China hopes for cooperation with the administration of US President-elect Donald Trump to further stabilize relations between the two countries, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United States Liu Pengyu said, commenting on the statement by the US incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz on Trump’s plans to increase weapons supplies to Taiwan.\n\n\"We hope that the new US government will make the right choice and work with China to maintain the hard-won stabilization momentum of China-US relations, lay a good foundation for the future development of China-US relations, and strive for stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations,\" he told TASS, adding that the Taiwan issue is a \"red line\" in relations between the two countries.\n\n\"Not crossing the line on the Taiwan issue is the most important guardrail and safety net for China and the US to properly handle differences and maintain the development of bilateral relations,\" he stressed.\n\nAccording to Liu Pengyu, the United States’ \"provision of military aid and arms sales to Taiwan seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, especially the August 17 [1982] Communique.\" In his words, military assistance to Taiwan \"seriously infringes on China's sovereignty and security interests, seriously violates the US leaders' commitment not to support \"Taiwan independence\", and sends a serious wrong signal to the \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces.\"\n\n\"China urges the United States to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop dangerous actions that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China will take all necessary measures to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,\" he emphasized.\n\nAppearing at the US Institute of Peace in Washington on Tuesday, Waltz said that Trump plans to increase the rate of US weapons deliveries to Taiwan \"as a deterrent measure.\"\n\nSimilar statements came from US incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said during his confirmation hearing in the Senate on Wednesday that such a strategy is called to increase China’s costs in case it opts for a force solution to the Taiwan issue.\n\nTaiwan has been governed by its local administration since 1949 when the Kuomintang’s remaining forces headed by Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) were defeated in the Chinese Civil War and took refuge on the island. Taiwan has preserved the flag and several other symbols of the Republic of China that had existed before the Communists took over the mainland. According to China’s official position, which is supported by most countries, including Russia, the Island of Taiwan is one of China’s provinces.\n\nThe United States severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established them with China. While recognizing the One China policy, Washington continues to maintain contacts with the island and supply it with weapons. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the total amount of US arms supplies to Taipei has surpassed $70 billion over recent years.","summary":"\"We hope that the new US government will make the right choice and work with China to maintain the hard-won stabilization momentum of China-US relations, lay a good foundation for the future development of China-US relations,\" spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United States Liu Pengyu said","url":"https://tass.com/world/1899887","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 01:04:22","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":0.078},{"id":280621802,"title":"Yellen says Trump's plan for new revenue agency won't save money for taxpayers","text":"Yellen says Trump's plan for new revenue agency won't save money for taxpayersU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to set up a new government agency to collect tariffs would duplicate an existing agency and was unlikely...","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/interest/CHINA-10Y-CASH-146043375/news/Yellen-says-Trump-s-plan-for-new-revenue-agency-won-t-save-money-for-taxpayers-48777806/","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2025-01/2025-01-16T005929Z_1_LYNXMPEL0F00X_RTROPTP_3_USA-TREASURY-YELLEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 01:02:53","author":"Andrea Shala","authors":["Andrea Shala"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.874},{"id":280622284,"title":"B.C. forests minister says Trump tariffs could be 'devastating' to sector","text":"U.S. softwood lumber duties and president-elect Donald Trump's threatened tariffs against Canadian exports could be \"devastating\" to the province's forestry sector, B.C.

Given his comments and past stances – and notably that of Marco Rubio, a Cuban American politician who is Trump’s pick for secretary of state and has a long-standing record of animosity toward the island’s Communist government – it could well be the case that the yo-yoing of U.S. policy on Cuba continues. \n\nBut not necessarily so: The incoming administration has other sanction options at its disposal that could serve to pressure Havana without isolating the nation from the international community.\n\nA matter of timing\n\nThe Biden administration’s move to delist Cuba should come as no surprise.\n\nThe terrorism designation change was presaged by the decision in early 2024 to remove Cuba from the “not fully cooperating” with anti-terrorism efforts list due to Havana’s counterterrorism efforts. \n\nThroughout the Biden administration, Cuba has worked with U.S. law enforcement – primarily through its engagement with the FBI as well as through the multilateral body Financial Action Task Force – to combat illicit financing, including the funding of terrorism.\n\nBut despite these efforts, it was always unlikely that the Biden administration would remove Cuba from the terrorism list before the presidential election in November 2024, especially given the Democrats’ need to look tough on security issues – a key issue in Trump’s campaign. \n\nThat, coupled with Florida’s politics – Cuban Americans are an important electoral force in the state and tend to strongly support Cuba’s inclusion on the terrorism list – made a change in the nation’s designation an electoral grenade.\n\nBiden’s move now is less challenging because the next major federal election is two years away, when the midterm House and Senate races could decide control of the legislative bodies where margins are currently slim. \n\nAs such, I believe that removing Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list is unlikely to hinder the campaigns of Democrats running in congressional races in late 2026.\n\nCubans for Biden campaign in Miramar, Fla., in 2020.\n\nAP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\n\nA legal basis for delisting\n\nBiden’s move is not only politically insulated, but it is arguably legally valid. Cuba meets the legal criteria to be delisted – just as it did when the Obama administration removed Cuba from the list in 2015. \n\nTo be eligible for delisting, the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, where I once worked and directed its terrorist designation efforts, would have to illustrate that Cuba has not engaged in providing support for acts of terrorism over the previous six months; and that the nation’s government has provided assurances that it will no longer engage in acts supporting terrorism.\n\nThe Biden administration has evidently made a decision, as Obama did previously, that Cuba is no longer supporting leftist communist groups that the U.S. has designated as terrorist. \n\nCuba has a checkered history of supporting such groups. It was put on the U.S. list in the early 1980s due to its actions supporting groups including Colombia’s FARC and ELN. While the latter is enmeshed in long-term, sometimes rocky peace talks with the Colombian government, the former has dissolved and was removed from the State Department’s Foreign Terrorist Organization list in 2021.\n\nI doubt that Cuba’s yo-yoing on and off the terrorist list is over.\n\nFor Trump to add Cuba back on, he will need Rubio’s State Department to prove that Cuba has “provided repeated support for acts of international terrorism.” \n\nConsidering that the same set of civil servants with legal expertise just determined that Cuba no longer warranted the listing, this will, at a minimum, require some creative legal interpretation by the lawyers at the State Department and White House.\n\nIt is, I believe, likely that political pressure will be applied on these lawyers to make a very different decision – one that will certainly be called into question for its legal validity.\n\nTrump could also threaten a new state sponsor of terrorism listing to gain concessions from Cuba on a broad range of unresolved bilateral issues between the United States and Cuba. For example, the case of Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur – a Black Liberation Army activist who killed a New Jersey state trooper and fled to Cuba in 1984 after escaping prison. Her case, given the efforts by the U.S. government to have Chesimard extradited to the U.S., has remained an area of contention between Cuba and the U.S.\n\nAnd while Chesimard’s case is not an example of Cuban-sponsored terrorism, State Department decisions on new listings and delistings have in the past been linked to nonterrorism issues. For instance, North Korea was removed by the George W. Bush administration because of Pyongyang’s promise to halt its nuclear program and allow inspectors access to its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.\n\nA more targeted approach?\n\nWhile the Biden administration’s delisting of Cuba may temporarily pivot U.S.-Cuba relations toward warmer ground, there are moves, including the possible relisting of Cuba, that Secretary of State-designate Rubio may be able to make that will reverse this trajectory.\n\nBut rather than a knee-jerk relisting of Cuba based on flimsy or nonexistent evidence of Cuba’s support of terrorism, the Trump administration may be wise to focus on the Cuban government’s actual weaknesses – an atrocious human rights record, corruption, kleptocracy and a failed communist ideology that has left the island impoverished.\n\nHere, there are a bevy of sanctioning tools unrelated to terrorism that the Trump administration can deploy and that can laser-focus on the Cuban politicians responsible for those policies, rather than the island’s people as a whole. \n\nSuch targeted measures would diminish the impact of U.S. sanctions on a Cuban population already suffering as a result of its government’s human rights and economic record.\n\nAs such, the Biden administration’s decision to remove Cuba from the terrorist list gives a glimmer of hope to Cubans who need support from the outside. For example, it makes it easier for U.S. banks to engage in a wider variety of transactions that put bread on the table of Cubans. It may also increase tourism-related travel to Cuba.\n\nUltimately, in my view, any attempt by Trump to reverse Biden’s decision is unlikely to create the regime change it wants. It will instead only prolong the suffering of Cubans as a whole.\n\nJason M.

Israel says final details are in flux","text":"DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Israel and Hamas have agreed to pause the devastating war in the Gaza Strip, mediators announced Wednesday, raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies.\n\nThe three-phase ceasefire deal promises the release of dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and it will allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It would also flood desperately needed humanitarian aid into the territory ravaged by 15 months of war, mediators say.\n\nThe prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said the ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday and that its success would depend on Israel and Hamas “acting in good faith in order to ensure that this agreement does not collapse.” He spoke in the Qatari capital of Doha, the site of weeks of painstaking negotiations.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden touted the deal from Washington, saying the ceasefire will stay in place as long as Israel and Hamas remain at the negotiating table over a long-term truce. Biden credited months of “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy” for landing the deal, noting that his administration and President-elect Donald Trump’s team had been “speaking as one” in the latest negotiations.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday that the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is still not complete and final details are being worked out.\n\nAn Israeli official familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said those details center on confirming the list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed. Any agreement must be approved by Netanyahu’s Cabinet.\n\nNetanyahu thanked Trump and Biden for “advancing” the ceasefire agreement, but did not explicitly say whether he has accepted it, saying he would issue a formal response only “after the final details of the agreement, which are currently being worked on, are completed.”\n\nHis measured reaction may reflect domestic politics. Netanyahu’s governing coalition depends on the support of two hard-line factions whose leaders have threatened to leave the government over the planned release of Palestinian prisoners. Although opposition leaders have vowed to support the ceasefire deal, the loss of his hard-line allies could lead to the collapse of the coalition and trigger early elections.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu’s government to approve the ceasefire in a nationally televised speech. Hamas said in a statement that the ceasefire was “the result of the legendary resilience of our great Palestinian people and our valiant resistance in the Gaza Strip.”\n\nMediators from Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. will meet in Cairo on Thursday for talks on implementing the deal, according to a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nOnce the first phase of the deal takes effect, it is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting along with the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether.\n\nOver those six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it’s unclear if all are alive.\n\nIt remained unclear exactly when and how many displaced Palestinians would be able to return to their homes, and whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza — key Hamas demands for releasing the remaining captives.\n\nMany longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction after a brutal conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.\n\nHamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 in Israel and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.\n\nMore than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza in a weeklong truce in November 2023.\n\nThe U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November, after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in Gaza.\n\nU.N. and international relief organizations estimate that some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. They say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. Experts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza.\n\nAbed Radwan, a Palestinian father of three, called the ceasefire deal “the best day in my life and the life of the Gaza people. … Thank God. Thank God.”\n\nRadwan, who has been displaced from the town of Beit Lahiya for over a year and shelters in Gaza City, said he hopes to return and to rebuild his home. As he spoke to AP by phone, his voice was overshadowed by the celebrations of fellow Gazans.\n\n“People are crying here. They don’t believe it’s true,” he said.\n\nIn Israel, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling for a deal to be completed. Many held posters of hostages held by Hamas, others hoisted candles in the air.\n\nAs the deal was announced, some people were unaware that it had gone through. Sharone Lifschitz, whose father Oded is being held in Gaza, told the AP by phone she was stunned and grateful but won’t believe it until she sees all the hostages come home.\n\n“I’m so desperate to see them, if by some miracle my father has survived,” she said.\n\nThe Hostage Families Forum, which has long pressed Israeli leaders to make a deal that would bring the captives home, said it welcomed Wednesday’s announcement with joy and relief.\n\n“After 460 days of our family members being held in Hamas tunnels, we are closer than ever to reuniting with our loved ones,” the group said in a statement.\n\nBiden, who has provided crucial military aid to Israel but expressed exasperation over civilian deaths in Gaza, announced the outline of the three-phase ceasefire agreement on May 31. The agreement eventually agreed to followed that framework.\n\nHe said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a “full and complete ceasefire,” a withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, older adults and wounded people, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian assistance would surge, with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza each day.\n\nThe second and most difficult phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. The third phase calls for the start of major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nHamas had been demanding assurances of a permanent end to the war and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel, meanwhile, has repeatedly said it would not halt the war until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities.\n\nWith Biden’s days in office numbered and Trump set to take over, both sides had been under heavy pressure to agree to a deal.\n\nTrump celebrated the agreement in a posting on his Truth Social social media platform: “WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!”\n\nJonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said Biden deserves praise for continuing to push the talks. But Trump’s threats to Hamas and his efforts to “cajole” Netanyahu deserve credit as well.\n\n“The ironic reality is that at a time of heightened partisanship even over foreign policy, the deal represents how much more powerful and influential U.S. foreign policy can be when it’s bipartisan,” Panikoff said.\n\nHezbollah’s acceptance of a ceasefire in Lebanon after it had suffered heavy blows, and the overthrow of President Bashar Assad in Syria, were both major setbacks for Iran and its allies across the region, including Hamas, which was left increasingly isolated.\n\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll in Gaza. Israel says it has killed around 17,000 militants — though it has not provided evidence to support the claim. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing the group of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes.\n\nThe International Court of Justice is investigating allegations brought by South Africa that Israel has committed genocide. The International Criminal Court, a separate body also based in The Hague, has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas commander for war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the war.\n\nIsrael and the United States have condemned the actions taken by both courts.\n\nNetanyahu also faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose plight has captured the nation’s attention. Their families have become a powerful lobbying group with wide public support backed by months of mass protests urging the government to reach a deal with Hamas.\n\nIsraeli authorities have already concluded that more than a third of the roughly 100 remaining people held captive are dead, and there are fears that others are no longer alive. A series of videos released by Hamas showing surviving hostages in distress, combined with news that a growing number of abducted Israelis have died, put added pressure on the Israeli leader.\n\nHamas, a militant group that does not accept Israel’s existence, has come under overwhelming pressure from Israeli military operations, including the invasion of Gaza’s largest cities and towns and the takeover of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, have been killed.\n\nBut its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas’ military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But it has never been clear what that would entail or if it’s even possible, given the group’s deep roots in Palestinian society, its presence in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, and its exiled leadership.\n\nBoth sides still face many difficult and unanswered questions.\n\nAs the war winds down, Netanyahu will face growing calls for postwar investigations that could find him at least partially responsible for the security failures of Oct. 7 — the worst in Israel’s history. His far-right governing partners, who opposed a ceasefire deal, could also bring down the coalition and push the country into early elections.\n\nThere is still no plan for who will govern Gaza after the war. Israel has said it will work with local Palestinians not affiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. But it is unclear if such partners exist, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israeli forces.\n\nThe United States has tried to advance sweeping postwar plans for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza with Arab and international assistance. As part of those plans, the U.S. hopes Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for U.S. security guarantees and aid in setting up a civilian nuclear program.\n\nBut those plans depend on credible progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state, something Netanyahu and much of Israel’s political class oppose. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war that the Palestinians want for their future state.\n\nIn the absence of a postwar arrangement with Palestinian support, Hamas is likely to remain a significant force in Gaza and could reconstitute its military capabilities if Israeli forces fully withdraw.","summary":"DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Israel and Hamas have agreed to pause the devastating war in the Gaza Strip, mediators announced Wednesday, raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies.

I'm a bit of an airhead so that came over as well.'\nMinah, 29, and Linda, 70, were the only two Traitors left in the competition after Armani was banished from the castle.\n\nLinda from The Traitors has been the stand-out star of the new series, thanks to her iconic one-liners and her Oscar-worthy acting skills\n\nDuring Wednesday's episode, viewers were 'gutted' as her time on the BBC show came to a dramatic end\nBut Linda received the most votes at the latest banishment, with the contestants going wild when she revealed herself as a Traitor.\nReacting to her exit, one devastated fan wrote on social media platform x: 'Nooo what will we do without Linda';\n'Mourning our queen Linda'; 'Gutted that Linda has gone'\nShe become a huge hit with viewers as she attempts to hoodwink the Faithfuls, but has slipped up one too many times.\nAfter host Claudia Winkleman secretly chose her first three Traitors, Linda visibly reacted to the presenter when she said the title out loud.\nIt was a move noticed by several Faithfuls, and was soon brought up at the round table, leading others to question her loyalties.\nAnd after spawning meme after meme with her scene-steals on the BBC show, Linda has now been awarded the ultimate honour.\nA post showing a huge billboard plastered above the Vue cinema in London's Leicester Square has gone viral.\n\nSpeaking after leaving the show, she explained: 'I didn't really have a strategy - I think it was just to not let people know I was a Traitor and I'm really proud I made it as far as I did'\n\nThe billboard above the venue where many a red carpet premiere has taken place, shows Linda earning the Golden Cloak Award for the 'performance of a lifetime award'.\nLinda has played up to the viral trend, making the trek from her Hertfordshire home over the weekend to post for a photo with the billboard.\n\n The Traitors star looks unrecognisable in unearthed theatre clip - but can you guess who it is? \n'OHHH MYYY GODDDD! I can’t ACTUALLY believe this is happening! How FUN! Just getting up to speed on instagram! Bear with me guys…. #oldlady' she captioned her snap.\nThe former opera singer was selected as one of three Traitors in the new series.\nHer theatre background is particularly remarkable given her acting displays in the hit BBC show, which have attracted the ire of some viewers and raised the suspicions of her fellow contestants.\nIn Friday's episode, Linda surprised everyone by bursting into tears at breakfast upon the news that fellow participant Livi had been murdered in an attempt to hide the fact that she was the one who had done it.\nIt didn't exactly fool her competitors, who once again dragged her name through the mud during the nightly Round Table discussion and almost voted her off the show, and she only narrowly received fewer votes than the unfortunate faithful Dan.\nFans of the BBC show still can't get enough of Linda's 'iconic' acting skills and rushed to X to comment on the hilarious moment.\n\nMinah, 29, and Linda, 70, were the only two Traitors left in the competition after Armani was banished from the castle\n\nIn Friday's episode, Linda surprised everyone by bursting into tears at breakfast upon the news that fellow participant Livi had been murdered \n\nThey wrote: 'If our Linda doesn’t win a BAFTA for best actress in a leading role there’ll be hell to pay #TheTraitors.'\nAnother said; 'LINDA STOPPPP #TheTraitors.'\nA third posted: 'Truly a BAFTA-winning performance from ar' Linda and the direct look into the camera too I just can’t #TheTraitors.'\nLater in the episode, Linda's 'cinematic' display came back to her haunt her and was brought up at the Round Table.\nSo far, the contestants have only managed to sniff out ONE of the Traitors - Armani, 28.\nThe likes of Dan, 33, Elen, 24, Kasim, 33, Nathan, 39, Tyler, 29, have been banished after their wrong guesses, and Keith, 65, Livi, 26, Maia, 25, and Yin, 34, have all been murdered.\nCatch up on the latest episodes of The Traitors on BBC iPlayer.\n\nMeet the cast of The Traitors 2025\n\nOccupation: Translator\nLocation: Cardiff \n\nOccupation: Anglican Priest\nLocation: Cornwall \n\nAge: 24 (at time of filming, 25 now)\nOccupation: Market trader and landscaper\nLocation: Yorkshire \n\nOccupation: Care Manager\nLocation: Whitby \n\nOccupation: Former British Diplomat\nLocation: London \n\nOccupation: Swimming Teacher\nLocation: County Wicklow, Ireland \n\nOccupation: Financial Investigator\nLocation: London \n\nAge: 32 (33 now)\nOccupation: Business Director\nLocation: London, recently moved to Hampshire\n\nOccupation: Bank Risk Manager\nLocation: Liverpool \n\nOccupation: Community Development Manager\nLocation: Birmingham \n\nOccupation: Interior Designer\nLocation: East Sussex \n\nOccupation: Politics Student\nLocation: Peterborough \n\nOccupation: Project manager\nLocation: Barrow-in-Furness \n\nOccupation: English Teacher\nLocation: Southampton (Originally Yorkshire) \n\nOccupation: Doctor\nLocation: Cambridge \n\nOccupation: Window cleaner\nLocation: Bournemouth\n\nOccupation: Veteran\nLocation: Holywell, North Wales \n\nOccupation: Retail store manager\nLocation: East Midlands \n\nOccupation: Retired opera singer\nLocation: Hertfordshire \nOlivia (Livi)\n\nOccupation: Beautician and Model\nLocation: Horsham\n\nOccupation: Full-time Mum \nLocation: Essex \n\nOccupation: Call Centre Manager\nLocation: Liverpool \n\nOccupation: Property Consultant\nLocation: London \n\nOccupation: Barber\nLocation: Leicester \n\nOccupation: Doctor of communication\nLocation: Berkshire\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Traitors' fan-favourite Linda breaks her silence on banishment - after posing with a viral London billboard paying tribute to her iconic performance on the BBC show\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLinda Nolan's heartbreaking final wish: Star was 'grateful' for spending Christmas with her beloved sisters before her death 65\n\nSir David Jason, 84, seen for the first time at Cirque du Soleil Corteo Premiere just hours after Only Fools And Horses co-star Diane Langton's death\n\nMolly-Mae Hague hits back at accusations her split from Tommy Fury was a 'publicity stunt' as he claims breakup was sparked by his alcohol demons\n\nEXCLUSIVE'I felt as though I didn't deserve to feel grief, I didn't deserve to feel sad.'

If they embrace my song as their song, it makes me proud.\"Why It MattersGreenwood's song \"God Bless the USA\" was originally released in 1984. It has since become a popular song, especially among the Republican Party. Former President Ronald Reagan was the first presidential nominee to use Greenwood's song when it appeared in a film that was shown at the 1984 Republican National Convention. Greenwood performed the song at the 1988 Republican National Convention and at rallies for George H W Bush. It was re-popularized after the September 11 attacks. Trump brought it back during his 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections.What To KnowGreenwood, who calls himself the \"perfect example of the American dream,\" chose the name \"God Bless the USA\" over the colloquial title \"Proud to be an American\" because of the \"inference that God is important to me.\"\"I'm proud that I wrote it in a time of peace and my intention was not to have what it is now,\" Greenwood said. \"It has evolved through the presidents using it. My intention was basically to write something as a love of country.\"Greenwood acknowledged that there has been backlash from a lot of musicians and bands when Trump uses their songs at rallies and on the campaign trail.\"I didn't think that was going to be something I had to worry about,\" Greenwood told Newsweek. \"A lot of people were condemning artists for working with them. I think America still was subject to false news but then this campaign proved that America said you know what we're not turning a blind eye this time.\"Greenwood joined Trump along his 2024 campaign trail multiple times, even performing at the Republican's return to Butler, Pennsylvania, as well as his last grand rally before Election Day at Madison Square Garden.Looking toward next week, Greenwood expects it to be a \"premier performance,\" with him and Carrie Underwood sandwiching performances around Trump taking his oath of office. He told Newsweek that Trump is a friend, and he has visited the president-elect in Mar-a-Lago for dinner.\"Donald Trump is very good about letting people talk and the times I've been in his presence he will say a few things and let you talk because he wants to get a feel from you about the American culture because he doesn't rub elbows with normal people,\" Greenwood said.Greenwood will also be a part of Trump's rally in DC on the eve of the Inauguration.\"There's like four other galas that I'll be performing at and attending. Two or three of them will be with the president in attendance,\" Greenwood said. \"I probably will sing at some of those I don't know which ones yet. That's up to the Trump team.\"Greenwood, however, said if the tables had turned at Vice President Kamala Harris won she would have had to ask him in person to perform at her Inauguration Day celebrations.\"I believe if I'm correct very few Democrats would ever ask to use the song,\" Greenwood said. \"If they use the song and it ignites their audience, that's fine with me. Don't ask me to come and sing live.\"What's NextGreenwood will perform on stage before Trump takes his oath on Monday, January 20.","summary":"Lee Greenwood will be performing before Carrie Underwood takes the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Inauguration on Monday","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/lee-greenwood-donald-trump-inauguration-god-bless-usa-2015745","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2565717/lee-greenwood.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:55:48","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.079},{"id":280621428,"title":"US Firms Concerned About Trump Tariff, Immigration Plans: Fed","text":"US businesses across the country are concerned about the economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to raise tariffs and sharply curtail immigration, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.\"More contacts were optimistic about the outlook for 2025 than were pessimistic about it,\" the US central bank said in its \"Beige Book\" survey of economic conditions.However, \"contacts in several Districts expressed concerns that changes in immigration and tariff policy could negatively affect the economy,\" it said.On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs of between 10 and 20 percent on all goods entering the United States, and to carry out mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants.Whether or not Trump follows through on his plans once he takes office as president on Monday remains to be seen.But manufacturers in a number of districts told the Fed they are already stockpiling inventories \"in anticipation of higher tariffs.\"In the Philadelphia district, inflation expectations rose on concerns about \"deficits, tariffs, and immigration,\" the Fed said.And in the Dallas district, contacts \"noted concern about disruption from potential retaliatory tariffs on agriculture exports,\" and raised concerns that they would have to pass on higher cost to consumers.Concerns in the Atlanta district meanwhile were broad-based, and included \"labor shortages, concerns over tariffs, and potential supply chain disruptions at east coast ports that would result from a labor strike,\" the Fed said.Despite the worries, businesses across the Fed's 12 districts reported an overall increase in economic activity in late November and December, the Fed said.Prices increased modestly overall, the Fed continued, adding that contacts had said they expected prices would \"continue to rise in 2025, with some noting the potential for higher tariffs to contribute to price increases.\"","summary":"US businesses across the country are concerned about the economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to raise tariffs and sharply curtail immigration, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-firms-concerned-about-trump-tariff-immigration-plans-fed-3759447","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4575660/manufacturers-have-been-stockpiling-inventory-anticipation-higher-tariffs-businesses-contacts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:55:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.374},{"id":280621514,"title":"Even Biden insiders admit it took Trump to close the cease-fire and Israel hostage deal","text":"Even Biden administration officials are admitting that it took President-elect Donald Trump wading into Israel-Hamas negotiations to close the deal and force a hostage release and cease-fire after 15 months of war.\n\nMultiple insiders and officials in both Israel and the US told The Post that it was Trump’s impending inauguration — combined with the efforts of his Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, that finally solved a problem that had proved intractable for President Biden and his team.\n\nA source with Trump’s transition team described the conversation last weekend between longtime Trump pal Witkoff and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “straightforward, no phony platitudes and very direct.”\n\nAnother official told Reuters: “Witkoff was able to pressure Netanyahu into accepting the deal and moving quickly. It’s that conversation that shifted everything into motion.”\n\nThe agreement ultimately signed Wednesday was very similar to the terms that the Biden administration had been trying to get through since last May.\n\nThe first stage is a 42-day cease-fire that begins Sunday, during which 33 Israeli hostages will be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut, it took Trump’s bully pulpit to force Jerusalem and the Palestinian terror organization to agree by putting pressure on both sides, officials said.\n\nA senior Biden administration official Wednesday praised Trump for setting a sell-by date for the hostage release, saying he forced negotiators’ hands on both sides.\n\n“In any negotiation, any breakthrough diplomacy, sometimes you need a deadline. Sometimes that’s an artificial deadline you try to create,” the official said.\n\n“In August, for example, we came together with a mediator proposal that we we worked hard at [with] three different countries putting it together and tried to set a deadline [to] get this done. And again, as I laid out, we did not succeed in that.”\n\n“The transition from one president to another was one [deadline,]” the official said.\n\nThe official also admitted Witkoff “played a very important role in full coordination with [US diplomat] Brett McGurk” in the arrangement — while also giving credit to the Biden administration saying they “worked as partners together, sometime splitting up the role.”\n\nWhile Biden himself refused to give Trump credit for the deal, Biden officials have publicly praised the cooperation between Witkoff and McGurk.\n\nThe official said Biden had “set the tone” for the talks in a meeting with Trump days before the breakthrough talks on Saturday.\n\nTrump has publicly threatened Hamas if hostages were not released by the time he took office.\n\nIncoming national security adviser Michael Waltz told Fox News Wednesday that Hamas agreed to the deal because “they believed President Trump when he said there would be all hell to pay, and any deal that was on the table would only get worse once he was in office.”\n\nThe Biden official added that the “catalyst for this intensive diplomacy was the defeat of Hezbollah, the ceasefire in Lebanon and the massive isolation of Hamas,” after Israel defeated Hezbollah.\n\n“That got them back to the table and for the first time to accept a hostage list … that led to this ultimate breakthrough,” the official said.\n\nThe second way Trump influenced the ceasefire is due to his significant “leverage” over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Witkoff convinced to accept the deal, American and Israeli officials familiar with the negotiations told The Post.\n\n“Just the other day, you know, Brett was leading these negotiations in Doha with [Qatar’s] Sheik Mohammed [bin Rashid Al Maktoum] and the team,” the senior Biden offiicial said. “We wanted to have an engagement with Prime Minister Netanyahu, which Steve went to Israel to do, and came back again.”\n\nHe added: “I thought that was quite effective, so, but that’s pretty much how it played out.”\n\nTrump’s leverage comes from his fervent support of the Jewish State, which worked wonders in building their relationship. During his first term in office, Trump took the unprecedented actions of recognizing the Golan Heights region as Israeli territory, moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokering the Abraham Accords, said Alex Mintz, a senior professor at Israel’s Reichman University.\n\n“Hamas has not changed much of its position and demands,” he said. “Trump was able to push Netanyahu to accept a deal that Bibi refused to accept for many months.”\n\n“The concessions that Israel has made are very, very substantial.”","summary":"Multiple insiders and officials in both Israel and the US told The Post that it was Trump's impending inauguration that finally solved a problem that had proved intractable for President Biden and his team.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/us-news/even-biden-insiders-admit-it-took-trump-to-close-the-cease-fire-and-israel-hostage-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/COMP-423602231_863060792236540_6945125742917670127_n.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/887q7xOR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:52:59","author":"Caitlin Doornbos,Diana Glebova","authors":["Caitlin Doornbos","Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":280622286,"title":"B.C. real estate braces for year of uncertainty","text":"As the new year gets underway, market observers and participants are looking ahead at how B.C.’s real estate sector might fare in 2025. \n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider, including political and fiscal uncertainty at the federal level; the continued implementation and enforcement of provincial housing policies; interest rate decisions by the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve; the threat of U.S. tariffs; a lower loonie; and tighter immigration—not to mention challenges faced by countries such as India and China, and local market trends, including weak presales, stabilizing rents and tapering construction.\n\n“It’s a lot of factors that can play into each other. They can multiply each other, or they can cancel each other out, which is why I am so good at predicting the past,” said Andy Yan, director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University.\n\nReal estate markets in B.C. continue to evolve, with changes occurring on the three fronts of supply, demand and finance. On the supply side, provincial policy is aimed at accelerating transit-oriented density. On the demand side, punitive taxes related to “speculation” and “flipping” continue to be implemented and enforced. And the finance side depends on credit markets both domestic and global.\n\nAll of this makes prognostication a difficult task when looking forward to the year ahead.\n\n“I think it’s one of those strap-in-and-watch kinds of situations,” said Yan.\n\nBC NDP expected to continue affordability efforts\n\nThe province is expected to continue its efforts to boost housing supply and tackle unaffordability.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Eby proposed an initiative to fund 40 per cent of select first-time home purchases. He also indicated doubling the speculation and vacancy tax. \n\nOne new measure that came into effect Jan. 1 is a provincial “home-flipping” tax, by which anyone who sells a home within a year after purchasing it pays a 20-per-cent tax on their profit, with the rate falling to 10 per cent after 18 months and zero after two years.\n\nA recent Statistics Canada study found that 2.8 per cent of the province’s residential properties sold in the years spanning 2019-2021 (the most recent data available) had been owned by their sellers for less than a year. \n\nBy comparison, it was more common for residential properties to be re-sold in the second year of ownership. For instance, 5.3 per cent of properties sold in 2021 and 6.2 per cent of those sold in 2019 had been held by their seller for one to less than two years.\n\nOn the supply side, the new BC NDP term could see the province continue its focus on missing-middle homes and transit-oriented density, as well as on ensuring municipalities proceed with densification.\n\nChanges abound at federal and international levels\n\nFederally, polls widely predict the governing Liberal party could be replaced by the Conservatives in the 2025 election, which could affect federal housing policy and funding. \n\nIt would also affect relations with and policy regarding the U.S.\n\nIncoming U.S. president Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on all goods entering the U.S. from Canada.\n\nYan said the diversity of the B.C. economy means tariffs would affect regional real estate markets differently. He said the U.S. has its own housing challenges, as well as a reliance on Canadian lumber exports for home construction and other uses.\n\nA leadership change could also bring different immigration policies. Already, the Liberal government has temporarily banned foreign property buyers and curbed immigration by international students and others, curtailing real estate demand. A Conservative government could go even further in reducing immigration levels.\n\nMonetary policy and forex will play significant roles\n\nWhether interest rates continue their downward trajectory will also affect B.C.’s housing markets. Royal Bank of Canada, for example, forecasts a two-per-cent policy rate by mid-2025. The key rate currently sits at 3.25 per cent.\n\nLower interest rates make mortgage financing cheaper and therefore support real estate activity, although they can also lead to inflation and price appreciation, worsening affordability.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian dollar is depreciating vis-a-vis the greenback.\n\n“One reason the [Canadian] dollar is weakening, but not the only reason, is the threat of tariffs, which would be devastating,” said Thomas Davidoff, professor of real estate finance with University of British Columbia.\n\n“This would certainly make housing cheaper, but it would make housing cheaper because we’d be in a heinous recession.”\n\nDavidoff said the exchange rate is something to watch. The U.S. Fed and the Bank of Canada are diverging in their respective pace of interest rate reductions, with the former concerned about lingering inflation. A weaker loonie boosts the visitor economy and strengthens exports, but those same exports may get battered by Trump tariffs.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a challenging year for the Canadian economy,” Davidoff said.\n\nWithin that context, local trends continue.\n\nDavidoff noted that there is significant weakness in the presale market, and that more rental housing and condo development will hinge on further interest rate reductions. \n\nStill, rental prices have in many cases declined from their peaks, and affordability could improve if household incomes grow and immigration moderates. \n\n“My best guess is that affordability will improve, certainly on the rental side with the pause in the rate of immigration,” he said. \n\nDavidoff said the key metric is the ratio of homes and people, and that it may gradually balance in B.C. as more supply comes online in 2025 and beyond.\n\n“A lot of rental supply is coming on the market in the next couple of years, so that should augment the effect we’ve already had of an increasing ratio of units to people, as opposed to a decreasing ratio that we had for so long,” he said.\n\n[email protected]","summary":"Provincial economy and massive housing sector likely in for a dynamic and turbulent year.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/real-estate/bc-real-estate-braces-for-year-of-uncertainty-10080867","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/250107-oarkridge-38.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:45:00","author":"Jami Makan","authors":["Jami Makan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.324},{"id":280621664,"title":"Trump mulls executive order to ‘save TikTok’ – media","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is considering issuing an executive order to delay the enforcement of a US law that mandates the sale or shutdown of TikTok, potentially granting the popular social media platform a temporary reprieve, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe current legislation, which was passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, requires ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to divest from its US operations by January 19, 2025. Failure to comply would result in TikTok being removed from US app stores and losing access to essential infrastructure, effectively ceasing its operations in the country.\n\nTrump has reportedly been “mulling ways to save the day,” including potentially issuing an executive order that would extend the compliance deadline by 60 to 90 days, allowing for further negotiations, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.\n\nTikTok has already devised a plan to “go dark” for 170 million US users on Sunday. According to anonymous insiders cited by Reuters, the app would greet American users with a pop-up message explaining the ban and providing an option to download their data. This move would exceed the law’s requirements, which permit existing users to continue using the app without new downloads.\n\nThe Supreme Court has yet to issue a ruling on TikTok’s appeal against the law. During recent oral arguments, the justices appeared to prioritize national security concerns over potential free speech implications.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump attempted to ban TikTok, citing national security risks due to its Chinese ownership. However, during the recent campaign, he changed his mind, stating: “For all of those who want to save TikTok in America, vote for Trump. The other side is closing it up, but I’m now a big star on TikTok.”\n\nIn December, Trump reportedly met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, further signaling a shift in his stance toward the platform. Trump’s legal team has also requested the Supreme Court to halt the ban’s implementation, seeking additional time to pursue a political solution.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is considering issuing an executive order to delay the sale or shutdown of TikTok, according to WaPo \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/610972-trump-tiktok-executive-order/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/6788536185f540364b534f0a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:40:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":280620928,"title":"Man who accidentally binned £600m worth of Bitcoin makes two-word admission","text":"Ever stuffed a tenner into your pocket only to find hours later its gone AWOL? Well, times that feeling by a factor of 60 million and you'd probably arrive close to the mood of arguably Britain's unluckiest man. Thats because James Howells, who accidentally tossed a digital hard-drive containing £100 millions of Bitcoin into the rubbish, has had his case to retrieve it thrown out by a judge, causing the unlucky crypto enthusiast to admit it's \"game over\" James, 39, says he’s “gutted” after Cardiff High Court threw out his bid to dig through a landfill site to find a hard drive holding the key to a £635M crypto jackpot. The IT worker had been battling Newport City Council for years, hoping to recover the treasure trove of 8,000 Bitcoins . Back in 2013, James’s ex accidentally chucked out the hard drive, not realising it contained the digital key to his riches . Ever since, it’s been buried deep in a Newport tip, with James launching a full-blown campaign to retrieve it. But last week, his dreams were dashed when Judge Keyser KC struck down his case, saying it had “no realistic prospect” of succeeding. Now, James says he’s been left stuck with the knowledge of what he could have had \"for life”. “The council’s decision feels like a kick in the teeth,” he said. “It’s gut-wrenching, to be honest. I always thought I’d at least get a proper trial, but instead, it was dismissed at the first hurdle. I didn’t even get to speak.” James had promised to cover all costs of the dig and even pledged 10% of the proceeds – a whopping £63M – to the local community. But the council argued the excavation would have a huge environmental impact and accused him of trying to “bribe” them. “I understand the environmental concerns,” James admitted, “but they could be managed professionally. This isn’t just about money; it’s about doing something incredible for the area. Newport could have been the Dubai or Las Vegas of the UK.” Now, the tech enthusiast is facing an uncertain future. “I’ll never stop thinking about it,” he said. “Bitcoin’s only going up, and when it hits £500K a coin, those 8,000 Bitcoins will be worth billions. Maybe then, someone will let me dig it up.” Newport City Council has repeatedly refused to budge, insisting excavation isn’t possible due to environmental regulations. But James isn’t giving up entirely. Half-joking, he even appealed to Donald Trump to step in, saying, “I’d cut him in on the deal if he made it happen.” For now, though, the dream remains buried, and James says he’ll spend the rest of his life wondering what might have been.","summary":"James Howells, 39, even appealed to Donald Trump to lend a hand in the search, although it seems his attempts to recover the fortune has reached its conclusion","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/man-who-accidentally-binned-600m-34490416","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article34490134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_bitcoin3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:40:20","author":"Edward Easton","authors":["Edward Easton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.758},{"id":280620146,"title":"Miley Cyrus Fans React to Billy Ray Cyrus' Controversial Trump Celebration Decision","text":"Billy Ray Cyrus was recently confirmed to be one of the many musical acts who will perform at President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural celebrations.The 63-year-old country singer is set to join the likes of Carrie Underwood, The Village People, and Kid Rock at the Make America Great Again Victory Rally on Sunday, January 19.

The drop in yields occurred as traders resumed betting on another Fed rate cut by July.\n\nTraders ignored the strong December employment data released Friday, which sparked a surge toward the highest levels in months as it sowed doubts that policymakers would cut rates at all this year. The 10-year peaked Tuesday at nearly 4.81%, more than a full percentage point higher than when the Fed began easing in September.\n\n“The report gives support to those in the market and at the Fed that the next move by the Fed is still to ease rates,” said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “Given that inflation is the critical variable, it probably means 10s can start to consolidate between 4.50% and 4.80% for a while.”\n\nThe December Consumer Price Index report showed that the rate of increase for core prices slowed for the first time in five months. Along with resilient US economic data, its re-acceleration had suggested that the Fed — which cut rates three times last year by a combined 100 basis points to arrest an increase in unemployment — may have acted prematurely.\n\nCore prices rose 0.2% in December and 3.2% from a year earlier, down from 3.3% in November. The broader consumer price index matched expectations as rose 2.9% in December from a year earlier.\n\nSpeaking after the release, New York Fed President John Williams said “the process of disinflation remains in train,” but that the central bank’s 2% price stability goal needs more time. The Fed targets a different inflation gauge that rose 2.4% year-on-year in November. Later Wednesday, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said it remained possible to tame inflation without causing a recession.\n\nAt their last meeting in December, Fed policymakers released forecasts showing they anticipated cutting rates by 50 basis points in 2025. Their previous quarterly forecast was for an additional 50 basis points of easing.\n\nInterest-rate strategists at Morgan Stanley recommended that investors position for a cut as soon as March. Yet bond traders in recent weeks also cited the prospect of inflationary trade policies under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next week, as a reason to be bearish.\n\n“I don’t know how much more we can push Trump policy shocks before we get eyeballs on some details,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, a rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.","summary":"Benign price data revived the case for additional Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/01/15/bonds-have-banner-day-as-inflation-report-revives-fed-cut-bets/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fredgraph-36.png?w=1024&h=576","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:38:22","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":280620176,"title":"Joe Biden to give farewell speech just five days before White House exit with his approval rating at its lowest ever","text":"PRESIDENT Joe Biden is giving his farewell address to the nation five days before passing the torch to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's final speech is expected to highlight the president's achievements while in office, despite leaving the White House with his lowest-ever approval rating.\n\nAmericans generally view Biden's time in the Oval Office as more of a failure than a success, according to a new CNN poll.\n\nThe research revealed just 36% of US adults approve of how Biden handled his presidency, which matches the lowest approval mark during his term.\n\nIn a farewell letter released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Biden wrote it was \"the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.\"\n\n\"I have given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said.\n\nBiden is set to speak at 8 pm ET from behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.\n\nThe last time Biden spoke behind the Resolute desk, he explained his decision not to run for reelection against Trump.\n\nHOSTAGE DEAL\n\nBiden's fifth and final speech from the Oval Office comes just hours after Trump revealed Israel and Hamas have finally reached a ceasefire deal to release the hostages trapped in Gaza.\n\nThe president-elect confirmed the hostage deal and called the agreement \"epic\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

And therefore, they made their own assessment, and they are inclined to do the deal, thinking that they'll maximize what they can get now and not wait to see what 'hell' means,\" Avivi stated. On Wednesday, President Biden's White House National Security communications adviser John Kirby recognized President-elect Donald Trump's incoming Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff as a key figure in brokering the deal. President-elect Donald Trump warned Hamas on Jan. 7 that \"all hell will break out\" if hostages are not returned by his inauguration.

Given his comments and past stances – and notably that of Marco Rubio, a Cuban American politician who is Trump’s pick for secretary of state and has a long-standing record of animosity toward the island’s Communist government – it could well be the case that the yo-yoing of U.S. policy on Cuba continues. \n\nBut not necessarily so: The incoming administration has other sanction options at its disposal that could serve to pressure Havana without isolating the nation from the international community.\n\nA matter of timing\n\nThe Biden administration’s move to delist Cuba should come as no surprise.\n\nThe terrorism designation change was presaged by the decision in early 2024 to remove Cuba from the “not fully cooperating” with anti-terrorism efforts list due to Havana’s counterterrorism efforts. \n\nThroughout the Biden administration, Cuba has worked with U.S. law enforcement – primarily through its engagement with the FBI as well as through the multilateral body Financial Action Task Force – to combat illicit financing, including the funding of terrorism.\n\nBut despite these efforts, it was always unlikely that the Biden administration would remove Cuba from the terrorism list before the presidential election in November 2024, especially given the Democrats’ need to look tough on security issues – a key issue in Trump’s campaign. \n\nThat, coupled with Florida’s politics – Cuban Americans are an important electoral force in the state and tend to strongly support Cuba’s inclusion on the terrorism list – made a change in the nation’s designation an electoral grenade.\n\nBiden’s move now is less challenging because the next major federal election is two years away, when the midterm House and Senate races could decide control of the legislative bodies where margins are currently slim. \n\nAs such, I believe that removing Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list is unlikely to hinder the campaigns of Democrats running in congressional races in late 2026.\n\nA legal basis for delisting\n\nBiden’s move is not only politically insulated, but it is arguably legally valid. Cuba meets the legal criteria to be delisted – just as it did when the Obama administration removed Cuba from the list in 2015. \n\nTo be eligible for delisting, the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, where I once worked and directed its terrorist designation efforts, would have to illustrate that Cuba has not engaged in providing support for acts of terrorism over the previous six months; and that the nation’s government has provided assurances that it will no longer engage in acts supporting terrorism.\n\nThe Biden administration has evidently made a decision, as Obama did previously, that Cuba is no longer supporting leftist communist groups that the U.S. has designated as terrorist. \n\nCuba has a checkered history of supporting such groups. It was put on the U.S. list in the early 1980s due to its actions supporting groups including Colombia’s FARC and ELN. While the latter is enmeshed in long-term, sometimes rocky peace talks with the Colombian government, the former has dissolved and was removed from the State Department’s Foreign Terrorist Organization list in 2021.\n\nI doubt that Cuba’s yo-yoing on and off the terrorist list is over.\n\nFor Trump to add Cuba back on, he will need Rubio’s State Department to prove that Cuba has “provided repeated support for acts of international terrorism.” \n\nConsidering that the same set of civil servants with legal expertise just determined that Cuba no longer warranted the listing, this will, at a minimum, require some creative legal interpretation by the lawyers at the State Department and White House.\n\nIt is, I believe, likely that political pressure will be applied on these lawyers to make a very different decision – one that will certainly be called into question for its legal validity.\n\nTrump could also threaten a new state sponsor of terrorism listing to gain concessions from Cuba on a broad range of unresolved bilateral issues between the United States and Cuba. For example, the case of Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur – a Black Liberation Army activist who killed a New Jersey state trooper and fled to Cuba in 1984 after escaping prison. Her case, given the efforts by the U.S. government to have Chesimard extradited to the U.S., has remained an area of contention between Cuba and the U.S.\n\nAnd while Chesimard’s case is not an example of Cuban-sponsored terrorism, State Department decisions on new listings and delistings have in the past been linked to nonterrorism issues. For instance, North Korea was removed by the George W. Bush administration because of Pyongyang’s promise to halt its nuclear program and allow inspectors access to its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.\n\nA more targeted approach?\n\nWhile the Biden administration’s delisting of Cuba may temporarily pivot U.S.-Cuba relations toward warmer ground, there are moves, including the possible relisting of Cuba, that Secretary of State-designate Rubio may be able to make that will reverse this trajectory.\n\nBut rather than a knee-jerk relisting of Cuba based on flimsy or nonexistent evidence of Cuba’s support of terrorism, the Trump administration may be wise to focus on the Cuban government’s actual weaknesses – an atrocious human rights record, corruption, kleptocracy and a failed communist ideology that has left the island impoverished.\n\nHere, there are a bevy of sanctioning tools unrelated to terrorism that the Trump administration can deploy and that can laser-focus on the Cuban politicians responsible for those policies, rather than the island’s people as a whole. \n\nSuch targeted measures would diminish the impact of U.S. sanctions on a Cuban population already suffering as a result of its government’s human rights and economic record.\n\nAs such, the Biden administration’s decision to remove Cuba from the terrorist list gives a glimmer of hope to Cubans who need support from the outside. For example, it makes it easier for U.S. banks to engage in a wider variety of transactions that put bread on the table of Cubans. It may also increase tourism-related travel to Cuba.\n\nUltimately, in my view, any attempt by Trump to reverse Biden’s decision is unlikely to create the regime change it wants. It will instead only prolong the suffering of Cubans as a whole.","summary":"Incoming Trump administration is set to adopt a more hawkish stance on Cuba-US relations – but a more targeted sanctions approach may pressure Havana without hurting the island’s impoverished people.","url":"https://theconversation.com/bidens-move-to-remove-cuba-from-terror-list-continues-yo-yo-policy-likely-to-be-reversed-by-trump-247440","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/642681/original/file-20250115-17-hb908.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C30%2C1022%2C510&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:31:52","author":"and Counterterrorism,Extremism,Jason M.

Paxton, a case challenging a spate of red-state laws that block internet users from pornographic websites without first verifying their age. Seeking to get a grasp on the overall content of some of the websites that were pushing back against the laws, Alito asked if anyone looked at websites like Pornhub for the articles.\n\nFree Speech Coalition attorney Derek Shaffer noted that several of the websites feature non-pornographic content in their blogs and podcasts, leading Alito to ask if any public intellectuals are well-known for their work on the adult tube site.\n\n\"Is it like the old Playboy magazine, you have essays there by the modern-day equivalent of Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr.?\" Alito asked.\n\nShaffer didn't want to stretch the truth, balking at both Alito's repeated guesses as to what percentage of Pornhub was pornographic and his hypothetical haven of internet-age literati among the smut.\n\n\"Not in that sense, but in the sense you have wellness posts about women recovering from hysterectomies and how they can enjoy sex,\" Shaffer offered.\n\nPornography has a history at the Supreme Court, frequently prodding and testing the edges of free speech laws. A good chunk of the middle of the last century was spent getting a handle on the famously hard-to-define idea of obscenity. Justice Potter Stewart muddied the waters significantly in 1964 when he defended the right of theater manager Nico Jacobellis to show the Louis Malle film \"The Lovers.\" Writing a concurrence with the majority opinion that found screening the film was protected by the Constitution, Stewart said of obscenity, \"I know it when I see it.\" A stricter test was devised in 1973's Miller v.

The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so.\n\nThe law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site.\n\nUsers who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars U.S. companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a \"political resolution\" of the issue.\n\n\"TikTok itself is a fantastic platform,\" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. \"We're going to find a way to preserve it but protect people's data.\"\n\nA White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok.\n\nU.S. Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal.\n\nIf it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public.\n\n\"We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week.\n\nThe company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision.\n\nShutting down TikTok in the U.S. could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the U.S. help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday.\n\nTikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to \"avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States.\"\n\nTikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that \"data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store\" TikTok code, content, or data.\n\nThe sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban.\n\nShutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for U.S. users in a relatively short time, sources said.\n\nTikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nU.S. tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday.\n\nPrivately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.\n\nPresident Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech.\n\nTikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-considers-suspending-tiktok-ban-enforcement-for-60-to-90-days-report-291897.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/40prgtbs_tiktok_625x300_16_January_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:30:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":280620154,"title":"Bessent, Burgum, Zeldin, Turner to Face Confirmation Hearings: Here’s What to Know","text":"The U.S. Senate will continue its slate of high-stakes hearings to consider President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominations days before his inauguration.\n\nBillionaire financier Scott Bessent, whom Trump tapped to head the Treasury, will headline the Jan. 16 schedule and appear before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nFormer North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, whose confirmation hearing for secretary of the Department of Interior was delayed over paperwork issues, will sit in front of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\nLee Zeldin, who has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nBessent has expressed support for the president-elect’s trade pursuits. In a Fox News op-ed shortly after the November election, Bessent endorsed the tactic as a negotiating tool, revenue generator, and shield for U.S. industries.\n\nThe hedge fund manager signaled over the last few months that Trump’s tariff policies could be watered down.\n\nIn a Nov. 6 interview with CNBC, Bessent stated that tariffs should be “layered in gradually” to ensure that higher prices appear over time and are then offset by the incoming administration’s disinflationary efforts, such as cutting red tape.\n\nIn October 2024, he also told the Financial Times that Trump’s universal tariffs were “maximalist” stances that could be chipped away.\n\n“My general view is that at the end of the day, he’s a free trader,” Bessent said. “It’s escalate to de-escalate.”\n\nTrump has proposed across-the-board 10 to 20 percent levies on all imports and 60 to 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods arriving in the United States. He also threatened 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nMedia reports, including one from The Washington Post, suggested that Trump could scale back his tariffs. The president-elect recently denied these reports on Truth Social.\n\nLast summer, speaking at a Manhattan Institute event, Bessent recommended three different economic strategies the Trump administration could use to stimulate the national economy and improve the federal government’s finances.\n\nThis would involve aiming for 3 percent real economic growth, boosting domestic crude oil production by 3 million more barrels per day, and reducing the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP by the end of Trump’s second term.\n\n“How do you get that?” Bessent asked during the conference. “Through deregulation, more U.S. energy production, slaying inflation and forward guidance on competence for people to make investments so that the private sector can take over from this bloated government spending.”\n\nWhen examining Bessent’s 3-3-3 proposal, Warren asked why the first Trump administration’s tax cuts and deregulatory efforts failed to spur 3 percent growth.\n\n“There is no comprehensive record of your positions relating to various Treasury-related duties and key policy areas within the Secretary’s orbit,” Warren wrote.\n\nIn October 2024, Bessent recommended that Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell’s successor be chosen before his second term ends in 2026.\n\n“You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair,” Bessent told Barron’s. “And based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Powell has to say anymore.”\n\n“As the president said on Sunday, and I’m in complete agreement with him, that Jay Powell will serve out his term,” Bessent told CNBC.\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that Powell can serve the remainder of his term. The central bank chief has also confirmed that he would not step down if asked to, and his termination would “not be permitted under the law.”\n\nLawmakers will likely try to garner more significant insights into Burgum’s new role and the council’s agenda.\n\nBurgum, who will also have a seat on the National Security Council, will spearhead a whole-of-government panel expected to partner with all agencies and departments that work with regulations, permits, oil and gas production, and transportation.\n\nThe former North Dakota governor stated that the White House council would foster coordination within the federal government to advance domestic energy and assert U.S. energy dominance.\n\nThe president-elect and his team have signaled that the incoming administration will take an all-of-the-above approach to energy, from fossil fuels to renewables.\n\nThe Department of the Interior could play a substantial role in realizing Trump’s energy plans as it oversees energy development and other activities on about 500 million acres of public land.\n\nTrump wants to embark upon a deregulatory crusade, and permits will be one area to transform.\n\nAs Interior secretary and energy czar, Burgum could lead an accelerated permitting and regulatory process that would help expand oil and gas drilling and production.\n\nOn the 2024 campaign trail and since his electoral victory, Trump has repeatedly promised to embrace the “frack, frack, frack” and “drill, baby, drill” mantras for his second term’s energy policy.\n\nThe potential blueprint will ignite probing by Democrat lawmakers in the upper chamber. Officials could concentrate on energy development in environmentally sensitive regions such as Alaska’s wildlife refuge or areas bordering the Grand Canyon.\n\nConcerning emissions and threatening the country’s climate commitments, Burgum has a record of endorsing the concept of carbon capture, which he called a “game-changer” for the world.

This has included a controversial proposal to repurchase or even take the canal by force, a move he claims would bolster US economic and military security.\nHouse Republicans recently introduced a bill that would allow Trump to buy the waterway, citing Chinese investments in Panamanian infrastructure as a growing threat.\nChina’s involvement in the Panama Canal dates back to 2016, when a Chinese vessel owned by COSCO first crossed the expanded waterway. Landbridge Group acquired control of Margarita Island, Panama’s largest port on the Atlantic side, that same year in a deal estimated at around US$900 million.\nChinese interests expanded further in 2018 through a consortium led by the China Harbour Engineering Company and the China Communications Construction Company to construct the canal’s fourth bridge.\nWith an estimated $1.4 billion contract at the time, the transaction was deemed “the fifth most important project in the history of the country” by then-president Juan Carlos Varela.\nIn addition, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings manages two ports located on the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal, respectively.\n\n“China’s interest in and presence around the canal is a cause for concern. America must project strength abroad – owning and operating the Panama Canal might be an important step towards a stronger America and a more secure globe,” Representative Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican and one of the co-authors of the purchase authorisation bill said in a statement last week.\nRubio tied the issue to what he described as “the defining challenge of the 21st century” – countering China’s growing influence globally.\nHe also condemned Beijing’s “violation” of Hong Kong’s autonomy, which he said had transformed the financial hub into a “tool for advancing China’s interests.”\nThe Florida Republican accused China of breaking promises made under the 1997 handover agreement with the United Kingdom, adding that Hong Kong’s sweeping national security law has rendered it an inhospitable environment for international business.\n“I think we have to call it for what it is: the notion that Hong Kong is now a semi-autonomous entity that operates within China’s system,” Rubio noted. “Its independence for the decisions they make, is a complete work of fiction.”\nHe also called for reducing America’s dependence on China for raw materials and medicine, and emphasised the need to counter Beijing’s more aggressive naval activities in the South China Sea, saying that while the One China policy has been respected across several administrations, but also stressed the importance of “national defence” in the Taiwan Relations Act.\n“We’re not going to pressure Taiwan in any arrangement … We make no commitment to not helping them in their national defence … And frankly, we are going to do everything [to] reject any effort to coerce, intimidate and/or forcibly drive Taiwan to do whatever China wants them to do,” Rubio promised.\nLike most other Western countries, the US does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country, though Washington is committed by the law to support the self-governing island’s defence capability.\nThe senator said he does not intend to change Taiwan’s status, but will advocate for Taiwanese participation in international organisations. He also warned Beijing about recent military escalation in the region.\n“If [the Chinese] want to stabilise the relationship [with the US], they need to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines,” Rubio said.\nThe testimony highlighted his well-established reputation as a China hawk. As a senator since 2011 and a member of both the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, the 53-year-old Floridian has consistently opposed Beijing’s policies.\nThroughout his Senate career, Rubio has been a staunch critic of China’s human rights record. He co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which sanctioned officials responsible for undermining the city’s autonomy, and the Uygur Forced Labour Prevention Act in 2021, targeting imports tied to forced labour in Xinjiang.\nFollowing Beijing’s passage of the Hong Kong national security law in 2020, Rubio also championed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. The legislation sanctioned officials from mainland China and Hong Kong over their alleged roles in undermining the city’s autonomy under the Basic Law.\nRubio’s work on these issues earned him a spot on Beijing’s sanctions list in 2020, one of 11 US citizens targeted, including lawmakers Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, both Republicans. At the time, China’s Foreign Ministry accused the group of “egregious behaviour” concerning Hong Kong.\nDespite being sanctioned – a move that prevents him from travelling to Beijing – Rubio said in a December interview with Voice of America that he is confident in his ability to “find some solution” for engaging with the Chinese if confirmed by the Senate.\nHis confirmation hearing was one of six held on Wednesday for president-elect Trump’s nominees. Among the other contenders were former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi for US attorney general, fracking executive Chris Wright for energy secretary, and John Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, for CIA director.","summary":"In nomination hearing, Rubio also slams Beijing’s ‘violation’ of Hong Kong’s autonomy and asserts ‘national defence’ component of Taiwan Relations Act.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3294940/marco-rubio-us-secretary-state-nominee-echoes-trumps-panama-canal-china-concern","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/16/9de77469-29a0-40df-b206-1301b40d3ebc_31034415.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:23:37","author":"Igor Patrick","authors":["Igor Patrick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":280618966,"title":"The Traitors fans are left baffled by Minah's choice of new recruit and warn she'll be 'stabbed in the back' - after fan-favourite Linda was banished","text":"Black Friday\n\nThe Traitors\n\nThe Masked Singer\n\nLove Island All Stars\n\nDancing On Ice\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Traitors fans are left baffled by Minah's choice of new recruit and warn she'll be 'stabbed in the back' - after fan-favourite Linda was banished\n\nHave YOU got a story?

They will be released shortly. Thank you!’ he wrote.\n\nIt comes after President Joe Biden – in the final days of his presidency – said a deal was ‘on the brink’.\n\nImplementation of the agreement will be agreed by Qatar, Egypt and the US.\n\nBut the sister of two British citizens murdered in the Israel-Hamas conflict has said ‘there will never be any closure’ until all Israeli hostages are returned, following reports of a ceasefire.\n\nAyelet Svatitzky, 47, said the reports emerging on Wednesday were a ‘relief’ after her brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell both died and her mother Channah Peri was previously taken as a hostage.\n\nSpeaking from Israel, she told the PA news agency: ‘We’ve been praying for a deal to be signed, and every hostage [being] released is a relief for them, for the families and for us.\n\n‘Of course, it’s too late for my brother, we will never be able to save them. We were able to bring him for burial, and so we know how crucial it is for for a deal to be complete and for all hostages to be brought back, for the live hostages to be released to their families and to start the healing and rehabilitating.’\n\nAsked if the reported ceasefire would bring her family closure, Ms Svatitzky said: ‘There will never be any closure for us until all the hostages are back.\n\n‘We’ll be worried and we’re not able to move on until the last hostage is home.’\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ‘The announcement of a ceasefire is, at last, a moment of hope after many months of darkness and despair for the region.\n\n‘As this ceasefire comes into effect, Palestinians will hope that the killing will now stop. Israeli hostages will finally be returned their loved ones again after being held in captivity for 15 months.\n\n‘The work of flooding Gaza with the aid which it has desperately needed for months must begin in earnest.’\n\nSir Ed Davey continued: ‘Now, it is incumbent on the UK and the entire international community to do all it can to ensure that this ceasefire does not turn out to be temporary truce.\n\n‘Otherwise we will not be able to get the remaining hostages home and finally alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\n‘We must look back on this moment as the first step on the road to a lasting peace. \n\n‘That two-state solution, with a recognised Palestinian state based in 1967 borders, is the only way to deliver the dignity and security which Israelis and Palestinians deserve.’\n\nMany longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction.\n\nStill, the announcement offered the first sign of hope in months that Israel and Hamas may be winding down the most deadly and destructive war they’ve ever fought, a conflict that has destabilised the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.\n\nIn Israel, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv on Wednesday evening, calling for a deal to be completed. \n\nMany held posters of hostages held by Hamas, others hoisted candles in the air. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously said he was determined to destroy Hamas after the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people and seized about 250 hostages when they entered Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023.\n\nThe US, along with Egypt and Qatar, have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. \n\nIt comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November, after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza.\n\nIsrael responded with a brutal air and ground offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials. \n\nThey do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.\n\nUN and international relief organisations estimate that some 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. \n\nThey say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. \n\nExperts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza, where Israel launched a major offensive in early October, displacing tens of thousands of residents.\n\n‘The best day in my life and the life of the Gaza people,’ Abed Radwan, a Palestinian father of three, said of the ceasefire deal. ‘Thank God. Thank God.’\n\nRadwan, who has been displaced from the town of Beit Lahiya for over a year and shelters in Gaza City, said he will try to return to his hometown, and ‘rebuild my house, and rebuild Beit Lahiya.’\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

I believe that it all depends on the parties of the agreement acting in good faith in that agreement in order to ensure that no collapse happening to that deal.' \n\nDonald Trump confirmed mediators had struck 'a deal for the hostages' after his 'pressure tactics' were lauded for securing an agreement that had eluded Joe Biden.\n\n'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you!' the US president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform. \n\nBut despite a hostage release deal being reached, the sister of two British citizens murdered in the Israel-Hamas conflict has said 'there will never be any closure' until all Israeli hostages are returned.\n\nAyelet Svatitzky, 47, said the reports emerging on Wednesday were a 'relief' after her brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell both died and her mother Channah Peri was previously taken as a hostage. \n\nSpeaking from Israel, she said: 'We've been praying for a deal to be signed, and every hostage [being] released is a relief for them, for the families and for us.\n\n'Of course, it's too late for my brother, we will never be able to save them. We were able to bring him for burial, and so we know how crucial it is for for a deal to be complete and for all hostages to be brought back, for the live hostages to be released to their families and to start the healing and rehabilitating.'\n\nAsked if the reported ceasefire would bring her family closure, Svatitzky said: 'There will never be any closure for us until all the hostages are back.\n\n'We'll be worried and we're not able to move on until the last hostage is home.'\n\nIsrael is due to vote on the proposal in parliament this morning but it is expected to pass after Benjamin Netanyahu convinced his far-Right allies to fall in line.\n\nFamilies and loved ones of the 98 hostages held in Gaza took to the streets in Tel Aviv to celebrate the monumental agreement which will come into force on Sunday. \n\nThey were seen lighting flares, waving placards and embracing as it is hoped the first captives could be freed as early as this weekend.\n\nIn Gaza, men came out with Palestinian flags and danced after the news that the 467-day conflict was finally paused.\n\nAfter three days of intense negotiations following an early hours breakthrough on Monday, Trump proclaimed that he had helped seal an 'epic ceasefire agreement'. \n\nThe President-elect said: 'I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\n\n'With this deal in place, my national security team, through the efforts of special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza never again becomes a terrorist safe haven.' \n\nHours later, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said there were 'still some unresolved clauses' that they were working to resolve.\n\nThe Qatari PM paid credit to both the outgoing and incoming US presidents saying their united work was a 'clear demonstration of the commitment' of America which helped seal the deal.\n\nBiden said the framework was based on his contours laid out last May, adding: 'My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done.' \n\nWhile the historic deal is an important first step there are still fears the agreement could collapse and fighting resume before all the hostages are freed and Gaza rebuilt.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have agreed to pause fighting for 42 days to allow 33 of the 98 hostages to be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nHowever, during this time they must begin to negotiate the much trickier second phase which would see the Israel Defence Forces gradually withdraw entirely from Gaza in exchange for the remaining hostages. \n\nHamas is insistent it will remain in power – something that is unacceptable for Israel – meaning the ceasefire could collapse.\n\nThe terror group breached the last ceasefire after the first phase in November 2023 by firing rockets into Israel. \n\nThe Hostage Forum last night called for a deal that 'ensures the return of every person held captive'.\n\nIt is understood the first phase will start with the release of female civilian hostages, with three freed as early as this Sunday. \n\nThey will be followed by women soldiers before men over 50 and sick men under 50. \n\nUS sources last night told Fox News that 23 out of the 33 hostages to be released are alive.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has said the ceasefire and hostage deal is 'long-overdue news' and paid tribute to 'the British people who were murdered by Hamas', adding: 'We will continue to mourn and remember them.' \n\nLast night Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, said: 'Donald Trump's pressure tactics and warnings to Hamas and Israel have clearly been effective in reviving the drawn-out negotiations where the Biden administration proved unwilling to exert adequate pressure over Israel's leadership.'\n\nWitkoff was seen as vital in pushing the Israelis into agreeing a breakthrough on Monday.\n\nHamas' de-facto leader in Gaza Mohammed Sinwar then gave his blessing on Tuesday but the terror group threw a spanner in the works by demanding last-minute changes to the proposal.\n\nAfter Hamas backed down, Trump announced a ceasefire.\n\nIt pauses a conflict that started with the October 7 attacks, the largest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nUN and international relief organisations estimate that some 90 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. \n\nThey say tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hospitals are barely functioning. \n\nExperts have warned that famine may be underway in northern Gaza, where Israel launched a major offensive in early October, displacing tens of thousands of residents.","summary":"The Tottenham Hotspur fan with British-Israeli citizenship was shot in the hand and leg when she was snatched from her home during the October 7 attack by

very day Barack Obama was elected president, writer and producer Michael Crichton died at age 66 in Los Angeles.\n\nHad Crichton lived until today, he would have seen at least one of his homes – the landmark Richard Neutra house – destroyed by fire. Its destruction would not have surprised him.\n\nA contrarian by nature, the Harvard trained M.D. enjoyed a spectacular career. Several of his bestselling, science-rich novels had been turned into movies.\n\nThese included hits like “Andromeda Strain,” “Jurassic Park” and “Lost World.” He also had success as a screenwriter and a director, and he produced the mega hit TV show “ER,” which he also conceived.\n\nDespite this resumé, or perhaps because of it, the leading progressive online journal, ThinkProgress, saw fit to headline his obituary “Michael Crichton, world’s most famous global warming denier, dies.”\n\nTo the eco-warriors of the Left, Crichton had no other meaningful credential.\n\nWhat galled the Left was that Crichton used his high-profile platform to tell his fellow Californians they had their priorities screwed up.\n\nHe did so most flamboyantly on the evening of Sept. 15, 2003, at the famed Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.\n\nAs to the nature of his talk, he had been handed a weighty assignment, namely to address the most important challenge facing mankind. The one he chose was unexpected – “distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda.”\n\nWithout the ability to make these distinctions, Crichton argued, it was useless to try solving more tangible problems.\n\nAs an example of the challenge at hand, Crichton spoke about environmentalism, a bold move in a city that spawned the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and a swarm of other like-minded groups.\n\nBut if anyone had the chops to challenge environmental orthodoxy, it was Crichton. At this stage of his career, Crichton did not need anyone’s approval, and, in San Francisco, he wasn’t about to get it.\n\nAfter reassuring those in attendance that, like all rational people, he understood man has a responsibility for his environment, he cautioned them that too often civic leaders failed to make the right decisions on fixing the environment and, even worse, refused to learn from their failures.\n\nOne can only imagine what he would have thought of the half-assed decision making that fed the L.A. fires, let alone the epic responsibility-ducking by those ostensibly in charge.\n\nAs a student of anthropology, Crichton thought he knew why this willful ignorance prevailed. Although America was said to be a secular society, one in which “the best people, the most enlightened people” had transcended religion, Crichton argued that the religious instinct was innate.\n\nEven the best people, he argued, needed to believe in something beyond themselves that gave meaning to life and shaped their sense of the world.\n\nFor the Western world, said Crichton, “one of the most powerful religions” was environmentalism. He called it, in fact, “a perfect 21st century remapping of traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and myths.”\n\nCrichton went on to explain how environmentalism mimics Christianity. It starts with the “initial Eden, a Paradise, a state of grace and unity with nature.”\n\nMan then overreaches, he plucks the technological fruit from the tree of knowledge, and this leads to pollution. “There is a judgment day coming for us all,” said Crichton. “We are all energy sinners, doomed to die, unless we seek salvation, which is now called sustainability.”\n\nNot above a little humor, Crichton described communion in the church of environmentalism as pesticide-free organic food that is consumed by the elect, “the right people with the right beliefs.”\n\n“Facts aren’t necessary,” jibed Crichton. “It’s about whether you are going to be a sinner, or saved. Whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation, or on the side of doom. Whether you are going to be one of us, or one of them.”\n\nAs Crichton argued, in some circles what is “believed” has more weight than what is known. Appeals to scientific fact would probably not “impact more than a handful of you, because the beliefs of a religion are not dependent on facts, but rather are matters of faith. Unshakeable belief.”\n\nAs the fires consumed L.A., California state legislators proved themselves unshakably stupid. They went into emergency session plotting not on how best to protect the citizens, but on how best to “Trump-proof” their state.\n\nIn so doing, they proved themselves incapable of “distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda.”\n\nThe fantasy is that the legislators are in charge. The reality is that, come Monday, President Donald Trump is their daddy.\n\nAnd yes, daddy will save their sorry arses, but not without a very serious application of tough love.\n\nJack Cashill’s newest book, “Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6,” is available in all formats.","summary":"'As the fires consumed L.A., state legislators proved themselves unshakably stupid'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/california-never-could-distinguish-reality-from-fantasy/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/newsom-at-la-fires-twitter-screenshot-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:19:51","author":"Jack Cashill","authors":["Jack Cashill"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.072},{"id":280620152,"title":"Trump’s Energy Chief Nominee Says He Supports ‘All-of-the-Above’ Approach to Energy","text":"Energy Secretary nominee Chris Wright told key senators that if confirmed, he’d embrace an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy development, sustain funding for research programs, slash permitting timelines, encourage natural gas exports, and accelerate electric grid expansion.\n\nDuring his nearly three-hour Jan. 15 nomination hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, President-elect Donald Trump’s selection to lead the Department of Energy (DOE) said that upon assuming office, he would “immediately” freeze more than $25 billion in loans being processed by the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO) in the wake of recent Inspector General (IG) disclosures.\n\nWright, the MIT-educated CEO of Colorado-based Liberty Energy, among the nation’s largest fracking contractors, was less resolute when asked how he’d respond as DOE chief to anticipated efforts by the Trump administration to “claw back” funding in the annual budgets and spending programs authorized over multiple years by Congress.\n\n“If the OMB director was to try to direct your department not to fund a program or an activity that Congress had expressly appropriated funding for, would you follow the law?” asked Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).\n\nAsked how he would “protect clean energy provisions in the IRA,” Wright replied, “I would follow the statutes and laws of the United States.”\n\nDespite those vanilla vagaries and six pauses to silence climate activists, Wright’s interview with senators was friendly, with the Denver native garnering bipartisan plaudits as an energy renaissance man of sorts.\n\nIn introducing Wright to the panel, Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said he and the nominee “disagree on a lot of things” and recalled how an “almost legendary” heated discussion between them disrupted at an Easter dinner a decade ago.\n\n“Some people would be surprised I’m introducing him here, and yet, he’s a scientist who has invested his life around energy,” Hickenlooper said.\n\n“He’s, indeed, an unrestrained enthusiast for fossil fuels in almost every regard, but he studied nuclear. His first years working were in solar. He has experience in wind. He is a practitioner and a key innovator around geothermal,” the senator continued. “He is a scientist who is open to discussion, and he is, again, a scientist who is a successful entrepreneur and has that ability to assess what is possible and what isn’t.”\n\n“You understand the energy sector and the many challenges that it faces, including and especially those from the government,” Lee said.\n\nLee noted a December interim inspector general report that “raised several pretty serious concerns” regarding potential conflicts of interest within DOE’s Loan Program Office with some contractors allegedly holding “troubling dual roles” as advisors and recipients.\n\nRepublicans have chafed at DOE’s Loan Program Office spending since the office was established in 2005. Boosted by $37 billion in IRA loan authorizations for clean energy projects, about $25 billion remains “unfinalized” and is being eyed for clawbacks or defunding.\n\n“If you’re confirmed, will you commit to following the Inspector General’s recommendation and suspend the issuance of new loans until the loan program office’s compliance with conflicts of interest regulations and contractual obligations is guaranteed?” Lee asked.\n\n“I will immediately,” Wright responded.\n\nLee said Wright is ideally suited to “bring balance back” in refocusing DOE “on what ought to be its core mission, ensuring energy security, driving innovation, and lowering costs for American families” at a critical juncture for the nation’s economy and security.\n\n“American energy demand is growing, growing, growing because of our growth; growing because of the ways in which we use energy, with data centers and artificial intelligence making a dent and about to make a much bigger dent,” Lee said. “We need to energize our economy. It sounds like you grasp that fully and are ready to take that challenge on.”\n\nWright—an investor in Fervo Energy, a Texas “green energy” company that uses fracking technologies to develop geothermal resources—while celebrating his 60th birthday on Jan. 15 said he would be a steady advocate and applicator of Trump’s energy policies.\n\n“We share a passion for energy, and the reason I sit in front of you today is because President-elect Trump shares a passion for energy and an instinctual understanding that energy is not a sector of the economy—it’s the sector of the economy that enables everything else we do,” he said.\n\nWright said he’d administer an energy policy that safeguards “American quality of life, American economic strength, our geopolitical power, and what the possibilities are for the future, how we can make our children and grandchildren’s lives so much better than ours.”\n\nSen. Jim Justice (R-W.V.), the former governor of West Virginia in his first hearing succeeding the retired Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.), said the next DOE chief must “solve the riddle” of making “all of the above” energy accessible and affordable to homes, businesses, and industry where they are and when they need it.\n\n“Are you in a position of thinking about, of embracing, all energy forms? Of solving the whole riddle?” Justice asked.\n\nWright said in response, “We want energy from all sources.”\n\n“We can add energy from all sources to our pile of affordable, reliable, secure American energy,” he said.","summary":"Fracking CEO Chris Wright pledges to implement a diversified approach to lowering fuel and electricity costs in a friendly Senate nomination hearing.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trumps-energy-chief-nominee-says-he-supports-all-of-the-above-approach-to-energy-5792815","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/01/15/id5792814-01152025-DSC04474-Chris-Wright-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:19:32","author":"John Haughey","authors":["John Haughey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.143},{"id":280618110,"title":"Kanye West posts NAKED Pamela Anderson video as rapper sparks fears for Bianca Censori marriage","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Nolan's heartbreaking final wish: Star was 'grateful' for spending Christmas with her beloved sisters before her death 65\n\nTransgender girl was stabbed nine times at a roller skating party 'in revenge for lying about her gender before performing a sex act on a boy', court hears\n\nIsrael and Hamas 'agree on ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release deal', mediators claim: Benjamin Netanyahu speaks out on final details\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Terrifying twist in the Lucy Letby case which means that if she's innocent she could still be behind bars for decades\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama spark speculation they are 'heading for divorce' amid notable public absences\n\nHugh Jackman and wife Deborra-Lee Furness heading for a 'messy' divorce as shock reason behind the delay is finally revealed\n\nCure your restless legs: From a canned drink to rubber bands and garden netting, leading doctors share what REALLY works - and reveal how to avoid the scary side-effects of NHS drugs\n\nJENNI MURRAY: I can't think of anything worse that a child could do to a dead parent than this.

Where they are trying to put him away for life or worse for exposing corruption in governments. \n‘He’s been locked in a small room for almost 6 years in London at the Ecuadorian Embassy. And now he can have no visitors. No phone calls or internet. They are squeezing him.’\nIn her letter, Anderson explained that she wanted more people to discuss Assange’s situation: ‘So I want to seek more voices and share more about his fight. Public support could set him free. Media is monopolized So some brave voices are the only Hope to break through.’\nAnderson went on to say that she always supported Kanye’s ‘no filter’, adding that ‘you make an impact’.\n‘And you make an impact. I’m sure a lot of people feel like you – They just are stuck in what society says is OK to say.’\nShe ends her letter by telling the Life of Pablo musician that he should let her know if he wants to know more about Assange ‘ or just look at his life and writing’.\n\nThe Instagram video was set to offensive audio from an apparently unreleased new West track, called Hide Your B***h\n\nIn the clip, the then-41-year-old pin-up,who had performed a lap dance for the millionaire after arriving at his 82nd birthday in nothing but a pair of high heels, presented him with a cake\n\nThe rapper was recently seen celebrating his wife Bianca's 30th birthday in Dubai after spending time in Japan and China for the past four months\n\nMeanwhile in LA, Kanye's wife ex-wife Kim Kardashian and their four young children - North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm - all had to evacuate their Hidden Hills, California mansion after the Kenneth Fire threatened to burn it down\n\nIn a postscript, Anderson thanks Kanye’s wife, Kim Kardashian for going ‘#furfree’.\nThis comes after West finally reunited with his children he shares with ex-wife Kim Kardashian after reportedly spending 118 days apart as he continues life overseas, DailyMail.com exclusively revealed.\nThe controversial rapper who has been traveling with Censori for much of the last six months, was spotted in Japan with his three youngest children on Tuesday. \n\n Kanye West slammed for exposing his wife Bianca Censori's breasts in wild post \nExclusive DailyMail.com photos and video show West visiting a 7-Eleven convenience store in Tokyo's Ginza district with Saint, nine, Chicago, six, and Psalm, five. \nDressed entirely in black, the dad-of-four left the store with his kids clutching huge bags of snacks, following a 10-minute visit.\nCensori and eldest daughter North, 11, were not part of the group outing and it is not clear whether the preteen traveled to Japan to visit her dad with her siblings.\nKanye – or 'Ye' as he prefers to be known – was last seen with his children in public in September when they performed together at a Vultures 2 listening event in Haikou, China.\nIn the interim, he and Censori have lived a nomadic existence, drifting between Japan, China, and the Maldives.\nThe couple rang in the New Year in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where the pair also celebrated Censori's 30th birthday on January 5 with her parents.\nYe's constant traveling has become a bone of contention between him and Kardashian, 44, in recent weeks with the reality star accusing him of an absent father to their children.\nThe rapper attracted further criticism after a series of hellish wildfires ignited around Los Angeles, including two that threatened the Calabasas neighborhood where his children live.\nDespite the infernos blazing close to their home, Ye did not rush back from Japan to check on his children and has now flown them to Tokyo instead – a move that will invite more questions over why he is so reluctant to return to the US.\n\nOn Monday DailyMail.com revealed that his fear of being dragged into the sex abuse case that has seen his former pal Sean 'Diddy' Combs thrown in jail is partly to blame.\n'Kanye's reasoning for not being [in America] has nothing to do with his children and has everything to do with the multiple lawsuits that he is facing in the states,' a source told DailyMail.com.\n'With all this stuff with Diddy, Kanye is terrified.'\nDiddy is currently in federal custody facing a litany of charges, including sex trafficking related to drug-fueled 'freak-off' orgies.\nYe's extended travels began in June, when he was named in an ongoing wrongful termination and sexual harassment lawsuit by his former assistant, and Censori-lookalike, Lauren Pisciotta, 36.\nPisciotta claimed West had subjected her to repeated incidents of sexual harassment when she worked for him in 2021 and 2022, and that he fired her after she refused to sleep with him.\nWest has denied all the claims.\nThen in an updated filing in October, Pisciotta added a raft of new accusations. \nShe alleged that she was sexually assaulted by West sometime before she began working for him in 2021.\n\n'With all this stuff with Diddy, Kanye is terrified,' sources said. Disgraced media mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs (pictured left) is currently in federal custody facing a litany of charges.\n\nKim also told Winkler that she doesn't talk about raising her kids a lot because it comes with 'a lot of judgment'; Kardashian with all four of her children\n\nPisciotta claimed the incident occurred during a party at a Santa Monica recording studio, where Combs was allegedly present.\nShe claims that she was told to either have a drink or leave and beverages 'poured at the direction of West' were served. After drinking, she allegedly 'slip[ed] into an altered and highly-impaired state.'\nOnly years later, Pisciotta says, did West suggest to her that they had sexual relations that evening.\nPisciotta also alleged that as West's personal assistant she was tasked with organizing orgies and was asked to recruit sex workers and procure a supply of sexual-enhancement products that West allegedly called his 'sex honey'.\nPisciotta's lawyer, Mark Koorenny, said in filings in November that West had been 'out of the country' and he accused the rapper of 'evading service [of a subpoena]' stalling the lawsuit.\nWest's lawyers have denied all of these allegations as well.\nPamela AndersonKanye WestBianca CensoriJapan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West posts NAKED Pamela Anderson video as rapper sparks fears for Bianca Censori marriage\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLinda Nolan's heartbreaking final wish: Star was 'grateful' for spending Christmas with her beloved sisters before her death 65\n\nSir David Jason, 84, seen for the first time at Cirque du Soleil Corteo Premiere just hours after Only Fools And Horses co-star Diane Langton's death\n\nMaya Jama displays her jaw-dropping figure in a chic floral form-fitting dress as she features in a glamorous Dolce & Gabbana perfume advert\n\nEXCLUSIVE'I felt as though I didn't deserve to feel grief, I didn't deserve to feel sad.'

I love this guy lol and respect him for wearing the ceasefire pin and speaking out against Trump,' another wrote. \nDuring his chat with Meyers, Alwyn spoke about his new three-hour film, The Brutalist, and its 'shoestring budget' and his love for the American audience. \nWhile speaking about seeing a film in the United States, he joked about how people in the United States see movies versus in England, where they're 'embarrassed to even buy a ticket and show up.'\n'I saw Conclave recently in America, in LA. It's set in the Vatican. And there were about 10 people there dressed up as bishops. There was a pope. I mean, they'd made the pilgrimage to Sherman Oaks,' he mused, prompting laughter from the audience. \nElsewhere in the interview, Meyers asked how Alwyn was feeling while appearing on his 'first talk show' in America. \n'Awful. No,' he said, with a charming laugh. 'It's great.' \n\nThe 33-year-old actor previously dated the pop star, 35, for six and a half years after fatefully meeting at the 2016 Met Gala until their split in early 2023; seen in 2020\n\nWhile appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers, fans were blown away by the 33-year-old actor's charming personality as he answered questioned and promoted his new movie, The Brutalist\n\nThe Harriet star left viewers captivated by his wit, sense of humor and sincerity during a rare public appearance\n\nHis appearance comes less than two weeks after making a rare remark about his past relationship with Swift during a recent interview with The Guardian. \nWhen asked if thought dating the 14-time Grammy winner would overshadow his career, the actor answered, 'I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control.' \n'Right from the beginning, tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work, of course,' he said.\n'So noise outside of that, I think I've done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it,' he explained adding, 'If you don't, and if you let all of that other stuff in, and if it starts to affect you and your behavior, you're living from the outside in. And then you're pretty f**ked.'\n\n'So happy to see Joe in his debut night-time talk show ! I love his understated sense of humour that runs through his answers. The Brutalist needs to be seen on the big screen!' one fan wrote under a YouTube view of the interview\n\nAnother commented: 'He's so lovely.

We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life. So that’s for other people. That’s what I feel.'\nSwift has certainly moved on. The singer and songwriter has been dating NFL star Travis Kelce since sometime in the summer of 2023.\nTaylor SwiftJoe AlwynYouTube\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTaylor Swift's ex Joe Alwyn wins over fans with his first appearance on an American late-night show\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLinda Nolan's heartbreaking final wish: Star was 'grateful' for spending Christmas with her beloved sisters before her death 65\n\nSir David Jason, 84, seen for the first time at Cirque du Soleil Corteo Premiere just hours after Only Fools And Horses co-star Diane Langton's death\n\nMolly-Mae Hague hits back at accusations her split from Tommy Fury was a 'publicity stunt' as he claims breakup was sparked by his alcohol demons\n\nEXCLUSIVE'I felt as though I didn't deserve to feel grief, I didn't deserve to feel sad.'

It marks the seconds, minutes and days since families in Israel and beyond have been campaigning for the release of hundreds of their loved ones taken by the Hamas militant group into Gaza.\n\nIt is a clock that these families hope will finally come to a stop.\n\nOn Wednesday, mediators from the US and Qatar announced that they had reached a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, which will come into effect on Sunday. Negotiators hope it is the first step in ending the unprecedented bloodshed in Gaza, where Palestinians say Israel’s bombing has killed more than 46,000 people and laid waste to swathes of the Strip.\n\nThe hope is that it will also lead to the release of all the remaining 100 or so hostages held in Gaza and will lay the groundwork for the end of this nightmare that began on 7 October, when Hamas launched its bloody attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,000 people according to Israeli estimates.\n\nThe wording of the deal, which The Independent has seen, is complicated. It was described by one person, who is briefed by the negotiators, as “an onion”.\n\nThat worries civilians in Gaza, living in tents, their homes completely destroyed and dozens of family members killed.\n\nThey told The Independent they were cautiously celebrating, worried at the same time that the deal wouldn’t hold.\n\n“It’s a strange feeling,” says Nedal, from the north of Gaza, an area largely razed to the ground. “We are sad for those who were killed and injured, and at the same time happy that the bloodshed has stopped. We hope our return is a matter of days.\n\n“People are celebrating in the streets, shouting happily and gathering together. But they are also worried, as it will start on Sunday. There are still 72 hours to wait.”\n\nCare International said the agreement is “just the first step in stemming the overwhelming tide of suffering”, adding: “Palestinians have been killed on an incomprehensible scale.”\n\nIn Israel, families of the hostages also described a whirlwind of joy, hope, and “deep anxiety” that the agreement might collapse and not everyone would be brought home.\n\n“It’s mixed feelings – happiness, sadness, grief, and worry,” said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat, 41, a hostage, was supposed to be part of this ceasefire deal.\n\nCarmel, an occupational therapist seized from her home in Kibbutz Be’eri, was on the list of those set to be freed in an earlier draft of this deal that floundered in the 11th hour in the autumn. Carmel was shot dead by her captors in a tunnel shortly after negotiations collapsed in September.\n\n“She was even supposed to be part of the first days of the first phase, but the deal didn’t come in time. So this was such a miss for us, for me,” Gil added, his voice cracking.\n\n“On the other hand, I’m really so happy for my fellow hostage family members who are going to see, hug, and kiss their loved ones after waiting for such a long time. It feels like some of my family members are coming home too.”\n\nIn the first phase, 33 hostages, including women, the elderly, and the wounded, are expected to be released in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.\n\nAccording to US president Joe Biden, it will see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza and a surge in humanitarian aid to the Strip, which has teetered on the brink of complete famine.\n\nDuring that time, negotiations will start for the second and third phases, when the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, will be released and Israel will completely withdraw from Gaza.\n\nBut many worry there are numerous steps that have to be taken before that can happen.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Wednesday that the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is still not complete and final details were being worked out.\n\n“We are really, really worried. From what I understand, this was the same deal we had on the table since May. It wasn’t signed before – and the reason why it is signed now is because [Donald] Trump is now in the White House,” Gil continues, echoing what people close to the negotiations have told The Independent: the pressure for a truce before Trump’s inauguration on Monday was a watershed moment.\n\nThanking Trump’s team, Gil added he hoped the incoming US president understood that he had to finish what he had started.\n\n“He should leave no one behind,” he said.\n\nIn Gaza, Nedal said despite the devastation and the loss, families were celebrating because there was a chance they could go home.\n\n“People might be able to go back to the north. But of course, most homes were destroyed. But they are celebrating.”","summary":"People are celebrating in the streets as a ceasefire deal is reached,  but they still have 72 hours to wait, writes Bel Trew from Tel Aviv","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-hamas-war-ceasefire-deal-agreement-b2680464.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/15/19/SEI236081722.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OQNvRun6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:15:18","author":"Bel Trew","authors":["Bel Trew"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":280620310,"title":"STEPHEN POLLARD: This ceasefire deal isn't the final hurrah for Biden... it's the first victory for Trump","text":"At last, it seems, the hostages are going home. Or rather, some of them. \n\nThe majority have been killed in captivity, and the deal between Israel and Hamas does not mean the immediate release of all those who are still alive.\n\nAll previous prospective deals have collapsed because, when push came to shove, Hamas refused to release the hostages and Israel would not agree to Hamas’s demand that its troops leave the Philadelphi Corridor –an eight-mile strip of land along the border between Gaza and Egypt which has been used by Hamas to smuggle weapons.\n\nThis time, however, it seems both Hamas and Israel have moved. And the obvious question is: ‘Why now?’\n\nThe answer is straightforward: Donald Trump.\n\nThe deal should be seen not as the final hurrah of the Biden administration but, rather, as the first foreign policy success of Mr Trump’s second term.\n\nEven though he doesn’t take office until Monday, the very fact that he is about to become president again has already upended the dynamics not just in Gaza but across the Middle East.\n\nThe default position of so many is to look at Mr Trump and sneer. He is uncouth, unabashed and often unreliable. But as we saw in his first term as president, it is those very characteristics that give him an impact denied to the smooth, respectable and – all too often – wrong-headed foreign policy establishment.\n\nPut simply, Mr Trump gets that the single most important factor in succeeding in the Middle East is showing strength and being seen to mean it.\n\nBoth Hamas and Israel are well aware that on Monday, when Mr Trump is inaugurated, everything changes.\n\nLast week, for example, he threatened Hamas that ‘all hell will break out’ if it does not release the remaining hostages before then. Last month he said there would be ‘hell to pay’.\n\nHamas know he means what he says, unlike the weak, vacillating Joe Biden.\n\nFor months the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has been trying to secure a ceasefire deal involving the release of the hostages. He got nowhere, because all he has done is ask politely.\n\nWorse, he made it less likely there would be a deal by repeatedly criticising Israel’s tactics in Gaza, such as last March when he and Mr Biden told Israel not to enter Rafah, and then said unless Israel changed course it might lose US support.\n\nHamas smelled weakness and US pressure being put on Israel, so the prospect of a deal receded.\n\nAs the former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it when he left office in 2006: ‘Weakness is provocative. Time and again, weakness has invited adventures that strength might well have deterred.’\n\nCrucially, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, trusts Mr Trump to have Israel’s back.\n\nIn his first term, Mr Trump moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a hugely symbolic and supportive act, and he was tougher on Iran – by far the biggest national security threat to Israel – than any previous US president.\n\nMr Netanyahu also knows that it would be foolhardy to ignore the incoming president’s wishes. And Mr Trump made clear that he wanted a deal, not least by sending his incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to make sure that Mr Netanyahu was on board.\n\nMr Trump’s first term showed the Middle East he was prepared to throw his weight around.\n\nHe inherited Barack Obama’s flagship nuclear deal with the Iranian regime – a terrible treaty that allowed the coffers from its oil sales to flood back into the Iranian war chest, which it used to step up not only its nuclear programme but also its funding of its terrorist proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nMr Trump was widely pilloried for saying he would rip up the deal, but he did just that, as well as reimposing sanctions on Iran’s oil sales.\n\nThe result was clear: Iran fast ran out of money for its terrorism support.\n\nAnd because the US was seen as leading the diplomatic fight against the region’s pariah state, it paved the way for the unprecedented Abraham Accords which established friendly relations between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Sudan, all of which had good reason to fear Iran.\n\nAll that good work was undone by Mr Biden and Mr Blinken, who from their first day in power set about securing another nuclear deal with Iran – and who relaxed the sanctions so that Iran has since been able to build up its terrorism funding.\n\nMr Trump’s approach extends beyond the Middle East.\n\nIt has, for example, long been obvious that Nato members do not spend anything like enough on defence. But it was only when Mr Trump threatened, in his first term, to walk out of Nato, saying we should not expect a free ride at the US taxpayers’ expense, that members started to even think about spending more.\n\nNow the need to spend more is even clearer, but, once again, it is only thanks to Mr Trump’s threats that there is a prospect of it happening.","summary":"The majority have been killed in captivity, and the deal between Israel and Hamas does not mean the immediate release of all those who are still alive.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14290117/ceasefire-deal-Biden-victory-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/16/00/94143139-0-image-m-38_1736986163798.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:15:14","author":"Editor,Stephen Pollard","authors":["Editor","Stephen Pollard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":280618084,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres Is Unrecognizable After Hair Transformation Upon Returning to U.S.","text":"Ellen DeGeneres' blonde pixie cut became so deeply associated with the comedian that many dubbed the signature look \"The Ellen.\" But as the former talk show host, 66, was spotted in Montecito, CA on Tuesday, January 14, after spending months in England with wife Portia de Rossi, the blonde locks were nowhere to be seen.

The transition tabletop exercise was chaired by Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall in the White House Situation Room, the White House said, and included a substantial share of Biden's outgoing Cabinet for the two-hour session. The exercise has been a key part of presidential transitions since the September 11, 2001, attacks and give the outgoing and incoming teams a chance to rehearse how to respond to and manage a range of national security crises. Wednesday's simulation touched on the management of potential terror attacks and avian flu, among other challenges. The exercises can sometimes become an eerie preview of reality. During the 2016-17 transition from then-President Barack Obama to Trump, one such exercise included a discussion of the U.S. response to a global public health event. Three years later, Trump's administration was confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic. It comes two weeks after an Islamic State-inspired attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day killed 14 people and injured more than two dozen. The country is currently managing an avian flu outbreak that has killed one person and affected the nation's food supply. Attendees included Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state; former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence; his defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth; and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, his nominee for homeland security secretary, among others. Rep. Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser, and other senior White House staffers also represented the Trump team. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg were among the Biden Cabinet officials or their deputies who participated in the session, which came hours after the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The Biden team has been highlighting its efforts to cooperate with Trump's transition effort, including responding to hundreds of requests for information across the government on ongoing programs and sharing briefings on the top five to 10 most pressing issues at each agency. The White House separately briefed Trump's team on top issues, including global health, disaster response and artificial intelligence, that may require action in the first six months of the new administration. Wednesday's exercise follows an earlier tabletop in November with senior career government staffers to prepare to support the incoming administration. Separately, Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff was seen in the West Wing earlier Wednesday ahead of the exercise meeting with senior members of the incumbent administration.","summary":"Senior officials from the Trump administration, including prominent Cabinet nominees, attended a crucial transition exercise at the White House, hosted by President Biden's team.

Irresponsibly, the legacy media helped promote it, failing to do the research necessary to accurately report that the place Biden describes simply does not exist. The conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, in a very short video, does an excellent job of explaining how Biden’s claim is nothing short of fatuous pettifoggery. It suggests Biden has simply taken a lesson from his Bidenomics playbook: “Twist(ing) the numbers to make Biden look good.”\n\nHeritage reports that Biden’s spending spree has left the U.S. with a $36 trillion debt and an interest payment alone costing taxpayers over $1.1 trillion annually. The video continues:\n\n“There has never been a bigger federal deficit than the one Biden is handing off to Trump. Biden’s reckless spending set off inflation. That inflation induces the Fed to raise interest rates. The result is that Biden set our economy in a death spiral of higher debt levels and higher interest rates, driving each other up. … He tried to claim that inflation has declined to pre-pandemic levels, while wages have increased … that just isn’t true. During Trump’s first term, the average year over year inflation rate was 1.9%. Under Biden, inflation peaked at 9% and has settled to around 3% or higher as the new norm. Inflation never decreased to pre-pandemic levels. … Sure, many Americans may have seen their weekly paycheck go up, but the hidden tax of inflation means that your paycheck doesn’t go as far as it used to. That’s because real weekly wages, your paycheck minus inflation, are down 3% since Biden took over. This is the actual economy Trump is receiving. Rather than the strongest economy in modern history, it’s a house of cards built on federal debt, creating one of the most dangerous economies in modern history. Far from fixing the economy, Biden has sent the economy spiraling out of control, and he’s handing Trump an economy on the precipice of disaster.”\n\nWatching “The Wizard of Oz,” we all learned to hate the Wicked Witch of the West. We rejoiced when she, ultimately, met her end – melting as Dorothy threw a bucket of water upon her. With the legacy media promoting false stories about the strength of our economy, they are now being held accountable as they get doused with a bucket of reality – i.e., learning that such factual irresponsibility comes at a high price. Several legacy media members are suffering financial losses mandating the termination of employees – such as HuffingtonPost, which fired 22% of its newsroom staff.\n\nIf the legacy media fail to wake up to this reality, they too will suffer the Wicked Witch’s fate.","summary":"Outgoing president's claim is nothing short of fatuous pettifoggery","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/bidens-strongest-economy-whopper/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Biden_4_Pinocchios.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:14:02","author":"Lt.

Such employees could be fired more easily by the administration rather than being protected by the bureaucracy.\n\nBiden eliminated this classification in the first days of his administration, and in April 2024, implemented a rule granting federal employees future protection from a future Trump administration’s revival of Schedule F. \n\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., sympathetic to Vought’s goal of paring down the bureaucracy, praised Vought in his opening remarks while also condemning the increase in the national debt under the first Trump administration.\n\n“Since taking office four years ago, President Biden has added $8.4 trillion to our national debt. To be fair, the Trump administration added $7.8 trillion to the national debt. This is truly a bipartisan problem,” said Paul.\n\n“While I was disappointed to see our nation’s annual budget deficit grow for President Trump’s first term, I remain optimistic about President Trump’s nominee, Russell Vought.” \n\nRand Paul’s lukewarm welcome paled in comparison to Michigan Democrat Sen. Gary Peters’ full-on attack, as he accused the nominee of a politically biased war against civil servants with his creation of the Schedule F employee classification.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned by another action you pushed for during your time in the OMB to replace nearly 50,000 nonpartisan career civil servants with appointees whose only qualification is that they’re politically loyal—not that they’re competent, not that they follow the law,” said Peters, who proceeded to accuse Vought of calling civil servants “villains” as well.\n\nVought then took the floor for his opening statement, pledging to eliminate government waste.\n\n“When I look at government waste, international debt, I know I fear for my daughters’ future,” said Vought. He added that his focus would be “reforming regulation and coordinating policies across agencies to ensure efficient and effective implementation of the American people’s will.”\n\nPeters once again went on the offensive when given the opportunity to question Vought, as he stridently accused him of violating the law by intentionally delaying spending money already approved by Congress.\n\n“I’m concerned about your actions and statements about the president, who will be able to unilaterally refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated,” said Peters. “How do we negotiate with someone who says, ‘I’m just going to do what I want, to hell with the Constitution’?”\n\nVought, visibly uncomfortable yet seemingly determined in the face of Peters’ questioning, denied the senator’s accusations of withholding congressionally approved funding.\n\nThe fiscally conservative Paul took Peters’ side on the issue, telling Vought, “I’m sympathetic to the point Sen. Peters is making. … I think if we appropriate something for a cause, that’s where it’s supposed to go, and that will still be my position.”\n\nAlthough Vought did receive more friendly treatment from Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the stand-out moments of the hearing were the attacks by both libertarian-minded Paul and progressive Peters.","summary":"Russell Vought, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to direct the Office of Management and Budget, faced tense questioning from both Democrat and Republican senators during his...

Others treated in rooms designed for viewing the dead. Women miscarrying in public view. The shameful list goes on.\n\nIt beggars belief that such depravity can take place in one of the world’s leading economies, and in an NHS that costs more than £200 billion a year.\n\nCan we really continue to kid ourselves that the NHS model is somehow world-leading or viewed with envy by other nations?\n\nAs we have stated before, the Government is simply not doing enough to combat the root causes of this disarray in our hospitals.\n\nOne of the key factors is ‘bed-blockers’ who do not need to be in hospital but have nowhere else safe to go – nearly 12,000 patients every night, mainly elderly people.\n\nAnd yet Labour’s care review – which will hopefully provide some proper, long-term solutions – will not report back until 2028.\n\nThat delay was unacceptable when Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced the timescale earlier this month, and is even more so in the wake of today’s harrowing findings.\n\nDubious loyalties\n\nIt is becoming quite overwhelming how Labour is working against British interests on numerous fronts.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is appointing ministers whose previous pursuits are, at the least, questionable. Decisions are being taken which directly benefit foreign powers and not the British people.\n\nThe Government is beginning to resemble a long-dormant ‘sleeper cell’ finally activated in a John le Carré novel.\n\nAfter the resignation of the PM’s ally Tulip Siddiq – the anti-corruption minister facing a corruption investigation – he replaced her with Emma Reynolds, who has previously lobbied on behalf of Chinese interests.\n\nThen we have Labour’s moves to repeal legislation which blocked compensation claims by ex-Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, among others.\n\nShadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick yesterday raised questions about the role of Attorney General Lord Hermer, another Starmer buddy, in that sorry affair.\n\nAnd then there is the near-treacherous proposal to surrender the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which threatens to benefit China and cost the British taxpayer billions.\n\nOnly due to external factors has the Chagos deal stalled, and it will now face the scrutiny of Donald Trump after he returns to the White House next week.\n\nMr Trump, author of The Art Of The Deal, is sure to conclude it’s a stinker and dismiss any proponent of it as a fool.\n\nReeves’s folly\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves’s latest wheeze is to ask official regulators what they can do to stimulate economic growth.\n\nPerhaps it has escaped her attention that she imposed a massive, counter-productive burden on employers in the form of additional National Insurance contributions.\n\nIt was already predicted that this move would cost jobs and cut investment, and now the boss of electrical retailer Currys has voiced further dire warnings.\n\nBefore asking quangos for big ideas, the Chancellor should reflect on the folly of her own ways.","summary":"The barbarity endured by some unfortunate NHS patients is impossible to abide.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14289975/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Harrowing-truth-broken-NHS.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/15/23/94144789-0-image-m-24_1736983225895.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 00:13:02","author":"Daily,Editor","authors":["Daily","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.255}]}
