(Photo by Isabel Infantes/PA Images via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images Olympic swimmers can look like they’re glide through the water with the greatest of ease. So, it can be all that more stunning when one collapses suddenly after a race. That’s what happened to Tamara Potocka from Slovakia after she had just finished swimming in the third heat of the women’s 200 meter individual medley at the Paris Olympics. This was the 21-year-old’s first ever Olympic Games, and the 200m IM was the only event that she was swimming. After she had finished seventh in the heat, Potocka had gotten out of the pool at La Defense only to fall down at the side of the pool. Medical personnel quickly attended to her, fitted her with a neck brace and an oxygen mask, placed her on a stretcher and carried her from the pool deck. Now, when someone collapses after swimming, lots of things are possible. Swimming is a physically intense activity and can put a lot of strain on the body. There are neurological reasons why someone might fall over, ranging from a stroke to a seizure to a migraine headache. There are also cardiovascular ones where the brain is not getting enough blood flow, which can occur with a heart attack, orthostatic hypotension or other conditions. There are metabolic reasons such as a drop in blood sugar. Then there is the whole not-getting-enough-oxygen thing when something impedes your ability to breathe in enough air or exchange enough oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. It turns out Potocka had suffered an asthma attack. This wasn’t completely out of the blue as she already had a documented history of asthma. If you’ve got asthma, you can suffer periodic attacks where the airways in your lungs get inflamed and tighten. They may also produce extra amounts of mucus, all of which can make it a little or a lot harder to breathe, depending on the severity of the attach. And being able to breathe is kind of important since that’s how you get oxygen into your bloodstream and expel carbon dioxide. While a mild asthma attack can be cumbersome, a severe one can be a life-threatening medical emergency. Typically, you’ll need oxygen and medications to re-expand your airways and reduce the inflammation and swelling. That’s why any0ne with a history of more than mild asthma attacks will usually carry around medications just in case.

Common triggers include allergic ones such as molds, pollens and pet dander and non-allergic ones such as exercise, stress, illness and certain weather conditions as described on the Cleveland Clinic website. Now, there didn’t seem to be dogs and cats running around the pool, Potocka was exercising and presumably competing in the Olympics was kind of stressful. But one doesn’t always know what specifically triggered a given asthma attack. Fortunately, Potocka was able to return to the Olympic Village later that afternoon following oxygen therapy and assessment at a local hospital. It’s not the greatest ending for Potocka’s competition as her time of 2:14:20 was not fast enough for her to continue on to the semifinals of the event. But she did make it to and swim in the Olympics, which is more than over 99% of the people in the world can say. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Bruce Y.

Following the assassination attempt last month on the Republican presidential candidate, Modi condemned the attack on “my friend, former President Donald Trump” in a comment posted on social media platform X. The remark by Modi, who is the most followed head of government on the social media platform with more than 100 million followers, grabbed headlines, particularly since the two leaders have made several public appearances supporting each other. Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his star appeal at a joint rally in Houston in September 2019 that drew about 50,000 people. The two leaders more than doubled that crowd about five months later at a cricket stadium in the western Indian state of Ahmedabad, where they praised each other. Modi has widespread support among the Indian diaspora in the US, with a recent study by the Carnegie Endowment finding that around 50 per cent of Indian Americans approve of the prime minister. But even those who are diehard Modi supporters may not gravitate to Trump over fears that his regime will not be friendly to ethnic minorities, analysts say. “Traditionally, Indian Americans vote overwhelmingly for the Democrats. However, this changed slightly in 2016 and 2020 with some shifting allegiances to Trump. Some Indian Americans may vote for Trump this time, but I can’t see it as a dominant trend,” said Uday Chandra, an assistant professor of government at Georgetown University. Trump’s recent remarks casting doubt on Democrat rival Harris’ ethnic origins may again not have won him many followers from the minority Asian-American community, analysts say. The Republican leader said at a Black Journalists Conference in Chicago at the end of last month that Harris was “Indian all the way” before pivoting to a black identity for political gains. “So, I don’t know – Is she Indian? Or is she black?” he said. Harris brushed off Trump’s remarks as “the same old show” of “divisiveness … and disrespect”. “We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us – they are an essential source of our strength,” she told a meeting in Houston on Wednesday. Harris, 59, is the first female vice-president in US history and the daughter of immigrants. Her Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father were both academics and activists. As a child, Harris went to both a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple – embracing both her South Asian and black identities. Some Republicans – even from within Trump’s campaign – seem to have distanced themselves from Trump’s remarks. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who has endorsed Trump, said on Thursday that the rhetoric around race and identity was not “helpful to anyone” this election cycle, according to an Associated Press report. Trump’s attacks on Harris came as latest polls suggest a dead heat between the two in swing states since Joe Biden decided to exit the US presidential election last month, forcing the 78-year-old Republican leader to rejig his strategy that had previously made his rival’s age as a centrepiece. Diaspora’s dilemma “It is possible that a small section of Indian-origin Hindu [Americans] may cross over from Democrats to Trump because of the imagery painted by Trump of Kamala Harris, but the majority will not,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a New Delhi-based independent political commentator. Trump’s tactics of tarnishing the image of political opponents were similar to that of Modi, he said. Modi’s government has maintained robust ties with the Biden administration and has advanced military and business cooperation. Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance has an Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whose origin could have helped him gain support from the Indian-American community. “The Republican Party is shedding its racial exclusivity from the past to become a broad tent party akin to the UK Tories. However, this will take time to work out,” Chandra said. “Even wealthy and successful Hindu Americans have personal stories of racism and discrimination in the US. There is plenty of distrust. It will take more than Usha Vance or Trump’s statements to win over the majority of right-wing Hindu Americans,’ he said. Indian Americans who are Hindus have rallied behind Modi as they see him capable of bringing economic development and providing a stable administration regime in the South Asian country. Under a decade of Modi’s rule, India has emerged as a darling of global investors and the country is set to remain the fastest-growing major economy in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. In its outlook in July, the IMF raised India’s growth projection for 2024 to 7 per cent from the previous estimate of 6.8 per cent in April. The government has been gradually steering the economy from the services sector towards manufacturing. While Hindus are the dominant religious community in India, they are a minority in the US that could make them vulnerable to Trump’s policies, according to Mukhopadhyay. Another analyst, however, said a section of the diaspora was likely to support Trump because of his relationship with Modi. High-ranking executives and businessmen, especially from the tech sector, believed “Trump will be a better and natural ally to Modi”, said Priyajit Debsarkar, a London-based Indian author. Harris would need to rely on the vote of the American public in general and not on the diaspora, he said.","summary":"Even diehard Modi supporters may not gravitate to Trump over fears his administration will not be friendly to ethnic minorities, observers note.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3273049/plenty-distrust-indian-diaspora-unlikely-warm-modis-friend-trump-analysts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/03/f6e22097-1230-46b7-bdb0-8daea0e2725e_2c8f4c03.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/03/05/Trump%20win%20-%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-05 00:00:13","author":"Biman Mukherji","authors":["Biman Mukherji"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.325},{"id":253375404,"title":"David Axelrod says 2024 race is still ‘absolutely’ Trump’s to lose","text":"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod cautioned Democrats not to overly celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris’s newfound support, as he predicted the election is currently still former President Donald Trump’s to lose. Harris has seen an uptick in support since becoming the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, with recent polling data indicating she has a slight lead over Trump. However, Axelrod has contended that it is “still a really tight race” and that both sides will have to put up “a hard fight” to claim victory. “It’s absolutely Trump’s race to lose right now,” Axelrod said on CNN Newsroom. “He is ahead. And he is ahead in most of the battleground states. They’re close; they can be won by either candidate.” Axelrod argued that Harris’s spike in support stems from “irrational exuberance,” and he stated that the vice president has “a lot of momentum” since entering the 2024 race. He suggested that Democrats were initially feeling despair over the election with President Joe Biden as their nominee. “Now people feel like there’s a chance,” Axelrod said. The Democratic adviser’s caution that Trump could still emerge as the victor comes after some have suggested that Harris’s jump in support is merely a “honeymoon” period, which could wear off after a time. Gov. Chris Sununu (R-NH), for example, predicted it will last about 30 days. Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison announced Friday that Harris has received the delegates needed to become the new 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. She is expected to accept the nomination during the party’s convention in Chicago later this month.

Harris has rejected the idea of debating Trump on Fox, and is instead sticking with a previous plan to have ABC News host the debate. Harris for President communications director Michael Tyler has contended that Trump “needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”","summary":"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod cautioned Democrats not to overly celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris’s newfound support, as he predicted the election is currently still former President Donald Trump’s to lose.

The Algerian athlete spoke about her tumultuous Olympic experience on Sunday night in an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press. “I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” Khelif said in Arabic. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.” The victories of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in the ring in Paris have become one of the biggest stories of the Paris Games. Both women have clinched their first Olympic medals even as they have faced online abuse based on unsubstantiated claims about their gender, drawing them into a wider divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports. The vitriol stems from claims by the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics, that they both failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women’s competition at last year’s world championships. Khelif declined to answer when asked whether she had undergone tests other than doping tests, saying she didn’t want to talk about it. She expressed gratitude to the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, for standing resolutely behind her while the banned former governing body of Olympic boxing stoked a furor around her participation in Paris. “I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,” she said. She also has seen massive support at her bouts, drawing cheers when she enters the arena and crowds waving Algerian flags chanting her first name. She will fight again Tuesday night in the women's 66-kilogram semifinals at Roland Garros. Khelif repeatedly made clear she won't allow chatter or accusations to deter her from attempting to claim Algeria's first Olympic gold medal in women's boxing. “I don’t care about anyone’s opinion,” Khelif said a day after she beat Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary. “I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.” Although she is aware of the worldwide discussion about her, Khelif said she has been somewhat removed from the uproar. “Honestly, I don’t follow social media,\" she said. “There is a mental health team that doesn’t let us follow social media, especially in the Olympic Games, whether me or other athletes. I’m here to compete and get a good result.” Khelif started her Olympic run last Thursday with a victory over Angela Carini of Italy, who abandoned the bout after just 46 seconds. Carini later said she regretted her decision and wished to apologize to Khelif. That unusual ending raised the chatter around Khelif into a roar, drawing comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, “Harry Potter” writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. The IOC repeatedly declared her and Lin qualified to participate in the Olympics, and it has decried the murky testing standards and untransparent governance of the IBA, which was banished entirely from the Olympics last year in an unprecedented punishment for a governing body. Khelif clearly felt the weight of the worldwide scrutiny upon her, and her victory over Hamori on Saturday appeared to be cathartic. After the referee raised Khelif's hand with the win, Khelif went to the center of the ring, waved to her fans, knelt and slammed her palm on the canvas, her smile turning to tears. “I couldn’t control my nerves,\" Khelif said in the interview. \"Because after the media frenzy and after the victory, there was a mix of joy and at the same time, I was greatly affected, because honestly, it wasn’t an easy thing to go through at all. It was something that harms human dignity.” She had competed in IBA events for several years without problems until she was abruptly suspended from last year's world championships. The Russian-dominated body — which has faced years of clashes with the IOC — has refused to provide any information about the tests. Algeria’s national boxing federation is still a member of the IBA. Khelif is from rural northwestern Algeria, and she grew up playing soccer until she fell in love with boxing. Overcoming her father’s initial objections, she traveled 10 kilometers by bus to train for fights in a neighboring town. After reaching the sport’s top level in her late teens, she struggled early in her career before reaching an elite level. Khelif has been a solid, if unspectacular, international competitor for six years, and she lost to eventual gold medalist Kellie Harrington of Ireland at the Tokyo Olympics. Khelif’s next bout in Paris is against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand. If Khelif wins again, she will fight for a gold medal Friday. “Yes, this issue involves the dignity and honor of every woman and female,” she told an Algerian broadcaster in brief remarks Sunday after beating Hamori. “The Arab population has known me for years and has seen me box in the IBA that wronged me (and) treated me unfairly, but I have God on my side.” ___ Habbari is an SNTV videojournalist.

Her shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters. Harris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests. Shapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. \"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\" His handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labour groups have also criticised Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organising. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate. Walz has become a favourite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump. At 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age. Walz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years.

(Photo by: Andia/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Andia/Universal Images Group via Getty Images This is data on C2Q 2024 HDD shipments (and some SSD trends from WD) from the August 2024 Digital Storage Technology Newsletter. Total HDD shipments in C1Q 2024 were up about 1.0% compared with C1Q 2024 (30.3M versus 29.7M). Total exabytes shipped in C2Q 2024 were up about 10.6% from C1Q 2024, driven by greater sales of mass storage HDDs, such as nearline drives. HDD revenues ($4.51B) were up about 14.6% from the prior quarter. This quarter continued the upward trend in unit and exabyte shipments as well as revenues that started two quarters ago. Other memory and storage products have also recovered. Seagate said their HDD revenue was $1.727B in the quarter with Mass Capacity HDDs accounting for 83% of this revenue. 79% of the company’s product was sold directly to OEMs (up from 75% in the prior quarter). Total storage capacity shipped was 114.2EB with 103.9EB for Mass Capacity and 8.3TB for Nearline HDDs, the balance of 10.3EB was shipped for legacy applications. The average HDD capacity was 9.3TB with Mass Capacity average capacity at 12.6TB and legacy average capacity at 2.5TB. The company shipped about 12.3M units in the quarter with an ASP of $140.9. Western Digital reported that their C2Q 2024 total HDD EB shipments increased by 12% from the prior quarter (I estimate this at 162.1EB) and that they had shipped 125EB of nearline storage. They also said that they shipped 2.3M client compute units, consumer shipped units were 1.9M and data center (cloud HDD unit shipments) were 7.9M. That means the average capacity of their nearline HDDs was about 15.8TB. The company’s ASP was $163 (up from the prior quarter at $15). Total HDD revenue was $2.003B. Cloud storage was about 50% of the company’s revenue in this quarter (compared to 45% in the prior quarter). Dave Mosley of Seagate said that. “﻿…we are seeing strong nearline cloud demand growth from customers globally. Fourth quarter nearline cloud revenue more than doubled from the year ago period, and we expect growth to continue in fiscal 2025. We attribute the underlying demand drivers to an increase from both traditional cloud computing workloads, as well as new AI-related deployments. We believe this demand rebound follows a period of deferred HDD storage investments by cloud providers as they prioritize spending towards compute-intensive infrastructure.

By offering cost-efficient, scalable storage solutions, HDDs are ideal for maintaining the integrity of AI training data sets as well as preserving the valuable content that AI engines are projected to generate in the future. ﻿In the enterprise OEM markets, we observed a gradual improvement in demand for the second consecutive quarter; and continue to project stronger growth in the second half of the calendar year, driven by both modest improvement in traditional server unit demand and increased exabyte content.” Seagate says that it is pursuing a built to order (BTO) strategy for their HDDs. They also said that they should have completed HAMR-based Mozaic 3+ production qualification with a leading cloud partner in the September quarter. They also shipped some HAMR-based Mozaic drives for revenue to non-cloud customers. They are also launching new HAMR HDD qualifications and expect a volume ramp towards mid-calendar 2025. The company is also pushing development of its Mozaic 4+ HDDs (40+TB). 28TB PMR products are also popular. ﻿Gianluca Romano (Seagate CFO) said, for the June quarter, “﻿Within our hard disk drive business, exabyte shipments grew 15% sequentially to 114 exabytes, while revenue increased 17% to $1.7 billion. Growing demand for our mass capacity products more than offset a sequential decline in the legacy and non-HDD businesses. Within the mass capacity market, revenue increased 22% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strengthening global nearline cloud demand along with an improvement in the VIA market. Mass capacity shipments totaled 104 exabytes compared with 89 exabyte in the March quarter, up 17% sequentially. Mass capacity shipments now represent more than 90% of total HDD exabytes, reflecting the continued long-term secular growth for cost-efficient scalable storage. …﻿Turning now to our outlook, we expect mass capacity revenue to trend higher in September quarter and more than offset lower sales into the legacy markets. We continue to see demand growth from global cloud customers as well as a modest improvement in the nearline enterprise market.” David Goeckeler of WDC said, “… AI Data Cycle is increasing the need for storage and creating new demand drivers across both Flash and HDD. Given this landscape, we expect Flash to benefit from both AI training and inference while HDD is poised to benefit at both the input and output stages of these AI models. To address the growing performance, power, and capacity requirements, we have developed our Flash and HDD product road maps to meet our end customer storage needs across the entire AI Data Cycle. During our new era of NAND webinar last month, we introduced the world's highest capacity BiCS8 two-terabyte QLC memory die specifically designed to meet growing data center and AI storage needs. Built on a chip bonded to array architecture, BiCS8 reinforces Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost and capital efficiency as well as superior I/O performance by integrating wafer bonding in advanced 3D manufacturing to establish a groundbreaking foundation for future scalability of 3D NAND. In addition, our 64-terabyte enterprise SSD is now being sampled with plans for volume shipment later this calendar year. Furthermore, our PCIe Gen 5-based enterprise SSD delivers best-in-class read performance as well as power efficiency. The layers focus race is behind us. The emphasis is now shifting toward strategically timing the economic introduction of new longer-lasting nodes. Innovation now means enhancing power efficiency, performance, and capacity within these nodes, while capital decisions increasingly prioritize opportunities for margin expansion and revenue growth. Turning to HDDs. Revenue growth was driven by strength in nearline demand and improved pricing. By leveraging our SMR leadership and lean cost structure, we have surpassed our target gross margin range, underscoring our ongoing commitment to improve future profitability. On the technology front, we ship samples of our 32-terabyte UltraSMR/ePMR nearline hard drives to select customers. These drives feature advanced triple-stage actuators and OptiNAND technology which are designed for seamless qualification, integration, and deployment in hyperscale cloud and enterprise data centers while maintaining exceptional reliability. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect further growth driven by greater demand and more favorable pricing. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR, and we anticipate a third major cloud vendor to begin the ramp of adopting SMR in the fiscal first quarter.” We saw a 10.5% average sales price (ASP) increase for HDDs from C1Q 2024 to C2Q 2024. The chart below shows this boost in ASP combined with the ASP in the prior quarter have HDD ASPs at the highest level they have been at since late in the 1990’s (almost to the ASP in 1998).

Total HDD unit shipments will likely continue to decline for the next year or so, due to the continuing decline in legacy HDD applications (such as PCs and consumer devices). However high capacity nearline HDD growth should continue in 2024 and in the future, driven for the demand for lower cost secondary storage in data center to support large amounts of incoming data to support AI training and other applications. This should raise the number annual shipping HDDs by 2027. History and Projections for HDD Unit Shipments Tom Coughlin The increase in HDD prices indicate greater growth and a greater percentage of sales of nearline and other mass storage HDDs. It also indicates that demand is now greater than supply. Seagate reports providing HDDs on a build to order model and the other HDD companies will likely have similar strategies to deal the growth in demand, while all the HDD companies idled capacity during the downturn of the last couple of years. Total HDD unit shipments in C2Q 2024 were up about 1% from the prior quarter, marking a third turn-around quarter for HDD demand. Capacity shipments were up 10.6% from the prior quarter and revenues were up about 14.6%. HAMR HDD qualifications are continuing and are on track for significant shipments in 2025.

Last week, Biden called for sweeping reforms to the Supreme Court, including term limits, a binding code of conduct for its nine justices and a constitutional amendment that would limit presidential immunity. In an interview to promote his new book, Gorsuch requested the president exercise caution in how he goes forward, because the judiciary is meant to be an independent check on Biden’s office. ‘It’s there for the moments when the spotlight’s on you, when the government’s coming after you. And don’t you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn’t that your right as an American?’ Gorsuch asked. The Donald Trump-appointed justice then added: ‘And so I just say, be careful.’ Gorsuch, a part of the Republican majority on the 6-3 Supreme Court, also has expressed worry that Americans don’t appreciate what the court represents. ‘I´m not saying that there aren’t ways to improve what we have. I´m simply saying that we´ve been given something very special. It´s the envy of the world, the United States judiciary,’ he said. Gorsuch is currently promoting his new book, ‘Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law. ‘Too little law and we´re not safe, and our liberties aren´t protected. But too much law and you actually impair those same things.’ The 56-year-old justice was the first of three Supreme Court nominees of Trump, and they have combined to entrench a conservative majority that has overturned Roe v. Wade, ended affirmative action in college admissions, expanded gun rights and clipped environmental regulations aimed at climate change, as well as air and water pollution more generally. Biden, citing ‘recent ethics scandals’ involving justices and high court rulings that ‘overturned long-established legal precedents protecting fundamental rights’, has called on Congress to pass three major reforms in a bid to ‘restore trust and accountability’ in America’s democratic institutions. The White House last week detailed the contours of Biden’s court proposal, noting how the Democrat believes ‘no one – neither the President nor the Supreme Court – is above the law’. The President will officially propose the changes today during a speech in Austin, Texas, however his proposals appears to have little chance of being approved by a deeply-divided Congress with under 100 days to go before Election Day. Regardless, Democrats hope Biden’s proposal will help to focus voters as they consider their choices in the tight presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has sought to frame her race against Republican former President Donald Trump as ‘a choice between freedom and chaos’. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and adds a measure of predictability to the nomination process. He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a code of ethics for justices that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden has also urged Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. It comes after the Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump cannot be prosecuted for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president in a landmark decision recognizing for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution. The decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. Biden’s push for reforms comes a week after Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris to square off against Republican presidential candidate Trump in November. It also follows the Supreme Court’s ruling that there is no Constitutional right to abortion and other decisions that blocked Biden’s agenda on immigration, student loans, vaccine mandates and climate change.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch sent a stern warning toward Joe Biden&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supreme Court Justice criticizes Biden&#8217;s extensive reform proposal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/supreme-court-justice-criticizes-bidens-extensive-reform-proposal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Supreme-Court-Justice-issues-stern-words-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:26:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":253374272,"title":"The Looming Catastrophic Flooding After Debby Makes Landfall","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Tropical Storm Debby as it approaches Florida. It is expected to become a hurricane before landfall. NOAA and Tropical Tidbits website As I write this on Sunday evening, Tropical Storm Debby is slowly inching towards the northern Florida coast. It is expected to become a hurricane before making landfall. The same region was hit by Hurricane Idalia (2023) last year. As concerning as a landfalling storm is, I am equally concerned that people in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas may not fully appreciate what they are about to experience after landfall. Irrespective of its category, Debby is likely to be a catastrophic rainfall event in the coastal southeastern United States. Day 1 to 5 Rainfall Forecast (inches) from Debby. NOAA Why do I say that? The storm is likely to drop between 1 to 2 feet in southeastern coastal areas and linger for days. Before delving into the potentially historic rainfall event that looms, let’s turn to the National Hurricane Center for an update as of 5 pm EDT on Sunday. NOAA forecasters wrote, “Debby will continue to move over waters of high heat content and remain in an environment of low vertical wind shear into Monday morning.... given the favorable oceanic and shear conditions, significant strengthening is expected before landfall.” The Florida peninsula has dealt with storm surge, wind gusts, and tornadoes most of Sunday and now the easternmost Florida panhandle braces for impacts. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane winds, excessive rainfall, and tornadoes are likely. Given recent trends in the Gulf of Mexico, I would not be surprised if rapid intensification occurs before landfall. After a landfall in northern Florida some weakening is likely, but here is where it gets particularly deceptive and worrisome. Projected track of Debby.

Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flooding impacts from the Florida Big Bend region through southeast GA and the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas through Friday.” Even before seeing this language, I pondered the right word to use for several minutes before landing on “catastrophic.” In the end, I went with it too. As a meteorologist, the analogue that comes to mind is Hurricane Harvey (2017) and messaging challenges associated with it. We warned that Harvey would dump several feet of rainfall over southeastern Texas once it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Yet, it the magnitude still seemed to “surprise” some people. The system stalled and produced historic, life-altering flooding in Houston and surrounding areas. While Harvey is not the perfect analogue, Debby will make landfall and then drift to near the Georgia and South Carolina border. At that point, it is projected to stall or meander. NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center discussion explains, “With a col in place across the Southeast U.S. in the wake of the departing trough across the Northeast, steering flow aloft will be rather weak and disorganized, resulting in a severe slow down for the tropical cyclone and model guidance typically struggles in these types of situations.” If it stalls over water, it could likely re-intensify. Either way, it is a dreadful scenario. Greatest risk of flash flood risk with Debby. NOAA Much of the Southeast has experienced sustained rainfall for days so the soil is saturated. When you couple that with heavy, sustained rainfall, flooding is going to happen along with falling trees, power outages, and even potential water supply disruptions. In case it slipped by you earlier, the region will likely be dealing with Debby this entire work week. Large swaths of rainfall in the 1 to 2 feet range are expected across much of coastal Georgia and the Carolinas. Such amounts will lead to compound flooding when you consider the flash flooding, delayed riverine flooding, and surge inundation. If you live in the moderate or high-risk areas depicted in the graphic above, make sure you understand your flood risks and plan accordingly. Before you say, “But Dr. Shepherd it will only be a tropical storm at that point.” Some of the most catastrophic rain events in history happened when the storms were not really “strong” from a Saffir-Simpson scale categorization. Such storms include Allison (2001), Harvey (2017), and Florence (2018). In these situations, try to focus on potential impacts not category.

(Photo by Thomas SHEA / AFP) (Photo by THOMAS SHEA/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images My fear is that many people residing in affected regions or vacationing in there have no benchmark experience for this type of event or may underestimate the risks associated with a lingering tropical system. There are also dangerous cognitive or other biases that may appear. The Decision Lab website defines optimism bias as, “Our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing positive events and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing negative events.” A recent Stanford study also finds that over time people’s perception of hurricane risk drops after they have experienced previous storms. Motivated reasoning, is defined by a University of Notre Dame website as, “Our tendency to use reasoning not to discover what's really true but to justify—both to ourselves and to others—the conclusion we prefer, or have already made.” All of these are common. I remember numerous conversations with my own dad, a long-time resident of coastal Florida. Inland freshwater flooding is the deadliest aspect of a hurricane, but there is a perception that it is “just” rain. Images of violent winds speeds or turbulent seas can shape the risk perception for many people when it comes to storms like Debby. Rainfall can often be “slept on.” That’s why I write these articles.

[+] season 2 finale of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO With the season two finale of House of the Dragon now upon us, the hostile tension between Targaryen Greens and Targaryen Blacks is officially at its boiling point. Despite all of the deadly dragon fights, backstabbing and changes in alliance that have occurred throughout this second season of the HBO original series, two characters who have continued to lead with reason and loyalty to the best of their abilities - Jacaerys Velaryon and Lady Baela Targaryen. Bethany Antonia and Harry Collett in season 2 of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO Played by Harry Collett and Bethany Antonia, I sat down with the House of the Dragon actors to uncover their mindsets around their seemingly more sensible characters, amidst the chaos that surrounds them. With both actors being cast towards the end of season one as Jacaerys and Baela, after a time jump occurred for their characters into young adulthood, Antonia said about her enjoyment around her character’s evolution thus far, “I think just getting to be a part of something from the very beginning is just so much fun. We had a tiny little taster of what it was going to be like [in season one] - and now, getting to be here from the very start [of season two] and getting to be part of the character-building process has just been amazing.” Collett added: “There’s a lot of pressure but it’s not like horrible pressure. You have to have pressure going into something like this, being a character in one of the biggest shows in the world. It’s a lot but I’ve had an absolute blast on this, and like Bethany said, we had so much freedom this year.” MORE FOR YOU ‘Vicious Spiral’ Alert Issued After Donald Trump Proposed A ‘Massive,’ Radical Plan To Pay Off $35 Trillion Of U.S. National Debt Leak Reveals Crypto Is Braced For A Huge BlackRock And Wall Street ETF Earthquake After $60,000 Bitcoin Price Crash Apple iPhone 16 Pro To Gain Most From Powerful Upgrade, New Leak Says Harry Collett and Bethany Antonia in season 2 of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO Being characters whose childhood friendship has blossomed into a romance, I wondered what Antonia and Collett would say makes their on-screen relationship unique on House of the Dragon and something that is really compelling within the show’s storytelling. Collett said, “Very good question. I would say there is a number of things, really. They understand each other, which a lot of couples don’t on this show. Even if they do argue, it’s a very civilized argument, if that makes sense, so they’re very subtle about it. I feel like they both are going through so much, so they both try so hard not to upset each other and they talk out their feelings, which is really, really nice.” Antonia quickly added: “Which I think comes from them having had such a formative experience together, where we saw them as children in the first season. Baela experienced death at such a young age and that was visible for everyone to see, but people maybe don’t realize that Jacaerys also went through [death] at the exact same time with Harwin. The two of them have bonded over this loss of parenthood from the get-go, and I think that’s a really invaluable experience that we’ve seen them go through as such good friends. So, anything that came after that was always built on a really beautiful foundation.” Being a prequel story within the popular Game of Thrones universe, based on the George R.R. Martin book Fire & Blood, this television storytelling with House of the Dragon has taken several creative liberties over these two seasons, with a third season already announced at HBO. With showrunner Ryan Condal continuing to pave the way on-screen, I wondered if Collett and Antonia ever wonder when they get a new script, if their characters will survive beyond that given episode and get to see another day. Showrunner Ryan Condal on the season 2 set of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO Antonia said, “Yeah! It’s really funny with this one because it is an adaptation of a book, but it’s the world of Game of Thrones and Ryan has the power to do anything. I had already started reading the book when I was auditioning for the show and I finished it before I had been offered the part, so I kind of like messed myself up there and I knew the plan for Baela. So everyday, I spend [time] just like begging Ryan Condal to not change things!” Collett said, “I think somebody told me if your time on the show comes to an end, you will be told beforehand. It’s not like at the cast script reading, you’ll find out there and then, and you have to go through sadness with loads of people next to you. You’ll be told prior - I think Ryan told me that he calls it ‘The Death Call’ - you just see your phone buzzing and you’re like, No!” As I concluded my conversation with the actors behind these beloved House of the Dragon characters, I wondered what Antonia and Collett would say to Baela and Jacaerys, after embodying them on-screen throughout the entirety of season two. Harry Collett and Emma D'Arcy in season 2 of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO Collett said, “I would say to Jacaerys, Just chill out, man! I know you’re going through a lot but you need to stop with the rational decisions, and just take a chill pill and just take each day as it comes.” Bethany Antonia in season 2 of \"House of the Dragon\" HBO Antonia said, “Mine would be to keep her wits about her, and to kind of understand that people’s alliances are going to change very quickly around her and there might not be a reason for that. I think she’s still in a state where she wants reason for everything because she’s a child. I would say to understand that not all decisions are made rationally or logically.” Follow me on Twitter.

There will be, after all, some kind of presidential debate, and we all know how well Kamala Harris does in debates – or in any situation where she has to speak without a script or a teleprompter.

Biden laid out his Supreme Court reform agenda last Monday with a “bold” three-part proposal: A “No One Is Above the Law” constitutional amendment to state a former president does not have immunity for crimes carried out in office; term limits for Supreme Court justices; and a “binding” code of conduct for the high court. Vice President and presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris endorsed the plan.

Monte Maria Radio, a Tijuana-based Catholic media ministry, began airing Spanish-language Catholic Church programming on Aug. 1. “I’m not disappointed at all,” Hagen told Times of San Diego. Instead, Hagen said he was proud of what happened with The Mightier 1090, which benefited from a 50,000-watt signal that reached throughout Southern California. “Absolutely,” he said. “We accomplished something that had never been done before and during a very challenging time in the economy and broadcasting.” Beginning in August 2020, Hagen, a passionate fan of sports talk radio since his youth in Phoenix, led the re-launch of The Mightier 1090. Hagen said he grew up listing to KTAR, a Phoenix news-talk-sports radio station featuring sportscaster Lee “Hacksaw” Hamilton, who relocated to San Diego in the 1980s. Hagan said his first job after college was at KTAR. The 1090-AM station, previously billed as “The Mighty 1090,” was a fixture in the San Diego radio market since its founding in 2003 by Broadcasting Company of the Americas. The station went off the air in April 2019 due to a dispute over leasing fees between BCA and Interamericana de Radio, the Mexican-based signal transmitter provider. At the time, Hagen said he had signed a local marketing agreement, including a five-year lease of the 1090-AM frequency, with Andreas Bichara Assad of Interamericana del Radio in Rosarito, the signal tower operator who previously battled with the now-defunct BCA. Since 1998, Hagen has owned and operated Out The Window Advertising, a Flagstaff, AZ-based advertising agency. But, he also has loads of experience in the radio industry. Hagen was involved with launching KMVP-FM 98.7 in Phoenix. Today, the station is the flagship station for the MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks, NFL’s Arizona Cardinals, NBA’s Phoenix Suns and Arizona State University’s Sun Devils’ football games. “It was a daunting task to launch a radio station from scratch in 2020 during the pandemic when there were virtually no live sports taking place,” Hagen said. “I knew what it takes to launch a radio station and a tireless amount of work from a number of great people made it happen. The station had an iconic history in sports radio in San Diego.” Scott Kaplan, who had spent 16 years at The Mighty 1090, was the headline talk-show host during the four years of The Mightier 1090, although some of his shows were prerecorded. Today, Kaplan is the afternoon drive co-host at KSPN-AM ESPN 710 in Los Angeles. “I want to thank Andres Bichara and Scott Kaplan for their partnership in making all this happen,” Hagen said. “I know I can say that I certainly learned a lot with this endeavor and am better for it.” Lee “Hacksaw” Hamilton’s 26 years in the San Diego radio market included stints at XTRA Sports 690-AM (1987-2008) and The Mighty 1090-AM (2011-2017), two stations that preceded The Mightier 1090 ESPN Radio. “The Mexican ownership charged excessive licensing fees to program sports, an expensive talent-based format. Those fees sank 1090,” Hamilton told Times of San Diego. “Makes your heart ache what the hosts gave their stations and poured into the community, only to see decision makers in Tijuana do this to the signal and their hosts.” Creative Agency 62ABOVE Hires New Team Members San Diego creative marketing agency 62ABOVE has announced two new hires, including Jomary Jimenez as social media manager and Shanley Honarvar as public relations and social media coordinator. Jimenez, with 10 years of marketing experience, was previously with Orlando-based MayCom Interactive, a marketing consulting agency, and BCV Social, a Chicago-based social media marketing agency for hotels, resorts and hospitality clients. She also has worked with Retro Fitness in West Palm Beach, FL, Hotel Bennett in Charleston, South Carolina, Salamander Hospitality of Middleburg, VA, and Eden Roc Hotel in Miami Beach. A statement said Jiminez with work with 62ABOVE clients Temecula Valley Winegrowers Association, Go Lake Havasu and Qualcomm. Honarvar, who graduated from Loyola University Maryland in May 2023, was previously with Baltimore integrated marketing agency GKV as an assistant account executive during the past year. She also has worked with Savor Public Relations in Washington, DC and Butin PR in Charlotte, NC. The agency said Honarvar will work with Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort, San Diego Museum of Art, Love Catalina and The Viv Hotel. “Jomary and Shanley each bring a deep passion for tourism and hospitality with their impressive skill-sets in public relations and social media,” said Indra Gardiner Bowers, 62ABOVE’s chief communications officer. TV Reporter’s Foundation Offer Free Back-to-School Haircuts The Larry Himmel Neighborhood Foundation, named after the late San Diego TV personality and humorist Larry Himmel, is offering free haircuts and school supplies to boys and girls, ages 5 to 18, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, at Skyline Church, 11330 Campo Road, La Mesa. More than 600 children are expected to attend, according to Miles Himmel, foundation founder and Larry’s son. It’s the eighth annual back-to-school haircut day, he said. Barbers and hair stylists, including students and trainers, from the California Barber & Beauty College will volunteer their time and talents. The kids also will be treated to breakfast or lunch and given backpacks stuffed with school supplies, including notebooks, pens and rulers, along with tickets to various San Diego attractions, including sporting events, San Diego Zoo and San Diego Air & Space museum. The foundation is accepting donations to cover costs at larryhimmelfoundation.org. “A fresh haircut and essential school supplies can significantly boost a child’s self-esteem and readiness to learn,” said Himmel. “However, to make this event a success, we need the community’s support. Your generous donation will help us provide backpacks to children in need. Together, we can ensure that every child starts the school year with confidence and the necessary resources.” Over the years, the foundation has paid for Christmas gifts for homeless families, a new sandbox for special education students, new uniforms for cheerleaders, equipment and uniforms for Pop Warner players after their storage shed was vandalized, and financial aid to restaurants struggling during the COVID-19 crisis. Also, the foundation has paid for marriage license fees, roses and gifts for couples who get married on Valentine’s Day at the San Diego County Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk office at the County Administration Center. Larry Himmel, a feature reporter for 35 years with KFMB-TV, passed away in November 2014 from pancreatic cancer. He was 68. Shortly after Larry’s passing, Miles established the foundation in his father’s name that exists to help ordinary San Diegans in need. Larry Himmel, who grew up in Chicago, moved to San Diego in the 1970s and worked at bartending in Ocean Beach and stand-up at the Comedy Store in La Jolla. In 1979, he was hired at KFMB-TV’s Channel 8 news to host “Larry Himmel At Large” commentaries. Biden’s Final Ad Spending Tally Tops $300 Million Until the very end, before he dropped out, President Biden’s reelection campaign continued to spend money on advertising. According to AdImpact, an ad tracking firm, in the weeks leading up to Biden’s July 21 announcement to end his presidential re-election campaign, millions of Biden ad dollars were spent on ads in battleground states, including Pennsylvania ($35.3 million), Michigan ($26.3 million), Georgia ($21.4 million), Arizona ($16.2 million), Wisconsin ($15.5 million), North Carolina ($137.7 million) and Nevada ($11.4 million). As reported by Inside Radio, a trade publication, AdImpact’s analysis shows Biden aired more than three times as many broadcast TV ads as Trump in June. The vast majority of those ads (88%) were attacks on former President Donald Trump. Other top topics were abortion rights, character, healthcare, crime, abortion and Medicare. Also, AdImpact has tabulated how much President Biden spent on his re-election effort before dropping out. It says the Biden campaign spent $207 million, with 56% of those dollars targeting Facebook and Google ads. However, not all of Biden’s ad spending came from the campaign. When outside group spending is factored in, AdImpact says pro-Biden ad spending reached $301 million. Meanwhile, AdImpact says the Trump campaign is planning to run ads valued at $12.2 million in six swing states through mid-August. Also, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has reserved $50 million in ads through the Democratic National Convention, to be held Aug. 19 to 22.

Despite a decade of failure in repealing the Affordable Care Act, and the fact that the law is stronger than ever, gutting it still looms large in their aspirations. And this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, is banging the repeal-and-replace drum. “Well, I think we’re definitely gonna have to fix the health care problem in this country,” Vance told the news outlet NOTUS this week. “The problem with Obamacare is that for a lot of people, it just doesn’t provide high-quality health care, right? So you have a lot of people paying out the ass, paying very high prices for health care that isn’t high quality.” As a matter of fact, premium costs for people with subsidized ACA plans have decreased 44%, or $705 per year, according to a recent analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan organization focused on health policy. That’s 21.4 million people with Obamacare plans who have enjoyed those lower costs thanks to President Joe Biden and the Democratic Congress that increased those subsidies. So much for that argument from Vance. Vance also claimed that “repeal and replace efforts” during Trump’s presidency were “fundamentally focused around the idea of fixing what was broken, not about stripping people’s health care away. So yeah, I think you’re certainly gonna see efforts to reform the system.” That’s not true, either. While Trump kept up the fiction that he was working on a plan to replace the ACA, that plan never materialized. On top of that, his Department of Justice was arguing before the Supreme Court, trying to get them to overturn the law—and yes, that included ripping coverage away from people with preexisting conditions. In this election cycle, Trump has regularly talked about getting rid of Obamacare, even though Republican lawmakers want him to stop talking about it. (Again, the law is popular.) While he might not find much congressional support to repeal the law, that doesn’t mean the ACA would be safe in Trump’s hands if he wins this November. When he couldn’t repeal it during his administration, he did everything he could to sabotage it through executive actions. Biden had to undo that damage, and it worked—there are more people enrolled in its plans than ever before. But that doesn’t mean it’s safe. In a second administration, Trump would have the Project 2025 playbook, the Heritage Foundation’s authoritarian agenda to, among other things, replace civil servants in the Department of Health and Human Services with a raft of Trumpists who could do a great deal more damage. None of the plans for health care in the Trump team’s blueprint would be good for consumers. There are still necessary improvements to the ACA, and to the health care system in general, but who would you trust to oversee that?

Newsweek could not independently verify this.In early May, Russia launched a cross-border offensive into the Kharkiv region. Ukraine quickly said the opening up of a new front was designed to pull its vital resources away from the hotspots in the east.However, in late July, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank, said Russian forces were \"unlikely to mount a distinct new summer offensive operation due to material and manpower constraints.\"Moscow had been pushing ahead with a \"localized\" effort in the west of Ukraine's Donetsk region at the end of the month, but \"likely lack the wider operational capacity to mount a separate renewed offensive operation in Donetsk Oblast or elsewhere on the front this summer,\" the ISW evaluated.This assessment is broadly correct, agreed Nick Reynolds, a research fellow in land warfare at the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank.But the situation is \"fragile for both sides\" and \"very unpredictable,\" he told Newsweek.Analysts and officials say Moscow is waging an attritional war, hoping to grind down opposition fighters and Kyiv's reserves of equipment before the Kremlin runs low on its own resources.While Western intelligence indicates Russia has received supplies from allies like Iran, China and North Korea, Moscow also quickly put its defense industry on a war footing and has leaned on vast stockpiles of mothballed Soviet equipment.Russia's gains have been fueled by high casualty counts among its personnel, and in recent months, Ukraine has frequently reported that more than 1,000 of Moscow's fighters are sustaining injuries or are being killed each day.Estimates from Kyiv indicate Russia is able to pull around 30,000 new recruits into its military each month.Ukraine receives significant aid from its Western backers, including military vehicles. But despite public declarations of ironclad commitments to Kyiv from NATO, there are pressing questions over the future of military aid deliveries should former President Donald Trump clinch victory in the U.S. elections later this year.However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Sunday that F-16 fighter jets, donated by at least one of Kyiv's supporter countries, were already operational after days of reports suggesting the aircraft had arrived. Kyiv hopes to use the advanced aircraft to stave off Russian efforts and beef up its air defenses.A large-scale offensive from Russia could be more likely next year, Reynolds suggested, although Moscow could attempt further smaller-scale operations before then.Offensive pushes have typically come in the spring or summer, avoiding the muddy season coming straight after the winter or in late fall. Tanks and armored vehicles get bogged down in off-road patches, forcing their operators to stick to well-paved roads.","summary":"Moscow has been pressing west from the captured city of Avdiivka for months, gaining territory at a high cost to personnel and equipment stocks.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/russia-summer-offensive-eastern-ukraine-donetsk-1934298","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442485/ukraine-artillery-fire.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 23:00:01","author":"Ellie Cook","authors":["Ellie Cook"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":253373842,"title":"Why Dior Launched A Floating Wellness Retreat For The Paris Olympics","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The upper deck of the Dior Spa Cruise ship replete with Toile de Jouy and a cryo inspired plunge ...

That fight card, UFC 305, goes down at RAC Arena in Perth, Australia. In the headlining scrap, UFC middleweight champion Dricus du Plessis faces former 185-pound champion Israel Adesanya. In the evening’s co-main event, recent UFC flyweight title challenger Steve Erceg faces former interim 125-pound title challenger Kai Kara-France.

[+] Men's Singles Gold medal match against Novak Djokovic of Team Serbia on day nine of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 at Roland Garros on August 04, 2024 in Paris, France. (Photo by Jean Catuffe/Getty Images) Getty Images If emotion is the metric to evaluate whether Olympic tennis means as much as the four majors, then there was plenty of evidence in Paris to show there’s a case. On Sunday, a tearful Novak Djokovic called his gold medal win over Carlos Alcaraz the “biggest success of his career.” He has 24 slams. Meanwhile, the Spaniard cried in an interview with Alex Corretja such was his utter devastation. There’s a view that Iga Swiatek doesn’t do emotion. The Pole is the automaton who wins lots of tennis tournaments. When she lost to eventual gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the Olympic semi-final, it was all too much for the No. 1 seed on a streak of 25 consecutive wins in her own backyard at Roland Garros. The tears flowed in a post-match interview with Polish TV. Swiatek couldn’t comprehend what had just happened. She couldn’t speak. This was the stark reality of how brutal professional tennis can be. The sport only returned to the Games of the Olympiad in 1988 after a six-decade absence, but it has generated some of the most compelling stories and emotions on court ever since. Steffi Graf may have some sympathy for what Swiatek had gone through when destiny was calling. The 22-time singles Slam winner was beaten by the precocious 16-year-old Jennifer Capriati in the final of the women’s singles at the 1992 Barcelona games. “It was so emotional, I got the chills out there. This is unbelievable. I mean, I can’t believe it. The last two weeks, I saw all the other athletes up there on the victory stand and I thought, ‘Wow, that would be so cool ,” said the teenage champion. She summed up the zeitgeist of tennis at the Olympics right there. Andy Murray has won three Grand Slams, none more cherished than his two Wimbledon titles, but perhaps they, and the very first baby, the U.S. Open in 2012, were only possible because of what happened at the London Olympics just a month before his Flushing Meadows breakthrough. His straight sets battering of Roger Federer on Centre Court in front of a partizan, strictly non-traditional SW19 crowd sprinkled the magic dust on what was to follow.

The match wasn’t the most epic in terms of quality with a whole host of service breaks. What was special was how much both wanted it. \"I'm living a dream once again,\" Del Potro said after Murray overcame him in four sets. The Argentinian had shown immense courage to return from numerous wrist surgeries to make the most emotional return. It wasn’t about just the individual. It was the spectacle and the fact that it mattered. Feel the quality of the champions. Djokovic, Nadal, Murray (twice) and Alexander Zverev have won the men’s singles in the last five editions. Zverev had just passed up an opportunity to win his first slam in New York in 2020 having been two sets up against Dominic Thiem. The gold in Tokyo was more than just an emollient. \"I think, because you're not just playing for yourself, you're playing for everybody involved, everybody in Germany supporting me back at home, supporting all the athletes here. So, for me, the feelings that I have, and the feelings that I probably will have in these next few days, can't compare to anything else,” said the German.

It was not “an exhibition”, it was a real live chance to win a global event. Trophies matter even without the points and dollars. Monica Puig had no expectations when she became one of the most leftfield winners in 2016, defeating Angelique Kerber. “When people ask if you could have a Grand Slam or an Olympic medal, I would always choose the Olympic medal. What it meant for my country and what it means to me. There’s four Grand Slams a year, and there’s one Olympics every four years. You have something that’s very rare,” the Puerto Rican told the WTA website. Some might balk at Djokovic’s desire to win the gold after previous comments that he had completed the whole set of prizes. The truth is that the Olympic Spirit is alive and well.

Donalds told Stephanopoulos that Trump was only “responding to a question” and called the scandal a “phony controversy.” “If we’re going to be accurate, when Kamala Harris went into the United States Senate, it was AP that said she was the first Indian-American United States senator. It was actually played up a lot when she came into the Senate. Now she’s running nationally, obviously the campaign has shifted—they’re talking much more about her father’s heritage and her Black identity. It doesn’t really matter,” Donalds said, before trying to shift the conversation to the Trump campaign’s typical lines of attack against the vice president—her role as the “border czar,” the Biden administration’s foreign policy, and rising inflation. But Stephanopoulos repeatedly dogged the Florida congressman about repeating Trump’s questioning over her racial identity. “You just repeated the slur again. If it doesn’t matter, why do you all keep questioning her identity? She’s always identified as a Black woman, she’s biracial. She has a Jamaican father and Indian mother, she’s always identified as both. Why are you questioning that?” In response, Donalds claimed that Harris’ racial identity was “a conversation throughout social media right now” and told Stephanopoulos “lots of people are trying to figure this out. But that’s a side issue, not the main issue. Stephanopoulos cut the Florida congressman off before he could redirect the conversation. “You just did it again! Why do you insist on questioning her racial identity?” Donalds then claimed that Trump only “brought it up” at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, while the original Associated Press story questioned her racial identity. “AP is the one that wrote the headline when she first came in to the United States Senate. It didn’t talk about her being black, it talked about her being the first Indian-American senator.” AP published a short news brief immediately after Harris won the election in 2016. The news agency quickly followed the brief up with a longer story, which refers to her biracial identity in the second sentence. “Now you’re saying that AP is the one that slurred Kamala Harris? Cause those are the facts. You can go to the internet and look at the clips George if you want to,” Donalds told the ABC host. “AP did not say that Kamala Harris is not Black,” Stephanopoulos said before moving on. “She is biracial. She is Indian, she is Black. You continue to repeat the slur, I don’t understand why you and the president do it, but it’s clear that you’re not going to say that it’s wrong.

Harris, 59, is officially in the ‘Baby Boomer’ generation, even though she’s trying to mask her age and fit in with younger generations, including Gen Zers born after 1997. ‘Sorry, she’s a boomer. Rules are rules, slackers,’ wrote Washingtonian journalist Andrew Beaujon in 2020. ‘Kamala Harris was born October 20, 1964. It’s the very tail end of the Baby Boomer generation.’ Harris was recently was mocked after she was repeatedly filmed with a smartphone on speaker mode, holding it up to her ear, despite the audio blaring from the device during calls with former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, and with the widow of Alexei Navalny. It’s the kind of activity that screams ‘boomer,’ even as the vice president tries to emphasize her youthful persona as she runs her own campaign for president. Last fall, Harris launched a tour of American colleges, in an effort to shift her brand away from the aging President Joe Biden and toward Generation Z. ‘I love Gen Z,’ she said repeatedly as she made her way across the country. ‘Let me just tell you, I love Gen Z. I don’t know, something about — I love Gen Z,’ she said with a laugh at an event in July. ‘So, okay, for the older adults, this is going to be a humbling thing I’m about to share with you. If someone is 18 years old today, they were born in 2005. Oh, yeah, check that out. Think about that for a minute.’ At another event, she urged adults to have patience with their Gen-Z kids. ‘I love Gen Z. I really do. I — you know, I know it’s complicated if you have a Gen Z member in your family. But they’re so spectacular,’ she said during another event. Although she typically wears professional pantsuits a Vice President, Harris frequently talks about her love of Chuck Taylor tennis shoes and casual clothing when she’s not on the job on when she ran her first campaign. ‘I have a whole collection of Chuck Taylors: a black leather pair, a white pair, I have the kind that don’t lace, the kind that do lace, the kind I wear in the hot weather, the kind I wear in the cold weather, and the platform kind for when I’m wearing a pantsuit,’ she once explained to the Cut. As a presidential candidate, Harris frequently danced with young people, with marching bands, and even on her campaign stage as she expressed her love of music and dancing. She famously was caught on camera breaking it down to the song Q-Tip’s ‘Vivrant Thing’ in September when she hosted a party celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop at the vice president’s residence. But even Harris admitted that despite her love of watching shows with her husband Doug she struggles to stay awake sometime. ‘We will sit on the couch in front of the TV with the switcher, for like 45 minutes debating which Netflix show we start streaming, and we weigh the pros and the cons of each and by the time we’re done we are ready to go for bed,’ she said. She also likes to brag about her language being ‘uncensored’ despite her office. ‘I am sure I’m the first Vice President to in front of the press to use the word ‘uterus,’ and then I didn’t stop there either, I said the f-word, I said fibroids,’ she said laughing. ‘I’m pretty sure, I mean we could do a fact check but I’m pretty sure no other Vice President has done that in public.’ Harris repeatedly used the actual f-word on stage, in an attempt to click with young people struggling to get ahead. ‘Sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open, and sometimes they won’t— and then you need to kick that f***ing door down,’ Harris said during a roundtable discussion with comedian Jimmy O. Yang in May. Harris made headlines after she joked about smoking pot in college and also her about love of ‘Snoop Dogg’, ‘Tupac’ and ‘Cardi B,’ in college with the crew at the Breakfast Club radio show. ‘I did inhale. It was a long time ago,’ she said, endorsing the legalization of marijuana. ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy. We need more joy in the world,’ she argued. Harris was ridiculed after she recorded an appearance with host Taraji P. Henson, where she made reference to popular rap songs for the July 2024 BET award show. ‘Yeah girl, I’m out here in these streets. And let me tell you, you’re right, Taraji. There is so much at stake in this moment. The majority of us believe in freedom and equality. But these extremists, as they say, they not like us,’ Harris said, referring to Kendrick Lamar song ‘Not Like Us.’ During the campaign trail, Harris frequently referred to her love of Marvel movies, and even compared her opponent Donald Trump to the Marvel villain Thanos. When asked about which Marvel superhero she would like to be she hesitated but ultimately chose the character Shuri from the Black Panther. Harris also once performed the Wakanda salute on television, announcing her run for ‘Senate’ of the fictional African nation as a joke with the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. As she runs for president again, Harris has toned down some of the Millennial-themed attempts to go viral. But her campaign still appears eager to recruit the boomer generation as she tries to rally the Democratic party. ‘It’s happening!!’ wrote Harris’ husband’s ex-wife Kerstin Emhoff on social media, sharing details of a campaign event with ‘Seniors for Harris.’ ‘Barb and Mike are excited to meet the Boomers!’ she concluded.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSince her first failed campaign for president, Vice President Kamala Harris has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Attempting to Connect with a Younger Audience: Kamala Harris, 59, Seeks to Relate to Gen Z and Youth Despite Age Gap first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/attempting-to-connect-with-a-younger-audience-kamala-harris-59-seeks-to-relate-to-gen-z-and-youth-despite-age-gap/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/02/23/87884097-13703821-U_S_Vice_President_Kamala_Harris_speaks_on_the_phone_with_former-a-9_1722638215976.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:32:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.326},{"id":253372966,"title":"Chris Murphy says 2024 election shows ‘a contrast’ between Harris and Trump","text":"Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) argued the 2024 presidential election, which is expected to be between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, will showcase “a contrast” to voters. Murphy was asked about how Harris’s campaign has changed her position on previously-held views, such as no longer wanting to ban fracking and wanting additional funding for border security. The Connecticut senator contended that the vice president “has always been for border security” and that this is part of the contrast voters can expect at the polls come November. “Today, border crossings are lower at the southwest border than they were at the end of the Trump presidency,” Murphy said on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream. “There is a contrast between Democrats, Kamala Harris who’s serious about border security, and Republicans, who are not.” Murphy also said that democracy is about the majority of residents voting for a policy, and predicted that Harris will campaign on several reforms “to make democracy work better.” He argued this would compare well against Trump at the election, saying that the Republican nominee has “promised on day one to become a dictator.” The senator’s claim on Trump relates to comments the former president made last year, during which he said he would not be a dictator “except for day one.” Trump also vowed to secure the border and increase oil drilling during his interview should he become president again. In the wake of the interview, Trump waived off his dictator comment, claiming that it was made “in jest.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Since President Joe Biden bowed out of his 2024 reelection bid, many high-profile Democrats have endorsed Harris as his replacement for the candidacy, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Biden himself. Murphy stated last month that these endorsements were not pre-organized and that none of them were aware of Biden dropping out until he announced it. Recent polling data found that Harris and Trump are statistically tied nationally and across the collective battleground states, with Harris having a 1-point edge nationally. Trump previously enjoyed a 5-point national head-to-head lead when the data was conducted with Biden before he dropped out.","summary":"Sen.

The multi-Grammy winner, 42, has already given the vice president permission to use her songs in her presidential campaign, but is set to go far further by donating to and endorsing Harris because she believes the ‘stakes are too high’ to remain silent. ‘Beyoncé has cleared her schedule to attend a Kamala Harris fundraiser,’ an insider claimed to DailyMail.com. The source said the singer had deliberately taken a step back from politics after hosting a fundraising campaign with her husband Jay-Z for Barack Obama in 2012. ‘Beyoncé decided to step back in after people close to her showed her Project 25.’ The radical Project 2025 plan was developed by allies and former officials as a blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration. However, Trump and his campaign have worked to distance themselves from Project 2025, with the former president going so far as to call some of the proposals ‘extreme’. DailyMail.com has contacted representatives of Beyoncé and Kamala Harris for comment. The source added that Beyoncé and Harris first met when Obama was campaigning in 2008, ‘but became close friends’ during the Joe Biden election. However, the pair have never been publicly seen together to date. In 2020, Beyoncé made a smaller show of support for Biden and Harris a day before the presidential election as she rocked a Biden-Harris face mask in an Instagram post. Now, the singer is ready to officially add her star power to Harris’ ongoing campaign – which began after Biden, 81, dropped out of the race for the White House on July 19. ‘She feels the stakes are too high and believes in Kamala’s vision for America,’ the insider stated, adding that the singer is even set to donate funds towards the campaign. The source explained: ‘She has set aside $4 million dollars to donate to the campaign, with plans to donate more if she sees the need to.’ Indeed, Beyoncé has already shown her support for Harris by authorizing the Vice President to use her song Freedom as the anthem for her campaign trail. The hitmaker is known to maintain strict clearance guidelines when it comes to her music, but was quick to grant Harris permission for the song, a source close to the Democrat’s campaign told CNN. It was claimed that the campaign team asked for consent just hours before Harris made her debut at her election headquarters. The move came after Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, revealed her excitement for a Harris run, calling her ‘new, youthful, sharp’ in an Instagram post. Knowles, alongside a photo of her with Harris, wrote: ‘You asked for it and our President Biden did what was best for the country! ‘Putting personal Ego, power and fame aside. That is the definition of a great leader. Thank you, President Biden for your service and your leadership. Go Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Let’s Go’. Over the years, Harris has been open about being a fan of Beyoncé and even accepted two tickets to enjoy the singer’s Renaissance concert last year – which were valued at $1,655.92. The Vice President and her husband Doug Emhoff went to the concert at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland in August 2023. She marked the occasion with an Instagram that read: ‘To the one of one, the number one, the only one, Beyoncé, thank you for a fun date night.’ So far, Harris has been publicly supported by a slew of famous names including Cardi B, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Legend, Cher, Barbra Streisand, Katy Perry, Spike Lee, Questlove, and Demi Lovato.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBeyoncé is set to make a sharp U-turn after years of political caution&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Beyoncé considering surprising change in her political stance after allowing Kamala Harris to use her music first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/beyonce-considering-surprising-change-in-her-political-stance-after-allowing-kamala-harris-to-use-her-music/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Beyonce-planning-shock-political-U-turn-after-letting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:24:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":253374342,"title":"Chris Christie Credits Donald Trump for Potential Democratic VP: He ‘Created Josh Shapiro’ | Video","text":"The GOP only has Donald Trump to blame if Kamala Harris chooses Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate, Chris Christie told George Stephanopoulos and Donna Brazile on Sunday’s “This Week.” “And I’ll tell you this, if she picks Shapiro on Tuesday, Donald Trump created Josh Shapiro,” Christie began. “He endorsed [Doug] Mastriano, the weakest Republican candidate in that field,” he continued, explaining the 2022 campaign for governor in Pennsylvania. “What it allowed Josh Shapiro to do was instead of playing to his base to try to win a narrow election, he saw an opportunity for a coalition-building election. And that’s what he did.” Shapiro is on the shortlist of potential vice presidential picks for Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as a strong candidate due to his immense popularity in Pennsylvania, a key tipping point state in the 2024 presidential election. “So now [Shapiro’s] seen as a coalition builder because he did it,” Christie added. “But the only reason he could do it is because Trump made another ridiculously stupid endorsement by endorsing Mastriano, who was a flawed, weak, bad candidate.” Christie also addressed the former president’s claim that he will pardon those who were convicted of assaulting police officers during the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. “Trump’s been consistent, he says he’s going to pardon them, and what people need to understand about Donald Trump is what I’ve learned over 22 years,” Christie said. “When he says something, he’s going to do it. And so if he says he’s going to pardon those folks, if he’s elected, you could take to the bank that he will.” Christie’s comments contradicted those of Rep. Byron Donalds, who spoke with Stephanopoulos just before his conversation with Christie. Donalds insisted Trump would instead review the charges against the convicted on a case-by-case basis. Brazile commented on the racism inherent in Trump’s questioning of Harris’ racial identity earlier this week, as Donalds had also defended. The move is from “the playbook of the late ’60s and the ’70s,” she said, and reminiscent of Trump’s own questioning of President Barack Obama’s place of birth in 2011. “America is tired of this playbook,” she continued. “We’re tired of questioning people’s background simply because they don’t look like something or someone else. Donald Trump wants to be the arbitrator of who is an American, and he’s not. Is this strategy or impulse? Impulse.” You can watch the George Stephanopoulos interview on ABC’s “This Week” with Chris Christie and Donna Brazile in the video above.","summary":"New Jersey’s former governor says Trump’s \"ridiculously stupid endorsement\" of a weak Republican let Pennsylvania’s Shapiro build his coalition\n\n\nThe post Chris Christie Credits Donald Trump for Potential Democratic VP: He ‘Created Josh Shapiro’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/chris-christie-donald-trump-created-josh-shapiro/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chris-christie-shapiro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 22:20:56","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.626},{"id":253373388,"title":"Trump embraces MAGA activist at Atlanta rally who repeats his offensive claims about Harris’ heritage","text":"Donald Trump embraced conservative activist Michaelah Montgomery on stage at his Georgia rally before awkwardly quipping that he considered “never going back home to the First Lady”, when they first met at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in April. Montgomery spoke on stage on Saturday evening at a rally for the former president in the battleground state. She was featured in a video in April where she hugged Trump in the fast food restaurant, where he bought food for his supporters. Trump later took the stage and called Montgomery back up the stage as he recalled walking into the Atlanta Chick-fil-A in April, where she was behind the counter. Trump recalled Montgomery saying: “It’s president Trump. You saved my college.” “And I said: ‘How the hell do you know that?’” Trump added. He then said “this one,” pointing to Montgomery, is “so smart so sharp. She grabbed me she gave me a kiss. I said: ‘I think I’m never going back home to the First Lady!’” Montgomery then cut in, jokingly: “Shh, you were supposed to keep that quiet!” “For the average politician that’s death. For me, I don’t care,” Trump noted. Melania Trump has been notably absent from the campaign trail, although she did attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last month. The former first lady wrote a touching tribute to Trump after he survived the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania last month. Before the attack, the Slovenian former model reportedly cut a deal with her husband: if he takes back the White House in November, she would not have to be constantly on first lady duty. Earlier at the Atlanta rally on Saturday, Montgomery defended Trump over the offensive remarks he made earlier this week about Kamala Harris’ racial background. “A few days ago president Trump said he didn’t know vice president Harris was a Black woman,” Montgomery said. “I’m trying to figure out what all the outrage is about because she’s only Black when it’s time to get elected.” Last week, Trump claimed at a conference of Black journalists that Harris “happened to turn Black” only recently, to groans from the audience. The former president then said: “Is she Indian or is she Black?” Harris was born in California. Her father, Donald Harris, was born in Jamaica and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. Trump’s latest offensive remarks on race come as the former president has insisted in recent weeks that he and his running mate JD Vance are not “the weird ones” - despite Democratic messaging to the contrary.

The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris’ team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said. The Harris campaign shared the details of the program first with The Associated Press before the official announcement. Her team is trying to create “a permission structure” for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The effort will rely heavily on Republican-to-Republican voter contact, with the belief that the best way to get a Republican to vote for Harris is to hear directly from another Republican making the same choice. Trump’s “extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values” and will vote against him again in November, said Harris’ national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford. He said the campaign would be “showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.” Weatherford is a onetime chief of staff to former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who had endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket before President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Kinzinger is backing Harris once more as part of the launch. “As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,” he said in a statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House.” Kinzinger developed a national profile as one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The committee highlighted a number of Trump’s transgressions before and during the deadly attack as Congress tried to certify the results of the 2020 election that Biden won over Trump. Trump has done little to try to win over moderate Republican voters and on Saturday criticized anew Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rebuffed Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the battleground state. Last month, when Biden was still at the top of the ticket, the campaign went out with an ad highlighting former Trump staffers’ criticism of their onetime boss. A separate ad highlighted Trump’s often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as “birdbrain” and suggestion that “she’s not presidential timber.” Hundreds of thousands of registered Republicans voted in primaries for Haley even after she ended her bid for the 2024 Republican nomination and as Trump trounced her in almost every contest. Haley in May announced she would vote for Trump and appeared at last month’s Republican National Convention. The Harris campaign’s effort includes former Govs. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and 16 former Republican members of Congress, including Kinzinger and Reps. Joe Walsh of Illinois and Susan Molinari of New York. All have been notable critics of Trump in the past. Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham is also endorsing Harris. “I might not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on everything, but I know that she will fight for our freedom, protect our democracy and represent America with honor and dignity on the world stage,” Grisham said in a statement.

Gorsuch has received a $500,000 advance for the book, according to his annual financial disclosure reports. In the interview, Gorsuch refused to be drawn into discussions about term limits or an enforceable code of ethics for the justices, both recently proposed by President Joe Biden at a time of diminished public trust in the court. Justice Elena Kagan, speaking a couple of days before Biden, separately said the court’s ethics code, adopted by the justices last November, should have a means of enforcement. But Gorsuch did talk about the importance of judicial independence. “I’m not saying that there aren’t ways to improve what we have. I’m simply saying that we’ve been given something very special. It’s the envy of the world, the United States judiciary,” he said. The 56-year-old justice was the first of three Supreme Court nominees of then-President Donald Trump, and they have combined to entrench a conservative majority that has overturned Roe v. Wade, ended affirmative action in college admissions, expanded gun rights and clipped environmental regulations aimed at climate change, as well as air and water pollution more generally. A month ago, the Supreme Court completed a term in which Gorsuch and the court’s five other conservative justices delivered sharp rebukes to the administrative state in three major cases, including the decision that overturned the 40-year-old Chevron decision that had made it more likely that courts would sustain regulations. The court’s three liberal justices dissented each time. Gorsuch also was in the majority in ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution in a decision that indefinitely delayed the election interference case against Trump. What’s more, the justices made it harder to use a federal obstruction charge against people who were part of the mob that violently attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an effort to overturn Trump’s defeat by Biden in the 2020 election. Gorsuch defended the immunity ruling as necessary to prevent presidents from being hampered while in office by threats of prosecution once they leave. The court had to wrestle with an unprecedented situation, he said. “Here we have, for the first time in our history, one presidential administration bringing criminal charges against a prior president. It’s a grave question, right? Grave implications,” Gorsuch said. But in the book, co-authored by a former law clerk, Janie Nitze, Gorusch largely sets those big issues aside and turns his focus to a fisherman, a magician, Amish farmers, immigrants, a hair braider and others who risked jail time, large fines, deportation and other hardships over unyielding rules. In 18 years as a judge, including the past seven on the Supreme Court, Gorsuch said, “There were just so many cases that came to me in which I saw ordinary Americans, just everyday, regular people trying to go about their lives, not trying to hurt anybody or do anything wrong and just getting whacked, unexpectedly, by some legal rule they didn’t know about.” The problem, he said, is that there has been an explosion of laws and regulations, at both the federal and state levels. The sheer volume of Congress’ output for the past decade is overwhelming, he said, averaging 344 pieces of legislation totaling 2 million to 3 million words a year. One vignette involves John Yates, a Florida fisherman who was convicted of getting rid of some undersized grouper under a federal law originally aimed at the accounting industry and the destruction of evidence in the Enron scandal. Yates’ case went all the way to the Supreme Court, where he won by a single vote. “I wanted to tell the story of people whose lives were affected,” Gorsuch said. The book expands on a theme that has run through Gorsuch’s opinions over the years, from his criticism of the Chevron decision back when he served on a federal appeals court in Denver to his statement in May 2023 in which he called emergency measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis that killed more than 1 million Americans perhaps “the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.” While Gorsuch has voted with the other conservative justices in most of the court’s momentous cases, he also has joined with the liberals in notable cases, including those in which he wrote the opinion in 2020 that expanded protections against workplace discrimination to LGBTQ people. Gorsuch also has sided with the liberal justices in all the court’s cases involving Native Americans since he joined the court. Immigration, especially when people fighting deportation have complained they were given inadequate notice about hearings, is another area where he has typically broken with his conservative colleagues. Gorsuch recently returned from a summer teaching gig in Porto, Portugal, for the George Mason University law school. Last year, he spent two weeks in Lisbon, Portugal, with the same program for which he was paid nearly $30,000, plus meals, lodging and travel. He will travel to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, later this week to talk about the new book. The day he met with AP, he said, was the first time in weeks that he put on a tie. He wore a dark blue suit, cowboy boots and a Western-style belt. He seemed at ease, offering chocolate chip cookies and coffee to visitors and joking with a reporter who talked about an upcoming trip to the New Jersey shore. “Go fly some flags up there,” Gorsuch said, a reference to the controversy over flags, similar to those carried by Jan. 6 rioters, that were flown at homes owned by Justice Samuel Alito and his wife. Gorsuch is not the only justice rolling out a book this summer. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s memoir, “Lovely One,” will be published next month.","summary":"“Here we have, for the first time in our history, one presidential administration bringing criminal charges against a prior president.

Kennedy Jr. Explains How He Secretly Dumped a Dead Bear Cub in Central Park | Video","text":"In a bizarre story shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, he explained how he took a dead bear cub and dumped it in Central Park as a prank aimed at getting people to believe a bicycle had hit it and caused the animal’s death. He said that he was sharing the 2014 story because the New Yorker’s fact-checkers called him and indicated they were doing a story on the event. The three-minute video’s social media caption reads, “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, @NewYorker…” It’s unclear what there would be to spin about the story that the independent presidential candidate tells, but watch the New Yorker for more. Sitting at a kitchen table, he laid the story out for actress and comedian Roseanne Barr, who he was hanging out with for some reason. “I was taking a group of people falconing up in Goshen, New York, up in the Hudson Valley, and I was supposed to meet them there at like maybe 8 or 9,” Kennedy began. “I was driving up maybe, you know, really early, like 7, and then a woman in a van in front of me hit a bear and killed it. A young bear.” “So I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van, because I was going to skin the bear,” Kennedy said. “And it was very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator. And you can do that in New York state — you can get a bear tag for a roadkill bear.” The politician and activist continued his strange tale, adding, “And so then we went hawking and I had the bear in my car. And then we had a really good day, and we went late. We were catching a lot of game, and the people really loved it, so we stayed late. And instead of going back to my home in Westchester, I had to go right to the city, because there was a dinner at Peter Luger’s Steak House.” “And at the end of the dinner, it went late, and I realized I couldn’t go home — I had to go to the airport.” That’s when he had a realization: “And the bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car, because, well, that would have been bad.” Barr agrees at this point. Kennedy clearly had the good sense to not leave a dead bear in his car for a prolonged period of time while he traveled. “So then I thought, you know, at that time — this was the little bit of the redneck in me. There’d been a series of bicycle accidents in New York, they had just put in the bike lanes,” Kennedy ominously continued .”And some people, a couple of people had gotten killed, and it was every day, and people had been badly injured. Every day, it was in the press.” “And so I thought — I wasn’t drinking, of course, but people were drinking with me who thought this was a good idea,” he continued. Kennedy has long been sober after overcoming a 14-year heroin addiction when he was young, but apparently still thought it was a great idea to take advice from people drinking around him. “And I said, I had an old bike in my car that somebody had asked me to get rid of, and I said, ‘Let’s go put the bear in the Central Park, and we’ll make it look like he got hit by a bike’ — it would be fun, funny for people.” “So everybody thought, ‘That’s a great idea,’ so we went and did that,” Kennedy said, continuing his description of the kind of idea that people think is genius while they’re drunk. “And we thought it would be amusing for whoever found it or something.” “The next day, it was like, it was on every television station. It was the front page of every paper,” Kennedy added. Oops. “And I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and there were 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying over it and I was like, oh my God. What did I do?” “And then there were some people on TV in tie-back suits with gloves on, lifting up the bike, and they were saying they were going to take this up to Albany to get it fingerprinted.” A smiling Barr added, “uh oh” and chuckled as he continued. “And I was worried, because my prints were all over that bike,” Kennedy said. He did not say whether or not he ever came forward to authorities, but the implication was that he did not. “And luckily the story died down after a while, and it stayed dead for a decade,” Kennedy added. “And the New Yorker somehow found out about it and they’re going to do a big article on me, and that’s one of the articles. So they asked me, the fact-checkers… and, you know, it’s going to be a bad story.” It was unclear from his tone if he meant that the story would be bad journalistically, bad for Kennedy or something else. The clip concludes as Barr delivers another “uh oh” and laughs again as someone in the background notes, “I think it’s a great story, personally.” The video then closes with an iris out film effect, narrowing down like the end of a “Looney Tunes” cartoon. Which feels vaguely appropriate for the grim yet cartoonish story. He was correct that it was widely covered when it happened, including on CNN. You can watch the network’s anchors noting that authorities had figured out that someone had brought the dead bear and left it there, as there had been no bears in the park “for a long, long time. It seems as if someone brought the thing there, which is really sad.” While polling in the low double digits behind former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, Kennedy’s poll numbers have collapsed since Biden dropped out of the race, with the member of the famed political clan seeming to have little chance of making a significant impact on the 2024 presidential race.","summary":"Deciding to pull a prank back in 2014, he tells Roseanne that he left the animal with an old bike to make it look like a bicyclist had killed the young creature\n\n\nThe post Robert F.

However, MONEYED came to me after I thought about the theme clue more carefully. I then spotted WEALTHY just above that. Just above those, I saw \"Rich,\" which was not a theme word, but I thought it might be part of the spangram. The double \"f\" was a bit of a giveaway for AFFLUENT. OPULENT in the bottom left then made the spangram clearer. That left PROSPEROUS for the win. I didn’t use any hints and the spangram was the fifth theme word I found.

Gorsuch also has sided with the liberal justices in all the court’s cases involving Native Americans since he joined the court. Immigration, especially when people fighting deportation have complained they were given inadequate notice about hearings, is another area where he has typically broken with his conservative colleagues. Gorsuch recently returned from a summer teaching gig in Porto, Portugal, for the George Mason University law school. Last year, he spent two weeks in Lisbon, Portugal, with the same program for which he was paid nearly $30,000, plus meals, lodging and travel. He will travel to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, later this week to talk about the new book. The day he met with AP, he said, was the first time in weeks that he put on a tie. He wore a dark blue suit, cowboy boots and a Western-style belt. He seemed at ease, offering chocolate chip cookies and coffee to visitors and joking with a reporter who talked about an upcoming trip to the New Jersey shore. “Go fly some flags up there,” Gorsuch said, a reference to the controversy over flags, similar to those carried by Jan. 6 rioters, that were flown at homes owned by Justice Samuel Alito and his wife. Gorsuch is not the only justice rolling out a book this summer. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's memoir, “Lovely One,” will be published next month. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The attack required surgeons to remove part of his skull to save his life. Pelosi mentioned she and her husband have not discussed the incident, with doctors advising against revisiting the traumatic experience. The assailant had been targeting her, and Pelosi has expressed feelings of guilt about the event. In her book \"The Art of Power,\" she recalls her daughter suggesting she give up her political career following the attack, but Pelosi reflects on her family’s blame towards certain elements of the Republican Party for demonizing her over the years, reported CBS News.\"My husband and I have never talked about this,\" Pelosi said. \"The doctors have supported that, because they don't want him to revisit it.\" \"He was looking for me,\" she added. \"Imagine the guilt of all of that – it's just a horrible thing.\"Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, urged her mother to leave public life after the attack. Pelosi reflects on this in her book and discusses the family's perspective on who is to blame. \"Well, I blame me. I mean, not blame me. I was the target. My family, frankly, blames certain elements of the Republican Party who had been demonizing me for about 20 years, every election and the rest – cloven feet, horns on the head, a horrible person, in flames, a devil, and all of that. The sad thing about my husband's assault was that they just made a joke of it. They thought it was funny. And people laughed. So, [Trump] was an instigator of violence and then made light of it.\"In the interview with CBS News Correspondent, Pelosi addressed rumors about pressuring President Joe Biden to drop out of his re-election campaign. She denied leading any such effort, expressing confidence in Biden’s ability to make the right decision.\"Well, I've never shared any conversations with a President of the United States publicly, no,\" Pelosi replied. \"Well, he knows that I love him very much,\" she said when asked if Biden was furious at her. \"No, I wasn't a leader of any pressure party. Well, let me say things that I didn't do. I didn't call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, 'I never called anybody.' What I'm saying is, I had confidence that the president would make the proper choice for our country, whatever that would be, and I said that. 'Whatever that is, we'll go with.'\"When asked about Biden’s performance, Pelosi emphasized the importance of a more vigorous campaign and highlighted his accomplishments, such as leading the Nato Summit. \"My whole point was, whatever he decides, but we have to have a more aggressive campaign.\" \"He was in a good place to make whatever decision – the top of his game,\" Pelosi said. \"Such a consequential President of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of President of the United States.\"Pelosi's legacy as a leader in Congress spans 20 years, and she looks back on pivotal moments in her new book, \"The Art of Power\". \"There's certain episodes of our history that I played a major role in. So, I wanted to write about that just to show my side of it, what happened in the room where it happened, where I was,\" she said.Pelosi recounted pivotal events such as the financial bailout, Covid relief, the Affordable Care Act, and the attack on the Capitol on January 6. She vividly remembers hearing the mob targeting her during the insurrection and saying, \"Nancy, we're coming for you, b****.\"\"It was an insurrection instigated by the President of the United States. He now tries to disassociate himself from it, blaming it on me and everybody else. But that's the way he is. This was instigated by him,\" said Pelosi.She also recalled her reaction to Trump's statement about marching to the Capitol, expressing her willingness to confront him. \"If he comes, I'm gonna punch him out for trespassing on the Capitol grounds. I'm gonna punch him out, and I'm gonna go to jail, and I'm going to be happy.\" \"I knew that I would have to pay a price, to go to jail,\" Pelosi said, \"but I would be happy to do that.\"Pelosi remains determined to prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House, considering him a motivator for Democratic organization and fundraising. \"He should never set foot again in the White House – never should have, and shouldn't again.\"When asked about Trump’s choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, Pelosi responded with amusement. \"I think it was a great choice!\"Pelosi also offered advice to Kamala Harris on how to handle the campaign against Trump. She said, \"Just be yourself. It's the same advice I give to women – be yourself.\" She then dismissed attempts to portray Harris negatively, suggesting a focus on everyday issues. \"The opposition – the Trump people and he and JD Vance – are trying to portray Kamala Harris as being 'weird.' 'She's a radical, left-wing, San Francisco crazy lady. She's weird and she's nuts.'\" \"Well, the thing is, there's no question that they understand I make people laugh at them. And that's what they don't like, is to be laughed at. On the other hand, what I have always said about Trump and now – I don't know that much about Vance, but what we do know is menacing.\" \"So, what should Harris say? Just talk about kitchen-table issues – ignore him,\" said Pelosi.Though no longer in House leadership, Pelosi is running for re-election to her Congressional seat from San Francisco. On being asked if she had ever been asked to run for President, Pelosi said, \"I haven't been asked, but I was encouraged to put my name in there sometime for vice president. I said, 'Why would I want to be vice president?' I'm a legislator. I love legislating. People have to understand it's serious work. I mean, you really have to listen. What is the judgment you bring as to what priorities can prevail? What is your strategy to get it done? It's constant. It's constant. And it's being respectful of all kinds of points of view – inside maneuvering, outside mobilization. It's great. I love being a legislator.\"","summary":"Nancy Pelosi discussed the traumatic attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, in which he was severely injured.

Plenty of people are embracing a sideline venture. And beyond the money, it delivers tons of benefits from self-esteem to skill development and more. Interestingly, Gen Z is the generation most likely to have a side hustle, but all generations are running their own ventures beyond their regular jobs. And it’s a great time to do so. The uncertainty of the economy, declining loyalty from some companies and the tech environment that connects buyers with sellers all make this a perfect time for your side hustle. As you’re considering a side hustle, there are important criteria for success—and benefits to embrace as well. Side Hustles Are Popular and Lucrative Lots of people are making side hustles happen, with 48% of Gen Z, 44% of Millennials, 33% of Gen X and 23% of Boomers getting involved, according to a survey by Bankrate. People often ask, “Is it a good time to start a side hustle?” Yes. In fact, most people have started their side hustles rather recently. The majority of Gen Zs have started their side hustle either within the last year or over the last year or two. Among all other generations, most people have gotten started in the last year or two, based on the Bankrate data. MORE FOR YOU ‘Vicious Spiral’ Alert Issued After Donald Trump Proposed A ‘Massive,’ Radical Plan To Pay Off $35 Trillion Of U.S. National Debt Apple iPhone 16 Pro To Gain Most From Powerful Upgrade, New Leak Says Leak Reveals Crypto Is Braced For A Huge BlackRock And Wall Street ETF Earthquake After $60,000 Bitcoin Price Crash Of course another common question is, “How much money can I make with a side hustle?” and money is a primary reason people take on a side hustle. The average income across all generations is $891 per month, according to Bankrate. Creating Your Own Side Hustle How do you start a side hustle? These are the important criteria to consider, whether you’re just starting or continuing an effort you already have underway. Criteria #1 – Pursue a Side Hustle Based On Passion Be sure you choose a side hustle that energizes you. If you select work based on income alone, you’re likely to find the experience draining—especially when you’re working on the side after you’ve put in hours at your regular job. Instead, do what you love. According to a Gallup survey, 45% of people start their own venture to pursue their passion and 36% to make a difference. Initiate the work you find especially rewarding, meaningful or fun. If you love dogs, start a dog walking venture or a yard rental business for pooches to play and run at your place. If you love the environment, become a hiking guide for your places you know. Create a successful side hustle by doing what inspires you. Choose a side hustle that energizes you. getty Criteria #2 – Pursue a Side Hustle Based on Time The nature of a side hustle is that you must be able to make it happen while you’re also fully performing at your job. Be sure you select something that you can manage in terms of the time commitment, but also the hours that you’re available. If you start a tech support service but can’t help clients quickly enough because you’re required to travel on business, customers will get frustrated. On the other hand, if you start a business doing car detailing or boat cleaning and you can schedule jobs based on your availability, these could be a better fit. Criteria #3 – Pursue a Side Hustle Based on Market Knowledge You’re also wise to set yourself up for success based on your knowledge of a market or your interest in learning it. If you’ve always been close with your elderly neighbor or grandparent and understand seniors, the resources available and the unmet needs—doing senior care or companion time could be the perfect approach. Or if you know all the hot spots in your area, you could start a side hustle as a vacation planner for visitors. Criteria #4 – Pursue a Side Hustle Based on Scalability Another consideration for a side hustle is likelihood you could scale it up. If you’re testing the waters to go out on your own or building a base of business to parlay into a full-time endeavor, choose options that will scale. Often service businesses are good examples. If you’re providing coaching, perhaps you start doing this on evenings and weekends, and know you could potentially scale up to full time. Or offer financial planning support or travel consulting on the side, and then build to full time work as you move forward. When you see potential for your side hustle and have a vision for future growth, it will keep you energized and engaged. Criteria #5 – Pursue a Side Hustle Based on Integrity People often ask, “Are side hustles allowed by employers?” Of course it’s critical to have a side hustle that doesn’t compromise your job. Be sure you can still perform brilliantly at your job and that you’re not doing your side hustle during working hours. You wouldn’t want to erode your performance, commitment, credibility or integrity. In addition, ensure your side hustle doesn’t create a conflict of interest. For example, if you’re doing similar tasks for a rival business or using your company’s IP, these would be significant conflicts to avoid. In general, you’ll want to be transparent about the side hustle you’re doing in order to ensure an open trusting relationship with your employer. Choose a side hustle that is scalable. getty Side Hustles Provide Big Benefits If you’re wondering, “Is a side hustle worth it?”, know there are significant benefits you can get from a side hustle. Many people start a side hustle for the money, but there are plenty of other rewards as well. Benefit #1 - Be Your Own Boss With more control, independence and autonomy, you tend to experience greater happiness. In fact, 60% of people say they want to start their own business because they want to be their own boss, according to the survey from Gallup. Running a side hustle gives you the opportunity to make your own choices and do things your way. Benefit #2 - Learn New Skills and Take Smart Risks With a side hustle, you can learn new skills and start to take some risks as a budding entrepreneur. Because you have a job that can help pay expenses, side hustles can be an opportunity to spread your wings. Perhaps you start a side business as a personal trainer or a dog groomer on the weekends. You can test the market, build your skills and see if you would want to do that kind of work longer term. Benefit #3 - Develop Esteem, Ambition and Work Ethic Side hustles are also a great way to develop your self-esteem, ambition and work ethic. When the effort you make results in benefits that are all yours, it can be tremendously rewarding. And the responsibility and the demands can also reinforce your capabilities in taking ownership, following through and working hard. All of these are valuable in life, and can set you apart in organizations where employers are trying to avoid quiet quitting. Benefit #4 - Develop Your Network and Your Brand Having a strong network and positive relationships paves the way for future opportunities, and solid connections with others are also correlated with joy and fulfillment. With a side hustle, you’ll interact with lots of people and create a strong brand and network along the way—and these are important currency for anything you want to do in the future. Benefit #5 - Create Happiness Side hustles are also a great way to create happiness in your work. For Gen Zs especially, work may not be totally fulfilling, because you’re just starting out and building toward roles that will be more challenging and exciting in the future. But for any generation, if work isn’t ideal, you can pour yourself into something that energizes you and feeds your passion. Perhaps you love real estate, but your job in HR doesn’t give you the chance to do this kind of work. A side hustle flipping houses could be a great opportunity. Or perhaps your job in accounting doesn’t provide the chance for a lot of entrepreneurial expression, but you can start a venture buying and selling Legos online. Know When To Quit a Side Hustle In addition to loving your side hustle for all its benefits and the rewards it delivers, also remind yourself that you can stop anytime—and give consideration to a healthy exit when the time is right. Perhaps you’ve loved jewelry making, but then your job becomes more stressful or demanding. You can choose not to continue—so you’ll have more free time on the weekends. Or maybe you’ve enjoyed tutoring students, but then you have children of your own and just don’t have the same time available—so you stop. Your interests may change and the time you have will also shift as life moves on. There’s no shame in stopping a side hustle or having it evolve, and in fact that’s one of the great things about them—the flexibility to go all in, to remove yourself or to change it up when the time is right as well. Embrace the Side Hustle Opportunity Overall, this is a great time for a side hustle, and there are so many options. Consider the ventures mentioned in this article: dog walking, dog yard rentals, tech support, car detailing, boat cleaning, senior care, senior companion time, vacation planning, coaching, financial planning, travel consulting, personal training, dog grooming, real estate development, buying and selling online, jewelry making or tutoring. With a side hustle, you can enjoy a tons of rewards—from the income and the esteem to the opportunity to build your skills and your relationships. Success will come from being curious, committed and engaged when you choose to do something that energizes you. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

Tim Walz, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — at her Washington, D.C., residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate. Harris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Reuters was first to report. The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters. Harris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process. She met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday and is also meeting candidates virtually, the sources said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are the other candidates in contention for the job. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said. The choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris’ political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month. Her shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters. Harris’ decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests. Shapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. “There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,” said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. “Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.” His handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labor groups have also criticized Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate. Walz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump. At 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden’s departure over concerns about his age. Walz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and “supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair. Trust me.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Sen.

Dreyfus, who played the fictional vice president Selina Meyer on HBO’s Veep, told London’s Sunday Times this week that comparisons between her character and the current vice president are “inevitable.” But, she said, “If Selina had any advice for Kamala, she had best not take it. I think Kamala is so intelligent she wouldn’t take the call.” Though Veep ended in 2019, the show recently celebrated a resurgence in popularity following Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 election (in season three, Meyer became the first female president after the sitting POTUS stepped aside, which prompted many memes comparing the situations to real life). Louis-Dreyfus met Harris in 2022, where the actress said they talked about “How much Veep got right in terms of the culture of Washington, both behind the curtain and in front of the curtain,” adding that the now-Democratic nominee “was a big fan of the show.” Now preparing to support Harris in the 2024 general election, Louis-Dreyfus reflected on the similarities between the fictional character and the nonfictional potential future president. “Female candidates are more scrutinized,” she said. “That is the reality and we played into it and used it to our comedic advantage. There is an episode in which a character suggests Selina open a speech with ‘As a woman’ and she said, ‘I can’t identify as a woman! People can’t know that! Men hate that and women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.’ So we used that for a lot of fodder.” Louis-Dreyfus also spoke about her reaction to Donald Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, who recently came under fire for resurfaced comments in which he referred to Harris as a “childless cat lady.” Harris is stepmother to two adult children with her husband Doug Emhoff, and many on the left responded to Vance’s perspective with outrage. “I thought, You poor fucking idiot,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “These guys can’t help it. They can’t help it!” The actress also said she sees similarities between Vance and Veep character Jonah Ryan. “I think in the last few years the culture of politics has become much more venal,” she said. “So when we started we were pushing against reality, but now less so, certainly in terms of the nastiness of the communication.” Creator Armando Iannucci recently told The Hollywood Reporter he wasn’t sure if he could make a show like Veep today because “there are no rules anymore. If something happens, you just say, ‘Oh well, it didn’t happen.’ You just flip it around and just say, ‘No. The opposite happened.’ So, there are no rules.” Showrunner David Mandel echoed part of Iannucci’s comments when he told THR, “We need things to calm down and heal before Veep’s sort of horrible outlook on the world returns.

While betting markets are not definitive indicators of political outcomes, they often reflect insider information and public sentiment, making them a closely watched barometer in political circles.Other notable contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, whose odds have improved to +900, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at +1400. Both have been touted for their ability to win in traditionally Republican-leaning states, a quality that could prove valuable in a national campaign.The surge in odds for Shapiro and Walz has overshadowed other potential candidates who were once considered strong contenders. Former presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg now stands at +3500, while Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's odds have lengthened to +15000.These shifts in betting odds come on the heels of comments made by renowned election predictor Allan Lichtman, who recently identified Shapiro and Kelly as favorable choices for Harris. Lichtman, known for his accurate predictions in nine of the past ten presidential elections, emphasized the importance of selecting a running mate who could be trusted to assume the presidency if necessary.Lichtman's focus on Pennsylvania's importance in the electoral map aligns with Shapiro's strong position in the betting odds. Pennsylvania counts for 19 Electoral College votes and no Democratic candidate has won the election without the Keystone State since Harry Truman in 1948. Pennsylvania has voted Democrat in every election since 1992, save 2016, when Donald Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Separately, for the first time since launching her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is predicted to win the 2024 election, according to the online prediction market PredictIt. The platform shows Harris as the favorite to win in November, with shares of a Harris victory being sold for 52 cents, while shares for a Donald Trump victory are being sold at 50 cents.However, other betting platforms show that Trump maintains a lead over Harris. On the Polymarket betting platform, Trump has 55 percent odds compared to Harris' 43 percent, though his lead has shrunk since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.Recent polls have shown Harris reducing Trump's lead compared to when Biden was on the ticket. A Morning Consult poll conducted after Biden ended his campaign showed the former president only 2 points ahead of Harris, a narrower margin than the 4-point lead he held over Biden in a previous survey.","summary":"Shapiro and Walz emerge as frontrunners in betting markets on eve of Harris' VP pick, with dramatic shifts in odds reflecting last-minute speculation.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-josh-shapiro-tim-walz-vice-president-1934413","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442580/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:40:51","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":253371172,"title":"Musk-backed fund-raising committee under investigation","text":"Camera IconBillionaire Elon Musk has publicly endorsed Donald Trump in the US presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris “owes it to the country to confirm, out loud, in person, and on the record,” whether she has “abandoned the positions she held when running for Senate” or in a Democratic presidential primary, demands the Washington Examiner’s Timothy P. Carney. For more than a decade, she’s “staked out extreme and destructive policy proposals.” Some of those positions included “socializing America’s health insurance industry,” “defunding ICE” and “banning fracking.” Essentially, “on immigration, fracking and socialized medicine, we have no idea what Harris believes.” The presumptive Democratic nominee has touted “far-left stuff when she needed to win far-left votes,” but “now her priority is winning moderate votes.” Which raises the question: “Was she lying back then, or is she lying now?” Libertarian: If Recession Hits, We’re Screwed “A bummer of a jobs report” Friday triggered “a sharp drop in the stock market” and stoked fears of recession — “thanks to something known as the ‘Sahm Rule,’ ” flags Reason’s Eric Boehm. That rule, named for economist Claudia Sahm, says, basically, when unemployment is significantly higher than the previous year’s low-point, recession is likely to follow, based on the record for the past 50 years. Yet if a recession hits now, “there’s literally no money for stimulus checks.” Sahm doesn’t think we’re on the cusp of recession, but is worried. But “the outlook is certainly darker after Friday’s jobs report.” And “if a recession is coming,” the governments ability to respond “will be severely limited by the poor fiscal and monetary decisions that have left the Treasury deeply in debt and the central bank’s balance sheets overstretched.” Conservative: Dems’ Vote-Buying Blitz “To gild Kamala Harris’s path to the White House,” the Biden administration will be “buying . . . constituencies,” warns The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley A. Strassel. “The ‘Biden-Harris administration’ this week announced ‘the next step’ in its sweeping student-loan giveaway,” and, among other goodies, “federal departments in recent weeks larded out millions in new grants for women’s health, state climate programs, tribal fisheries, youth ‘skills’ development,” plus goodies for other “core Democratic demographics.” “These White House gifts and promises are designed to smooth over cracks in the base and to tantalize activists and donors . . . Republicans can’t stop this grifting, but they commit political malpractice by continuing to ignore it — allowing Mr. Biden, his unpopular agenda, and these latest expressions of far-left pandering to recede to an afterthought.” Liberal: Harris Voters Are Nothing Like Obama’s “The Harris coalition bears more resemblance to the Biden coalition” than it does to Barack Obama’s, notes The Liberal Patriot’s Ruy Teixera — except “without as many working-class voters.” Or “the Hillary Clinton coalition . . . but with far fewer white working-class voters.” Harris, per a New York Times poll, is losing working-class voters by 15 points; Obama won them by 4 points. “Obama’s massive 67-point margin” with nonwhite, working-class voters dwarfs Harris’ 29-point margin. “It is difficult to look at these data and not see profound differences between the Obama coalition and the emerging Harris coalition.” “None of this means Harris can’t win.” But now she and her team are “on a narrow, polarized path to November and their reckoning with Donald Trump.” Fiscal Watchdog: FDNY Pensions Burn Taxpayers Recently retired NYC firefighters and fire officers “were entitled to average annual pension benefits of $151,676, up six percent from the prior year,” reports the Empire Center on Public Policy. “Among the 470 new retirees with at least 20 years of service, nearly eight out of ten (399) were eligible for six-figure pensions; 79 were eligible for pensions over $200,000.” And though “the total number of retirees remained consistent over the last decade, the share of retirees eligible for six-figure pensions has soared,” nearly tripling. Who got the highest pension?

It's sign of strength. Getty Images CEOs and athletes have more in common than most people think. Both domains, at the top level, require extensive travel and time away from home and exist within pressure-cooker environments where criticism and scrutiny are relentless. In both fields, there's an expectation to be almost superhuman, showing no signs of distress or chinks in the armor. With the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris well underway, many were eager to see top athletes, and one notable return to the spotlight was Simone Biles. Biles recently won her third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, with several events left to add to her current nine Olympic medals. While her medals and peak performances are noteworthy, her journey to Paris is a valuable reminder for CEOs, founders, and business leaders. In the 2020 Tokyo Games, Biles was favored to win up to six golds and was deemed the \"face of the Games.\" Instead, she left with two medals (a silver and a bronze). Discussing her experience with NBC's Mike Tirico, Biles revealed the pressure to perform and her struggle with \"the twisties,\" a phenomenon where gymnasts experience a disconnect between their mind and body while airborne. After dismissing it as a fluke, Biles faced it again and didn't compete in most of her scheduled events. Although she didn't achieve multiple golds, Biles highlighted the critical mental health issue in high-pressure environments. In business, you can swap out medals for IPOs, key mergers and acquisitions, revenue targets, revitalizing a company, shareholder pressure, public scrutiny, and more. Biles' journey from the Tokyo Games to Paris highlights two essential lessons for CEOs striving to perform at a high level while preserving their mental health. Pay Attention to Your Check Engine Lights And Leverage Strategic Rest Biles, with her team of professionals and her self-awareness, was able to evaluate her situation and make decisions that prioritized her mental health. As she emphasized in her interview, \"Put your mental health first. It doesn't matter if you're on the biggest stage; that's more important than any other medal you could win.\" With 55% of CEOs encountering mental health issues over the past year, many attempt to power through and disregard internal struggles. Whether a top athlete or business executive, taking breaks is often frowned upon in favor of \"hustling\" and \"grinding.\" This approach leads to burnout, affecting your well-being, the organization, and crucial relationships, such as with family. Just as a check engine light serves as a warning for your car, CEOs must not ignore the check engine lights in their daily lives. Physical ailments, mental exhaustion, spiritual despondence, or emotional challenges—address them as soon as they appear and seek support. Professional athletes understand that rest allows muscles to rebuild and grow. In business, you can't constantly keep your foot on the gas. Strategic breaks and hobbies that provide a breather from daily demands aren't just stress relievers; they help you grow professionally.

Biles mentioned the \"loneliness of being expected to win,\" a sentiment echoed by athletes like Michael Phelps and Naomi Osaka. As she rebuilt herself mentally and physically, Biles relied on a board of directors for support, including her husband, coaches, teammates, and parents. Just as CEOs have a board to guide organizational decisions, leaders should approach their well-being with the same intent. While running a company and handling the intricacies of being a CEO share parallels, each leader's experience is unique. Therefore, building your well-being board of directors will be tailored to your situation. Key areas include people or groups that help maintain important personal relationships, address physical health, provide outlets for mental and emotional issues, and handle job pressures. Executive stress and the ongoing pressure to perform aren't diminishing anytime soon. These challenges are part of the package of being a CEO and leader. While the pressure-cooker environment may not cool down, your approach to handling it can be modified and improved. As seen with Biles' return and other athletes, taking a strategic break to regroup and recharge isn't a sign of weakness but a strategic move to return better and stronger. Follow me on LinkedIn.

After they emerged from the four-day meeting held behind closed doors, which ended on July 18, they put a glowing stamp of approval on Xi’s core views and vision for how the party should build the world’s second largest economy into a modern socialist nation by 2035, with more than 300 reform measures to be completed by 2029. China’s cheerleading state media have since fired on all cylinders, praising Xi as a visionary leader committed to reform and opening up, showing the way forward not only for China but the rest of the world. Behind closed doors, however, Chinese leaders are believed to have spent quite some time talking about another man who could throw a spanner in the works, more than 10,000km away. Donald Trump’s likely election to the White House for a second time in November and its ramifications for China was a hotly discussed and debated topic, according to one source familiar with the thinking of the Chinese leadership. After all, US-China relations took a decisive turn for the worse in 2018 when the then American president launched a trade war against China as part of his administration’s efforts to ramp up geopolitical rivalry with Beijing. Chinese officials had been eyeing the rising chance of Trump’s return with great interest even before the third plenum – so-called because it was the third meeting of the party’s five-year cycle – after US President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27 and the assassination attempt on Trump on July 13, two days before the meeting started. They may not acknowledge this publicly but Trump 2.0 could have profound ramifications for how China will carry out Xi’s vision of reform and opening up. Trump may not be the reason that the sweeping 22,000-word reform blueprint released after the meeting is heavy on high-sounding slogans and light on details. It has been the party tradition that a key meeting like the third plenum focuses on long-term commitments, leaving the specifics to be sorted out by the relevant departments in the coming months. But it may just fit the thinking of the Chinese leadership as they need to wait and see if Trump wins. The prevailing sentiment among China watchers is that Trump 2.0 will worsen bilateral ties between the world’s two largest economies, already at a historic low. Trump has declared in recent interviews that he would consider even higher tariffs on Chinese imports if elected. The concern is understandable, but a potential Trump presidency may not be all gloom and doom for bilateral ties, from a Chinese point of view. First of all, the Chinese leadership has long concluded that whoever enters the White House next, Trump or Kamala Harris, it is unlikely to lead to any notable improvement in ties. The best they can hope for is to stabilise the relationship when China wants to focus on growing the economy at home. In many ways, Trump’s signature transactional approach to US leadership in international affairs could work in China’s favour geopolitically. In a recent interview, Trump reaffirmed his long-held scepticism over defending Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese mainland. Trump 2.0 could help dial down the temperature over the Taiwan issue, which Beijing considers the most important red line in bilateral ties. Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports could deal a major blow to China’s exports and manufacturing, but it should be read in the global context that he would go after everyone that runs a trade surplus with the US, including the European Union. Furthermore, his repeated warnings to Nato allies to increase their defence spending – Trump advisers have reportedly floated the idea of demanding an increase in spending to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, a higher target than they had agreed to – would heighten tensions between Washington and these European nations. All this could provide a much-needed opportunity for China to disrupt the united Western front that Washington has cobbled together to resist the perceived rising and assertive influence of Beijing. China’s foreign policy priority is thus expected to focus on repairing and restoring ties with European countries, which have been hit by Beijing’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising trade tensions. To improve its fraught ties with Europe, Beijing must be seen doing more to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. It seems to be starting to do just that. Late last month, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi hosted his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Guangzhou, the first time a Ukrainian foreign minister has visited China since Russia’s invasion. On the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Laos late last month, Wang also met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss the Ukraine situation, among other topics. This has given rise to speculation that China is stepping up efforts to mediate in the Ukraine crisis. This has come as J.D. Vance, Trump’s running mate for the US vice presidency, said a second Trump administration would try to quickly negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine so that Washington can focus on China. Whether Vance plans to use China as an excuse to swiftly end the Ukraine war, or even whether that is Trump’s real intention, remains to be seen but a potential Trump presidency has provided an urgent catalyst for China to recalibrate its foreign policies.

The couple held the wedding Saturday in the chapel of their Seacoast Church in Mount Pleasant. Pastor Greg Surratt, a close friend and mentor of Scott, performed the ceremony. He previously counseled Scott when he considered a 2024 presidential run. The guest list included his fellow senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy -- who resigned after facing increasing internal dissent from his party and a failed re-election bid for the speakership. Others in attendance included Republican whip John Thune, as well the senators James Lankford of Oklahoma and John Barrasso of Pennsylvania, according to the Post and Courier Palmetto Politics online news site. \"Tonight, we promised to cherish and nourish each other and our marriage for the rest of our lives,\" Scott posted on X. \"Mindy, you've made me the happiest man alive. I love you.\" Noce met Scott, a 58-year-old lifelong bachelor, in 2022 They became close while using a Bible study app together, according to the Washington Post. A mutual friend eventually helped arrange a date. Scott has described Noce as a \"lovely Christian girl.\" Scott had been considered high on the list of potential 2024 vice-presidential running mates for Donald Trump, who ultimately picked Sen. J.D.

Like all federal judges, Supreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments on the court.\"The United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime seats to its high court Justices,\" a fact sheet from the White House reads. \"Term limits would help ensure that the Court's membership changes with some regularity; make timing for Court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary; and reduce the chance that any single Presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come.\"The White House said Biden would support reform in which presidents appoint justices every two years and justices spend only 18 years of active service on the Court—a timeline that aligns with what many critics of the Supreme Court have called for.During an interview appearance on Fox News Sunday, anchor Shannon Bream spoke about Biden's reform and asked Gorsuch, a conservative justice, \"How does the Court feel about potential changes to term limits?\"In response, Gorsuch said he would not \"get into what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.\"Gorsuch continued: \"I have one thought to add. The independent judiciary...what does it mean to you as an American? It means when you are unpopular, you can get a fair hearing under the law and under the constitution. If you're in the majority, you don't need judges and juries to hear you and protect your rights, you're popular. It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you. When the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.\"Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email and the Supreme Court via online form for comment.Biden's effort to reform the Highest Court comes after conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the Court, faced criticism for accepting undisclosed gifts and holding perceived biases in cases involving Trump and Thomas' wealthy benefactors. In addition, Samuel Alito faced recent criticism over a photograph of an upside-down American flag being flown outside his home just days before Biden's inauguration and days after the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.Thomas has defended the relationship between the donor of the undisclosed gifts as he previously said in a statement, in reference to a 2019 trip, which involved flying to Indonesia on the donor's private jet that he was \"advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable.\"In a statement previously emailed to The New York Times, Alito placed all the responsibility of flying the inverted American flag, a symbol often referred to as \"Stop the Steal\" that has been used by supporters of Trump, on his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. The justice wrote he \"had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag\" and that it was \"briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"Both justices have declined to recuse themselves from Trump-related cases, prompting Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, to file articles of impeachment against them last month. However, the impeachment attempt is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House.In addition, the conservative majority, which has three justices who were appointed by Trump, has also faced backlash after a series of controversial rulings issued just before the end of its term in July.\"These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court's fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,\" Biden said during an event commemorating the Civil Rights Act last month.Biden is also said to be considering whether to back a constitutional amendment that would eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other top officials—a way to counter the 6-3 Supreme Court decision on July 1 that granted broad presidential immunity in a ruling connected to Trump's federal election interference case. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.While the Supreme Court adopted its first code of conduct in November 2023, it was immediately met with criticism as it lacked a means of enforcement.However, Biden's efforts come as he has six months left in office as they have little chance of being approved with less than 100 days to go before Election Day, but experts say it's an effort that could become a key campaign issue.Legal analyst and senior legal affairs columnist at The Los Angeles Times, Harry Litman wrote in an op-ed piece on Tuesday that Biden's proposals were more than \"a mere political gesture\" in the last 100 days or so of the election.\"Biden and the Democrats are also playing the long game, looking in particular to make the court a campaign issue,\" he wrote. \"Then if they win control of both chambers and the White House, they can portray their election as a mandate for substantial reforms.\"","summary":"Biden last month released a new three-part plan to reform the nation's Highest Court, calling for there to be term limits on justices, among other plans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/neil-gorsuch-two-word-warning-joe-bidens-supreme-court-plan-1934399","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442553/neil-gorsuch.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:26:52","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":253371114,"title":"What Donald Trump should beware of in the debate with Kamala Harris","text":"Mark your calendar, ladies and gentlemen, Kamala Harris has done something extraordinary. She has become the only candidate in half a century to become the presidential nominee without winning a single primary vote. Biden’s vice got enough delegate votes in the virtual roll call process to become the official Democratic nominee. Interesting how not winning votes has had an uncanny way of getting this severely unqualified woman one cackle closer to the Oval Office. But the shock and awe does not stop there, so be advised to have a seat. The absolutely, positively 100% legitimate corporate media monstrosity with blood-soaked hand to its heart reports: Harris is now more popular than Joe Biden or Donald Trump have been at any point in the 2024 election cycle. Yes, a Morning Consult poll of 11,538 registered voters between July 26 and 28 found 50 percent have a favorable opinion of the sitting vice president, while 46 percent have an unfavorable opinion. According to the pollster, “Harris’s 4-point net favorability is a higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all cycle.” Is anyone really buying any of this, aside from those people who would rather see Donald Duck, for example, as commander-in-chief than Donald J. Trump? Incidentally, let’s not forget that this is the same unbelievable, super-sensational candidate who had her presidential dreams (temporarily) demolished in less than five minutes by a tenacious Tulsi Gabbard during the 2020 Democratic primary debates. The problem, however, had nothing to do with the deeply unlikeable Deep State darling, of course, but rather with a little problem known in the world of politics as cash flow, the primary grease responsible for slipping the most despicable people into positions of power over the years. As CNBC reported shortly after the debate debacle, “[w]ith Harris falling behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, among others, some of Harris’ lead bundlers have struggled to convince members of their networks to write checks to her campaign. In some cases, many of her supporters have told the campaign that they will not host events for her.” Now, just four lackluster years later, without a serious signature project to call her own, cash is no longer a problem for female, Black and Asian-American Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s ultimate DEI hire. The Harris campaign announced over the weekend it had raised $310 million in July, more than double Trump’s take last month, thereby strongly pointing to the obvious: for whatever reason, the money and media machine is churning in high gear for the political left, as it has since time immemorial, and woe to the mortal who thinks this has anything to do with power-hungry vultures perched on Capitol Hill, waiting for their next feeding time. And this is where Trump has all the reason in the world to distrust the merchants of media – even if they happen to be the notorious backstabbers at Fox News – as it plays ‘neutral’ arbitrator in the upcoming debates. As proof, as if proof were needed, here is something that Harris and not some AI-generated body double uttered just a few days ago during a rally: “Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself,” the invisible border czar told a crowd of worshipful supporters. “And when I am president, I will actually work to solve the problem.” The fact that Kamala Harris is able to utter such inanities without any pushback or laugh track shows that the media is seriously gas-lighting the American people, and not playing fair with Trump. But in the perennial fight against left-wing media forces, Trump has a knack for being his personal Darth Vader, namely due to his willingness to speak his mind, and occasionally the truth, no matter who it hurts. In a less moronic age that was known and welcomed as candidness. Consider, for example, the extremely hostile interview the former president had during a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists last week. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly,” Trump said with regards to his political opponent. “And she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.” “I respect either one,” he added, “but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and… she became Black... Somebody should look into that, too.” “Is she Indian or is she Black?” he asked totally unfazed despite the hisses from the crowd. In these maddeningly diverse times, this is not the first time a politician was called out for not being Indian, Black, Sequoia, or what have you. In 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren went through the embarrassment of a DNA test to prove that she was, as many suspected all along, a very White Democrat from Massachusetts and not a member of the Cherokee Nation tribe. The question of race, however, was not so obvious when it came to Harris. Here, Trump provided his opponent – and the vexatious media – with an unnecessary box of free ammunition by questioning Harris’ Black identity as the wagons were circling. And as much as it would be entertaining to run with the line that Harris has concealed 50% of her racial lineage for most of her lifetime, that would be twisting the facts. Harris, 59, is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – both legal immigrants. And although her parents went their separate ways when Harris was just seven years old, and she went on to live with her mother, that did not prompt an alienation from Black culture. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, she was brought up in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Berkeley, Calif., because, she said, “her mother thought her daughters would one day be seen as Black women and wanted them to have strong role models around them.” Harris went on to attend Howard University, a historically Black institution in Washington, D.C., and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a Black sorority. Needless to say, the White House had a field day with Trump’s reckless foray into such foreign affairs. “What he just said, what you just read out to me, is repulsive, is insulting,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify.” While it is questionable as to whether Trump was actually telling Harris who she was, how millions of Black Americans will interpret Trump’s comments is another matter. Regardless, he has set himself up for what could be a very uncomfortable – even disastrous – exchange with Harris, who, as a far less accomplished speaker than The Donald, will jump on any opportunity to play the victim card. And Trump may have just unwittingly handed her the ace of spades. On top of the race card, Trump will also be entering the lion’s den as a climate-change-denying “convicted felon,” misogynist, and an anti-abortion supporter – quaint little sound bites that Harris is certainly remembering by heart. However this tragicomedy plays out, expect lots of handwringing and lecturing from the female (check), Black (check), Indian (check) candidate as she attempts to portray herself as the deserving underdog in a white man’s game.","summary":"The former president should be cautious about challenging the VP on her gender and race credentials \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/602112-kamala-harris-trump-debate/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66af850985f5401ffa6f3882.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:11:58","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":253370514,"title":"How China’s mediation is redefining Middle Eastern politics","text":"This current activity of China as an intermediary between Palestinian factions and the formation of relations is an indication of China’s growing diplomacy power and the direct threat it poses to the US hegemony in international and Middle East affairs. The globe is gradually experiencing the new form of diplomacy whereby, there is a shift of power in many centres through multipolar diplomacy headed by China. Hearings laid by anti-war demonstrators urging for the halt of weapons sales to Israel and the halt to bombings in Gaza while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a visit to the USA. Though President Joe Biden is expected to sit with Netanyahu, the fulsome part of the visit is Netanyahu’s meeting with ex-president Donald Trump, the presidential candidate who may provide robust backup to Israel if elected. Traditionally, the USA sided with Israel; in the last decades, the USA has given approximately $300 billion in aid, mainly in military assistance. The recent violence includes a Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, and in the cases of violence the USA has supplied military assistance and voted against ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council. However, by the end of the conflict, there were many critics over the high death toll of civilians in Gaza which put the USA in a hard situation regarding issues to do with the Israel-Palestine conflict. These factors have resulted in changes within this context, and most notably China has come to play a major role. More recently, China managed to act as the mediator between the Palestinian factions which points to a shift in the diplomatic power dynamics. This has helped to strengthen China as a mediator in the Middle East region as against the traditional mediator, the USA. China has also managed to foster the reconciliation of both Saudi Arabia and Iran and ironically erode more of the USA’s influence in the area. The US concern is that Saudi Arabia is gradually moving closer to China which would decrease the influence of the USA in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, China has remained an impartial player and has remained diplomatic enough to help in actualization of agreements that do not create a confrontation with the USA. Palestine is also recognized by other European countries, most recently Spain, Ireland, and Norway, thus changing the trends of the international solidarity that influence the US-Israel relations. China has emerged as a very instrumental country in the Middle East in solving disputes, besides being an arsenal and diplomatic problem solver in the Middle East for the USA. Speaking of Netanyahu’s visit to the USA, protesters got into the Capitol Hill building and called for an end to the supplies of arms to Israel and a Gaza ceasefire. US mainstream media sources indicate that Joe Biden has planned to sit down for a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, while Donald Trump is to do so with the same interlocutor. Meanwhile, the United Nations has applauded the peace deal that has been signed by China to solve conflicts within the Palestinian factions. It is noteworthy that Netanyahu has chosen the time for the visit to the USA, when the presidential election campaign has begun. Getting an audience with US President Joe Biden should not prove to be much of an issue as he is no longer a contender in the presidential race. The focus of the visit is to see Donald Trump who, according to the poll, is a main contender for the presidency of the United States and, possibly, a main benefactor of Israel. Indeed, Israel has been a problematic partner for the USA for many years. Now the intensity of conflict between the two countries appears during the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. A pro-US-Israel policy has always been a recurrent agenda issue for the Democrats and Republicans in Washington. Over the past several decades, power has shifted between the two major political parties in the USA, but one thing has remained steadfast: the extent of the commitment that is made by the USA to the state of Israel. Both sides’ leaders are sure that Israel does not have a better friend than the USA, and they cannot allow Israel to be unsafe. On average, US aid to Israel accounts to $3 billion annually and has totaled $300 billion since the beginning of 1948. Based on calculations by the Council on Foreign Relations, the majority of the assistance goes to the military services despite the country being home to only 9.55 million people. Fearing China’s influence, the USA is creating instability in various regions to strengthen its global position. To maintain its grip on Europe, Russia is prolonging the war in Ukraine, while it engages in violence against Palestinians, making Gaza a battlefield on its global agenda. After Hamas fired rockets at Israel the USA provided arms to Israel, sent warships to the region and threatened to veto any ceasefire measures in the United Nations Security Council. US President Joe Biden has also overlooked conflicts with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and back up the country’s defence by asserting that “he knows the Israeli perception of the war on Gaza very well.” Over the course of several years, Israel has moved steadily to the right politically. In this context, religious extremists in Israel have gained more political power, largely due to various government periods led by Netanyahu. Israeli efforts to normalize its control over Palestinian territories and Gaza have led to conflicts, especially with the US Democratic Party. The US administration has also faced increasing criticism over the 40,000 civilian deaths in Gaza. The American stance is now clear: it desires broad freedom, opportunities, and democracy for both Israelis and Palestinians. However, Israel’s expansion into Palestinian territories undermines the Biden administration’s vision. The bombs raining down on Palestinians today are largely US-made, and most of the aircraft delivering them are also American. The artillery and drones used to kill Palestinians often bear the “Made in America” label. The largest bombs used by Israel are also provided by the USA. The USA quickly recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but when asked to acknowledge the Palestinian state it has promised, it claims that the timing is not right. It seems that the “right” time would only come once the entire Palestinian territory is settled and Palestinians are completely eliminated, rendering the need for a state moot. The situation is changing as new powers in the world and the region challenge the American system. The USA and Israel do not want unity among Muslim countries and organizations, and they obstruct such efforts. Bahrain and the UAE have recognized Israel, partly due to fears of Iran. The soft war between Saudi Arabia and Iran has created a rift, with diplomatic missions between the two countries closing. These conditions were ideal for the USA and Israel. However, news from Beijing reveals that Saudi Arabia and Iran are negotiating in China, and their agreement has weakened the US and European camps. Former President Trump wanted Saudi Arabia to quickly recognize Israel, and the Biden administration shared this desire. However, Chinese diplomacy has thwarted these wishes. Now, Saudi and Iranian embassies have reopened, and relations are progressing. Recent reports from China state that on July 23, representatives of 14 Palestinian groups signed a Beijing Declaration to end divisions and strengthen Palestinian national unity. This diplomatic development represents a significant shift in power. Previously, negotiations occurred under US oversight. Now, they have taken place in a major Eastern city, with China employing a quiet but effective diplomatic approach. The 14 major Palestinian groups’ agreement could make direct Israeli control over Gaza nearly impossible. Palestinians will now present themselves as a unified nation on the world stage. Ehe Israeli strategy has been to target all Palestinians while claiming to act against Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Currently, the USA fears it cannot prevent the expansion of Saudi-China relations. The Saudis, sensing a changing world, may view China as a more reliable partner for a stable future. The USA hopes to influence Saudi Arabia through the Gaza ceasefire agreement, but it is unlikely that Saudi Arabia will fully align with the USA or view it as the sole reliable partner. While the USA can complicate security relations, Saudi Arabia will likely maintain its relationship with China. Saudi Arabia is also loosening its grip on European allies. The recognition of Palestine by Spain, Ireland, and Norway may be symbolic but serves as a warning to the USA, reflecting a gap in solidarity with Palestinians and relations with Israel. The USA is attempting to create global divisions based on its competition with China. The USA views the Middle East as a crucial market and seeks regional instability to control Arab oil, while China does not have a history of deep alliances or ceasefires in the region. Most countries prefer not to choose between the USA and China. China pursues its goals in West Asia and globally without competing with the USA, maintaining relations with all parties. This approach has allowed China to mediate a significant understanding between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Fearing China’s influence, the USA is creating instability in various regions to strengthen its global position. To maintain its grip on Europe, Russia is prolonging the war in Ukraine, while it engages in violence against Palestinians, making Gaza a battlefield on its global agenda. The world should express solidarity with the Palestinian people and urge Israel to end the brutal violence that has devastated Gaza and resulted in nearly 40,000 innocent Palestinian deaths over the past 10 months.","summary":"This current activity of China as an intermediary between Palestinian factions and the formation of relations is an indication of China’s growing diplomacy power and the direct threat it poses to the US hegemony in international and Middle East affairs.

Both point out it had been a Labor election promise, with the ABC saying the government had already allocated $5.8 million towards its establishment. Guardian Australia said Makarrata is one of three ambitions of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, alongside a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which was rejected in last year’s referendum, and a treaty or treaties. During an interview with the ABC’s Insiders program at the Garma Festival over the weekend, the prime minister declared: “That’s not what we have proposed. What we’ve proposed is Makarrata just being the idea of coming together.” He later added: “With regard to Makarrata, a Yolngu word — that simply means a coming together after struggle. I’m somewhat perplexed at why people see that as being complex.” Pushed by host David Speers what he meant, Albanese said: “What it means is that this is happening. This is a coming together of people through engagement.” Uluru Dialogue co-chair Pat Anderson said on Sunday night in response: “Is he [Albanese] rolling back on the Labor election commitment to the Makarrata commission? We understand that a constitutional Voice didn’t get up, but the Australian people didn’t vote on truth or treaty. Makarrata is not a vague vibe or a series of casual conversations. The Makarrata called for in the Uluru Statement is a bricks-and-mortar body and it was a clear election promise.” Dean Parkin, a key figure behind the Uluru Statement, said: “That was the election night commitment, it was to the full implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and [it] is very, very clear on that point. The first element of the commitment has been carried through, the prime minister has been true to his word on that, and we would say that the remainder of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is outstanding, and it does involve a commission.” Guardian Australia reports the Albanese government has also been accused of a “total cop-out” and lacking political courage over reports it may not implement a blanket ban on gambling advertising. According to a report by the Nine newspapers at the weekend, the proposal includes a cap of two gambling ads per hour on each channel until 10pm, and banning ads an hour before and after live sporting events. There is set to be a blanket ban on ads on social media and other digital platforms though. Independent Senator David Pocock described it as a “watered down policy to appease the gambling industry”, while crossbench MP Zoe Daniel criticised it as a “half-hearted, half-arsed” proposal. As Albanese tries to navigate the criticisms this morning, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is attempting a charm offensive of his own with a five-day “rehabilitation tour” in WA which began on Friday. He is quoted in The West Australian as saying: “The more you meet me, the more you like me. Off a difficult state election and a difficult federal election, we have a lot of rebuilding to do in WA. I am here to listen to the people of Western Australia — to make sure we can introduce policies to help this great state grow, not shrink.” THE RBA, ASX AND ABC Talking of growth, or more accurately of the fears the US economy may be set for a bumpy time and could bring global growth down with it, the AFR claims the ASX is set for its worst two-day sell-off in two years after jobs data in the US contributed to fears about its economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board is meeting today, and its decision on interest rates is due tomorrow afternoon. The RBA is widely expected to leave rates on hold at 4.35%, especially after last week’s inflation numbers. Plenty was written last week on when any potential rate cut may eventually arrive and if it will come before the federal election. The Sydney Morning Herald today reports the rate of food inflation has now slowed to pre-COVID-19 levels but also highlights the Australian Council of Social Service is arguing the economy and jobs market are much weaker than the RBA believes and therefore it should cut rates now. Outside of the Olympics coverage, which unsurprisingly is dominating every national news website (as Australia continues to build on its best-ever start to a Games), the SMH has been leading this morning on leaked audio it says it has obtained of ABC chair Kim Williams criticising the organisation’s digital news platforms in an address to Radio National staff last month. The paper reports Williams lamented the mix of stories and headlines in the ABC’s news feed and the preference for lifestyle stories. “I think people have, in moments of public torment, crisis, division, challenges to leadership, a right to be able to access it from us reliably and immediately, and not to suddenly see a lifestyle story being No.1 or No.2 or No.3,” he is reported to have said. The Australian, as it does most days, also has a piece on the ABC, reporting the broadcaster’s spend on advertising, promotions and audience research is up more than 33% over the last year to $21 million. Finally, the AAP highlights that a Senate committee will today hear from government departments and aid agencies as part of an inquiry into Australia’s response to the war in Ukraine. ON A LIGHTER NOTE… A teacher in Adelaide received a most unexpected text message from her mother while teaching her Year 2 students the other day — her cat, who went missing some two-and-a-half years ago, had miraculously been found. “It took me a while to figure out what she [her mother] was talking about,” Guardian Australia quotes Jessica van Niekerk as saying. “I was shocked, to be honest. I looked for months and I always held out a little hope, but in the end I gave up on ever seeing him again.” The ABC said the cat, named George, had gone missing from his Davoren Park home in Adelaide’s north in March 2022. The broadcaster said George spent the next two years living at an industrial park at Edinburgh, several kilometres from where he disappeared. Local workers took to feeding him and according to one, Courtney Mincham, found quite a unique place to live. “He was actually living in the drainpipes around our workplace — there’s a bit of a network of them around the area, because he would go through one and pop out the other,” she said. Courtney one day spotted something wrapped around the cat’s neck and decided to contact the RSPCA, who initially caught George, before one of Courtney’s co-workers unknowingly released him again. “Fellow stray catchers on the internet suggested KFC as a way to get back into the trap they’d already escaped from, and so I put a bit of KFC in the trap every night,” she said. George was eventually recaptured and taken to the RSPCA’s animal care centre at O’Halloran Hill where the item wrapped around his neck was found to be a harness and a microchipping check revealed his owner. Jessica and George were soon reunited. “He’s just as cuddly — the same old George, he jumps up on you … trying to see what you’re doing or trying to pinch your food. He’s back to being his little piggy self,” Guardian Australia quotes her as saying, while 7News said her pupils had “lots of questions and ideas about where he might have gone” when she told them of his adventure. Say What? I’d like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. Donald Trump The former president and Republican nominee was addressing at a rally in Atlanta at the weekend when he praised the Russian president over the high-profile prison swap involving Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Politico said Trump asked his rally “did you see the deal we made?”, adding “some of the greatest killers” in the world had been released in the historic prisoner swap last week. “We got our people back, but boy we make some horrible, horrible deals. It’s nice to say we got ’em back, but does that set a bad precedent?” CRIKEY RECAP READ ALL ABOUT IT Calls for foreigners to leave Lebanon as war fears grow (BBC) Far-right protesters attack hotel housing asylum seekers in violent weekend (The Washington Post) Ukraine’s Zelenskyy unveils newly arrived F-16 fighter jets to boost country’s war effort (euronews) At least 90 killed as Bangladesh protesters renew call for Hasina to quit (Al-Jazeera) ‘It could happen to anyone’: Harry and Meghan discuss dangers of online harm (ITV News) Harris interviews Walz, Kelly, Shapiro at her home for vice president pick (Reuters) THE COMMENTARIAT Even better than gold, these Olympians have shown Aussie girls anything is possible — Shona Hendley (The Sydney Morning Herald): It’s not lost on any parent of girls right now that the overwhelming majority of gold medals won by Australia to date have been earned by young women. Or that as they win across events like swimming, BMX and canoeing, they bring a new generation of kids into sports with them. Despite the physical, mental and social benefits of sport being well known and well proven, in its 2022 report, Clearinghouse for Sport found only 32% of females will continue participating in sport when they reach the age of 15, compared with 50% of boys. One of the main reasons for this drop off from girls is a lack of role models, but clinical psychologist Dr Emma Steer says having sight of women at the top of their game, like the Dolphins in Paris and the Matildas during last year’s Women’s World Cup, “is everything”. So much so, that in NSW alone there was an 18% increase in girls taking up soccer in the afterglow of the Tillies’ success. Albanese’s move to split Asio across two portfolios has laid security and political tensions bare — Karen Middleton (Guardian Australia): This change goes beyond just having a second department involved in warrant authorisation to avoid having one giant department and one single minister checking their own homework and authorising secret activities — arguably an important extra layer of scrutiny in a country that does not aspire to become a police state. Its impact is potentially more problematic because it means there are effectively now two bosses — one determining the extent of Asio’s powers and the other controlling completely how they are executed. What happens if the new Home Affairs Minister, Tony Burke, wants to make a policy change that affects how Asio operates, and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus doesn’t agree and won’t authorise the agency’s cooperation? It’s not terribly clear.","summary":"Labor's commitment to a Makarrata commission on First Nations truth-telling is on shaky ground, and the ASX is set for its worst day in two years.\n\n\nThe post Albo puts truth-telling in doubt appeared first on Crikey.","url":"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/08/05/labor-makarrata-commission-asx-interest-rates/","image":"https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/alboarma.jpg?quality=70","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 21:11:10","author":"Rich James","authors":["Rich James"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.074}]}
