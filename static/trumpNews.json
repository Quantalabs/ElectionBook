although an Italian saying says a wet bride is a happy and lucky bride.'\nKim, 44, and her younger sister Khloe, 40, struggled to stay dry in their couture gowns as their security team guided them to their designated water taxi.\n\n Slim Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, brings Vittoria Ceretti, 27, to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding \nKylie, who is the younger half-sister of Kim and Khloe, reacted to the weather by sharing a photo of her rain-soaked water taxi to her Instagram Story.\nBride-to-be Lauren was surrounded by tuxedo-clad gentleman carrying blue umbrellas over her as she carefully stepped on to her awaiting boat.\nThe TV personality, 55, had on a striking off-the-shoulder dress with a dramatic gold corset cinching in her already tiny waist.\nBezos, 61 — who popped the question in 2022 with a $3million engagement ring — was seen following closely behind Lauren with an umbrella over his head.\nSinger Ellie Goulding was also spotted standing out in the rain as she and a fellow guest waited patiently for their boat.\nBezos and Sanchez are set to tie the knot on Saturday in Venice, Italy after a two-year engagement.\nThe Amazon billionaire and his bride-to-be are said to have invited 200 people to their three-day Italian wedding.\n\nThe strong gusts of winds whipped table cloths away and sent waiters scurrying for umbrellas to protect the VIP guests\n\nKim, 44, and Khloe, 40, struggled to stay dry in their couture gowns\n\nThe sisters waited for a boat with their hefty security team\n\nKhloe, showing off her gym-honed figure in a sheer frock, looked shocked by the weather\n\nGuests dived for cover under the vaulted cloisters as lightening bolts flashed across the sky and thunder rumbled overhead\n\nKim carefully made her way into the rain-soaked water taxi \n\nOnce the sisters were loaded on, they appeared to embrace the unexpected rain\n\nKylie Jenner reacted to the weather by sharing a photo of her rain-soaked water taxi to her Instagram Story\n\nSinger Ellie Goulding was also spotted standing out in the rain as she and a fellow guest waited patiently for their boat\nOn Tuesday, a copy of the couple's invite was leaked with one very specific request made on behalf of the couple.\nThey've asked guests not to buy them any presents and told them they'll be making donations to multiple charities working to stop Venice from sinking on attendees' behalf instead.\nThe star-studded guest list includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Tom Brady.\nBezos is worth around $224.6 billion and is thought to be spending tens of millions on his wedding.\n'If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax,' one gigantic banner read in St. Mark's Square.\nGreenpeace and the UK-based collective Everyone Hates Elon have joined protests in Venice attempting to disrupt, or even prevent, the planned wedding celebrations of Amazon founder Bezos this week.\n'Jeff Bezos is the second-richest man in the world yet is reported to pay a 1.1 percent true tax rate,' the two groups said in a joint statement.\n'The multi-million-dollar wedding is reportedly happening over three days, with the wedding ring alone worth as much as $5million.'\nA spokesperson from Everyone Hates Elon said: 'As governments talk about hard choices and struggle to fund public services, Jeff Bezos can afford to shut down half a city for days on end just to get married.'\nVenice mayor Luigi Brugnaro and regional governor Luca Zaia have spoken out in favor of the nuptials, which have been dubbed, 'the wedding of the century,' pointing out that the celebrations are expected to bring $23-34million to local businesses.\n'This is a city that handles 150,000 people a day,' Zaia told Italian daily Corriere della Sera. 'George Clooney, François-Henri Pinault and Salma Hayek, Alexandre Arnault, Elton John and many others got married here.'\nBezos has also pledged to make sizable charity donations, including $1.16million to Corila - an academic consortium dedicated to studying Venice's lagoon ecosystem - according to Corriere della Sera and Italy's ANSA news agency.\nEarlier this month, anti-Bezos banners were hung in Venice from St. Mark's Tower with 'Bezos' in blue capital letters and a red X over it as part of a 'No Space for Bezos' campaign, a play on Bezos' Blue Origin spaceflight venture.\nKylie JennerItalyLauren Sanchez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' A-list guests run for cover as pre-wedding party is hit by huge freak thunderstorm\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

A crowd of about 35 linked arms to bar access to the building, at one point briefly entering the lobby, while another 20 or so people gathered in support.\n\n\"This is a billion dollar company that is profiting from and enabling ICE that are separating our families,\" 27-year-old Marcus Romero of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) told the crowd in Palo Alto.\n\n\"Today, Palantir and the Trump administration are targeting immigrants. Tomorrow, it'll be anyone who disagrees with the MAGA agenda.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir clarified that the trucks were hired for an event and were unrelated to the protest, but otherwise declined to comment. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPalantir's stock has soared by more than 250 percent since the 2024 election as it takes an increasingly central role in President Donald Trump's push for \"mass deportations\", earning a reported $113m through new and existing contracts.\n\nFounded in 2003, with backing from arch-conservative Peter Thiel and the CIA, Palantir sells data-crunching services to companies, government agencies, intelligence services, and militaries. Its name comes from the all-seeing crystal balls used by Sauron's forces in Lord of the Rings.\n\nHaving first started working with ICE under Barack Obama, it is now alleged to be helping the Trump administration build a comprehensive surveillance system that pools data from many government departments, as well as working extensively with the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nPalantir has pushed back on the former claim, saying: \"To be very clear, Palantir is not building a master database, and Palantir is neither conducting nor enabling mass surveillance of American citizens.\"\n\n\"Our product is used on occasion to kill people,\" said CEO Alex Karp in an interview with Axios in 2020. \"If you're looking for a terrorist in the world now you're probably using our government product... I have asked myself, 'if I were younger at college, would I be protesting me?'\"\n\nThursday's demonstrations were organized by the campaign group Planet Over Profit, with help from a coalition of local groups including ACCE, Bay Resistance, and the immigration rights group Mijente.\n\nThe demonstration in Palo Alto was lively but peaceable, featuring drums, an amplified electric guitar, a man dressed as the Statue of Liberty, ‘Stop AI’ activists warning about the coming machine apocalypse, and no arrests.\n\nThe Independent counted around 130 to 140 people in attendance, while organizers estimated roughly 250 had come and gone over the course of the event. \n\nAfter blocking the street outside Palantir's unassuming redbrick office, and briefly making way for an ambulance, the crowd marched to a nondescript building nearby where organizers said the company was holding a developer conference to recruit new talent, slapping rhythmically on the windows and chanting \"quit your jobs!\"\n\n\"We shut their s*** down! They left! It’s an abandoned event space right now,\" one organizer announced soon afterwards, to wild cheers.\n\n\"Our intel tells us that... one of the most important things we can do to hurt Palantir right now is disrupting their recruitment pipeline by hurting their brand image, to the point where even very apolitical recent college graduates [feel] that it's social suicide.\"\n\nLaila Ali, an organizer with the Palestinian Youth Movement, led the crowd in chants of “free, free Palestine!”, while another — a dissident Google employee going by the alias ‘Jam’ — described Palantir as part of an effort by tech moguls to build \"a totalitarian police surveillance state at a scale unprecedented in human history\".\n\n\"The oligarchs see Trump's authoritarian tendencies, his deep disinterest in the truth, his vanity and his naked corruption, and they see their chance to ride the wave of fascism with the resources of history's most powerful economic and military empire, the United States,\" Jam said.\n\n\"They need this surveillance state because they also see another holy grail on the horizon. They believe that generative AI can realize a fantasy that they have dreamt of for centuries: a perfectly obedient workforce that they don't have to argue with, that doesn't pester them with basic needs.\"\n\nAlthough Palantir did not confirm whether its event was disrupted, one visibly confused event worker did try to deliver equipment, only to find their intended recipients had vanished.\n\nIn New York, things got spicier. Caroline Chouinard, a Brooklyn resident who was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, told The Guardian that police had begun arresting people before giving them a chance to disperse, and that people identifying themselves as Palantir employees had tried to physically push past the demonstrators into the building.\n\n\"From NYC to LA to Gaza, Palantir is one company making unspeakable horrors happen. We need to shut them down. I do not want this vile stain on my communities,\" she said.","summary":"Six people were arrested in New York City in protests over the firm’s alleged work building a massive new surveillance apparatus for President Donald Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/palantir-ice-idf-contracts-protests-b2777976.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/27/0/23/IMG_5802.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 01:08:14","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.111},{"id":335643758,"title":"Senators offer glimpse into actual result of Trump's Iran bombing campaign after classified briefing","text":"Democrats remained skeptical after the classified briefing on the Iran bombing, as Republicans insisted Tehran's facilities had been 'obliterated.'\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Gen. Dan 'Raizin' Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Capitol Hill to give the classified briefings, originally scheduled for Tuesday. \n\nSenators emerged from a classified briefing Thursday with sharply diverging assessments of President Donald Trump´s bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, with Republicans calling the mission a clear success and Democrats expressing deep skepticism.\n\nMany Republicans left satisfied, though their assessments of how much Iran´s nuclear program was set back by the bombing varied. Sen. Tom Cotton said a 'major blow' and 'catastrophic damage' had been dealt to Iran's facilities.\n\n'Their operational capability was obliterated. There is nobody working there tonight. It was highly effective. There´s no reason to hit those sites anytime soon,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nDemocrats remained doubtful and criticized Trump for not giving Congress more information. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the briefing 'raised more questions than it answered.'\n\nSome on the left repeated the mainstream media reports that Trump has raged against suggesting they didn't push back Iran's nuclear program very far. \n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the strike appears to 'have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a handful of months.'\n\n'There's no doubt there was damage done to the program,' said Murphy, but 'allegations that we have obliterated their program just don't seem to stand up to reason.'\n\n'I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated,' he added.\n\n'It’s still too early to know exactly what the battle damage was, and that’s normal,' said Democrat and former CIA agent Elissa Slotkin. \n\nThe session came as senators weighed their support for a resolution affirming that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran. \n\nA vote on that resolution could come as soon as Thursday.\n\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, have said the White House overstepped its authority when it failed to seek the advice of Congress. \n\nThey also want to know more about the intelligence that Trump relied on when he authorized the attacks.\n\nA similar briefing for House members will be held Friday.\n\nA preliminary U.S. intelligence report found that Iran´s nuclear program had been set back only a few months, contradicting statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the status of Iran´s nuclear facilities, according to two people familiar with the report. \n\nThey were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n'You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated - choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,' Hegseth said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday.\n\nHegseth went ballistic on reporters at a Pentagon press conference Thursday, lashing out at reports that U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were ineffective.\n\nThe defense secretary was joined by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Caine, to tout to reporters the 'historic success' of last weekend's B-2 bombing run.\n\nA fired-up Hegseth was also adamant that journalists in the Pentagon press corps are decidedly anti-Trump.\n\n'You cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and blood,' he accused the press in the room. 'You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes.'\n\n'Your people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful, it's irresponsible,' he charged. \n\nThe press conference - a rarity for Hegseth - came within days of CNN reporting that the U.S. strikes would only set back Iran's nuclear sites by a couple of months. \n\nThe report cited seven individuals briefed on a battle damage assessment done by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the Iranian sites. \n\nIt directly contradicted President Donald Trump and the defense secretary's claim that the sites were destroyed - and clearly enraged the administration. \n\nTrump has raged against those reports, calling out CNN and The New York Times and saying that the leakers should be in prison and the reporters fired. The outlets have stood by their reporting. \n\nOn Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Ratcliffe sent out statements backing Trump´s claims that the facilities were 'completely and fully obliterated.'\n\nGabbard posted on social media that 'new intelligence confirms what @POTUS has stated numerous times: Iran´s nuclear facilities have been destroyed.' She said that if the Iranians choose to rebuild the three facilities, it would 'likely take years to do.'\n\nRatcliffe said in a statement from the CIA that Iran's nuclear program has been 'severely damaged.' \n\nHe cited new intelligence 'from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.'\n\nMost Republicans have defended Trump and hailed the tentative ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Iran war. \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., went as far as to question the constitutionality of the War Powers Act , which is intended to give Congress a say in military action.\n\n'The bottom line is the commander in chief is the president, the military reports to the president, and the person empowered to act on the nation´s behalf is the president,' Johnson told reporters.\n\nBut some Republicans, including some of Trump´s staunchest supporters, are uncomfortable with the strikes and the potential for U.S. involvement in an extended Middle East conflict.\n\n'I think the speaker needs to review the Constitution,' said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. 'And I think there´s a lot of evidence that our Founding Fathers did not want presidents to unilaterally go to war.'\n\nPaul would not say whether he would vote for the resolution by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that would require congressional approval for specific military action in Iran.\n\nA simple majority in the Senate is needed to pass the resolution and Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage.\n\n'I will have Republican votes, plural,' Kaine said. 'But whether it´s two or 10, I don´t know.'\n\nKaine authored a similar resolution in 2020 aimed at limiting Trump´s authority to launch military operations against Iran. At the time, eight Republicans joined Democrats in approving the resolution.\n\n'I think I have a chance to get some votes from people who are glad that President Trump did this over the weekend, but they´re saying, `Ok, but now if we´re really going to go to war, it should only have to go through the Congress,´' Kaine told The Associated Press before the briefing.\n\nWhile Trump did not seek approval, he sent congressional leaders a short letter Monday serving as his official notice of the strikes, which occurred Saturday between 6:40 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. EDT, or roughly 2:10 a.m. on Sunday in Iran.\n\nThe letter said the strike was taken 'to advance vital United States national interests, and in collective self-defense of our ally, Israel, by eliminating Iran´s nuclear program.","summary":"Senators emerged from a classified briefing Thursday with sharply diverging assessments of President Donald Trump´s bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14852193/Senators-classified-Iran-briefing-Democrat-Hegseth.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/27/01/99769653-0-image-a-14_1750985183192.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/27/7680988442441071326/1024x576_MP4_7680988442441071326.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-27 01:04:06","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Think of what the flash has done to those priceless paintings.'\nAnother follower posted cheekily: 'When you get to do it at the Palace but Harry and Meghan couldn't lol'.\nAnother remarked in response to the Royal Family's reaction: 'In a world at times worrying and serious this comment was so needed.'\nProof that no offence was taken, a palace aide told the Mail: 'I'm sure it was done in a spirit of fun, and of course aligned to Jamie's wonderful support for The King's Trust Awards - even if it's not something we would greatly encourage every guest to attempt.'\nReferring to 'theroyalfamily' account's official response, they added most definitely with tongue-in-cheek: 'Proof that from time to time the Royal Family account has a sense of humour too. \n'As for Jamie, may we recommend a visit to the Tower of London.

Trump did a victory lap afterwards, claiming the strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. \n\nOn Tuesday, CNN, followed by theTimes, published the findings of a preliminary report that suggested the bombings only set Iran’s nuclear program back by a few months, contradictory to Trump’s boasting. \n\nDespite his administration confirming the American intelligence assessment on the effectiveness of last weekend’s airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities is indeed real, the president took to his social media platform on Wednesday afternoon and demanded CNN terminate the reporter who broke the story.\n\nTrump targeted the two media outlets on social media, referring to them as the “Failing New York Times” and “Fake News CNN,” and calling their reporters “BAD AND SICK PEOPLE.”\n\nAnd now, the Times is reporting Trump’s lawyer, Alejandro Brito, has threatened to sue the publication, claiming it damaged the president’s reputation. \n\nThe Times cited a letter written by Brito and sent to the publication on Wednesday, in which he asserted that the Iran bombings were a “historic and resounding military success” and that the Times reporting about the preliminary report “undermined the credibility and integrity of President Trump in the eyes of the public and the professional community.”\n\nBrito demanded that the Times “retract and apologize for” its reporting, which he called “defamatory” and “unpatriotic.”\n\nThe Times said its lawyer, David McCraw, wrote a letter in response, which stated, “No retraction is needed.”\n\nMcCraw said the publication would not apologize, adding, “We told the truth to the best of our ability. We will continue to do so.”\n\nA CNN spokeswoman told the Times that it had responded to a similar legal threat from Trump’s team.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN released a statement that read, in part, “We stand 100% behind Natasha Bertrand’s journalism and specifically her and her colleagues’ reporting of the early intelligence assessment of the U.S. attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.”\n\nBertrand, one of the authors of CNN’s reporting on the preliminary report, was called out directly by Trump, who said on social media that she should be fired and “thrown out ‘like a dog.’”\n\nWhen CNN released the findings of the preliminary report, it included a statement from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, which read, in part, “This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong.”\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed Wednesday that the preliminary report did exist. During a press conference Thursday morning, Hegeth lashed out against the press, saying, “You cheer against Trump so hard.”\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced what they said were new findings Wednesday revealing apparent further damage to Iran’s nuclear program. \n\nRatcliffe said in a statement Iran’s nuclear program had been “severely damaged” and that it “would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.”\n\nGabbard also said it “would likely take years” for Iran to rebuild the bombed nuclear sites in an X post.","summary":"Trump’s lawyer claimed the reporting ‘undermined the credibility and integrity of President Trump in the eyes of the public and the professional community’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-sue-new-york-times-cnn-iran-bombing-b2777966.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/26/23/23/GettyImages-2221849502.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0njBZekh-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:46:05","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.535},{"id":335642348,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Thursday, June 26","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode June 26, 2025 43:31 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Thursday, June 26 \n Iran, Donald Trump, Israel\n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Iran, Donald Trump, Israel","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6374918178112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/5dd519a0-ca84-4fa9-8eb4-be49ac944cc4/5471baa4-9148-452e-a576-d8459999510c/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:44:40","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":335637926,"title":"Australian superannuation investors spared as US drops Section 899 ‘revenge tax’","text":"Australian superannuation investors have been spared from a potentially costly new tax, after the United States confirmed it will withdraw a controversial measure targeting foreign capital from Donald Trump’s signature economic legislation.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Friday that Section 899 — dubbed the “revenge tax” — would be removed from the President’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” following progress on a new G7 tax agreement.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers welcomed news of the change, calling it a “welcome one for Australians and for the Australian business and institutional investor community”.\n\nThe legislation was framed as a retaliatory response to global minimum tax rules imposed by countries including Australia, as well as digital services taxes like Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code.\n\nUnder Section 899, superannuation funds were facing a rise in the rate of withholding tax from 15 to 35 per cent at a base case and as much as 50 per cent in a more severe scenario that could significantly reduce investment returns. An estimated $450 billion of Australians’ cash is invested in the US.\n\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia previously estimated the tax could reduce annual returns by 0.1 to 0.26 per cent, depending on how far rates were lifted — a hit that could translate to tens of billions of dollars a year.\n\nASFA welcomed the decision to remove the measure, saying it was a positive outcome for Australian investors. In a statement, the association said the move reflected the importance of international tax stability and fair treatment of long-term institutional investors.\n\nIt also acknowledged the collaborative dialogue between Australian officials and their US counterparts in helping secure the outcome.\n\n“This is a really welcome step from the US Treasury Secretary and the superannuation sector is monitoring developments closely,” ASFA chief policy officer James Koval said.\n\n“This section of the legislation would have changed the risk return profile of investment in the US, which would have been a poor outcome for all involved.”\n\nMr Chalmers raised the issue directly with Mr Bessent during a phone call earlier this week, warning in public remarks that Australian investors and funds should not be unfairly treated by tax changes in the US.\n\n“We do not want to see our investors and our funds unfairly treated or disadvantaged when it comes to developments out of the US,” he said after the meeting.\n\nMr Bessent, in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), said the decision followed a new joint understanding with G7 countries on the OECD global tax deal, and praised President Trump for issuing executive orders to defend US tax sovereignty.\n\n“Based on this progress and understanding, I have asked the Senate and House to remove the Section 899 protective measure from consideration,” Mr Bessent said.\n\nDigital tax tensions remain\n\nWhile the decision removes a key threat to superannuation earnings, it may complicate Australia’s parallel efforts to hold tech giants — which pay relatively little tax on their Australian earnings — to account.\n\nSection 899 had also been positioned as a response to digital services taxes, including Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code, which required Alphabet and Meta to pay local publishers for content appearing on their platforms.\n\nAt its peak, the code delivered between $130 million and $200 million a year to Australian media companies. But Meta has since withdrawn from the code, and Google has said it will halt payments to 24 smaller publishers in July.\n\nThe Albanese Government has flagged it is developing a new framework — referred to as a “news bargaining incentive” — but no detail has yet been released.\n\nThat proposed levy may still be in the firing line with Mr Bessent vowing to “enact tax policies that serve the interests of American businesses and workers”.\n\n“The Trump Administration remains vigilant against all discriminatory and extraterritorial foreign taxes applied against Americans. We will defend our tax sovereignty and resist efforts to create an unlevel playing field for our citizens and companies,” Mr Bessent posted on X.\n\nDr Chalmers said the Government would continue to pursue efforts to fight tax minimisation.\n\n“Australia will continue to engage constructively through the OECD on international tax rules that are fair and ensure multinationals pay their fair share in Australia.\n\n“We’ll consider the details of the G7 agreement.”","summary":"Australian superannuation investors have been spared from a potentially costly new tax, after the US confirmed it will withdraw a controversial measure in Donald Trump’s signature economic legislation.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/australian-superannuation-investors-spared-as-us-drops-section-899-revenge-tax--c-19170728","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19170728/885fc6e9b623e8e12261f02e13985a54d666efd8-16x9-x0y1386w3242h1824.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:43:36","author":"Jackson Hewett","authors":["Jackson Hewett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":335638070,"title":"‘Word Games’: ‘The Five’ Guests Say Democrats Have Power To Do Something About Deportations Besides Whining","text":"Fox News’ Dana Perino and Charles Hurt slammed Democrats on “The Five” Thursday, saying they continue to complain about President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration crackdown despite having the power to change the laws.\n\nAs Democrats continue to support allowing illegal migrants to remain in the country, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett went on a bizarre rant Wednesday during a hearing, questioning First Lady Melania Trump’s citizenship. While discussing Democrat pushback to Trump’s immigration agenda, Perino said lawmakers are in the “perfect position” to change the laws if they actually disagree with them. (RELATED: ‘Biggest Concern I’ve Ever Had’: Tom Homan Tells Hannity What Has Him Worried About Previous Administration)\n\n“Crossing the border illegally or overstaying your visa illegally is illegal,” Perino said. “If they want to change that, they’re in the perfect position to do that. They are in Congress. In addition, I think Jazzy, which I learned, that’s who they call her [Rep. Jasmine Crockett] on the Gutfeld show when I was on last night. What a perfect person to say ‘Mr. President. Can I come see you? I’d like a word. I’d like to bring a couple people. We have an idea.'”\n\n“Donald Trump would say ‘Yeah, sure come on. Let’s have a conversation’ And if they went and said ‘We’re concerned about these guys. We know they crossed over illegally. OK, they should pay a price for that, but they’ve been lawful ever since. They have kids here. Is there something we could do? Is there something we could put into this big beautiful bill that might pass your muster that you’d be OK with? Could I work with you? Could I try to bring enough Democrats to vote with on something like this?’ If they wanted to come to a solution, they have the perfect person in the Oval Office in order to do that,” Perino added.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing, Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett drew backlash from Republicans after mocking First Lady Melania Trump’s EB-1 visa, referring to it as the “Einstein Visa.” Crockett asked why GOP lawmakers weren’t investigating the “lack of integrity when it comes to the president’s family’s visas.”\n\nDemocrats have long opposed Trump’s vow to deport illegal migrants, a core part of his campaign agenda. In April, a handful of Democrats began to rally behind Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an illegal migrant deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration.\n\nDespite alleged ties to the MS-13 gang and possible human trafficking, some Democrat lawmakers took taxpayer-funded trips to El Salvador to advocate on his behalf.\n\n“Of course we saw it in the first term, where President Trump tried to make a deal with the Dreamers. Of course, Democrats didn’t want to do that because they want the issue and not the solution,” Hurt said. “Look, if you want to know when people have absolutely nothing constructive to do, they start playing word games.”\n\n“When you start playing word games with ‘illegal alien,’ by the way, ‘illegal alien’ is the actual term. It’s in federal code, so they could change that when they’re changing the rules,” Hurt said. “When you’re playing word games you don’t actually have a solution, and this is why voters have thrown them out of power from the Senate and the White House. And I look at them as being fundamentally unserious on important issues that matter to them.”\n\nA new poll shows a majority of Hispanic voters still support key elements of Trump’s agenda.\n\nAccording to an online poll conducted by the League of American Workers and the TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, nearly six in 10 registered voters surveyed — including 53% of Hispanic respondents — said they support increasing the “pace of deportations… prioritizing individuals with criminal records.”\n\nData from the White House’s 100-day progress report shows that, compared to the Biden administration — which allowed millions of illegal migrants into the U.S. — daily border encounters have dropped 93%, and migrant crossings are down 99.99%.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

which Australia is not a part of - agreed to lift their defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP over 10 years during a summit in The Hague, the Netherlands, this week.\n\nThe move was triggered by pressure from the US President who had has long called for European allies to boost their defence spending.\n\nIt was a win for Trump who had his ego massaged at the meeting of world leaders when Nato Chief Mark Rutte referred to him as 'daddy'.\n\nBut now the US Commander-in-Chief has indicated he expects his allies in the Asia-Pacific - including Australia - to also increase their defence funding.\n\n'Yeah, look, if our allies in Europe and our NATO allies can do that, I think our allies and our friends in the Asia Pacific region can do it as well,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.\n\nMs Leavitt said she would leave the 'specific relations and discussions' for individual countries to Trump.\n\nThis means that Albanese may be pressured to increase defence spending if he hopes to secure a carve-out from the punishing tariffs imposed by the US on imports, including a 50 per cent levy on steel and aluminium.\n\nAustralia should boost its defence spending in line with NATO partners, according to a new diktat from the White House which sets Anthony Albanese (pictured) on a collision course with Donald Trump, who he is yet to meet\n\n'Yeah, look, if our allies in Europe and our NATO allies can do that (increase defence funding), I think our allies and our friends in the Asia Pacific region can do it as well,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday\n\nHe will also be hoping to shore up the $368bn AUKUS submarine deal, which is currently under threat from a 30-day review by the Pentagon. \n\nBut Albanese rebuffed the call to increase defence spending on Friday morning, insisting his government would not deviate from the levels they outlined in the March budget, which aims to reach 2.3 per cent over the next ten years.\n\n'We continue to invest in whatever capabilities Australia needs – we'll continue to do that,' ALbanese told reporters. \n\n'My job is to look after Australia's national interest, that includes our defence and security interests, and that's precisely what we are doing.'\n\nSpain was the only NATO member not to agree to lift its defence spending above 2.1 per cent of GDP, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez arguing it was 'incompatible with our welfare state and our vision of the world'.\n\nThis triggered Trump's ire, with the US President vowing to hit Spain with higher tariffs.\n\nSingle picture exposes sad reality about Australia\n\n'They want a little bit of a free ride, but they'll have to pay it back to us on trade, because I'm not going to let that happen,' Trump said. \n\nAlbanese's planned meeting with Trump at the G7 summit in Canada failed to eventuate when the US President had to dash back to Washington to deal with the Israel-Iran crisis. \n\nMany had expected him to go in Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles place to the NATO summit this week to secure a meeting but instead he stayed in Australian. \n\nMarles risked Trump's ire by insisting Australia would not follow NATO members by lifting its defence spending to five per cent of GDP. \n\n'Look, obviously, a very significant decision has been made here in relation to European defence spending, and that is fundamentally a matter for NATO,' Marles said.\n\n'We've gone through our own process of assessing our strategic landscape, assessing the threats that exist there, and the kind of defence force we need to build in order to meet those threats, to meet the strategic moment, and then to resource that.\n\n'And what that has seen is the biggest peacetime increase in Australian Defence spending.\n\n'Now that is a story which is... understood here and we'll continue to assess what our needs are going forward. And as our prime minister has said, we will resource that.'\n\nMarles did not speak directly with Mr Trump, nor US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, despite intensive efforts by government officials to tee up a first face-to-face meeting of an Australian minister with the US President.\n\nOpposition Defence spokesman Angus Taylor called on the government to lift defence spending by at least three per cent of GDP on Friday morning.\n\n'It's essential Australia be in a position to stand on its own two feet alongside our allies like the United States and the UK and that does mean we have to spend more on defence,' he told ABC News.\n\nPete HegsethAnthony AlbaneseAustralia Politics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump's thinly-veiled threat to Anthony Albanese over defence spending\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The US Commander-in-Chief has indicated he expects his allies in the Asia-Pacific - including Australia - to also increase their defence funding.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14852191/Donald-Trumps-thinly-veiled-threat-Anthony-Albanese-defence-spending.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/27/00/99769011-0-image-a-8_1750979380308.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:40:07","author":"Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":335637904,"title":"Trump’s threat of more tariffs makes U.S. trade partners wary of signing deals","text":"Tariff negotiations with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump are running into roadblocks, as partners including Japan, India and the European Union balk at signing deals without knowing how badly they’ll be hit by separate levies on exports including chips, drugs and steel.The U.S. Commerce Department is set within weeks to announce the outcomes of its investigations into sectors deemed vital to national security, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals.

Following President Trump's command, the most powerful military in the history of the world executed massive precision strikes on three of the Iranian regime's key nuclear facilities,\" Leavitt said. \"The objective of Operation Midnight Hammer was to destroy the regime's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the grave nuclear threat posed to the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world. The mission, which will go down in the history books, was an overwhelming success,\" she added.

Leavitt took a dig at the past presidencies and contrasted them to the leadership of President Donald Trump. \"Barack Obama and Joe Biden sent pallets of cash, American taxpayer dollars, in a failed attempt to buy the Iranian regime's compliance with a weak and ineffective deal. President Trump sent a fleet of American warplanes to destroy Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. The United States and the entire world are safer because of this president's decisiveness,\" she said. She underlined that a broad consensus was emerging that Iran's nuclear capabilities were indeed destroyed. \"Despite agenda-driven leaks by the fake news media aimed at undermining this incredible accomplishment achieved by President Trump and our brave fighter pilots, there is a broad consensus emerging already that Iran's nuclear capabilities were indeed destroyed. The United States, Israel, the United Nations, and even Iran all agree they can no longer build a nuclear weapon,\" Press Secretary mentioned. Leavitt underscored that within 48 hours of the strikes, \"President Trump and his team brokered a historic ceasefire between Israel and Iran and officially ended the 12-day war.\" \"The Middle East is now shifting away from chaos and bloodshed and moving toward the beginning stages of a new era of peace and stability that President Trump has long called on them to achieve. This was unthinkable at this time last week, and this is what peace through strength looks like,\" she said. The conflict between Iran and Israel began on June 13 when Israel launched a large-scale airstrike targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities under \"Operation Rising Lion\". Iran responded by launching \"Operation True Promise 3\", a campaign involving missile and drone attacks against Israel's infrastructure.

This was actually not the worst that I have experienced in Hollywood. I've actually experienced far worse misconduct. You know, I spoke up because I wanted to address it, and I thought that I had, and I never had any intentions of discussing this or going public with my accusations,\"' Twohey said.\nOn June 9, federal Judge Lewis J. Liman dismissed Justin and his Wayfarer Studios parties' $400M countersuit against Reynolds, Lively, and her publicist Leslie Sloane alleging civil extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.\nLiman also dismissed Baldoni's $250M defamation lawsuit against the NY Times for its biased coverage of of the Another Simple Favor star's CRD complaint and text messages taken from Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel.\n\nThe Canadian 48-year-old scoffed in his TIME100 cover story Thursday: 'I can read something that says, \"He should be drawn and quartered.\" I could read something that says I should win a Nobel Prize.

Instead of revising the existing claims, our clients will be pursuing additional legal options that are available to us.'\nBehind the scenes, none of the major talk show hosts - Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, and John Oliver - have cracked a joke about the Lively-Baldoni case after Reynolds' company Mint Mobile was one of two sponsors for their 2023 podcast, Strike Force Five.\nThe Kwantlen Polytechnic University drop-out - who sold Mint Mobile to T-Mobile for $1.35B in 2023 - co-owns or has sold companies valued at over $14B, and Forbes ranked him the second highest earning actor of 2024 with $85M.\n\nRyan had called Justin a 'sexual predator' because his 37-year-old wife alleged she was sexually harassed by him on the set of It Ends with Us in the complaint she filed with the California Civil Rights Department complaint on December 20 (pictured in 2024)\n\nOn June 9, federal Judge Lewis J.

Brown reportedly has a warrant out for his arrest for attempted murder, and Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu told investigators a bullet grazed his neck, according to The Associated Press. The AP mentioned that Nantambu was the person selected to be a backup dancer for Lamar during the rapper's performance but instead took the opportunity to show his support for Sudan and Palestine. Nantambu was arrested Thursday on charges of resisting an officer and disturbing the peace by interruption of a lawful assembly, revealing a link between the incidents. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"In coordination with the National Football League, troopers learned that Nantambu had permission to be on the field during the performance but did not have permission to demonstrate as he did,\" Louisiana State Police said. The alleged incident between Brown and Nantambu happened outside a boxing event in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. The warrant reportedly listed the incident as occurring May 16. Fox News Digital previously reported that Brown appeared to be involved in several videos on social media in an incident at a Miami boxing event that night. One video showed Brown appearing to fight in a parking lot as a crowd moved toward an alley. Then, a gunshot appeared to ring out, sending spectators running in the opposite direction. Brown was spotted in handcuffs being led to the back of a police cruiser. When Nantambu's link to the incidents surfaced online, Brown responded. \"That guy is a fraud, liar, stalker & criminal. He was arrested in 2022 for stealing 6 figures of jewelry from me. He then showed up at my show at rolling loud in 2023 trying to assault me,\" Brown wrote on X. \"Then in May he snuck into a gate at the event and came right up to me trying to steal from me and threaten my life, Media hasn’t told this story yet… instead painting a false picture of me. That night I was fighting for my life with his intentions.\" FROM PROTECTING QUARTERBACKS TO MILITARY VETERANS, BRONCOS LINEMAN GARETT BOLLES TACKLES WILDFIRE PREVENTION Brown's warrant in Miami-Dade County lists a charge of attempted murder with a gun and calls for Brown to post a $10,000 bond and remain under house arrest pending trial, The Washington Post reported earlier this month. A Miami Police Department spokesman previously told Fox News Digital the department received an alert of shots fired at around 3 a.m. May 17. Police initiated an investigation, no arrests were made and no one was injured, the spokesman said at the time. The protest took place with President Donald Trump in attendance at the game, marking the first time a sitting president has attended a Super Bowl. Trump previously floated the idea of the U.S. \"taking over\" the Gaza Strip. \"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Trump said, adding it’s a decision he didn’t make lightly. During Lamar's performance of his new hit \"tv off,\" Nantambu held the flag on top of a prop car and then ran onto the field with the flag.

Paul Prosper, who is Mi'kmaq, proposed an amendment to ensure projects cannot be approved without the explicit free, prior and informed consent of affected communities, but it failed to pass.\n\n\"We are appointed so that we are outside of the pressures of the electoral cycle and able to stand on principle against poorly drafted legislation,\" Prosper said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\n\"I cringe when I hear people say that we need to back away from amendments, lest it turn public opinion against us,\" Prosper added as he read quotes from Indigenous leaders about their opposition to the legislation.\n\nHe said the country is quickly becoming a \"country of extremes,\" and that the ability for moderate social discourse is \"gone.\"\n\n\"When I came out against the rushed nature of this bill, and spoke about the need to amend or even delay its passage, the racist vitriol and threats my office experienced was so intense, staff asked for permission to not pick up unknown phone calls,\" Prosper said.\n\n\"That isn't right, and it isn't acceptable.\"\n\nThe legislation was introduced in the upper chamber on Wednesday after the bill was fast-tracked through the House of Commons. The Senate passed the bill Thursday, and it received royal assent that same day, becoming law.\n\nSen. Leo Housakos, who serves as the Opposition Leader in the Senate, said Canada is going through an \"existential crisis\" during his final speech before the bill's passage, referencing the unsteady trading relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Those of us that believe there has to be rigid environmental balances in this country are going to have to put a little bit of water in our wine. Those of us that believe that we need to unleash resources in this country at any expense, will have to put a little bit of water in our wine and come to compromises that work, but fundamentally, to create wealth, to create prosperity,\" Housakos said.\n\n\"When the going gets tough, Canadians get going. We come together, we find solutions. We work hard.\"\n\nAtiya Jaffar of 350 Canada said in a media statement the bill provides nothing more than \"unchecked power\" to cabinet to speed up projects that bulldoze through the environment, democracy and the rights of Indigenous Peoples without meaningful consultation or public input.\n\n\"Canada cannot build a just and sustainable future by steamrolling over the foundations of accountability and Indigenous consent. We will hold the government accountable every step of the way,\" Jaffar said.\n\nWhile the bill has seen fierce opposition, other development-friendly groups have expressed support for the speed at which the bill has been passed and the potential for the projects it can produce.\n\nMatthew Holmes, the executive vice-president and chief of public policy for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, commended Parliamentarians in a media statement for passing the bill in a quick fashion.\n\nHolmes said the bill has the potential to unleash the Canadian economy and streamline internal trade to get big projects built.\n\n\"At the same time as we move forward with this positive development, we remind and call on the government to ensure that these powers are used responsibly and in full compliance with the rights of Indigenous communities and with environmental standards,\" Holmes said.\n\n\"Large projects get done in partnership, and — when done right — will bring national interest dividends for generations to come.\"","summary":"The Liberal government&#39;s controversial major projects bill became law Thursday &mdash; legislation Indigenous leaders have warned could lead to widespread protests and legal challenges if Ottawa doesn&#39;t respect their rights and title.\n\nBill C-5 gives Ottawa the power to fast-track projects...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/558544/Controversial-legislation-to-fast-track-major-projects-Bill-C-5-becomes-law","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/cp/2025/6/8614aabd6e7d5f7f86d33a9aeb914b16aa5f0378bf949f1596661e9b21367f89.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:32:00","author":"Alessia Passafiume","authors":["Alessia Passafiume"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":335642346,"title":"Jesse Watters: Besides the ayatollah, CNN couldn't find a single backer to their story","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nJesse Watters Primetime June 26, 2025 11:00 \n\n Jesse Watters: Besides the ayatollah, CNN couldn't find a single backer to their story \n Fox News host Jesse Watters examines the genesis and execution of Operation Midnight Hammer under President Donald Trump’s leadership on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRJESSE WATTERS PRIMETIMEV-VIDEOPOLITICSDONALD TRUMP","summary":"Fox News host Jesse Watters examines the genesis and execution of Operation Midnight Hammer under President Donald Trump’s leadership on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6374916880112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/37bcfef2-f264-4ded-a8ae-b61ae405e419/790183a3-d932-4229-bf13-73fc68aa18d8/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:31:19","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":335636164,"title":"Trump tries to rally support for troubled budget bill","text":"June 26 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump held a \"One Big, Beautiful Event\" rally on Thursday afternoon to garner support for the federal budget bill that he wants passed before Independence Day.\n\nTrump was backed by dozens of supporters who represented many occupations while addressing attendees at the event held in the East Room of the White House.\n\n\"We're cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill, and you're not going to feel any of it,\" Trump told media and other event attendees.\n\n\"Your Medicaid is left alone. It's the same,\" Trump said. \"Your Medicare and your Social Security are strengthened.\"\n\nHe said Democrats would cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits in half and asked people to contact their senators and representatives to support the budget bill.\n\n\"Almost every major promise made in the 2024 campaign already will have become a promise kept,\" Trump said. \"That's very important.\"\n\nHe said the budget bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips, overtime pay or Social Security.\n\nA reconciliation bill before the Senate would limit the income tax deduction on tips to the first $25,000, though.\n\nThe president also said a trade deal has been reached with China and another might be coming with India, but he did not elaborate on them.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and several members of Trump's Cabinet attended the event, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.\n\nTrump held the rally after the Senate parliamentarian earlier ruled several provisions in the Senate reconciliation bill violate Senate rules.\n\nSenate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough nixed provisions that would have limited the use of healthcare provider taxes by states that recently expanded Medicaid coverage but did not increase Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThose proposed changes would cost states more to provide Medicaid coverage.\n\nMacDonough is still reviewing the Senate reconciliation bill and might issue more objections to proposed measures.\n\nThe House already passed the bill, but the Senate is trying to hammer out a reconciliation package that would pass both chambers and be ready for signing by the Fourth of July.\n\nRep.

For these reasons, even maintaining the Quad agenda going forward is difficult, despite the US concentrating the groups's focus on security, prosperity, tech, and homeland security,\" he said. The developments follow after, earlier on June 18, when US President Donald Trump accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to attend the QUAD Summit, which will take place in New Delhi later this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had previously informed. The telephonic conversation with US President Donald Trump took place on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Canada.\n\"For the next meeting of QUAD, PM Modi invited President Trump to India. While accepting the invitation, President Trump said that he is excited to come to India\", Misri had said in a video message.\nThe QUAD is a diplomatic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States committed to supporting an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient. The QUAD's origins date back to our collaboration in response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nEarlier in January, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on his first day in office, hosted the Foreign Ministers of Australia, India, and Japan for a significant meeting of the QUAD alliance.\n\"On day one as Secretary of State, I hosted the Foreign Ministers of Australia, India, and Japan for an important meeting of the Quad. We are committed to strengthening economic opportunity and peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region,\" Rubio posted on X. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held the meeting with his Quad counterparts--External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Japan's Takeshi Iwaya, and Australia's Penny Wong--at the US Department of State.\nIn a joint statement, the Foreign ministers of QUAD countries reaffirmed their shared commitment to strengthening a free and open Indo-Pacific where \"sovereignty and territorial integrity are upheld and defended.\" The Quad nations also expressed strong opposition \"to any unilateral actions aimed at changing the status quo through force or coercion.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

The president said the legislation will ensure \"no more families are victimized\" by illegal immigrants and open border policies. During the event Thursday in the East Room, Trump described what families have had to go through as a result of the previous administration's open border policies as \"sick,\" adding just thinking about it makes people want to cry. He pointed out that the GOP spending package, which still must be approved by Republicans in the Senate, would include provisions Trump described as \"the single most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress.\" At one point, Trump turned to Joe Abraham, an angel dad who lost his daughter Katie after an illegal immigrant rear-ended her stopped car at a traffic light while traveling 60 to 70 mph. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY: HOW SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE RESTORING RULE OF LAW AND SECURING BORDER FOR YEARS TO COME \"We will end this invasion once and for all. And we're always going to remember the memory of Katie, that beautiful, beautiful 20-year-old daughter of yours,\" Trump said, before her father walked over to the president, shook his hand and provided Trump a picture of his daughter that the president held up for the audience. Trump then highlighted a mother from Texas, Sarah Stuart, who the president said lost her brother to the ongoing fentanyl epidemic created by the United States' porous border policies. \"Our bill provides billions and billions of dollars to stop fentanyl and other illicit narcotics,\" Trump said. \"We're also charging other countries like Mexico, Canada and China billions of dollars in taxes that we put on because they've allowed people that are selling fentanyl to go through their countries. Or, in the case of China, they send it here.\" On Thursday, shortly before Trump's \"big, beautiful event\" at the White House, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced new visa restrictions for the families of fentanyl traffickers. SEN. ROGER MARSHALL: TRUMP’S ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL WILL KEEP OUR BORDER THE MOST SECURE IT'S BEEN IN HISTORY \"I get irritated. I get pissed off because I'm sick of meeting angel moms and dads,\" Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, said at the event. \"You want to talk about family separation? They bury their children.\" Last month, a letter from more than 60 angel moms, dads and relatives was sent to members of Congress, urging them to pass Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\" In addition to hiring more border patrol agents and providing more funding for the border wall, the legislation would allow the addition of extra detention centers for detained migrants, increased scrutiny of unaccompanied minors' potential gang ties and speed up deportations to at least 1 million per year.

That must end now.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump hosted relatives of those killed at the hands of illegal immigrants at a White House event, urging Congress to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-spotlights-parents-who-have-lost-kids-result-open-borders-during-big-beautiful-bill-event","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/trump_angel_parents_immigration.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:11:42","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":335643008,"title":"The telling sign that Katy Perry and Orlando's relationship was over weeks before his 'single man' debut: Actor kept a low profile at star's 'tone deaf' space flight before explosive row over her 'cringeworthy' display","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Jun 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat life is REALLY like for Lucy Letby behind bars: £33 a week to spend on sweets and chocolate, more time outside her cell...and TWICE as many visits as other prisoners\n\nStarmer caves in to rebels on benefits: Sir Keir is forced into a humiliating climb-down by Labour welfare army\n\nIn a plot twist worthy of John le Carré, we reveal the grandfather of the brilliant new head of MI6 was a Nazi spy chief\n\nWar breaks out at GB News as furious staff plot to oust Eamonn Holmes: Insiders tell KATIE HIND presenter is 'utterly despised' by colleagues and reveal the moment he pushed them over the edge\n\nDAVID PATRIKARAKOS: The chilling evidence that reveals what really happened to Iran's vast stockpile of uranium... and the terrifying next move that the mad Mullahs are plotting\n\nLouis Tomlinson and girlfriend Zara McDermott put on a loved up display as they stroll hand-in-hand at Glastonbury - after THAT frosty exchange with her ex Sam Thompson\n\nJeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are ALREADY married: As bride appears in terrifyingly tight corset for star-studded Venice wedding party, insiders tell ALISON BOSHOFF the couple tied the knot a month ago\n\nI know why JoJo Siwa felt pressured into calling herself a lesbian before dating Chris Hughes: FLORENCE SCORDOULIS\n\nThe new diet that can slash dementia risk by 25 per cent and slow ageing: Scientists reveal vital details including when YOU should start following it\n\nSkinny Leonardo DiCaprio, suave Tom Brady and newly-single Orlando Bloom lead stylish male guests at Jeff Bezos' wedding\n\nBest and WORST dressed celebs at Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' wedding extravaganza in Venice\n\nBritain's best and worst beach towns revealed - with popular South Coast resort labelled 'run-down' and 'tacky'\n\nBRYONY GORDON: Truth about the shameless anti-vaxxer nurse who blamed the NHS for her daughter's cancer death\n\nImpatient driver who killed his own wife in head-on crash while late for work is jailed for 10 years\n\nCheryl Tweedy's killer stalker turns up at house to try to meet her AGAIN: Convict is back in court after breaching restraining order\n\nQUENTIN LETTS: Welcome back, PM.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy LAURA FOX FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:55 BST, 27 June 2025 |Updated:01:09 BST, 27 June 2025 \n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom's split may have come as a surprise to some, but the writing was on the wall as far back as April, when the singer made a much-criticised appearance on the Blue Origin Space Flight.\nThe actor made a low-key appearance to watch the 11-minute trip into space, and opted against taking centre stage in the sea of cameras that documented every step of the mission.\nBringing their daughter Daisy Dove to watch her mother embark on the trip, at the time it seemed like Orlando was shirking the limelight to avoid distracting from Katy's historic presence on the journey.\nBut after it was revealed that Orlando and Katy had an explosive row over the singer's 'cringe-worthy' behaviour, it seems that the star's bid to keep a low profile was to avoid drawing attention to the fact their relationship was over.\nOn Wednesday it was revealed that Katy and Orlando had split after nine years together, with the Hollywood star set to make his 'single man' debut at Jeff Bezos' star-studded wedding this weekend. \nThe couple had made their last public appearance together in March, but it was reported on Thursday that Katy had told friends at the start of the year that their relationship was over.\n\nOrlando Bloom's low-key appearance as Katy Perry's much-criticised Blue Origin space flight in April hinted their relationship was already over, weeks before their split emerged\n\nOn Wednesday it was revealed that the couple had split after nine years together, with sources since revealing their relationship has been over for months\nJoined by Lauren Sanchez, the Blue Origin space flight was originally dubbed a huge step forward for women in science, but quickly turned into a PR disaster, and was branded 'tone-deaf' due to its huge price tag.\nKaty, in particular, became the internet's punching bag for her eccentric actions, hogging the camera while holding up a daisy - a nod to her daughter - in zero gravity, before bizarrely dropping to her knees and kissing the ground on touchdown. \nLast week, a source told DailyMail.com that Katy received little to no support from Bloom who blasted the 'embarrassing' debacle during an explosive row.\n'He told her the whole thing looked ridiculous,' a source in Perry's camp told the Daily Mail. 'He said it was cringeworthy. Embarrassing. This was in the middle of a fight, and it hurt her feelings.'\n'Of course she was hurt,' the source continued. 'Imagine going to space — motherf****** space — and your partner isn't impressed. She hoped he'd be more supportive.'\nIt had been previously reported that Katy would not be attending Jeff and Lauren's wedding in Venice this weekend, due to her tour commitments in Australia, and felt irate that Orlando insisted on attending.\nSources said: 'He complains about her going to space, and then wants to go to the wedding of the people who made it possible for her to do this in the first place,' our insider said. \n'That's difficult for her to accept. They're already spiraling and now the wedding is another thing that they have to fight about.' \n\nOrlando was pictured arriving in Venice for pals Jeff and Lauren's wedding on Thursday, and he's set to make his 'single man' debut at Friday's ceremony\n\nKaty faced huge criticism for her 'cringe-worthy' behaviour during the space flight, with the singer hogging the camera with a Daisy in her hand, before kissing the ground\n\nLast week, a source told DailyMail.com that Katy received little to no support from Bloom who blasted the 'embarrassing' and 'cringe-worthy' debacle during an explosive row\n\n 'Newly single' Orlando Bloom kisses Kim Kardashian in Venice- after he was caught 'checking her out' \nOrlando was pictured arriving in Venice for pals Jeff and Lauren's wedding on Thursday, and he's set to make his 'single man' debut at Friday's ceremony.\nIt was claimed on Wednesday that Orlando and Katy had called it quits following weeks of escalating tension after nearly a decade of their on–off relationship, six years of being engaged and one child together. \nFor weeks fans have been speculating all is not well between the pair after Katy, 40, was seen without her engagement ring.\nYet the pop star - who is currently on a world tour - and Orlando have refused to comment on the speculation, with sources claiming they were hoping to work through their rough patch for the sake of their daughter Daisy Dove, four. \nKaty and Orlando were last pictured together at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in March, where they posed for red carpet snaps. \nThe pair did not seem particularly comfortable in each other's company, however, body language expert Judi James noted. \nNews of their split came shortly after Katy's disastrous space flight, drawing significant backlash amid viral videos trolling her world tour and her poor-performing album 143.\nIn the wake of their split, it was reported that Katy and Orlando's relationship had been over for months.\nA source close to the couple told The Sun: 'Katy confided in friends at the start of the year that their relationship was as good as done.\n'They decided to hold off on announcing anything in case things improved between them, because they are desperate to stay together for the sake of their daughter.' \nYet the insider claimed that their busy work schedules have made it impossible to work things out and that Katy wanted to send a 'clear message' by removing her engagement ring. \nThe source concluded: 'It's been a hard year so far. They wanted to wait until the tour is over before they made their split official, although Katy has grown tired of the situation.'\n\nIt was claimed on Wednesday that Orlando and Katy had called it quits following weeks of escalating tension after nearly a decade of their on–off relationship (pictured in March)\nFor now, Katy is reportedly staying 'distracted' with her tour and caring for her and Orlando's four-year-old daughter Daisy, who was seen joining her while the 48-year-old English actor was elsewhere. \nHowever, the Lord Of The Rings star later returned to Australia — where Katy has spent the month of June on tour — and reunited with his fiancée and daughter over the past week.\nDespite once again being on the same continent as her fiancé, Katy has been spotted multiple times without her wedding ring in Australia. \nOn Monday, DailyMail.com reported that Katy and Orlando were renting out their $30 million mansion in Montecito, California, to Chris Pratt and his wife Katherine Schwarzenegger, which only intensified rumors of a breakup.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe telling sign that Katy Perry and Orlando's relationship was over weeks before his 'single man' debut: Actor kept a low profile at star's 'tone deaf' space flight before explosive row over her 'cringeworthy' display\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

In an order Thursday, a state appeals court in New York said that Chesebro's criminal conduct, namely conspiring to commit filing false documents in connection with efforts to negate Trump's 2020 defeat in Georgia to President Joe Biden, “undercuts the very notion of our constitutional democracy that he, as an attorney, swore an oath to uphold.” Chesebro was first admitted to practice law in New York in 2007. His disbarment is effective immediately, the order states. Follow live politics coverage here Chesebro struck a plea deal with Georgia prosecutors in 2023, when he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after being indicted on seven counts. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which included indictments against him, Chesebro and 17 others. The case stalled this year, in large part due to Trump's election win in November and the removal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as prosecutor. The court, which had initially suspended Chesebro from practicing law in the state last year, said in Thursday's order that Chesebro's \"cavalier attitude regarding his actions, particularly in the face of his extensive background in the areas of constitutional and election law, largely aggravates his conduct.\" According to the order, an official tasked with putting together a report on evidence and testimony also disputed an argument from Chesebro's attorney that it was incorrect to characterize his client as the architect of Trump’s plans to overturn the election. The court said that the official noted that “despite efforts to combat the description that respondent was the ‘architect’ of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the testimony and documentary evidence produced at the hearing fully support such a claim, inasmuch as respondent’s legal analysis and implementation guidelines fueled the effort.” An attorney for Chesebro did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. Chesebro is one of many Trump-allied attorneys who were penalized for their involvement in the president's election interference efforts. Rudy Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., and Jenna Ellis was prohibited from practicing law in Colorado for three years after she pleaded guilty in connection with Trump's efforts to subvert the election.","summary":"Chesebro in 2023 pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents in the Georgia election interference case against Trump and his allies.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/former-trump-lawyer-kenneth-chesebro-disbarred-new-york-2020-election-rcna215425","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231019-kenneth-Chesebro-ew-650p-c182b9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:08:57","author":"Zoë Richards","authors":["Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.526},{"id":335638490,"title":"Gencatan senjata Iran-Israel: Erdogan desak usaha sama tamatkan konflik di Gaza, Russia-Ukraine","text":"ANKARA: Presiden Turkiye, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, semalam memuji usaha Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, dalam mencapai gencatan senjata antara Iran dengan Israel, lapor Anadolu Ajansi (AA).\n\n\"Saya memberitahu Trump bahawa - merujuk kepada usahanya dalam gencatan senjata antara Israel dengan Iran - tahap usaha yang sama juga diharapkan untuk membantu menamatkan konflik di Gaza dan perang Russia-Ukraine.\n\n\"Penutupan Selat Hormuz akan menyebabkan masalah besar.

Read part 1 here.\nSoon after Hong Kong reopened in early 2023 as harsh pandemic restrictions were finally lifted, veteran lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee embarked on a solo mission to the West.\nVisiting Brussels to meet European Union officials in September 2023, she sought to explain fundamental political and legal changes in the city and how it would not be deterred by its critics.\nBeijing had reshaped the political landscape, first by imposing a sweeping national security law in 2020, then by introducing major electoral reforms to ensure that only “patriots” ruled the city.\nBy then too, a dark shadow had settled over the city, blanketing more nuanced and varied views about Hong Kong into one coagulated negative narrative that it had become a police state. With the national security law, no one was safe.\nDiplomats, bankers and business people were told to carry burner phones when entering Hong Kong. The city’s future was over, its past a romanticised era where democracy reigned, or so this gloomy tale went.\nIt did not help that Hong Kong residents had also left the city in droves, drawn by easier pathways to emigration laid out by Western nations and partly because of the pandemic restrictions.\n\nIp said from the get-go she was intent on debunking claims by many Western countries that the national security legislation – outlawing acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces – had eroded the city’s freedoms.\n“You have to be prepared to answer questions on human rights, and no dodging of tough political questions, to engage in effective communication,” said Ip, convenor of the Executive Council, the government’s top advisory body.\nThe next year, she brought along a team of Hong Kong figures to Britain on a similar drive and met Catherine West, the British Indo-Pacific minister.\n“You have to have the courage to engage in a lively discussion of tough issues … if they are convinced that you are a true believer in what you are saying, you command a certain amount of respect,” said Ip who has other trips lined up in future.\nFor officials like her and other businessmen-led delegations, these so-called truth-telling tours were important, observers said, and each in their own way had done a lot to slowly help Hong Kong shed the cloak of negativity dragging it down over the past few years.\nWhat most people failed to understand, they said, was why Beijing had lost patience and imposed the law. The change came about after several months of increasingly violent anti-government protests in 2019 that began over an unpopular extradition bill.\nThe introduction of the law brought all protests in 2019 to a halt almost immediately. Key opposition leaders, former lawmakers and pro-democracy activists were rounded up, with many detained on various charges related to national security.\nPolitical parties and civic rights groups soon disbanded one after the other.\nOne consequence of the law too has been the end of a June 4 commemorative vigil at Victoria Park to remember the Tiananmen Square crackdown. People were asked instead to remember the episode privately and protested at their own risk.\nA much-delayed domestic national security law, commonly referred to as Article 23, was finally enacted in March last year, as required under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.\nLast week, Beijing’s point man on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, warned that the city still faced “complex and severe” national security threats that it should be vigilant about, while calling on it to leverage its unique strengths to boost connectivity with the world and integrate with the country.\nFive years on, many believe the worst is over and Hong Kong is recovering, as seen from the influx of tourists and professionals eager to visit and take part in the slew of mega-events staged over the past one to two years.\n\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu had said repeatedly his administration would be “fully focused” on economic development and improving people’s livelihoods, with the foundations to ensure stability and security already established.\nAn annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce this year also found that nearly 80 per cent of respondents had no intention of relocating their headquarters elsewhere in the next three years despite concerns over US-China ties.\nMore of them were more confident in Hong Kong’s rule of law than in previous years.\nIp, chairwoman of the New People’s Party, puts it more positively: “Hong Kong has bounced back.”\nShe pointed to its competitive standing in recent global rankings for economic freedom, international competitiveness and universities.\nWestern media had also become “kinder” to the city, she said, shifting their coverage to topics such as the growing number of IPOs and British band Coldplay’s sold-out concerts at Kai Tak Sports Park.\n“Through the efforts of the government and the community, including the business community, universities, think tanks, and everybody working together, we are on an upwards trajectory,” she said.\n“So you can’t say that our obsession, so-called obsession, with national security has hurt our recovery.”\nVictor Dawes, the immediate past president of the Bar Association who had attended international conferences and events during his tenure, acknowledged the overseas interest in the national security law.\n“It is natural that there are concerns given the geopolitical situation,” he said.\nBut Dawes said outsiders’ perception of Hong Kong had improved five years on, as more people visited the city to understand the situation on the ground.\n\nEven as perceptions change, academics and several business leaders told the Post that rebuilding Hong Kong’s reputation would remain challenging for as long as US-China tensions existed and the national security law could be exploited as a soft target to criticise it.\n“The standing of Hong Kong has decreased in European countries over the past five years, predominantly owing to the national security legislation and the management of the pandemic, and has not significantly improved in the past two to three years,” said Martin Sebena, honorary lecturer at the University of Hong Kong’s department of politics and public administration.\n“While the geopolitical situation changes quite fast – rendering certain views of Hong Kong out of touch with reality – perceptions change much more slowly.”\nBut one key takeaway for many whom the Post spoke to was that the city still had options to forge ties with other friendlier countries, especially those in the Global South, including in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The city’s sophisticated financial and legal system and connectivity to mainland China remained unbeatable draws, many said.\n‘Hong Kong’s standing took a hit’\nAfter Beijing imposed the national security law, the UK, Canada and Australia introduced new pathways for Hongkongers who wished to emigrate.\nThe United States ended Hong Kong’s preferential trading status and went on to impose several rounds of sanctions on Hong Kong officials, including city leader John Lee Ka-chiu and Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok.\nAt least six foreign non-permanent judges from Britain and Australia resigned from Hong Kong’s top court, under mounting pressure in their home countries.\nProminent Western officials stayed away too.\nA European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Post: “How many ministerial officials from the US and Europe have visited Hong Kong these five years? Not many that I can recall.\n“Many declined invitations, even for non-political and cultural events, largely to avoid appearing too close to officials in a regime governed by draconian laws.”\nA clutch of Western political figures visited the city, including former British trade minister Dominic Johnson and former US vice-president Mike Pence.\nA Post check found that between July 2023 and this month, city leader Lee had welcomed senior officials mainly from Asean nations, the Middle East and developing countries such as Egypt and Kazakhstan.\n\nHong Kong’s network of 14 overseas Economic and Trade Offices encountered challenges in promoting the city’s interests, coming under intensified scrutiny.\nA Hong Kong manager at the London office was arrested for alleged espionage, and the US has kept up threats to shut down the three offices there.\nHong Kong responded to the international backlash by calling the criticisms “absurd”, “despicable” and a form of “bullying”.\nMeanwhile, Lee’s administration embarked on campaigns to “tell good stories” about the city to the world and woo visitors through a massive “Hello Hong Kong” tourism campaign.\nThe efforts appear to have paid off.\nHong Kong secured third place in the World Competitiveness Ranking by Switzerland’s International Institute for Management Development this year – its first return to the top three since 2019.\nIt led global listings with a sevenfold surge in IPOs during the first five months this year. Last year, it reclaimed its position as the world’s freest economy from Singapore in the Fraser Institute’s “Economic Freedom of the World” report.\n“The city’s international image is indeed improving, as most businesspeople know well how politics plays its role in today’s world,” said lawmaker and finance veteran Rock Chen Chung-nin.\nHe said his business partners from the UK, US and Switzerland told him that the city had become lively again with big events such as the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and large-scale international exhibitions.\n“But it still takes time for the city to restore its previous international reputation, especially when it is now stuck in between the wrestling between China and the US,” he added.\nRebuilding reputations and issuing rebuttals\nBut President Donald Trump’s return to the White House marked a renewed heightening of US-China tensions and has cast a shadow on Hong Kong’s drive to recovery, observers said.\nApart from launching a new tariff war that has affected the city, his administration also targeted Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings’ control of ports at the Panama Canal.\nIn March, tycoon Li Ka-shing’s conglomerate said it was selling the two Panama facilities along with its global port operations to a BlackRock-led consortium, sparking a backlash of condemnation from Beijing, which called it a “betrayal of all Chinese people”.\nCiting strategic national interests, regulators have since launched an antitrust probe.\nThe deal cast into the spotlight Beijing’s concept of “holistic national security”, which spans political, economic, cultural, social, technological and military security, among other fronts.\nThe sale is said to be on the brink of collapse, with a July 27 negotiation deadline looming.\n“Trump is trying to tell the world that there is no such thing as ‘one country, two systems’ and Hong Kong should be treated the same as the mainland,” said Lau Siu-kai, a consultant at the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank.\n\nLau added that the West was not the entire international community when it came to the city’s dealings with the world.\n“It also includes countries in the Middle East, Central Asia and others which Hong Kong might not have placed much emphasis on in the past. These countries have no problem with Hong Kong enacting the national security laws and welcome the city for closer ties,” he said.\nBut he anticipated national security would remain a contentious issue if US-China relations continued to worsen.\nA senior official overseeing publicity for the national security law told the Post the government believed it was better to invite foreigners and influencers to visit Hong Kong for business and cultural events and “see for themselves”, than to go on any publicity drives overseas.\nRecently, American-Chinese comedian Jimmy O. Yang spent a month in Hong Kong for five sold-out “homecoming” shows, while also becoming one of more than 100 influencers and celebrities from 13 countries and regions invited by the Tourism Board to promote the city.\nBut the government insider said it was important to maintain the “Rebuttal Team” to counter any malicious attacks and smears by Western countries, despite the risk that a hardline approach might not prove persuasive.\n“Rebuttal is in our DNA,” she said. “Our current strategies of submitting concise, timely op-eds to Western media are beginning to see results.”\nBut actual visits and encounters appear to be the best way forward.\n\nInaki Amate, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said he had noticed rising European business interest in the city over the past two years.\n“We’re starting to see that companies are realising that if the US market is closing or is becoming harder and harder, [they need] alternative markets. They are revisiting Asia and Hong Kong as an entry point to these markets,” he said.\nAs for the national security laws, he said European businesses welcomed the stability that had returned and suggested moving beyond repeated discussion of their impact.\nSoutheast Asian business chambers were on Hong Kong’s side from the get-go. Gan Khai Choon, head of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macau, said its members would have found it “increasingly difficult to do business and trade in Hong Kong” if the national security law had not been enacted.\nBut he added: “National security is dependent in the long run on people’s well-being and feeling of satisfaction, so we think Hong Kong should also pay great attention to livelihood issues and carry out appropriate reforms to realise its full potential.”\nAmate urged Hong Kong to highlight its unique position under the one country, two systems governance principle, noting that this special status allowed foreign businesses to operate differently than on the mainland.\nHKU’s Sebena, who had previously worked in the finance industry in Switzerland, Australia and Hong Kong, said: “Hong Kong combines deep capital markets with what appears to be a more stable and predictable business environment, which is attractive especially for non-Western companies looking for funding and other financial services.\n“Hong Kong’s reputation could be damaged if Western governments approached it from a normative perspective; however, under the current US president’s rather transactional approach, the city should be able to better address reputational risks.”\n\nDuring his visit last week to mark the fifth anniversary of the law, Xia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city had entered into a new stage of development, having achieved stability after the convulsions of the 2019 protests.\nCalling on Lee to take charge, Xia said the chief executive and his team were “the masters of Hong Kong”, while Beijing offered robust support for the city to maintain its “high level of openness”.\nExecutive Council convenor Ip said the city had achieved a lot more in the past few years after decades of policy gridlock. It had moved on financial centre reforms, for example, and she welcomed greater debate in the legislature to ensure better policies.\nOn the oft-heard lament that the city had changed, Ip had this to say: “Hong Kong has always had an identity issue. Before the national security law, the West would pretend we will continue to be a child of the West because we have been under British rule for 160 years.\n“But, of course, that is not sustainable in the long term because we are part of China. Culture follows power; culture follows economic influence.”\nAdditional reporting by Jess Ma","summary":"In the second of a two-part series on the national security law, we look at how the city has had to battle a negative narrative over the past five years.

Cryptocurrency values have surged since his election in November, which has also energised business activity in the sector.\nLast week, the US Senate passed a bill regulating the use of stablecoins, called the Genius Act, after Hong Kong passed its own law on the assets in May. The Hong Kong ordinance will take effect on August 1.\nIt shows that the “global race for digital assets innovation is well under way”, Fei said.\nThe policy statement introduced what the FSTB called the “Leap” framework, aiming to streamline the city’s legal and regulatory framework for digital assets, expand digital asset product offerings, advance use cases and foster industry talent.\nThese measures signify that Hong Kong is now “not merely a testing ground for digital assets”, but is transitioning towards increasing institutionalisation, scaling and globalisation, according to Xiao Feng, chairman and CEO of HashKey Group, a licensed crypto exchange operator.\nThe city’s latest policy statement placed a heavy focus on the tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), the process of putting representations of traditional assets on a blockchain. The city “strives to build a more flourishing DA ecosystem” that will “bring benefits to both the economy and society”, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said in a statement on Tuesday.\nOne of the biggest proposals in the new document is for legislators to make tax concessions on profits from digital assets, bringing them into parity with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.\n“RWA tokenisation takes centre stage in the second digital assets policy statement, which makes sense since many predict that tokenisation will grow into a multi-trillion dollar market before the decade’s end,” Fei said.\nMeanwhile, the city is charging ahead with stablecoin development, which industry players are exploring as a cross-border payment tool.\nHong Kong’s new digital asset blueprint will “strengthen market integrity, enable diverse activities and high-value transactions”, said Tian Gan, CEO of China Asset Management Hong Kong. With the new regulation, which requires licences for issuers, stablecoins will help the city’s Web3 ecosystem “reach a critical breakthrough moment”, Gan said.","summary":"Hong Kong is intensifying its bid to become a global digital asset (DA) hub with the release of an updated policy statement focused on accelerating stablecoin use and tokenisation efforts, amid renewed momentum in the US this year.\n“The government’s highly anticipated Policy Statement 2.0, aimed at establishing Hong Kong as a global digital assets hub, comes at a time when Trump 2.0 is trying to make America the ‘crypto capital of the planet’,” said Andrew Fei, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3315967/hong-kong-sharpens-crypto-hub-focus-amid-rising-global-competition-new-blueprint","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/26/ffdda497-9581-49d5-8211-82449a5407e6_89134aec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:00:16","author":"Xinmei Shen","authors":["Xinmei Shen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.048},{"id":335636490,"title":"China’s concerns expose Nato divisions as Tokyo liaison office shelved","text":"Nato has shelved plans to open a liaison office in Tokyo, dealing a symbolic blow to Japan’s hopes of cementing the alliance’s presence in the Indo-Pacific and exposing divisions among member states over how directly they should confront China’s rising power.\nThe proposal had been strongly backed by former prime minister Fumio Kishida’s government, which viewed the planned office as a step towards closer coordination with Nato and its partners in the region, including Australia, South Korea and New Zealand.\nBut officials confirmed on the sidelines of the alliance’s ongoing summit in The Hague that the plan had been dropped – at least for now.\nAnalysts say the decision is unlikely to derail growing military cooperation between Japan and key Nato members, but note that it will be perceived in Tokyo as a missed opportunity to formalise Japan’s role as a trusted partner in global security.\n“Yes, there will be disappointment in Japan as they were very much in favour of this, but Tokyo knows there are many ways to enhance the relationship with Nato rather than through the opening of an office,” said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, associate professor at Tokyo International University’s Institute for International Strategy.\n“It is not clear exactly why this decision was reached and there will be questions over whether Nato did not want an office in the Asia-Pacific region or Japan specifically,” he said. “But things can change in the future and it would be fairly easy to resurrect the plan again.”\n\nThe idea for a Nato office in Tokyo was first raised in January 2023, when then Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg visited Tokyo and held talks with Kishida. At the time, Japanese officials framed the initiative as a communications hub to facilitate dialogue between Nato and its Indo‑Pacific partners.\nFor Nato, the office would have underscored growing strategic alignment with Japan – the United States’ most prominent security ally in Asia. Tokyo signalled its seriousness by relocating its Nato mission from the Japanese embassy in Belgium to a dedicated office inside the alliance’s Brussels headquarters.\nWhile Japan has never sought membership in Nato, it has stepped up efforts in recent years to project itself as a reliable global actor, taking part in joint exercises and security consultations, particularly as concerns mount over China’s assertiveness and North Korea’s weapons programmes.\nHowever, some analysts believe the shelving of the Tokyo office reflects broader geopolitical recalibrations within the alliance – in particular, a shift in Washington’s strategic outlook under President Donald Trump and growing concern in European capitals about provoking Beijing.\n“I think it is apparent that the present US administration has a simplistic view that Europe should focus on what is happening in Europe and Asian countries on Asia,” said Robert Dujarric, co-director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at the Tokyo campus of Temple University.\nGiven Washington’s pre-eminence in the organisation, along with other members’ desire to avoid offending Trump out of concern that he might follow through with earlier threats to withdraw from the alliance, shelving the Tokyo office plan should not come as a surprise, he added.\n\nOther countries had also expressed reservations, he pointed out, with both France and Germany opposed on the grounds that they wanted to avoid further antagonising China, a key trade partner.\nAnd while the Japanese government has made no statement on the Nato decision, conservative media outlets were furious when French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his opposition back in 2023 and are likely to hold the same position now.\nIn July 2023, the Financial Times quoted Macron as saying, “If … we push Nato to enlarge the spectrum and the geography, we will make a big mistake.”\nPhilippe Setton, the French ambassador to Tokyo, echoed the French leader’s position, saying, “Although we do not support the opening of a Tokyo office, we do believe it is important to strengthen the cooperative relationship between Nato and Japan.”\nThe conservative Sankei newspaper at the time condemned that position, declaring in an editorial, “France shares responsibility for peace and stability in the world. As its leader, President Macron should not cower before China.”\nThe editorial added that if France “adopts a policy of turning a blind eye to the growing Chinese threat, it will throw the unified position of the Group of Seven industrialised nations into disarray”.\nWith questions raised over the commitment of some European nations to Ukraine in its war with Russia, there is concern in Tokyo that many governments will be even less inclined to support Taiwan should mainland China invade, leaving Japan in a precarious position.","summary":"Nato has shelved plans to open a liaison office in Tokyo, dealing a symbolic blow to Japan’s hopes of cementing the alliance’s presence in the Indo-Pacific and exposing divisions among member states over how directly they should confront China’s rising power.\nThe proposal had been strongly backed by former prime minister Fumio Kishida’s government, which viewed the planned office as a step towards closer coordination with Nato and its partners in the region, including Australia, South Korea and...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3315954/blow-japans-indo-pacific-hopes-nato-shelves-tokyo-office-plan","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/26/f3b2141a-8c6b-46ac-ab55-744fc20a743e_db4f794c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-27 00:00:12","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.003},{"id":335637830,"title":"Trump says his duties bring US $88 bln in revenue","text":"WASHINGTON, June 27. /TASS/.

Elsewhere on the site, other vague terms are now being used, describing the $499 phone as boasting an “American-Proud Design” and “brought to life right here in the U.S.A.”\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission requires that items labeled “Made in USA” be “all or virtually all” produced in the U.S. and several firms have been sued over misusing the term.\n\nThe Trump Organization has not explained the change and has not responded to a request for comment. Neither did an outside public relations firm handling the Trumps’ mobile phone business, including a request to confirm a statement made to another media outlet.\n\n“T1 phones are proudly being made in America,” said Trump Mobile spokesman Chris Walker, according to USA Today. “Speculation to the contrary is simply inaccurate.”\n\nThe language change on the website was first reported by the news site The Verge.\n\nAn expert on cell phone technology, IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo, said he’s not surprised the Trump family has dropped the “Made in the USA” label because it’s nearly impossible to build one here given the higher cost and lack of infrastructure to do so.\n\nBut, of course, you can claim to do it.\n\n“Whether it is possible or not to build this phone in the US depends on what you consider ‘build,’” Jeronimo said. “If it’s a question of assembling components and targeting small volumes, I suppose it’s somehow possible. You can always get the components from China and assemble them by hand somewhere.”\n\n“You’re going to have phones that are made right here in the United States of America,” said Trump’s son Eric to Fox News recently, adding, “It’s about time we bring products back to our great country.”\n\nThe Trump family has flown the American flag before with Trump-branded products of suspicious origin, including its “God Bless the USA” Bibles, which an Associated Press investigation last year showed were printed in China.\n\nThe Trump phone is part of a bigger family mobile business plan designed to tap into MAGA enthusiasm for the president. The two sons running the business, Eric and Don Jr., announced earlier this month that they would offer mobile phone plans for $47.45 a month, a reference to their father’s status as the 45th and 47th president. The call center, they said, will be in the U.S., too.\n\n“You’re not calling up call centers in Bangladesh,” Eric Trump said on Fox News. “We’re doing it out of St. Louis, Missouri.”\n\nThe new service has been blasted by government ethics experts for a conflict of interest, given that President Donald Trump oversees the Federal Communications Commission that regulates the business and is investigating phone service companies that are now Trump Mobile rivals.\n\nTrump has also threatened to punish cell phone maker Apple, now a direct competitor, threatening to slap 25% tariffs on devices because of its plans to make most of its U.S. iPhones in India.","summary":"The Trump Organization has not explained the change.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/06/26/trump-phone-drops-made-in-the-usa/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_Mobile_Phone_Company_49750_9fa909.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 23:54:18","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":335641124,"title":"SpaceX crane collapse in Texas being investigated by OSHA","text":"A SpaceX crane collapse at the company's Starbase, Texas facility on Tuesday has prompted an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency told CNBC in an email.\n\nThe crane collapse was captured in a livestream by Lab Padre on YouTube, a SpaceX-focused channel.

Through DOGE, Musk sought to reduce federal agency budgets, personnel and even certain regulations, limiting their ability to investigate and enforce existing laws.\n\nThe SpaceX crane collapse followed a string of explosions and other setbacks for the company's Starship Super Heavy launch vehicle, the largest rocket ever flown, which is key to Musk's ambition to transport equipment and people to Mars.\n\nEnvironmental activists in the U.S. and Mexico say those explosions have harmed sensitive habitat, wildlife and marine life. SpaceX said, in posts online, that its activity had not harmed the surrounding area during the most recent explosion on June 18.\n\nStarship was previously expected to play an important part in NASA's effort to return to the moon. SpaceX had earned more than $20 billion in federal government contracts mostly from the Department of Defense and NASA.\n\nMeanwhile, NASA's proposed lean budget for the next year has not yet been authorized by Congress and could impact the agency's business with SpaceX, and shift the focus of its missions.\n\nMusk, who was President Donald Trump's biggest financial backer, sought to appoint his friend Jared Issacman, a commercial astronaut, to lead NASA under the second Trump administration.

Omar Navarro, a failed four-time congressional candidate accused of funneling thousands of dollars of campaign funds for his personal use, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a single count of wire fraud as part of a plea agreement. Navarro failed to win a congressional seat in multiple campaigns against Rep. Maxine Waters, but drew the attention of high-profile Republican and right-wing political figures like Roger Stone, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Alex Jones, helping him raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in his unsuccessful campaigns. But the Republican candidate in 2023 was charged with 43 counts of wire fraud and misusing campaign funds, funneling tens of thousands of dollars for his personal use through his mother and a close friend. As part of his deal with prosecutors, Navarro agreed to plead guilty to a single count of wire fraud, a felony, which forfeits his right to vote or hold office, putting an end to a controversial political career where he managed to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations and gain the support of figures like Michael Flynn and Herman Cain without ever winning an election. David Evans, Navarro's attorney, declined to comment. According to the initial complaint, Navarro had no other source of income other than campaign funds, but between Jan. 2018 and July 2020, prosecutors allege he deposited more than $100,000 in cash to his personal accounts. Investigators found that Navarro's mother, Dora Asghari, 59, and his friend, Zacharias Diamantides-Abel, 34, would often cash campaign payments. When checks were deposited into their bank accounts, they often withdrew the money quickly to share the money with Navarro. Federal prosecutors alleged Navarro used money from campaign donations for trips to Las Vegas, wine country, and to pay for his legal defense in a 2020 stalking case. According to the initial complaint, Diamantides-Abel and Asghari received $49,260 and $58,625 respectively, from Navarro's failed campaigns between Dec. 2017 and June 2020. On Wednesday, Asghari pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during their investigation. Diamantides-Abel has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both will be sentenced at future dates. But Navarro's mother and friend weren't his only avenues for cashing in donated funds. Federal prosecutors allege Navarro set up a sham charity, called the United Latino Foundation, to embezzle money for his personal use. He gained attention in 2016 when he ran against Waters, then again in 2018, 2020 and 2022. Despite the notoriety, he consistently received less than 25% of the vote in the elections. Navarro has also been an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, and has promoted conspiracy theories on his social media accounts. In 2020, Navarro posted on Twitter the slogan of the QAnon conspiracy, and on social media promoted Pizzagate, the conspiracy that a Washington D.C. pizza shop was involved in the sexual trafficking of children. That conspiracy theory ultimately led to a shooting. Earlier this month, Navarro took to social media to say the charges against him were politically motivated. \"I seriously need help,\" he posted on X. \"I don't have connections or anyone who can help. This whole case is politically motivated. My only crime is standing up against [Maxine Waters] and running for congress.\" This isn't the first time Navarro has found himself in legal trouble, with his legal woes coinciding with his runs for office. In 2016, he was sentenced in Orange County to a day in jail and 18 months probation for placing a tracking device on his estranged wife's car. In 2017, he resigned as a Torrance traffic commissioner after video showed him in the back seat of a car while the driver and another passenger pepper-sprayed people at a pro-sanctuary cities rally in Cudahy.

The new probe takes aim at the UC 2030 Capacity Plan, which aims to swell the numbers of UC graduates and promote racial diversity in student bodies.\n\n“Public employers are bound by federal laws that prohibit racial and other employment discrimination,” Dhillon said in a statement. “Institutional directives that use race- and sex-based hiring practices expose employers to legal risk under federal law.”\n\nDhillon contended in the letter to Drake that “we have reason to believe” the UC 2030 Plan may include sex- and race-based hiring quotas for employees and potentially “runs afoul of federal law.” But she also noted that “we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation” and that “we intend to consider all relevant information” in the probe.\n\nRachel Zaentz, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President said the university system will work “in good faith with the Department of Justice as it conducts its investigation.”\n\n“The University of California is committed to fair and lawful processes in all of our programs and activities, consistent with federal and state anti-discrimination laws,” Zaentz said. “The University also aims to foster a campus environment where everyone is welcomed and supported.”\n\nThe UC 2030 Plan states in part that “California is a majority-minority state, but underrepresented groups (i.e., Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander, Indigenous) are less likely to graduate from college and have the economic benefits associated with a college degree; the pandemic further exacerbated these historic inequities.”\n\nIt goes on to say that “UC will seize its generational opportunity to become a Hispanic-serving and minority-serving system” and that UC had a “a generational opportunity to grow and diversify the faculty.”\n\nIn 2020, the UC system adopted a policy statement that pledged “to foster a working and learning environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive,” but also said it “shall not, in any of these processes, use race, ethnicity or gender quotas that must be achieved, or caps that cannot be exceeded.”\n\nUC’s policy statement against race quotas came the same year that California voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have repealed Proposition 209. The 1996 initiative banned the government from giving preferential treatment in public employment, education and contracting based on race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized and cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion-oriented hiring practices. This is the latest federal probe into the UC system and individual campuses.\n\nIn March, the Department of Justice announced an investigation of four California universities, including UC Berkeley and Stanford, to determine their compliance with a landmark Supreme Court decision two years ago that outlawed race-based affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nEarlier that month, the department began investigating the University of California over claims the university system allowed an “antisemitic hostile work environment” on its campuses.\n\nAnd in April, the Trump administration subpoenaed personal information of hundreds of UC Berkeley professors who signed petitions during escalating Israel-Hamas campus protests.\n\nDhillon is a longtime Trump acolyte and firebrand Bay Area attorney who is one of California’s most prominent Republicans. In her post leading the Civil Rights Division, she leads the Justice Department’s enforcement of civil and constitutional rights. Trump praised her willingness to challenge “woke policies” when announcing her nomination in December.","summary":"Led by California Republican, the DoJ is investigating possible employment discrimination at the University of California.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/26/trump-administration-to-investigate-university-of-californias-hiring-practices/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SJM-L-FOLOPROTEST-1108-1_65b8ae.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 23:47:46","author":"Grant Stringer","authors":["Grant Stringer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":335636300,"title":"Nike plans to reduce China production to soften US tariff blow, shares jump - Reuters","text":"SummaryCompaniesNike to reduce reliance on China for US-bound productsFourth quarter sales fall less than expectedCompany's running category returns to growth, CFO saysNike has ramped up marketing spending\n\nJune 26 (Reuters) - Nike (NKE.N), opens new tab said it would cut its reliance on production in China to mitigate the impact from U.S. tariffs on imports, and forecast a smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter revenue, sending its shares up 11% in extended trading.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports from key trading partners could add around $1 billion to Nike's costs, company executives said on a post-earnings call after the sportswear giant topped estimates for fourth-quarter results.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nChina, subject to the biggest tariff increases imposed by Trump, accounts for about 16% of the shoes Nike imports into the United States, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said.\n\nBut the company aims to cut the figure to a \"high single-digit percentage range\" by the end of May 2026 as it shifts production to other countries.\n\nConsumer goods is one of the most affected areas by the tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies, but Nike's executives said they were focused on cutting the financial pain.\n\nNike will \"evaluate\" corporate cost reductions to deal with the tariff impact, Friend said.

This has proved to be a much safer choice than actually standing up to him. Just ask Volodymyr Zelensky. Or Angela Merkel. Or Mike Pence. In Trump’s first term, Poland proposed to name a new permanent U.S. military installation Fort Trump in his honor. Israel thanked him for recognizing its occupation of the Golan Heights by unveiling a new settlement called Trump Heights. At this point in the Trump era, the path of over-the-top praise has been well-trodden by everyone from Lindsey Graham to the late Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, who, in 2018, nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing a nuclear-disarmament deal with North Korea that did not, in fact, happen. They know what we all know by now: Trump is a reverse-Machiavelli who prefers the praise of the flatterer, no matter how insincere, to the hard counsel of unpleasant truth.\nBut, even in the voluminous catalogue of world leaders who have engaged in ego-wilting acts of Trump sycophantism, this week’s performance by Mark Rutte stands out. Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO and former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, hosted the American President on Tuesday and Wednesday in The Hague for the alliance’s annual summit. To be fair, this was no easy assignment. Trump, a longtime NATO skeptic, threatened to pull out of the alliance altogether at its 2018 gathering; he began his second term demanding billions more in defense spending from NATO allies. Otherwise, he said at one of his 2024 campaign rallies, the alliance’s main adversary, Russia, ought to be free to “do whatever the hell they want” to any country that didn’t pay up. In response, Rutte and the allies designed the summit around avoiding a blowup with Trump—agreeing in advance to his demand for a new goal of five per cent of G.D.P. to be spent by members annually on their defense budgets, pre-negotiating the summit communiqué so that it could not be derailed by a last-minute Trump tantrum, and making the formal sessions as short as possible. “I would call this ‘the Trump Summit,’ ” Marco Rubio, Trump’s dual-hatted Secretary of State and national-security adviser, bragged before the official meeting had even begun.\nEven after watching the months of anxious buildup that went into hosting Trump, however, I was not fully prepared for Rutte to launch NATO so robustly into what may become known as its MAGA era. The first sign of where Rutte was headed came from Trump himself, who, before leaving for The Hague, posted on his social-media account a text message from the secretary-general that was so florid in its praise that I might not have believed it was real had NATO officials not confirmed it. Rutte hailed the “truly extraordinary” and “decisive action” that Trump had taken against Iran over the weekend, launching air strikes aimed at destroying its nuclear program, “something no one else dared to do.” He promised “another big success” awaited Trump at the summit. On Wednesday morning, the secretary-general followed up with a photo op alongside Trump; his language during the press conference was, if anything, even more worshipful. “He is a man of strength, but also a man of peace,” Rutte enthused, as Trump sat practically beaming next to him. He then announced that Trump was personally responsible for a trillion dollars in “extra aggregate defense spending” in his first term, before crediting Trump with “the big splash” at this year’s summit, the new five-per-cent threshold for defense spending. “This would not have happened if you had not been elected,” Rutte said. “So I want to thank you.” Trump beamed some more.\nAfter Rutte finished speaking, Rubio turned the discussion back to Iran and the controversy of the day—a leaked preliminary U.S. intelligence report that, to Trump’s fury, found that the air strikes might have only delayed Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon by a matter of months. Still, Rubio insisted, “This was a complete and total obliteration,” adopting Trump’s O-word as his own. To a veteran Trump-watcher, this was a sign that the press conference was about to take its inevitable partisan turn; rants about the evils of the “fake news” and the traitorous deep-state intelligence community were clearly soon to come. Rutte could have sat there and said nothing, the obvious course for a nonpartisan European security official, but instead he interrupted Rubio, just to make it clear how much Trump himself deserved credit. “Marco, can I just alert you to one other aspect?” Rutte said. “So, the great thing is you took out the nuclear capability of Iran. This was crucial. You did it in a way which is extremely impressive, but the signal sent to the rest of the world that this President, when it comes to it, yes, he’s a man of peace. But, if necessary, he is willing to use strength, the enormous strength of the American military.”\nWhen the President started talking again, Rutte listened without interruption as Trump accused CNN, MSNBC, and the Times of being “scum” for daring to report about the intel assessment. He also sat quietly when Trump mentioned how he had talked on the phone with the “very nice” Vladimir Putin. I wondered what the NATO members thought of that, at a summit where they were pledging to spend trillions of dollars more on their own defenses over the next decade in the hopes of deterring the “very nice” man from invading them.\nFinally, eighteen minutes into this remarkable display, Rutte offered what will no doubt become his most famous act of strategic self-emasculation. A day earlier, before leaving for the NATO summit, Trump had fumed to the cameras about Iran and Israel not sticking to a ceasefire deal that he announced they’d reached on Monday night. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing,” he said. During his photo op with Rutte in The Hague, Trump referenced his intervention in what he characterized as a “big fight like two kids in a schoolyard.” Trump did not repeat his expletive-laden criticism, but for some reason Rutte seized the chance to defend him for his F-bomb anyway. “Daddy has to sometimes use strong language,” he said, with no further elaboration. The moment was so painful it was almost a relief when Trump started talking again.\nOne can only imagine what they thought of Rutte’s line in the Kremlin. Trump, of course, loved it. After he returned to Washington on Wednesday evening, the White House put out a music video, with a highlight reel of his trip set to Usher’s 2009 track, “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home).” By Thursday morning, Trump was fund-raising off Rutte’s comment, selling red “DADDY” T-shirts for thirty-five dollars a piece. “When Biden was President we were LAUGHED at on the world stage. The whole world WALKED ALL OVER US!,” an e-mail read. “But thanks to your favorite President (ME!) we are respected once again. Moment ago, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called me DADDY on the world stage. How nice!”\nThe backlash from many of the Europeans whose security interests Rutte was presumably trying to protect by bowing so low was, unsurprisingly, swift. The former foreign minister of Lithuania, Gabrielius Landsbergis, called Rutte’s “gushings of weakness and meekness” both “disgraceful” and “one of the most shameful episodes in modern history.” In a long rebuttal on X, he added, “I feel I might speak for a significant part of Europeans—it’s tasteless. The wording appears to have been stolen from the adult entertainment industry.” Nathalie Tocci, a foreign-policy specialist and former adviser to top European Union officials, said that Rutte’s “pathetic flattery and genuflection” had made her feel “profoundly embarrassed as a European.” Perhaps more important, she concluded, “it doesn’t even work.”\nThis, it strikes me, is an essential point often overlooked by the suck-uppers. Trump’s bottomless need for positive affirmation is such that no one can aspire to permanently satisfy it; he simply does not stay sucked-up-to. Ask Mike Pompeo, whose willingness to praise the boss was so extreme when he was Trump’s Secretary of State that one former ambassador called him a “heat-seeking missile for Trump’s ass.” Nonetheless, Pompeo was frozen out of a job when Trump returned to office—a MAGA expulsion announced by Trump in a social-media post.\nAnother problem with Rutte’s strategy is that there is little evidence that sycophancy, no matter how extreme, has produced significant long-term change in Trump’s views. European leaders, including Rutte’s predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, have spent years trying oh-so-carefully to dissuade Trump from his positive views of Putin, his criticism of Ukraine, and his desire to impose punitive tariffs on the E.U.—with little success. If anything, their collective willingness to abase themselves before Trump has likely persuaded him that they are weak pushovers, the opposite of the strong leaders he so admires.\nWhen Trump was reëlected last year, Malcolm Turnbull, a former Prime Minister of Australia, attempted to debunk the myth that flattery will get you everywhere with Trump. “There were two misapprehensions about Trump,” he told the Times. “The first was he would be different in office than on the campaign trail. The second was the best way to deal with him was to suck up to him.”\nSo what, besides his own embarrassment, did Rutte actually achieve this week by sucking up to Trump? “Trump gets the win and goes home,” Ivo Daalder, the U.S. Ambassador to NATO during Barack Obama’s Presidency, told me, describing how officials had orchestrated the week’s events. “NATO lives for another day.” But, Daalder added, the “reality is different.” For starters, the five-per-cent spending target won’t actually kick in for a decade, and even then it’s actually three and a half per cent of G.D.P. to be spent on the military budget, a threshold that even the U.S. does not currently meet. (The other 1.5 per cent is supposed to go to nonmilitary areas, such as roads, ports, and cyber capabilities, that are, in theory, helpful to defense.) Just as importantly, Daalder noted, the reason NATO members agreed to Trump’s demand “is not only the Russian military threat (which Trump denies exists) but the realization that they can no longer count on the United States.”\nDaalder’s description of the state of affairs in Europe today rings much truer to me than Rutte’s: If Trump is really daddy, then what he’s actually doing is walking out on the family—and warning them that he’ll no longer pay their bills. I can understand why everyone is so relieved that he didn’t smash up everything at the annual family reunion. But is the divorce really off? As for the secretary-general, he ended the summit by trying to walk back the comment for which it will inevitably be remembered. “I didn’t call him ‘Daddy,’ ” Rutte insisted to reporters. It was all just a metaphor. ♦","summary":"The NATO secretary-general goes all in on strategic self-abasement while meeting with his American “Daddy.”","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/a-week-for-the-ages-in-the-annals-of-trump-suckuppery","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/685db8730ef52c63c9475155/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Glasser-NATO.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 23:47:20","author":"Susan B.

While Germany is eager to reach a swift agreement at all costs, France emphasised the important that bloc should not display weakness.In a press conference after the summit, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Council encouraged the Commission to use the remaining two weeks to come to a swift agreement. But he said that the Council had encouraged von der Leyen to pursue the EU’s own countermeasures if necessary. He said it was important to conclude something quickly and flagged the risks to the auto, chemicals and pharma sectors if 9 July arrives and the Trump tariffs take effect.“My hope is that we can reach a swift conclusion,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after an EU summit on Thursday in Brussels, adding: “However, this willingness should not be mistaken for weakness. We want to conclude quickly because it serves our collective interest, supports the stability of international trade, and benefits our businesses—but not at any price.”On Monday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized the Commission’s strategy as overly technical and called for accelerating the negotiations by focusing on strategic sectors such as automobiles, steel, and energy, chemicals and pharma.The US currently imposes 50% tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, 25% on cars and a 10% baseline on all EU imports.Negotiations between the US and the EU have gained momentum since President Donald Trump and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met at the G7 summit in Canada on 16 June, as the critical 9 July deadline approaches, after which Trump has threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU imports.On Thursday evening, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced to EU member states that she had received a US counter-proposal to the EU’s offer, though she did not disclose any details.For several months, the EU has been offering the US a zero-for-zero tariff deal on all industrial products, along with commitments to purchase strategic goods such as liquid natural gas and soybeans.However, few believe that securing 0% tariffs from the US is still a realistic possibility. “Since they decided to impose multiple tariffs on their trade partners across the globe, the US now has an appetite for the revenue that tariffs generate,” an EU official said, implying that the US rejected the EU offer.The Commission is now reconsidering its approach to a future tariff-based deal, though the specific terms have yet to be determined. “The prevailing assumption is that a 10% tariff might be the benchmark,” an EU diplomat said.“On some areas 10% is not so much, the EU imposes 10% on a lot of imports of cars, whether they are Chinese or Japanese,” another EU official told Euronews, adding that “for other products, such as aircraft, it’s much more complicated because the production line is very interdependent between the US and the EU. That’s why, you need a granular analysis.”If the EU manages to reach an agreement by 9 July, it will not be a comprehensive agreement, two senior EU diplomats said.“The most realistic outcome would likely be a general framework or a “principled agreement”, due to time constraints,” an EU diplomat commented.","summary":"France and Germany are at odds over the negotiating strategy on trade with the US, while the Commission is increasingly doubtful about securing a zero-tariff deal.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/06/27/tariffs-france-and-germany-pursue-different-tacks-towards-us-deal","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/34/59/95/1440x810_cmsv2_381225fe-6c00-5eb1-91d1-d0f31c48a682-9345995.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 23:43:28","author":"Peggy Corlin","authors":["Peggy Corlin"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":335632450,"title":"Love Island fans brand Ben 'immature' and 'disgusting' after explosive row with Yasmin and call for him to be kicked out of the villa: 'Alexa play Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter'","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Jun 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove Island fans brand Ben 'immature' and 'disgusting' after explosive row with Yasmin and call for him to be kicked out of the villa: 'Alexa play Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter'\n\n Have YOU got a story?

Immature. Bye Felicia.'; 'Ben needs to get out. How old is he?'\n'The way Ben speaks to women is scary'; 'Is Ben okay? Someone get him out of my villa now!!!'; 'Ben where has this come from?

Someone who is beautiful on the inside and out, looks after themselves and is healthy\nCLAIM TO FAME? My dad being an ex-professional footballer. I've met all kinds of famous people through him.

I always ask guys on a night out to guess which country I'm originally from. If they get it right, they can get my number. \nBut they never guess correctly so it works really well if you don't want to give a guy your number. I'm originally from Guinea Bissau.

I'm looking for darker hair, definitely muscular but not too muscular. Super fit. Clean hair cut. Someone that can make me laugh - I'm super outgoing. And someone that's quite active.

Johnson's administration. Moyers' son William said his father died at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York after a \"long illness.\"\n\nMoyers' career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson's press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \"The CBS Evening News\" and chief correspondent for \"CBS Reports.\"\n\nBut it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV's most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.\n\nIn 1988, Moyers produced \"The Secret Government\" about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \"Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\" a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.\n\nHis televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men's Movement, and his 1993 series \"Healing and the Mind\" had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.\n\nIn a medium that supposedly abhors \"talking heads\" — shots of subject and interviewer talking — Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \"The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\"\n\n(Softly) speaking truth to power\n\nDemonstrating what someone called \"a soft, probing style\" in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.\n\nFrom some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn't necessarily deny.\n\n\"I'm an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people's ideas,\" he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \"citizen journalist\" operating independently, outside the establishment.\n\nPublic television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \"the conversation of democracy open to all comers,\" he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"I think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\" he said another time, \"but they've chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\"\n\nOver the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.\n\nFrom sports to sports writing\n\nBorn in Hugo, Okla., on June 5, 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.\n\n\"I wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,\" he recalled.\n\nHe worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the \"y\" from his name.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master's in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry \"was a wrong number.\"\n\nHis relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote the then-senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson's employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.\n\nOn the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.\n\nMoyers' stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.\n\nOf his departure from the White House, he wrote later, \"We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.\"\n\nHe conceded that he may have been \"too zealous in my defense of our policies\" and said he regretted criticizing journalists such as Pulitzer Prize-winner Peter Arnett, then a special correspondent with the AP, and CBS's Morley Safer for their war coverage.\n\nA long run on television\n\nIn 1967, Moyers became publisher of Long Island-based Newsday and concentrated on adding news analyses, investigative pieces and lively features. Within three years, the suburban daily had won two Pulitzers. He left the paper in 1970 after the ownership changed. That summer, he traveled 13,000 miles around the country and wrote a best-selling account of his odyssey: \"Listening to America: a Traveler Rediscovers His Country.\"\n\nHis next venture was in public television and he won critical acclaim for \"Bill Moyers Journal,\" a series in which interviews ranged from Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, to poet Maya Angelou. He was chief correspondent of \"CBS Reports\" from 1976 to 1978, went back to PBS for three years, and then was senior news analyst for CBS from 1981 to 1986.\n\nWhen CBS cut back on documentaries, he returned to PBS for much less money. \"If you have a skill that you can fold with your tent and go wherever you feel you have to go, you can follow your heart's desire,\" he once said.\n\nThen in 1986, he and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, became their own bosses by forming Public Affairs Television, an independent shop that has not only produced programs such as the 10-hour \"In Search of the Constitution,\" but also paid for them through its own fundraising efforts.\n\nHis projects in the 21st century included \"Now,\" a weekly PBS public affairs program; a new edition of \"Bill Moyers Journal\" and a podcast covering racism, voting rights and the rise of Donald Trump, among other subjects.\n\nMoyers married Judith Davidson, a college classmate, in 1954, and they raised three children, among them the author Suzanne Moyers and author-TV producer William Cope Moyers. Judith eventually became her husband's partner, creative collaborator and president of their production company.","summary":"Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television's most honored journalists, has died at 91.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5448105/bill-moyers-the-former-white-house-press-secretary-turned-acclaimed-tv-journalist-dead-at-91","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2436+0+0/resize/3000x2436!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2Fab%2F5737b73443c8a4291c997cf81fb6%2Fap25177735852299.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 23:41:25","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.351},{"id":335643004,"title":"Maya Jama insists there's 'a lot of frauds' in TV industry who are 'evil' and 'mean' off camera and reveals how she secured Love Island hosting job after previously being rejected","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Jun 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat life is REALLY like for Lucy Letby behind bars: £33 a week to spend on sweets and chocolate, more time outside her cell...and TWICE as many visits as other prisoners\n\nStarmer caves in to rebels on benefits: Sir Keir is forced into a humiliating climb-down by Labour welfare army\n\nIn a plot twist worthy of John le Carré, we reveal the grandfather of the brilliant new head of MI6 was a Nazi spy chief\n\nWar breaks out at GB News as furious staff plot to oust Eamonn Holmes: Insiders tell KATIE HIND presenter is 'utterly despised' by colleagues and reveal the moment he pushed them over the edge\n\nDAVID PATRIKARAKOS: The chilling evidence that reveals what really happened to Iran's vast stockpile of uranium... and the terrifying next move that the mad Mullahs are plotting\n\nLouis Tomlinson and girlfriend Zara McDermott put on a loved up display as they stroll hand-in-hand at Glastonbury - after THAT frosty exchange with her ex Sam Thompson\n\nJeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are ALREADY married: As bride appears in terrifyingly tight corset for star-studded Venice wedding party, insiders tell ALISON BOSHOFF the couple tied the knot a month ago\n\nI know why JoJo Siwa felt pressured into calling herself a lesbian before dating Chris Hughes: FLORENCE SCORDOULIS\n\nThe new diet that can slash dementia risk by 25 per cent and slow ageing: Scientists reveal vital details including when YOU should start following it\n\nSkinny Leonardo DiCaprio, suave Tom Brady and newly-single Orlando Bloom lead stylish male guests at Jeff Bezos' wedding\n\nBest and WORST dressed celebs at Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' wedding extravaganza in Venice\n\nBritain's best and worst beach towns revealed - with popular South Coast resort labelled 'run-down' and 'tacky'\n\nBRYONY GORDON: Truth about the shameless anti-vaxxer nurse who blamed the NHS for her daughter's cancer death\n\nImpatient driver who killed his own wife in head-on crash while late for work is jailed for 10 years\n\nCheryl Tweedy's killer stalker turns up at house to try to meet her AGAIN: Convict is back in court after breaching restraining order\n\nQUENTIN LETTS: Welcome back, PM.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MILLY VEITCH FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:23:13 BST, 26 June 2025 |Updated:00:35 BST, 27 June 2025 \n\nMaya Jama has insisted that there are 'a lot of frauds' working in television, who are only friendly when the cameras are rolling.\nThe presenter, 30, appeared on her pal Chunkz's podcast, The Chunkz Show, where she opened up on career and how she secured the coveted Love Island hosting role.\nAs Chunkz praised her for being so down-to-earth and nothing like the preconceived ideas people had about celebrities, Maya insisted: 'There are a lot of frauds.'\nFellow TV personality Laurence McKenna chimed in to say: 'But also it's okay to be a presenter who is very friendly on camera and a bit reserved off camera.'\nBut Maya was quick to cut in: 'Reserved yes, but b***h? There's some people who are evil off camera!'\nKeeping tight-lipped on who she was referring to, she added that she'd worked with people who acted differently after the cameras cut.\n\nMaya Jama has insisted that there are 'a lot of frauds' working in television, who are only friendly when the cameras are rolling\n\nThe presenter, 30, appeared on her pal Chunkz's podcast, The Chunkz Show, where she opened up on career and how she secured the coveted Love Island hosting role (seen on show last year)\n\nAs Chunkz praised her for being so down-to-earth and nothing like the preconceived ideas people had about celebrities, Maya insisted: 'There are a lot of frauds'\nShe explained: 'A lot of people have been exposed like that. I won't say any names but on big telly, people have been caught on their mics being like mean.'\nElsewhere, Maya also reflected on her role as the host of Love Island, revealing that she had got the job after previously being rejected for being 'younger than the Islanders'. \nShe recalled: 'It was crazy because I was a fan of the show, I used to watch it from series one pretty much, I loved Love Island and obviously they had previous hosts before me.\n'I was actually living in America at the time when they wanted to meet about me potentially hosting. They called when I was in America and they were like \"Would Maya be interested in hosting?\" \n'And I was like \"Yeah I would be interested. But this is kind of mad because I kind of like accepted I wasn't really going to be a Love Island host\".'\nShe went on: 'I remember once ages ago I wanted to do it and we had a conversation and they were like \"She's too young, because she's younger than the Islanders at the time.\" And I was like \"Yeah that's fair enough.\"\n'And I still am the same age as some of the Islanders, but obviously they think I've grown up a little bit now so it makes sense.'\nMaya then went on to credit her fans for helping secure her the role, saying: 'So then I came back to London and we just kind of spoke, I didn't audition it was more like a chat. \n\nElsewhere, Maya also reflected on her role as the host of Love Island, revealing that she had got the job after previously being rejected for being 'younger than the Islanders'\n\nGiving fans an insight into the behind-the-scenes process, Maya insisted that the producers weren't allowed to tell the Islanders what to do or how to act, as 'it has to be real' \n'But I will big up like Twitter and the public because they were kind of calling for me to host for a long time and I think they did pay attention to like the public, which is lovely.'\nOpening up on the show, she admitted: 'I'm not going to lie it is a very lovely job, just in terms of like in January everyone's miserable in England so it's lovely just to get away and be in South Africa.'\nAnd when asked which is her favourite out of the nine seasons she's presented, she confessed: 'My favourite so far, I think I'm allowed to say, the Ella and Tyrique series. It just had me gagged all the time, I'd constantly be like \"What what?\"'\nGiving fans an insight into the behind-the-scenes process, Maya insisted that the producers weren't allowed to tell the Islanders what to do or how to act, as 'it has to be real'.\nWhile she added that she doesn't let them tell her who will be dumped ahead of time, so she doesn't give the game away accidentally.\nShe explained: 'I also do this technique where I don't let them tell me who is going until I'm literally stood in front of them in my ear. \n'Because I don't want to stare at them or give it away. Literally as I say it I find out, one second before everybody else basically.\n'I've never said the wrong name or something but like there is cameras constantly around and then they like the dramatic pauses.\n\nMaya also confessed that she felt protective over the Islanders, saying she had first hand experience of how intense the environment is and how hard it is to be vulnerable on TV.\n\n'It's always funny with the new Islanders when they're not used to me saying something and pausing for ages, so they're all looking around like \"is she like frozen? Why is it so silent?\" And I feel so awkward for them!\n'But I don't know if it's like illegal or what, but they're not allowed to tell them what to do. The most they can encourage is like \"have a little chat...\" But it has to be real because it's reality.' \nMaya also confessed that she felt protective over the Islanders, saying she had first hand experience of how intense the environment is and how hard it is to be vulnerable on TV.\nShe said: 'I have such a soft spot for them because obviously watching the show on the outside is one thing, but being there and being around them. \n'Your emotions in there, you've got people you like and then there's someone coming in to take them, you've got to like lay your heart on the line, there's millions of people watching.\n'I am like my little my shaylas, because I just feel like this is not easy for young people to go and put themselves out like that for one and for two like it can be tough.'\n'It's only on Aftersun that I can actually chat to them properly, but in between takes and stuff when I'm in there I will try and be like \"are you okay?\" or like check in, but you won't you won't see those bits.'\nMaya JamaLove Island\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMaya Jama insists there's 'a lot of frauds' in TV industry who are 'evil' and 'mean' off camera and reveals how she secured Love Island hosting job after previously being rejected\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

There, at The Hague, the president repeatedly, and sometimes unprompted, defended the strikes after the leak of a preliminary damage assessment report that indicated Tehran’s nuclear program may not have, in his own words, been “totally obliterated.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt then amplified Hegseth’s message on Iran, before underscoring the importance of Congress passing Trump’s legislative priorities ahead of the president hosting what the administration called his “one big, beautiful event.”\n\nFor political analyst Dan Schnur, “it’s hard to think of a time over the last 10 years when Trump has been as happy, as satisfied, and as confident as he is right now.”\n\n“But he also recognizes that this intelligence report is potentially a huge vulnerability, so it’s no surprise that he’s hitting it with everything he’s got,” Schnur, the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain‘s 2000 presidential campaign communications director, told the Washington Examiner. “If Iran stays quiet going forward, it will be the biggest political win of his presidency. So he’s especially invested in putting these doubts to rest.”\n\nThat started early Thursday with Hegseth’s press conference at the Pentagon, announced not by the Department of Defense, but by Trump on his Truth Social social media platform en route to Washington from The Hague.\n\n“Decimating,” “obliterating,” or “destroying,” Hegseth told reporters to “choose your word,” regarding the strike’s effect on Iran’s nuclear facilities.\n\n“Let me read the bottom line here: President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history, and it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day war,” he said.\n\nHegseth was accompanied at the podium by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan “Razin'” Caine. \n\nCaine was praised after a separate press conference last weekend, immediately following Trump’s strikes, for defending the operation while reserving judgment regarding its success until a battle damage assessment. On Thursday, Caine was asked whether he had been pressured to describe the president’s strikes as a success and whether he would update his evaluation.\n\n“No, I have not and, no, I would not,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hegseth forcefully defended Trump over the strikes and criticized the news media for their coverage of them, claiming it was in reporters’ “DNA” and “blood” to undercut the president, “because you want him not to be successful.”\n\nHegseth went on to single out former Fox News colleague Jennifer Griffin as being among the “worst” after she asked whether he was certain Iran had not moved highly enriched uranium from its mountain-fortified nuclear enrichment facility in Fordow.\n\nHours after Hegseth’s press conference, Leavitt deployed a similar strategy at the White House against the news media, particularly CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand. Bertrand was one of three reporters who broke the story that the preliminary assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency was that Trump’s strikes only undermined Iran’s nuclear program for months rather than obliterating it.\n\n“This is a reporter who has been, unfortunately, used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives,” Leavitt told reporters. “She should be ashamed of herself.”\n\nIn addition to responding to Iran-centric news of the day, Leavitt opened her briefing with the significance of Trump’s one big, beautiful bill before the president’s event that afternoon.\n\n“Simply put, this bill is going to unlock the golden age of America, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to see this bill on the president’s desk for signature by Independence Day,” she said.\n\nWhen asked about the administration’s two-pronged strategy, White House spokeswoman Liz Huston told the Washington Examiner, “while the fake news desperately tries to downplay President Trump’s historic achievements and discredit the courageous soldiers who successfully obliterated Iran’s nuclear capabilities, the president is steadfast in his commitment to advancing America’s interests both at home and abroad.”\n\n“Not only is President Trump restoring stability around the world, but his one big, beautiful bill will unleash our economy, strengthen national security through the Golden Dome, and deliver significant relief for working families,” Huston continued.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the Joint Chiefs of Staff head encountered pressure from Trump over Iran, Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are clearly under pressure from the president to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act before next week’s July 4 deadline.\n\nTrump used Thursday’s event to emphasize how the one big, beautiful bill could help people across the country, including through its proposed tax cuts by making his 2017 reductions permanent, eliminating taxes on tips, and expanding the child tax credit. A tipped food delivery driver, a barber from Arkansas, law enforcement officers, and Border Patrol agents were among the special guests invited to the White House to punctuate that point.\n\n“According to the Council of Economic Advisors, these reforms will protect or create more than 7 million jobs, add 3.1% to economic growth, reduce taxes for the typical American by nearly 15%, and increase take-home pay for a normal family by an incredible $13,000,” Trump said. “All of these things are happening.”\n\nThere appeared to be more urgency with Trump and the White House with respect to the one big, beautiful bill on Thursday, not only because of the president’s deadline, but because of Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough’s rulings on its components.\n\nMacDonough, who is responsible for implementing the Byrd Rule, has ruled that certain aspects cannot be included in the legislative package because they do not relate to the budget, as is required for it to be passed with a simple majority rather than a supermajority under the streamlined parliamentary procedure known as budget reconciliation. \n\nIn a blow to the GOP-led bill, MacDonough ruled on Thursday that its Medicaid provisions for provider taxes and federal funding for illegal immigrant services had to be removed.\n\n“I know that there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning,” Leavitt said. “Look, this is part of the process. This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate, but the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.”\n\nShe added: “I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day, and the president remains on the phones, talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary. And when they call, he picks up the phone.”\n\nSenators, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and House counterparts, such as Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), have expressed frustration with MacDonough over her rulings on the one big, beautiful bill, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has reiterated his intention not to overrule her. Instead, Republicans are poised to provide MacDonough with new language and possible savings as they continue negotiations between the House and Senate versions of the bill.","summary":"President Donald Trump and his administration are trying to go on the offensive to defend their foreign and domestic agendas.

As a native of Indiana with family still there, I felt “Indiana” could be substituted freely for “Arkansas” throughout.\n\nCalifornia has its challenges, but the struggle is on the right path; in the right direction. California is a national model, and as a decades-long resident now, I can share that there’s no going back. Californians who begin to believe the propaganda that the state is a “hellscape” should visit other states for a fresh perspective on personal freedoms, multicultural creative arts, land conservation and recreation space, and adoption of EVs, among other benefits California has over so many states.\n\nCraig Riebersal\nWalnut Creek\n\nRefreshingly positive\ntake on state in op-ed\n\nRe: “Ignore haters, California is a national model” (Page A6, June 25).\n\nI found it enlightening and refreshing to read the “Arkansan’s Perspective,” which examined the many criticisms often heard about our state. I’ve often been dismayed to hear the frequent California bashing, both here at home and on a nationwide level. The writer’s unique perspective as a new resident to our state offers a more positive outlook than we usually see, especially when contrasted with the rest of the country, and in particular, their former home state of Arkansas. Thank you for giving us a positive perspective for a change.\n\nJennifer Kline\n\nStop watering down\nhousing bill and pass it\n\nRe: “Senate passes housing measure” (Page B1, June 5).\n\nThe housing crisis in California requires policy solutions, not symbolic action. That is why SB 79 is critically important.\n\nThe bill proposes removing some height limitations and up-zoning areas near transit hubs, and also stops abuses of CEQA for said projects. But now SB 79 is endangered by the state Assembly, and lawmakers may continue to weaken the bill, including killing the CEQA limits. Curbing SB 79 is the apotheosis of California’s hypocritical self-professed commitment to “progressive values.” How can California claim to address poverty and climate change while protecting policies that displace workers and keep housing unaffordable?\n\nThe amended bill that barely survived the Senate is already a compromise; if we continue to strip it down, it will lose its effect. The Assembly should pass SB 79 as previously proposed without further concessions, and Gov. Newsom should sign it.\n\nJonathan Hofer\n\nPressure legislators to\nchange immigration law\n\nSo many of us don’t agree with many things that ICE is doing, yet they are doing what they are supposed to be doing: following the law.\n\nAs law enforcement officials, they and the other police agencies that work with them are enforcing what our lawmakers have declared illegal. That’s not Donald Trump. That’s our representatives and senators in Congress. In looking up where they stand, I was not able to find our California legislators stepping forth to change the law so that ICE is no longer an issue.\n\nOur legislators are in hiding. Demonstrate against them, change the laws and bring sanity to our system.\n\nRobert Harley\n\nMamdani win augurs\nnew era for Democrats\n\nRe: “Mamdani claims a win over Cuomo in Dems’ New York mayor race” (Page A4, June 26).\n\nZohran Mamdani’s earth-shaking victory in the New York mayoral Democratic primary over a typical, long-time corporate Democrat, proves that progressive policies and thorough, direct outreach can excite working class individuals, many who never voted before, and moderate voters, and defeat mountains of money, much greater name recognition and scare tactics.\n\nThe leaders of the ossified Democratic Party, whom people are rightly furious with because the party has failed for decades to deliver benefits to regular people and instead continues to pipeline riches to the one percent, are now afraid of losing their privileges.\n\nMamdani’s tactics and strategy will now be adopted by many others across the country and unleash a wave of much-needed, for-the-people politics.\n\nHad Kamala Harris run such a campaign, she would have defeated Donald Trump, and the country would not be threatened with his dictatorial, undemocratic, wildly erratic, damaging actions.\n\nCongratulations, Zohran Mamdani.\n\nKeith Nakatani","summary":"Also: Positive take &#124; Housing bill &#124; Change law &#124; Impeachment silence &#124; New era.

The party faithful cheered speakers including Lord Mandelson, now ambassador to Washington, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones.\n\nUnusually, another figure who prefers to lurk in the shadows was spotted at the event, where tickets cost up to £200. Standing quietly to the side in the Ev Turkish restaurant in Southwark was Morgan McSweeney, 48, the No 10 chief of staff. Labour insiders tell me that McSweeney is the real Deputy Prime Minister, wielding far more clout than the hapless Angela Rayner, who carries that title ‘in name only’.\n\nPerhaps McSweeney’s attendance was unsurprising. After all, the purpose of the event was to raise money for his wife: Imogen Walker, the Labour member for Hamilton and Clyde Valley. She became an MP only at last year’s election, but is already rising fast. She is parliamentary private secretary to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, so McSweeney has eyes and ears in the heart of the Treasury as well as at No 10.\n\nToday, as Labour’s civil war escalates over the Government’s plan to cut billions from the ballooning disability benefits bill, McSweeney’s unshakeable grip on the party machine – and his reputation as one of the canniest operators in Westminster – appears to be collapsing.\n\nYesterday, reports emerged that unnamed Labour MPs have been demanding ‘regime change’ in No 10 – and the ousting of Starmer’s team of ‘over-excitable boys’.\n\nOne authoritative source tells me: ‘What they mean by “regime change” is “sack McSweeney”. We haven’t even got to the Government’s first anniversary next week but the No 10 kitchen cabinet already has bunker mentality. Morgan has been semi-detached from the benefits row, which is hugely damaging.’\n\nThis very point was underlined by Starmer on Wednesday at the Nato summit in Holland. The PM waved away the benefits row – which could yet see a sensational defeat for his government despite its vast majority of 165 – as ‘noises off’. This airy dismissal saw the number of rebels swell to almost 130, among them, crucially, 14 select committee chairmen: senior MPs immune to the usual threats and blandishments from party whips.\n\nThe opponents need only 83 MPs to scupper the Bill and inflict a humiliating defeat on Starmer next week.\n\nA second source tells me: ‘Keir seems more exercised by managing relations with Donald Trump than he is with his own backbenchers.’\n\nOnce again, insiders point to the hand of McSweeney. In February, he was photographed sitting near Starmer in the White House when the PM met Trump. My source adds: ‘McSweeney thinks “Starmer the international statesman” plays well with voters. But what voters actually see is: Keir’s never here.’\n\nYesterday, research from the BBC showed that Starmer has voted in the Commons on fewer occasions in his first year as PM than all his recent predecessors (excluding Liz Truss’s brief tenure): just seven times, barely half the record managed by runner-up Tony Blair. Boris Johnson came top with 57.\n\nAs the welfare blame-game swirls, I can reveal that two sides are forming in the Downing Street bunker.\n\nIn one corner is McSweeney, who I’m told is ‘obsessed’\n\nwith the threat posed by Reform after Nigel Farage’s stunning recent successes in the local elections and the Runcorn by-election.\n\nIn the other corner is Liz Lloyd, a Downing Street veteran and Starmer’s ‘director of policy delivery’. While Morgan worries about Reform, Lloyd wants more emphasis on economic growth and schools policy. Morgan sees cutting sickness benefits as playing well with Reform voters – but Labour MPs are unconvinced the policy is worth it.\n\n‘Team Morgan is in denial and in chaos,’ says one furious party figure. ‘They’re making things worse, not better. It’s one thing to shake up welfare to try to get millions of economically inactive people back into work – but this is targeting the sick and disabled. Keir has a tin ear because he’s been listening to Morgan for too long.’\n\nOnly yesterday, a YouGov poll, the most extensive since the general election, showed Labour on course to plunge from 411 MPs to 178 at the next election – with Reform roaring ahead to become the largest party on 271 seats. Starmer’s personal rating is at a record low of minus 46 per cent.\n\nMcSweeney cites such polls as vindication for his emphasis on fighting Reform – but his enemies say that Starmer, as a self-professed socialist, is never going to convince voters he’s ‘Farage-lite’, and that Labour’s best approach is instead to tack to the Left to see off the threat of the Greens and Lib Dems.\n\nFriends of McSweeney have told me there are rumours that the briefing against him is coming from Louise Haigh – sacked as Transport Secretary by Starmer last year and still smarting. McSweeney fired her in November after it emerged she had pleaded guilty to a fraud offence a decade earlier.\n\nHaigh is close to Baroness (Sue) Gray, who was ousted by McSweeney as chief of staff in October after just three months in the job. Gray, the former ‘neutral’ civil servant who helped defenestrate Boris Johnson during the ‘Partygate’ farrago – and who went on to sign up as a paid senior Labour official – was blamed for the ugly PR debacle over free suits and spectacles greedily accepted by Starmer and other senior Labour figures from donor Lord Alli.\n\nMany Labour MPs have convinced themselves that purple-haired Haigh was hard done by – and that ‘macho’ McSweeney\n\nwent too far. Gray is said to be bitter on a personal level, too – and loathes McSweeney for orchestrating her early political demise.\n\n‘This is Lou and Sue’s revenge on Morgan,’ one senior female Labour adviser tells me.\n\n‘Sue will be wryly observing the unfolding chaos in the Downing Street machine, which she used to run, from her new perch in the Lords.’ Labour ultra-grandee Tony Blair, too, is said to be privately critical of McSweeney’s approach.\n\nThe buck, however, ultimately stops not with McSweeney, but with Starmer. The PM’s critics say he lacks any serious political convictions or instincts, having entered Parliament in 2015 after decades as a human rights lawyer, and having run for the party leadership on a far-Left Corbynista ticket before tacking to the centre ground to woo Middle England at the election, before finally governing on an unoriginal Old Labour tax-and-spend playbook.\n\nStarmer likes to think of McSweeney as his political barometer – yet the equipment seems increasingly faulty.\n\nAccording to party lore, Irishman McSweeney – who came to Britain aged 17 – was on a placement to Labour’s Millbank HQ a few days before the 2001 general election when a receptionist dropped a vase on her foot and had to be signed off work. McSweeney, the story goes, was asked to step in and man the desk – and has never looked back. (Interestingly, Lord Mandelson, who was a fixture at Labour HQ during the campaign, has no recollection of the 24-year-old manning the reception desk – and to this day, several members of Blair’s Cabinet are bewildered by McSweeney’s rise.)\n\nRegardless, he eventually made his name running Labour Together: a think-tank set up to engineer the end of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership during the 2010s. After Corbyn led his party to its worst election defeat since 1935 in 2019, McSweeney moved effortlessly to Starmer’s side, with the new leader appointing him as his chief of staff.\n\nAt Monday night’s fundraiser, thousands of pounds were raised for Imogen Walker’s constituency work. Yet it may all be for little: yesterday’s doom-laden poll predicts she will lose her Commons seat at the next election.\n\nIf the rumbles of discontent over the No 10 operation grow louder still, it may be that McSweeney is out of a job even sooner than his wife – and you can be sure that Blair’s former adviser Liz Lloyd will happily take his place.","summary":"At a glitzy fundraising gala for one of Labour 's rising stars on Monday night, the mood was buoyant.
