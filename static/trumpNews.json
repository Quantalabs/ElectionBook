Instead Of Abandoning Kyiv, Washington Should Give It The Tools to Win The United States has hit a wall in Ukraine. President Joe Biden’s incrementalist approach is not working. Instead, it has led to a long and tragic war of attrition. Ukraine’s faltering performance in the past year has raised the grim prospect of a Russian victory, which would see Kyiv fall under Moscow’s imperial dominion. Former President Donald Trump has promised to change the U.S. approach if he wins reelection in November, insisting he could end the war “in 24 hours.” And Trump’s running mate, U.S. Senator J. D. Vance, has written that Ukraine should limit itself to a “defensive strategy” to “preserve its precious military manpow-er, stop the bleeding and provide time for negotiations to commence.” The solution both Trump and Vance seem to favor is a negotiated settlement that would allow Washington to focus its attention and re-sources elsewhere. The war does need to end—and end quickly. The answer is not to cut off all U.S. aid or rush into a lopsided deal with Rus-sian President Vladimir Putin. The United States can still get out of an untenable situ-ation and also avoid handing Russia a win. To halt open-ended U.S. expenditures and preserve Ukraine’s independence and se-curity, the United States and its allies need to give Kyiv one last serious chance at vic-tory—defined not as a return to Ukraine’s 2013 borders (as Kyiv would prefer) but as a sustainable restoration of roughly its 2021 borders. To make that outcome possible, Wash-ington and its allies must substantially and speedily improve Ukraine’s military position with a large infusion of weap-ons—and place no restrictions on their use. The most realistic chance for peace will come if Ukrainian troops can launch a decisive push that sends Russian forces back across the pre-2022 lines. A new U.S. president could catalyze the policy shift to make this happen; an incoming Trump administration, for instance, could seize the opportunity to signal American strength and put the con-flict to bed, shoring up the United States’ international reputation and allowing Washington to turn to other priorities. But no matter who is in the White House, a short-term boost of unrestricted military aid offers the best chance for long-term peace on Europe’s frontier. Forever War The Biden administration’s current strategy is unsustainable both for the United States and for Ukraine. In 2022, af-ter Russia attacked and Ukraine showed remarkable determination to fight back, Washington and some of its allies gradu-ally and tentatively began to send military aid to Kyiv, placing restrictions on how and where Ukrainian forces could use the more advanced capabilities. They feared that a more resolute response would trig-ger Russian escalation, potentially ex-tending the conflict beyond Ukraine and putting the West in harm’s way. Putin’s nuclear saber rattling has so terrified U.S. and European officials that even though they claim to seek a Ukrainian victory, in practice they provide Kyiv only enough support to keep it from crumbling under the Russian onslaught. The apparent goal is not to defeat Russia on the battlefield but to sustain Ukraine “as long as it takes”— that is, hopefully, until Moscow concludes that further aggression will be self-defeat-ing and ends the war itself. More than two years into the fighting, Kyiv has not folded, but neither have its Western partners given it the tools to win. A long war of attrition is likely to end in Ukraine’s collapse. Kyiv does not have enough manpower to send reinforcements into the trenches for years to come, and away from the frontlines, the rest of the country is struggling. Three-quarters of Ukrainian businesses are experiencing labor shortages because of emigration and military conscription (and the casu-alties that follow). The agricultural sector has lost fertile acreage: for some crops, the amount of harvested land has decreased by about a third. The loss of ports, such as Mariupol, has caused serious problems for producers looking to export. A Feb-ruary report cosponsored by the World Bank estimated that rebuilding Ukraine’s housing, infrastructure, and industry will require close to half a trillion dollars. As time goes on, the situation will only get worse. Time is not on the side of Ukraine’s Western partners, either. European coun-tries have claimed that Russia’s war is an existential menace to the continent, but for the most part, their recent military investments have been modest and they have been reluctant to disburse large sums of money to prop up Ukraine’s economy. Countries on Europe’s eastern frontline are the exception; Poland will spend more than four percent of its GDP this year, and Finland, a new member of NATO, plans to double its artillery ammunition produc-tion by 2027. But even these countries will be forced to recognize that every artillery shell they deliver to a weakening Ukraine is one fewer that will be available to their own forces. If Russia makes further gains in Ukraine and ramps up its threats to the West, those countries may no longer ac-cept such a tradeoff. For the United States, there is no ben-efit in bankrolling a protracted conflict. Biden’s strategy of providing incremen-tal aid will not prevent Ukraine’s eventual destruction, and it will keep United States bogged down in a war without a path to victory. It is also politically unsustainable: in the wake of decades of deeply unpopu-lar “forever wars,” American leaders can no longer promise indefinite financial outlays and weapon supplies on the basis of a strategy with no prospect of success. The United States is also taking larger strategic risks by restricting its support for Ukraine to incremental armament. Moscow can lean on its war economy and has no need to negotiate as long as it is confident that it can bleed Ukraine to a surrender and outlast Western support for Kyiv. And Ukraine cannot afford to negoti-ate from its current position of weakness, either, having lost territory and access to the Sea of Azov, a crucial waterway for its agricultural exports, and lacking the means to reverse either loss. This means the war will drag on—and the longer it does, the more time Russia has to create problems for Europe and the United States in other parts of the world. Moscow may expand its cooperation with North Korea by sharing satellite and ballistic missile technologies, devote more military forces to destabilize countries in sub-Saharan Af-rica and the wider Mediterranean region, and jam GPS signals across an increasing-ly large region in Europe. China, mean-while, is building up its own military, and it could take advantage of persistent vol-atility in Europe to advance in the Pacific. At the same time, Washington and its partners should not be overly worried about provoking Russia. Western fears of a Russian escalation have been exag-gerated. Throughout his rule, Putin has been careful to avoid a direct clash with the West, conscious perhaps of Russia’s economic and military inferiority. Now, Moscow has an interest in containing the fight to Ukraine because it would have a hard time matching Western firepower and combined forces in an expanded war. Russia threatens to escalate but backs down when confronted with strength. Still, there are limits to what the United States and its allies should do; namely, they should not challenge the Russian army on the frontlines by sending their own troops to Ukraine. Decisive Action Instead of dragging out this war, the United States’ goal should be to end it quickly, helping Ukraine defeat Russia and in the process deterring Moscow from pur-suing further imperial ambitions. Stabiliz-ing Europe first would allow Washington to concentrate its efforts in the Asian the-ater, where it faces a looming threat from China, sequencing its strategy rather than risking confrontation with two revisionist powers at once. The most plausible way to achieve this goal is to surge weapons to Ukraine and place no restrictions on their use. Ukraine needs artillery, armor, and airpower, and it must be able to strike military targets in Russia, such as airports, ammunition and fuel depots, and military factories. By lifting usage restrictions on Western weapons, especially medium-range mis-siles, Washington would give Kyiv the op-portunity to degrade Russian forces and prevent large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukraine cannot defend itself from behind a trench and with a dwindling supply of expensive an-tiair capabilities. This surge would give Ukraine one last chance at a tactical breakthrough to restore or approximate its pre-2022 territo-rial status. From this position, Ukrainian forces could continue to threaten the gains Russia made in its 2014 invasion, especial-ly Crimea. Although Kyiv’s longing to reclaim the country’s pre-2014 borders is understandable, its horrific losses and na-tional exhaustion make a less ambitious definition of military victory much more realistic. By degrading and pushing Russian forces from the territory they took since early 2022, Kyiv would win itself political options. Such a military achievement could impose sufficient material and rep-utational costs to force Russia to the nego-tiating table. Even without negotiations, which in any case may not quell Moscow’s desire to restore its empire in Europe, a rapid and decisive battlefield victory would inflict enough damage on Russian forces to buy Ukraine time to rebuild its infrastructure and industry, regain fertile lands for agricultural production, and strengthen its military capacity to deter further Russian offensives. The United States and its allies will have the resources to implement this strategy by the time the U.S. election in November has passed or a new president takes office. By early 2025, Western pro-duction capacity will have ramped up enough to supply Ukrainian forces with sufficient quantities of artillery shells. U.S. plants are on track to produce 80,000 shells per month by the end of 2024 and 100,000 shells per month sometime in 2025. Add that to the 100,000 or more shells per month that European industry is expected to produce by late 2025 and Ukraine could not just maintain its defensive positions, which requires an estimated 75,000 shells per month, but also initiate offensive action. The U.S. army also has plenty of excess equipment, including older mod-els of tanks and other vehicles, sitting in storage. So far, the United States has sent only 31 tanks to Ukraine, mostly to force Berlin’s hand at providing tanks, but there are hundreds more in storage that could be refurbished and shipped. Ukraine clearly needs more than it has received, as losses quickly thin out its armor stock. A small number of Western fighter jets in the hands of Ukrainian pilots is also scheduled to join the fight in the next months, but there are scores more that European countries could offload to Kyiv. Greece, for example, is considering giving several dozen jets. Although Washington and its allies cannot send their own soldiers to Ukraine, they can provide additional military train-ing for Ukrainian troops. Manpower is a growing problem for Kyiv. Conscrip-tion-age Ukrainians who have emigrated abroad should be called on to come home and join the fight. In the European coun-tries where many of them now reside, gov-ernments could form Ukrainian military units and train the new recruits before sending them back to Ukraine. The decisive factor would be the speed and quantity of lethal aid. If Ukraine can manage a breakthrough on the front-line and force a return to the territorial status quo ante February 2022, it could deal Russia a clear defeat. Crimea would remain under Russian occupation, but it would also remain a weak spot that the Ukrainian military can target to deter Moscow from resuming a large-scale war. The port of Sevastopol, several Russian military bases, and the Kerch Strait Bridge (which connects the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian mainland) have already proven to be vulnerable to Ukrainian sea drones and, in the case of the bridge, a truck bomb. Ukraine should be given more capabilities—such as U.S. ballistic missiles and British, French, and German cruise missiles—to strike these places now and keep them under threat in the event of a cease-fire. By internationally recognized law, they are part of Ukraine’s own territory, so military operations there would not carry the same escalation risks as hitting targets in Russia proper. Only Moscow (and a handful of minor powers) considers Crimea to be part of Russia, and when Ukraine has attacked it in the past two years, Russia’s response has not been any different than its response to Ukrainian attacks on the frontlines. Even in the best-case scenario, there is no reason to expect a defeat of Russia so dramatic as to fundamentally alter Moscow’s strategic outlook. Russia will remain a powerful nuclear state, nurtur-ing deep aspirations to restore its imperial greatness. But to achieve that goal, it needs Ukraine, which would give it the ability to threaten the rest of Europe and hold sway over European politics. Without Ukraine, Russia is only an Asian power, swiftly los-ing ground to China. Kyiv cannot change Moscow’s strategic imperatives with vic-tories on the battlefield, but it can deny Russia control of its lands. A rapid and significant supply of Western arms would give Ukraine its best chance to push back Russian forces and create the space and the time it needs to rebuild, refit, and deter another Russian advance. There is no stra-tegic rationale for Washington to prolong the conflict with drop-by-drop delivery of supplies; policies designed primarily to avoid escalation will not save Ukraine or stabilize Europe’s eastern frontier. Instead, it is time for the next U.S. president to take decisive action. Culled from FOREIGN AFFAIRS (www. foreignaffairs.com) July 25, 2024.","summary":"&#8230;.

Many Democrats have criticized Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 election, and specifically his claims of voter fraud, after he was defeated by President Joe Biden, as well as the recent Supreme Court decision allowing for presidential immunity for any official acts taken during their time in the White House. Biden, 81, previously cited the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot as one reason that the ruling set a \"dangerous\" precedent because the power of the presidential office \"will no longer be constrained by the law.\" \"[The] American people must decide if they want to entrust the president — once again, the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing he’ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it,\" Biden said in a speech earlier this month.","summary":"Kamala Harris&#39; campaign team later called the former president&#39;s comments a &#34;vow to end democracy&#34;","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-tells-christians-they-wont-have-vote-anymore-if-hes-elected-8684844","image":"https://people.com/thmb/i1H6-J9j4vusHXABHAwm_gHiceA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(993x322:995x324)/donlad-trump-west-palm-beach-072724-c3cb1177a604477893f55d50d9f086a5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 00:23:20","author":"Charlotte Phillipp","authors":["Charlotte Phillipp"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.067},{"id":252784962,"title":"What Trump’s Speech Means For Bitcoin","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - JULY 27: Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald ...

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) Getty Images (Full disclosure: I’m helping build Coinbits.app, a bitcoin banking platform.) At the Bitcoin Conference this week, former President Trump delivered a keynote address meant to win over the increasingly important bloc of voters concerned about bitcoin. In particular, these voters see bitcoin as a means to advancing the cause of liberty in the U.S., and worldwide. They see bitcoin as a key component of the coming period of re-industrialization where bitcoin mining is combined with an energy production renaissance and parabolic demand for AI computation. President Trump gave a stump speech that hit on many themes that those following his campaign will recognize. However, he also made several concrete statements aimed at winning the bitcoin vote. First, he established his bona fides in a room full of bitcoin experts, Austrian economists, technology innovators, and human rights activists by pointing out that bitcoin is currently the 9th largest asset in the world by market capitalization, and is likely to overtake gold one day. This wasn’t news to bitcoiners, but this message will now be heard by many conservatives who have a natural affinity for gold and defer to Trump’s instincts. He also credited bitcoiners for their awareness of the dangers of inflation, calling it a “country buster” that took Germany down a very dark path a century ago. He stated that, contrary to those who believe bitcoin is a threat to the dollar, he believes that it is Washington D.C. that threatens the dollar. MORE FOR YOU Trump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Trump Virtually Tied With Harris In HarrisX/Forbes Poll And New WSJ Poll Olympics Drag Queen ‘Last Supper’ Sparks Outrage From Musk, Catholic Leaders, GOP Pundits Google Says Sorry After Passwords Vanish For 15 Million Windows Users Perhaps most significant was the pronouncement that any bitcoin that the federal government possesses will not be sold and instead be used as a backstop for the wealth of the country. Although he fell short of stating that the U.S. Treasury would actively purchase bitcoin, the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve with bitcoin already in possession of the government is the key first step that can lead to future debates about how much bitcoin the government should hold. (In fact, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has already, since Trump’s speech, announced that she will be introducing a bill that wolud direct the U.S. Treasury to acquire 1 million bitcoins.) What all this means is that the U.S. may lead the next industrial revolution after all, with the bitcoin industry concentrated in its jurisdiction. With Trump’s statement today that he supports the private property rights of individual bitcoin holders in the U.S., the slander that bitcoin is just for criminals is finally outmoded. And, regardless of whether any particular politician likes or understands bitcoin, the values of transparency, sovereignty, and freedom that are literally embedded in bitcoin’s open-source codebase will have a place to continue to flourish in the United States in the coming decades.

The 2024 Republican presidential nominee, who had notably been skeptical of cryptocurrency, made a stop at the event before his rally with running mate J.D. Vance on Saturday night in Minnesota. The addition of the Ohio senator to the GOP ticket was a welcome development for proponents of cryptocurrency, and Trump became the first president “ever to address a Bitcoin event.” “If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future, we’ll keep 100%,” Trump said. “I hope you do well, please. This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” Trump also used the speech as an opportunity to denounce President Joe Biden, who defeated him in 2020, and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he will likely face in the 2024 general election, for their “anti-crypto crusade” “I pledge to the bitcoin community that the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ anti-crypto crusade will be over,” Trump said. “The moment I’m sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization ends against your industry.” The GOP nominee said the United States will become the “undisputed bitcoin-mining powerhouse” and told attendees that “you will not have to move your family to China.” “[If] we don’t embrace bitcoin and cryptocurrency, China will,” Trump said. “I want [it] to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. It’s not going to be made anywhere else. And if bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say … I want America to be the nation that leads the way.” Trump also noted that the federal government has almost 210,000 bitcoin, or 1% of the “total supply that will ever exist.” “As we implement these reforms, bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy, cement American financial dominance, and strengthen our entire country long into the future. Many Americans do not realize that the United States government is among the largest holders of bitcoin.” The former president also reiterated his commitment, if he is elected, to commuting the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving life in prison for various charges related to his role as the owner of Silk Road, an online black market. Trump was met with applause at the Libertarian National Convention in May for pledging to commute his sentence, and the bitcoin community reciprocated that encouragement.

It is his third rally since a gunman attempted to assassinate him on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump addressed a bitcoin conference Saturday in Nashville, Tennessee, promising that the United States will become a &#8220;bitcoin-mining powerhouse&#8221; if he is elected to a second term in the White House.

For J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential hopeful, one of the most bizarre claims that has recently taken the internet by storm is that he once had a sexual encounter with a couch. Yes, you read that right. As per Rolling Stone, the origins of this head-scratcher can be traced back to a social media post made on July 15, the day Vance was confirmed as Donald Trump’s running mate for the 2024 election. A user on X (formerly Twitter), jokingly suggested, “Can’t say for sure but [Vance] might be the first VP pick to have admitted in a New York Times bestseller to f***ing an inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (Vance, Hillbilly Elegy, pp. 179-181).” The tweet ignited a frenzy of jokes and memes across the platform. Netizens were quick to believe — or at least joke — about the possibility of Vance having done the deed with a couch. However, for those familiar with Hillbilly Elegy, it was clear that no such anecdote exists in the book. Vance’s memoir, which delves into his upbringing in a working-class Appalachian family, contains its fair share of controversial statements, but a story about a couch is not one of them. As per Vox, the rumor escalated when the Associated Press briefly published an article titled No, JD Vance Did Not Have Sex With a Couch, only to retract it shortly afterward. According to an AP spokesperson, the article had not gone through its standard editing process, leading to its removal. The retraction only fueled further speculation, with some humorously suggesting that the AP couldn’t definitively prove Vance had never engaged in such an act with a couch. AP confirmed, “The story, which did not go out on the wire to our customers, didn’t go through our standard editing process. We are looking into how that happened.” The incident, while humorous, has added to a series of missteps for Vance’s early campaign. His recent attempts at humor, such as, “I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today and I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too,” fell flat and were widely mocked. Additionally, past controversial comments, including a 2021 interview where Vance criticized Democratic nominee Kamala Harris,​ drew severe backlash. He had remarked, “We’re effectively run in this country — via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs — by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.

The clarification was made after FBI Director Christopher Wray caught flak for doubting that it was a bullet that wounded Trump. “What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the Bureau said in a short statement on Friday. The shooter, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, climbed on a roof of a building and fired several shots at Trump when he was delivering a speech at an open-air campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. The former president was slightly injured, while one spectator was killed and two more were wounded. Crooks was killed by a sniper from the Secret Service. Investigators have still not determined a motive behind the would-be assassin’s actions. FBI chief Wray stirred some controversy during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, when he said that “there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, that hit [Trump’s] ear.” Wray was quickly slammed by Republicans and Trump himself, who said that statements like these are why “the once storied FBI has lost the confidence of America.” Trump’s personal physician Ronny Jackson said that there was “no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet,” and argued that it was “wrong and inappropriate” for Wray to argue otherwise. The New York Times and the Washington Post also reported that their analysis of the photos of Trump’s injuries showed that they were consistent with a wound from a bullet and not a bullet fragment. Wray was not the only one who was heavily criticized for handling the assassination attempt. Kimberly Cheatle resigned as the head of the Secret Service on July 23 after admitting that her agency had “failed” to properly protect the former president.","summary":"Former US President Trump was indeed wounded by a bullet, the FBI confirmed on Friday \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601749-trump-hit-by-bullet-fbi-says/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66a582cd203027322f10d9f5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:32:50","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.665},{"id":252784368,"title":"J.D.

Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville while he seeks to gather the funding and support for a win in November, Trump told the crowd of cryptocurrency fans that as president he would ensure the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. \"For too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin,\" Trump said during his keynote speech. \"This afternoon I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world and we'll get it done.\" Trump seemed to have made a 180-degree turn on crypto compared to when he was president. In 2019, he said bitcoin was \"not money\" and \"highly volatile and based on thin air.\" In a 2021 interview with Fox News, Trump said, \"bitcoin just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar. \"I want the dollar to be the currency of the world, that's what I've always said.\" But the former president and Republican candidate on Saturday offered attendees the prospect of a future presidency that embraces crypto, compared to President Joe Biden's strict regulatory \"war on crypto.\" \"The Biden-Harris administration's repression of crypto and bitcoin is wrong and it's very bad for our country,\" Trump said. \"Let me tell you if they win this election, every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless. They will do things that you wouldn't believe.\" Trump also pledged to fire Gary Gensler, the Biden-appointed chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission who has taken a hardline approach to crypto regulation, although the president doesn't actually have the authority to fire appointed commissioners. The former president is fully embracing the bitcoin hype despite public confidence plummeting due to recent revelations of widespread fraud. His campaign now accepts bitcoin donations and has already amassed some $4 million worth of the speculative asset. He's also made a lot of friends in the crypto space. Billionaires and venture capitalists Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss each contributed 15.57 bitcoin -- just over $1 million -- to Trump's reelection, although they received a partial refund, because their donation surpassed the $844,600 limit. \"It's time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington,\" Tyler Winklevoss wrote in an X post endorsing Trump. \"That attacking us is political suicide.\" Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz said they plan to make a significant donation to the Trump campaign as well, and venture investor David Sacks helped Trump raise $12 million at a fundraiser at his San Francisco home. Other Republican figures have grabbed onto crypto as a key issue for this election, promising to cut away the red tape of the Biden-Harris administration. Speaking at the conference on Friday, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said, \"we want people, whether they love their dollars or they love their digital assets, we want them in charge of making their decisions.\" Crypto has experienced a renaissance after plummeting in the wake of the downfall of crypto exchange FTX and the arrest, trial and imprisonment of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried wax sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for running a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme through his business ventures. The price of bitcoin has since risen from the ashes of FTX to reach an all-time high as of June, and enthusiasm for crypto was through the roof. Independent presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who addressed the conference on Friday, promised to go even further than Trump with the lofty promise of launching a 4 million bitcoin reserve and mandating the federal government purchase 550 bitcoin a day until the reserve is full.","summary":"Donald Trump addressed the biggest bitcoin conference of the year Saturday, promising to make the United States the \"crypto capital\" of the world if he wins in November.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/07/27/donald-trump-bitcoin-conference-nashville/1711722117511/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1711722117511/2024/upi_com/f850027635efde9b895c339cbc77b006/v1.2/Trump-addresses-Bitcoin-Conference-in-pro-crypto-shift-for-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:29:21","author":"Ehren Wynder","authors":["Ehren Wynder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.059},{"id":252784328,"title":"Only God Can Check Cabals In Nigeria’s Oil Sector – Bishop Edoro","text":"Bishop Dr Joseph Ighalo Edoro is an Edo State-born cleric, security expert and public affairs commentator. In this interview with EJIKEME OMENAZU, he speaks on the festering crisis between Dangote Refinery and agencies’ heads in the oil sector, the reinstatement of Philip Shuaibu as Edo State governorship election, the state of the campaigns in the state, and the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the US election, among other issues. Excerpt: How do you see the recent disagree-ment between Dangote Refinery, NNPCL and Oil marketers? The recent disagreement be-tween Dangote Refinery and the NNPCL and its subsidiaries is an expression, interpretation and impression of a relationship gone sour upon which also the bottom has dropped irretriev-ably. Dangote is a pivot and very ubiquitous player in the Nigerian economy, producing, manufactur-ing, distribution and supplies of vital products of consumption to Nigerian homes and families. To this, I believe he has done cred-itably well. Again, not without the support and assistance of the various governments in Ni-geria. I must make haste to say that Dangote and his companies are strictly profit-oriented and must not be seen as though it is free in all its manufacturing and distributions of vital products in our lives. Dangote has virtually used all successive governments to hold Nigeria to ransom anyway. This is the truth. However, I am quick to note that the present im-broglio is not really about compe-tence or licence, or positively the call for monopoly of fuel and its accessories requested by Dangote. It is as a result of ‘Government go, Government come’. Look, before we start slaughter-ing the government, let us pulse to think of the deep side of this rela-tionship that has gone sour. Suc-cessive governments have been very kind and cooperative with Dangote and if this government is not, then it points to anomalies ranging from corruption, lack of due process, excessive govern-ment favours, personal disdain from the powers-that-be and more. Dangote is a political business man. He knows that. If you hob-nob with politicians as a business-man, then you will face the conse-quences in due season. Make no mistake about this government, it is not crying wolf where there is none. There has been excessive government support for Dangote to the disadvantage of co-compet-itors than prescribed by law. Gov-ernment can review such. This is where Dangote is having issues. Tinubu’s government is review-ing all successive governments’ support for Dangote to the detri-ment of the Nigerian people. It is deeper than you think. Now, back to the refinery, the Buhari government created the impression that Dangote mono-lithically aided the government by building this gigantic refinery which the government could not do for its people. Dangote saw himself in that light and prided himself so. But, the government changes. He ought to know that that is the fate of political busi-ness men. So, much has been said. The questions that come to my mind are as follows: Is it not true that Dangote had expected and posited to the government that he would have a monopoly exclusively of the industry? This is where the problem is. That can-not happen. Our lives cannot be held to ransom. This has been on for too long. The industries where Dangote excels had been monopo-lised for too long. Competition had been stifled and the spaces closed by governments akin to Dangote. There are people in Nigeria as well that could build refineries too. So, what happened to them? Why were they not allowed to do the same? Where are the likes of Dr Mike Adenuga? For instance, that man had been in the oil and gas business before Dangote and were he and others given the op-portunity? I feel for Dangote. He should have remained in his line of business rather than to switch to the Oil and Gas terrain. This terrain is too big and sublime. ‘Governments go, Governments come’ and the king that does not know Joseph will keep Joseph perpetually in jail. Government does not care when it tries to ei-ther right a wrong, or when it wants to deliberately bring down a person. I feel for Dangote. This government will not buy that re-finery. Trust me. Not this one. The call for public sympathy over gov-ernment perceived plans may not work as the evidence of a soured relationship is rife. Dangote must refrain from harassing the gov-ernment publicly and take on the path of negotiation. Governments do not care. Dangote Refinery is a private business. Period. How do you think the cabals in the oil sector could better be checked? I told you that the oil sector in Nigeria is too deep and sublime. It is characterised by characters, governments and cartels that span from Nigeria to different nations. Of course, herein lies the wealth of individuals and nations. A cabal that spans to regions and creeks, from waters to waters is beyond what you think. The oil producing countries, what do you classify them as? Cabal. You can-not check them. Only God can. We are all tied to their apron strings. Period. Do you think President Tinubu should relinquish his position as Minister of Petroleum and appoint a substantive Minister for proper supervision and control of the nation’s oil sector? Well, if Tinubu as Minister of Petroleum and President can, he should try. God will help him and it will be good for Nigeria. You saw the fight and sabotage they gave him over subsidy on fuel. The President has to oversee this ministry. Sincerely, leaving such an enormous ministry in the hands of one minister will not be good. The reasons deductible are that the President takes final decisions. What is your take on the court rein-statement of Philip Shuaibu as Edo State deputy governor and the attack on him during his return to the state in the company of the APC governorship candidate, during which a policeman was killed? The court reinstating Shaibu Philip, the impeached Deputy Governor of Edo State mirrors the beauty of democracy and the fluidity of our judicial system. It is a beauty to behold. The Appeal Court may again see it from a dif-ferent light. However, what does it matter? The man has moved to an-other party. So, he obviously has relinquished his position to that of a mere title. As to the attack at the Benin Airport, I will look at it collectively at first. It is a show of shame. I had been through your medium, Sunday Independent, ap-pealing to Edo politicians to deal with caution and not cause unnec-essary tension. I have watched a series of videos, including an unapproved forensic analysis on Tik Tok and it is sad how politi-cians can be shameless. They live in a state of nature. It is sad that the policeman had to die for such shameless people. I hear one side of the divide calling for the head of the Commissioner of Police in the State? Why? What has he done? Nigerian politicians are crooks. They possibly have seen that this police officer cannot be bought over now, so they planned ahead to remove him. I know that this Inspector General of Police is a man of integrity. Officers must be given the right environment to flourish in their jobs. Anyway, my condolences to the Nigeria Po-lice Force and the family of the deceased. Too long our police-men have suffered in the hands of these politicians, even to death. It has to stop. This is sad. On the defection of Philip Shaibu to the APC, I don’t see anything wrong in it? It is constitutionally right. He feels he can prostitute and so be it. There is nothing wrong. Then, some people say it was morally wrong and I ask them: What was their yardstick to measure the same? Some others said it was shameful and I said it depends on the individual. He decides if he wants shame or not. If eating his words and kneeling in the public with all the cameras rolling and paying obeisance of profligacy and prodigality to his master, Os-hiomhole, then to him, it is not a shame. Then so be it. And for me, if it is a shame, what does it mat-ter? I can only appeal to them. Let all those that matter in the state, starting from our most cherished and Respected Father, the Oba of Benin, set machinery in motion to call all involved to a table where peace will be discussed. Sadly, there is not one man like Bishop Benson Idahosa to call for peace among congregants. The Catho-lic Church in Edo State will be of value. Let peace reign. The Labour Party candidate is said to be making a lot of impact in his campaigns. Don’t you think the crisis between the APC and PDP will push Akpata ahead of the candidates of the two major parties? Concerning the Labour Party, it may turn out that two dogs fight for a bone and the third one comes and takes. But, again Edo Politics is too complex for this calculation. Some youth groups are planning peaceful nationwide protests against the poor state of the nation and the suffering in the land. How best do you think the Presidency and security agencies should handle the issue? The call for protests by youths is genuine. The constitution al-lows for peaceful protests. Things are bothersome and worrisome in Nigeria. Everyone feels it. The suf-fering is too much. Sometimes I think we should all be at par in our incomes so they can feel it. The disparity is too much. Now, to the point of the government’s reaction, I will say the govern-ment should provide security and protect them. Government should prepare officers to receive them. Government should go ahead of them to make it a jamboree and create fun instead of hate. The police and military should be al-lowed to mingle with them. Then, if they have leaders, speak to them using broadcast agencies. I think the era of the government trying to match it by force will be cata-strophic. These are your people. You can assuage them. You don’t beat a child and say don’t cry. How do you see the recent develop-ments in the USA presidential elec-tion, including the attack on Trump and the withdrawal of Biden and his nomination of his Vice? The recent attack on Donald Trump, the symbol of Democracy in the Republican Party, is sad and discouraging to emerging democ-racies. It was a show of shame by our tutors of democratic values. It humiliated sensitivities and created the impression of a brain-washed ideology. How else do you hate a man? With all the court cases only to stop him…So, this happens too in the USA? I thought it was only possible in Africa? It was even clear and suspicious that it was either pre-arranged or allowed to happen. I think they should know by now where God tailors this to. They created an emotional environment for Trump to Triumph. With blood stained face and fist clenched upwards…That emotion will lead to ballot victory. Joe Biden’s withdrawal was the best. I may not know about Kamala Harris. I also do know that a nomination of a VP by the Democrats to match the quality of JD Vance as Donald Trump’s pick will be the test of the game.","summary":" Bishop Dr Joseph Ighalo Edoro is an Edo State-born cleric, security expert and public affairs commentator.

Addressing a crowd of over 10,000 attendees at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Tennessee, Trump, the Republican nominee for president, promised to make the United States a major hub for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin if re-elected for a second term. He emphasized his vision for the U.S. to become a leading force in the cryptocurrency world, stating that under his administration, the value of Bitcoin could even surpass that of gold in the future. Trump also pledged to end what he called President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ so-called “war on crypto” — and to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Genlser, who is leading a regulatory crackdown on digital currency. “For three and a half years, the current administration has waged a war on crypto and Bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen before,” he said. He announcement to boot Gensler, if re-elected president, drew huge cheers from the crowd. Trump also pledged to appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council to regulate the industry — but under new rules written by people “who love the industry” and want to help it grow. While president, Trump was a big skeptic of the crypto market, saying in 2019, “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever. It is called the United States Dollar!” But he’s embraced digital currency in recent years, and his campaign began accepting donations in crypto in May. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), has introduced and supported pro-crypto legislation. Vance, a former venture capitalist, is a stakeholder in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency backers are hopeful a Trump return to the White House will lead to Bitcoin becoming more mainstream. Earlier Saturday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hit the campaign trail in the Keystone State to stump for Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, while trying to move to the top of the list of frontrunners vying to become her choice for vice president. Harris, the 59-year-old vice president, is now embarking on a four-month sprint to the 2024 election after Democrats ousted Biden from the ticket and the 81-year-old endorsed her. Shapiro is widely viewed as a leading contender to become Harris’ running mate. He is popular in the Keystone State and viewed as a moderate who would balance out Harris — whose voting record as a senator made her the chamber’s most liberal, according to GovTrack. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are also among the top contenders. Harris is expected to make her choice by Aug. 7. Harris’ schedule Saturday included attending a fundraiser in Pittsfield. Massachusetts., where she was expected to raise $1.4 million– a huge haul compared to the $400,000 organizers originally hope to score, according to Politico. The vice president later addressed a virtual conference to Voters of Tomorrow, a progressive organization representing Gen Z and Millennial voters that are among the more than a dozen youth groups that have pledged their support to Harris.

Vance “weird” at her first fundraiser since US President Joe Biden quit the White House race, pursuing a line of attack that has taken off among Democrats since her ascent. Harris tried out the line on Saturday at a theatre in the Berkshires town of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where she was introduced by singer James Taylor and supporters clapped and cheered during her speech. The event was expected to bring in more than US$1.4 million with some 800 attendees, according to the Harris campaign. The shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee has given Democrats a bump in the polls, but she reprised a line from Barack and Michelle Obama’s endorsement of her candidacy this week to inject a note of caution. “We are the underdogs in this race,” Harris told the crowd. “We have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy.” In calling out the Republican nominee, Harris did not specify which comments, past or recent, by Trump and Vance she had in mind. A 2021 comment by Vance disparaging “childless cat ladies” drew criticism this week from Democrats as well as some Republicans. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record, and some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it’s just plain weird,” the vice-president said. “I mean, that’s the box you put that in, right?” As Harris arrived, people outside the venue held signs saying “Trump is weird” and “If my cat could vote, she would vote for you.” In her speech, Harris challenged Trump to join her for a previously scheduled debate on September 10, now that Biden has dropped out. Trump’s campaign said on Thursday that those plans cannot be finalised until her party formally picks its nominee. A crucial decision still awaits Harris: picking a running mate. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are on a short list, people familiar with the process said this week.","summary":"The US vice-president cast herself as the underdog in the White House race and once again challenged her Republican rival to debate her.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272168/kamala-harris-tests-new-attack-trump-and-jd-vance-just-plain-weird","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/28/8428e830-a0d5-4a2f-92ae-2d51e74615f6_45be9a8a.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:19:19","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.029},{"id":252783446,"title":"“Harris Hosts Inaugural Fundraiser as Presumptive Democratic Nominee Gains Support from Donors”","text":"WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris used her first fundraiser since becoming the Democrats’ likely White House nominee to excoriate the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as determined to roll back Americans’ freedoms. Harris traveled to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday where she was expected to raise more than $1.4 million, her campaign announced, from an audience of hundreds at the Colonial Theatre. That would be $1 million-plus more than the original goal set for the event before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She told an excited group of supporters that she entered the race as an “underdog,” while expressing confidence that her surging campaign could defeat Trump. “I will fight to move our nation forward,” Harris said. “Donald Trump intends to take our country backwards.” Harris also poked at Trump, and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, for lobbing peculiar attacks at her and other Democrats. The vice president appeared to be alluding to a 2021 interview with Vance in which he slammed some prominent Democrats without biological children, including Harris, as “childless cat ladies” with “no direct stake” in America. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, it is just plain weird,” Harris said. “I mean that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris’ branding the Republican ticket as “weird” appears to be part of a concerted effort by her campaign to spotlight some of Trump and Vance’s rhetoric as questionable. Earlier this week, the Harris campaign on the social media site X called Vance “weird and creepy” for some of his stances on women’s reproductive rights. Trump, meanwhile, has raised the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter from the film “Silence of the Lambs” in stump speeches. “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who is on Harris’ shortlist for vice president, said in an MSNBC interview earlier this week. “They’re running for He-man women-haters club or something.” Supporters for the fundraiser included musician James Taylor and many of the state’s Democratic heavyweights, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, former Gov. Deval Patrick and Rep. Richie Neal. Harris took in more than $100 million in donations in the first 48 hours after Biden quit the race, a presidential record, and aides said she has continued to raise money at a steady clip. “This is a people-powered campaign,” Harris said. “And we have momentum.” Harris, a former prosecutor in her home state of California, also derided Trump for his legal troubles. She noted his recent conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York, a jury finding the former president of being liable for sexual abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and a $25 million settlement paid to attendees of the now-defunct real estate seminar called Trump University. “I’ve been dealing with people like him my entire career,” Harris said. She added, “So in this campaign, and I say in all seriousness, I will proudly put my record against his any day.” Harris began her remarks with praise for Biden, who opted to end his reelection bid and endorse Harris last weekend after his campaign fell into a tailspin following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump. She called Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three and a half years “unmatched in modern history.” Trump denigrated Harris as a “radical left lunatic” who wants to defund the police during a keynote address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville on Saturday. He said she was worse than Biden but was probably his second preference for a candidate to run against after Biden. Trump told the crowd of bitcoin supporters that he would embrace the cryptocurrency more than the Biden-Harris administration has and vowed to “replace the Biden-Harris economic stagnation” with an economic boom. The vice president told supporters at her Massachusetts fundraiser that her economic agenda would sharply contrast with Trump’s, who she claimed is squarely focused on lowering tax rates for wealthy Americans and improving the bottom lines of corporations. “Building up the middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said. She added, “Let us make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation.” ___ Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris used her first fundraiser since becoming&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Harris Hosts Inaugural Fundraiser as Presumptive Democratic Nominee Gains Support from Donors&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/harris-hosts-inaugural-fundraiser-as-presumptive-democratic-nominee-gains-support-from-donors/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Harris-holds-her-first-fundraiser-as-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:16:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":252784538,"title":"Propaganda in politics, crime","text":"Since this country is in a life-and-death war against crime, there is a compelling, inevitable desire for the government forces to win this war.

Are the anti-Israel protesters “officially Iran’s useful idiots?” Two weeks ago, this column stated: “A lot of politics is about showmanship, theatre and propaganda without which there is almost no politics and wherein the crowd creates the hero. Critical thinking merely irritates the flow.” Last week, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds sincerely said: “What I am satisfied with is that I gave my mind, my time, my heart and my soul to my work as a minister and I do so very proudly and very confidently…So I do my part and do it thoroughly and I do it wholeheartedly…As a government, we keep a very open mind, very open ears and we listen to the cries of the population.” Around the same time, the UNC Chaguanas mayor Faaiq Mohammed said: “We have the worst crime rate under this Minister of National Security, yet you continue to have faith in him to make changes. I don’t know who is mad – maybe the Prime Minister is going mad. Change needs to happen now, because this crime rate could lead to a civil uprising.” Now, as well-meaning as they may be, which statement do you think amounts to propaganda? The first? The second? Both? Or none? Propaganda is defined as “organised efforts to induce certain attitudes in other people or in public, largely by way of suggestion and the utilisation of emotionally tinged words ”(from the Dictionary of Psychology). Its biased use is largely exercised in wars, politics and advertising. Inaccurate, repeated or exaggerated claims, statistics, images, even lying are some of the key instruments. Usually, propaganda travels without evidence, leaving its power in the eyes of the beholder. And there is also subliminal seduction. Why is this sexy-looking girl hovering over the advertised bottle of whisky? Propaganda’s main objective is to reinforce or change an audience or person’s mind and thinking in, for example, seeking support for a particular view, a particular party, a certain product, or even appearing to win a war, etc. A big one was when both US President George W Bush and British PM Tony Blair justified the invasion of Iraq by falsely claiming “weapons of mass destruction” there. Was former president Donald Trump’s repeated claim he was “cheated” out of the 2020 US elections true? Uniforms and flags, the swastika symbol, lavish marches, big, repeated lies through censored radio and newspapers all helped make Hitler and the Nazi party looked invincible, for a time. We here had and continue to have our propaganda share, with the mass media caught in the middle with daily “he say-she say” exchanges. Propaganda may be mischievous or untrue, but not a crime, unless it is seditious or libellous. During the covid epidemic, much misinformation flowed as propaganda. Who is lying? several commentators asked. I then wrote a column entitled Lies, lying and liars. Today, the same question is asked about contradictory reports concerning the Strategic Services Agency (SSA). Who is lying? Now, lying in politics is an age-old phenomenon. In parliament, it is a serious breach of privilege. Calypsonian Lord Nelson, noting our cultural relish for it, sang about King Liar, a contest between three “big liars” with the moralising chorus: “Teacher Percy say if you tell a lie/You going to hell as soon as you die.” Not all lying is propaganda. How many people would lie to get medicine in order to save their mother’s life? In her book Lying: Moral Choice in Public Life, Sissela Bok noted several contexts in which “lying for survival” may be justified. The survival of party politics often depends on lying to “protect the party.” “White lies” are the trade of diplomacy, tolerated and understood. Through fake news, post-truth and social-media misinformation, lying has now become an industry in itself. The anonymity adds danger. Witnesses lie in court every day. Cross-examination doesn’t always help. Machiavelli allowed propaganda in politics as necessary for maintaining power. Check the newspapers for political statements, especially about crime, which appear as propaganda.","summary":"Since this country is in a life-and-death war against crime, there is a compelling, inevitable desire for the government forces to win this war.\n\n\nBut given the political system as it is, the Opposition feels obligated to question the government’s methods, promises and apparent “failures.” The need for persuasion and its techniques from both sides therefore makes crime a hot political issue, with each side striving for support.\n\n\nPropaganda, for good or bad purpose, comes into inevitable play.

While speaking to over 10,000 people at Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, the Republican presidential nominee vowed the “United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world” if he’s elected to a second term in White House. “If Bitcoin is going to the Moon – as we say – it’s going to the Moon, I want America to be the nation that leads the way,” said Trump, insisting the digital currency’s value could someday surpass that of gold under his leadership. Trump also pledged to end what he called President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ so-called “war on crypto” — and to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Genlser, who is leading a regulatory crackdown on digital currency. “For three and a half years, the current administration has waged a war on crypto and Bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen before,” he said. He announcement to boot Gensler, if re-elected president, drew huge cheers from the crowd. Trump also pledged to appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council to regulate the industry — but under new rules written by people “who love the industry” and want to help it grow. While president, Trump was a big skeptic of the crypto market, saying in 2019, “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever. It is called the United States Dollar!” But he’s embraced digital currency in recent years, and his campaign began accepting donations in crypto in May. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), has introduced and supported pro-crypto legislation. Vance, a former venture capitalist, is a stakeholder in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency backers are hopeful a Trump return to the White House will lead to Bitcoin becoming more mainstream. Earlier Saturday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hit the campaign trail in the Keystone State to stump for Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, while trying to move to the top of the list of frontrunners vying to become her choice for vice president. Harris, the 59-year-old vice president, is now embarking on a four-month sprint to the 2024 election after Democrats ousted Biden from the ticket and the 81-year-old endorsed her. Shapiro is widely viewed as a leading contender to become Harris’ running mate. He is popular in the Keystone State and viewed as a moderate who would balance out Harris — whose voting record as a senator made her the chamber’s most liberal, according to GovTrack. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are also among the top contenders. Harris is expected to make her choice by Aug. 7. Harris’ schedule Saturday included attending a fundraiser in Pittsfield. Massachusetts., where she was expected to raise $1.4 million– a huge haul compared to the $400,000 organizers originally hope to score, according to Politico. The vice president later addressed a virtual conference to Voters of Tomorrow, a progressive organization representing Gen Z and Millennial voters that are among the more than a dozen youth groups that have pledged their support to Harris.

The perpetrator, Thomas Matthew Crooks, who authorities say acted alone, was fatally shot within seconds of opening fire. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, at least 700 FBI agents are involved in the investigation into the matter—the first attempted assassination of a U.S. president in more than four decades. Two other reviews into the Secret Service’s security failure are ongoing. While these investigations are underway, a clearer image of the incident has come into focus—though many questions, including the shooter’s motives, remain unanswered. New details were disclosed in testimonies to Congress in the week of July 22 by Mr. Wray, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, and Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. So far, more than 100 interviews have been conducted, and more than 1,000 pieces of evidence have been cataloged, according to Col. Paris. Mr. Crooks searches on the internet for how far away Lee Harvey Oswald was from President John F. Kennedy when Oswald shot the president. “That’s a search that’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” Mr. Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Crooks registers for the Butler rally on July 6. “I think, a week before, he spent roughly 20 minutes there,” Mr. Wray testified. On the morning of the rally, Mr. Crooks returns to the site of the rally and spends around 70 minutes there. It was the second of his three visits to the site, according to Mr. Wray. Mr. Wray said that the FBI has learned this purchase took place at around 1:30 p.m. ET, approximately 5 hours before the shooting. The drone, Mr. Wray said, afforded the gunman a “rearview mirror” of the scene behind him and a better assessment of the angle toward the podium. The FBI has recovered the drone. This sniper is one of two posted inside the American Glass Research (AGR) building, the same building from which Mr. Crooks fires an hour later. The sniper who notices Mr. Crooks doesn’t immediately report it. In her testimony, former Secret Service Director Cheatle said that the rally was allowed to proceed because Mr. Crooks was deemed as suspicious but not as a threat. According to body camera footage taken in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, a Beaver County sniper caught images of Mr. Crooks arriving via bicycle. Local officers notice Mr. Crooks has a rangefinder, which are used to calculate distances for firearms, a little less than an hour before shots are fired. Mr. Crooks is not yet considered a threat by the Secret Service, and isn’t until moments before the shooting. Col. Paris said local officers deem Mr. Crooks suspicious because he is “milling around that area in front of the AGR building” but not entering the rally venue. At the time, the officer is asked to report it to the Butler emergency services command center, which is in charge of distributing communications. Notably, according to Mr. Johnson’s report, communications were siloed by agency, limiting communication between local and state police and the Secret Service. This means that the local sniper is unable to immediately communicate it to the Secret Service. Col. Paris said multiple people were identified as suspicious at the rally. Snipers stationed in a building overlooking the roof of the nearby AGR building leave their post to look for Mr. Crooks around the same time, Col. Paris said. Mr. Crooks could have and should have been apprehended around this timeCol. Paris says at the hearing. “I would say Mr. Crooks could have been encountered and intercepted. That would have been the ideal,” Col. Paris said. Ms. Cheatle said in her testimony that rangefinders, which can offer a zoomed-in image to users, aren’t prohibited items and carrying one wasn’t enough on its own to label Mr. Crooks a threat. Mr. Crooks “climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,” Mr. Wray said. The FBI discovered later that Mr. Crooks had previously purchased a ladder, though Mr. Wray said that the FBI does not believe that he used this ladder to scale the building, as no ladder was found at the scene of the incident. “Look, they’re all pointing,” one says. “Yeah, someone’s on top of the roof,” another says. The video zooms in on the shooter: “Yeah, he’s right there, you see him? He’s laying down; you see him?” “Officer!” one shouts. “He’s on the roof!” one woman says, sounding exasperated. “Right here, right on the roof.” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) mentioned this during a July 24 hearing, citing briefings from law enforcement officials. As the officer grabs onto the roof’s ledge to get on the roof, the shooter turns and aims his gun at the officer. After the first shot rings out, the former president whips his hand to his ear, appears to notice blood, and quickly drops to the ground. In later comments on the incident, former President Trump said he “knew something was wrong” almost immediately, particularly when he saw the blood. According to Mr. Wray and Col. Paris, eight shell casings were recovered, indicating that Mr. Crooks fired as many rounds. Ms. Cheatle reported that the countersniper who neutralized Mr. Crooks fired a single shot. Some of the agents’ comments are picked up by the microphone. “What’re we doing, what’re we doing?” one female agent says. “Where are we going?” Two Secret Service personnel carrying military grade rifles take to the stage, scanning the crowd as Secret Service agents determine their next move. Several agents shout, “Shooter down.” “Shooter down, are we good to move?” a female agent asks. “Shooter’s down,” a male agent replies. “We’re good to move.” At this point, former President Trump begins to slowly stand up, still largely covered by agents. His shirt and hair are disheveled, and streaks of blood run down the right side of his face. As he stands up, agents continue to shield his body. Moments later, he says, “Wait, wait, wait.” The former president then raises his fist to the crowd and is seen saying the words, “Fight, fight, fight!” He is taken by agents to a nearby vehicle, which pulls away. Former President Trump is taken to Butler Memorial Hospital to receive medical attention, while several patients in the ER pray. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter is killed during the shooting as he shields his wife and daughter from gunfire. Two other men are seriously wounded, including 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, and 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington. In addition, a “detonation device” is discovered on the shooter’s body, according to Col. Paris. Few other details about the explosive devices have been released. Aside from the joint investigation being conducted by the FBI and Pennsylvania State Police, the Secret Service plans to issue its own investigation report in about 60 days, according to Ms. Cheatle before she resigned. The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General’s Office has opened an investigation into the Secret Service’s “process for securing former President Trump’s July 13, 2024 campaign event.” The House voted unanimously on July 24 to pass a resolution creating a special task force to investigate the attempted assassination. “We are announcing a House Task Force made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats to thoroughly investigate the matter,” Mr. Johnson and Mr. Jeffries wrote in a joint statement. “The task force will be empowered with subpoena authority and will move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and make certain such failures never happen again.”","summary":"What we know after several law enforcement officials testified to Congress.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/trump-assassination-attempt-an-updated-timeline-5694776","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/27/id5694898-Election_2024_Trump_Shooter_24197853777964_E2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:14:16","author":"Joseph Lord,Zachary Stieber","authors":["Joseph Lord","Zachary Stieber"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":252784536,"title":"Propaganda in politics, crime","text":"Since this country is in a life-and-death war against crime, there is a compelling, inevitable desire for the government forces to win this war.

Then 23, the sportsman-turned-actor trialled for a spot in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics but unfortunately failed both times. He made the move from diving to modelling, and then to acting in music videos, until he eventually became gritty Hollywood hard man he is known as today. So, have you guessed who it is? Photos of a then-23-year-old Hollywood star representing Team GB in diving at the 1990 Commonwealth Games resurfaced on Saturday Before he became Hollywood's action favourite, Jason Statham, 57, was an avid diver who tried and failed to qualify for Team GB at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics It's Jason Statham! Over the course of his acting career, Jason has gone from playing cockney gangsters to one of the world's most recognisable action stars. In 1998, he made his acting debut in the Guy Ritchie project Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But before the glitz and the glamour, Jason was nearing the pinnacle of something very different. Read More Jason Statham competed in diving at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland Eight years prior to that, Jason found himself in Auckland competing at the Commonwealth Games. Representing England, the Death Race star was actually a professional diver. It was an admirable attempt from Jason who actually performed across three separate events. He secured a top-10 finish in the one-metre springboard, and followed that up with two 11th places in the three and 10-metre platforms respectively. Jason has given credit to his career in sports as part of the reason he has been so successful on the big screen, telling the BBC in 2008: 'I think what I didn't achieve [in sports] helped me focus more and take my acting career more seriously.' While many may not have known about Jason's past as a diver, his interest in sport will come as less of a shock. Jason made the move from diving to modelling, and then to acting in music videos, until he eventually became gritty Hollywood hard man he is known as today. Jason has credited a high diver he saw during as a child while he was on a family holiday as the reason he got into diving Despite the diving career not working out, Jason has enjoyed great success through his acting and personal life (pictured with his long-time partner Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 37, in April) Showcased in so many of his films, the Derbyshire-born star has practiced martial arts including kickboxing and karate. But his love for diving began as a young teen which he accredits to seeing a high dive in Miami.

'And I said: \"When we get home, I am going to do that.\" 'I joined the club then, I was like 11 or 12 years old. Within a year, I was part of the British team and it gained momentum and speed and I spent the next 10 years doing that.'

The former president even offered them a high-profile government scalp as he gave a speech to the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville on Saturday. ‘On day one I will fire Gary Gensler,’ he told the crowd, speaking of the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Trump received so much applause from the crowd that he repeated his pledge, adding, ‘I didn’t know he was that unpopular’. Gensler would be replaced with someone friendly to crypto investors, and he would create a crypto advisory council to design regulatory guidance. The Bitcoin price crashed to less than $67,000 as soon as Trump started speaking, but rallied to $69,000 over the next hour when investors heard his pro-crypto speech. Trump made numerous promises to make the US the world’s ‘crypto capital’, in contrast with President Joe Biden’s efforts to strongly regulate it. ‘I pledge to the Bitcoin community, the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’s anti-crypto crusade will be over. It will end. It will be done,’ he said. ‘The moment I’m sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization ends against your industry.’ He warned that if Vice President Harris won ‘every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless. They will do things that you wouldn’t believe’. ‘Kamala is worse than Joe, she is a radical, lunatic, she is against crypto. Now a little honeymoon period is going on,’ he added. Trump’s embracing of cryptocurrency is a sharp turn from just three years ago when he railed against it, and even top crypto boosters admit the former president is ‘pandering’ to them to win votes. ‘Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,’ Trump said in 2021, calling it ‘another currency competing against the dollar’. ‘I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,’ he said in 2019, linking it to drug sales and criminals. ‘We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever. It is called the United States Dollar!’ But wealthy donors, and Trump’s desire to be president again no matter, what fueled a road to Damascus conversion he hopes will give him an edge. In Nashville, he tried to sell himself as ‘the crypto president’ in contrast to Harris, who allegedly privately told a donor ‘Bitcoin is money for criminals’. ‘This is the steel industry of 100 years ago,’ Trump claimed. ‘If we don’t do it, China and others are going to be doing it. Let’s do it right. If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. ‘It’s not going to be made anywhere else. And if bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say… I want America to be the nation that leads the way, and that’s what’s going to happen. So you’re going to be very happy with me.’ Trump outlined his plan to create a framework for the expansion of stable coins, and promised to keep all the crypto the US Government owned. He would then expand those holdings to create a ‘strategic national Bitcoin stockpile’. “America’s laws are too unclear, and too tough, and too angry and too stiff,’ he said. Trump would also end Treasury Department efforts to create a central bank digital currency, which would compete with Bitcoin and others. ‘There will never be a CBDC while I’m president of the United States,’ he said. Trump’s about-face on cryptocurrency followed investors poring tens of millions into his campaign coffers, and Americans sending $4 million in crypto donations. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who famously sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for Facebook, each pledged $1 million to his campaign. They each also sent $250,000 the Elon Musk’s America PAC, which funnels money to the Trump campaign. Tyler Winklevoss, in a 1,417-word rant on Twitter, claimed the Biden Administration ‘openly declared war against crypto’ and endorsed Trump for president. ‘It’s time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington. That attacking us is political suicide,’ he wrote. He claimed Biden ‘weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it’. ‘This administration’s actions have been nothing short of an unprecedented abuse of power wielded entirely for twisted political gain at the complete expense of innovation, the American taxpayer, and the American economy.’ Winklevoss and other crypto boosters also got into a fight with Harris after she declined an invitation to speak at Saturday’s event in Nashville. ‘The Biden-Harris Administration wages all-out war on the crypto industry for four years,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘Despite all of this, Kamala is still invited to the The Bitcoin Conf[erence] in Nashville and given a chance to speak to our industry and reset the relationship. ‘What does she do? She declines. She can’t even take the first step and show up to start mending fences. ‘Our industry won’t forget this. We will show no mercy in November.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is courting the votes of cryptocurrency investors by promising to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump names first person he would fire as president and promises to turn the US into the &#8216;crypto capital&#8217; of the world, despite previously criticizing Bitcoin as a &#8216;scam&#8217; built on &#8216;thin air&#8217;. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-names-first-person-he-would-fire-as-president-and-promises-to-turn-the-us-into-the-crypto-capital-of-the-world-despite-previously-criticizing-bitcoin-as-a-scam-built-on-thin-ai/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/27/23/87849629-13679803-image-a-1_1722117860285.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:07:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":252783082,"title":"JD Vance gets Secret Service code name ‘Bobcat,’ joins ‘Mogul’ in bid to take White House","text":"As the Secret Service continues to face scrutiny and outrage after former President Donald Trump was nearly killed by an assassin’s bullet on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency reportedly has issued a new code name for vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. The Republican senator from Ohio is Trump’s running mate as the 45th president hopes to regain the White House. Vance’s Secret Service code name is “Bobcat,” according to the Daily Mail, citing a friend of Vance’s. Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump-Vance campaign for comment as well as to the Secret Service. Secret Service code names are given to presidents, vice presidents, first ladies and other high-profile persons under the agency’s protection. They once had a real cloak-and-dagger purpose to help protect the nation’s top leaders. But these days, in the era of encrypted technology, the names are largely ceremonial and used for ease of communication in fast, high-pressure situations. Code names are selected by “sheer whim,” a Secret Service spokesperson once told The Washington Post. But they do appear to have some connection to the individual’s personal history or heritage. And note the alliteration of code names within families, said to be tradition. Here’s a look at some known Secret Service code names, as reported by Britannica and other sources. Bobcat Vice presidential candidate Vance. “Bobcats” is the nickname for both Ohio University and Breathitt County High School, in Jackson, Kentucky, the family hometown Vance profiled in “Hilbilly Elegy,” his bestselling 2016 memoir. Capri First lady Jill Biden, married to Celtic. Celtic President Joe Biden. He was Renegade’s vice president when he first earned a code name that pays tribute to his Irish roots. Dancer First lady Rosalynn Carter, married to Deacon. Her other code name was Lotus Petal. Deacon President Jimmy Carter. It “reflected his deeply religious faith,” noted Britannica. Eagle President Bill Clinton. “Some speculated that the code name concerned his association with the Boy Scouts,” said Britannica, given that “Eagle Scout” is the organization’s top rank. Evergreen First lady Hillary Clinton, married to Eagle. Hoosier Vice President Mike Pence. He hails from Indiana — the Hoosier State. Hummingbird Second lady Karen Pence, married to Hoosier. Lace First lady Jackie Kennedy. A tribute, apparently, to her elegant style and an alliteration with her husband’s code name. Lancer President John F. Kennedy. The “code name was apt, given that his administration was often compared to Camelot … of which Lancelot was a legendary knight,” according to Britannica. Lyric Caroline Kennedy. A prophetic nickname: President Kennedy’s daughter was the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s sing-a-long hit, “Sweet Caroline,” written in 1969, six years after her father was assassinated. Muse First lady Melania Trump, married to Mogul. Perhaps a tribute to the former model’s inspirational beauty. Mogul President Donald Trump. He wanted the code name “Humble,” Britannica said, adding that “the Secret Service opted for something … a little less humble.” Passkey President Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon. Pioneer Vice president Kamala Harris, who reportedly picked the name in August 2020 shortly after, like Vance, she was tapped as a VP candidate. Rainbow First lady Nancy Reagan, married to Rawhide. Rawhide President Ronald Reagan. Reagan appeared in several westerns and often wore a cowboy hat while campaigning to be governor of California. Renaissance First lady Michelle Obama, married to Renegade. Renegade President Barack Obama. He “opted for this moniker after being presented with a list of names beginning with the letter ‘R,’” Time magazine reported in 2021. Searchlight President Richard Nixon. His Secret Service nickname “is deeply ironic,” Time magazine and others reported, given the Watergate scandal that brought down Nixon’s presidency. Sunburn Sen. Ted Kennedy. “The pale, Irish-Catholic New Englander had to suffer this code name” while running for president in 1980, according to Time Magazine. Tempo First lady Laura Bush, married to Trailblazer (see two names down). Timberwolf President George H.W. Bush. Perhaps the top-dog nickname is an homage to his role as patriarch of a political dynasty. Trailblazer President George W. Bush. A “complimentary” code name, Britannica noted. Tranquility First lady Barbara Bush and mother of another president. “Snowbank” was apparently an alternate code name for her. Tumbler Also used for George W. Bush, when his father Timberwolf was president.","summary":"As the Secret Service continues to face scrutiny and outrage after former President Donald Trump was nearly killed, the agency reportedly has issued a new code name for vice presidential candidate Sen.

This pledge aligns with the growing interest in sustainable crypto mining practices and the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize the energy sector.Pledged to Fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary GenslerIn a move that drew thunderous applause, Trump promised, \"On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,\" referring to the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He vowed to roll back limitations imposed under the Biden administration, characterizing them as an \"anti-crypto crusade.\" This pledge resonates with many in the crypto community who view current SEC policies as overly restrictive.However, presidents cannot directly fire SEC commissioners, which could complicate the implementation of this promise if Trump is reelected in November.Newsweek contacted Gensler's office via email for comment on Saturday.Committed to Ending \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\"Trump announced plans to create \"a bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\" if he takes office.\"The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,\" the former president said. This commitment suggests a more collaborative approach to crypto regulation, with industry insiders having a seat at the table.The proposed council could potentially shape policies that are more favorable to cryptocurrency innovation and adoption. Additionally, Trump pledged to end what he called \"Operation Choke Point 2.0,\" referring to perceived efforts by federal regulators to discourage banks from working with crypto companies.This promise addresses a key concern in the crypto community about access to traditional banking services and suggests a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under a potential Trump administration.Guaranteed to Keep Bitcoin Leadership in AmericaThe former president vowed to ensure U.S. leadership in cryptocurrency, warning that if America doesn't take the lead, \"China will do it.\" This pledge aligns with Trump's long-standing \"America First\" economic policies and taps into concerns about maintaining U.S. technological supremacy. Trump emphasized the need for America to stay at the forefront of cryptocurrency development, framing it as a matter of national economic security.These promises mark a stark reversal from Trump's previous positions on cryptocurrencies. During his presidency, he tweeted in 2019 that he was \"not a fan\" of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, describing their value as \"based on thin air.\"Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Saturday for comment.Trump's recent change of heart and embrace of crypto has energized the industry, with many viewing the upcoming election as a critical opportunity to reshape what they perceive as hostile U.S. regulations. The former president didn't shy away from partisan rhetoric, warning that a Democratic victory would be disastrous for the crypto industry.\"If they win this election, every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless,\" Trump cautioned on Saturday.On Saturday morning, more than 20 Democratic lawmakers, including Vice President Kamala Harris, reportedly signed a statement calling for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to pivot away from the anti-bitcoin policies associated with Senator Elizabeth Warren.Warren said during an interview in May that she was \"concerned about anyone in Congress who is not worried about the threat posed by Iran and North Korea and their use of crypto,\" and has gone on record with an anti-cryptocurrency crusade.This shift in Democratic stance is reportedly influenced by recent polling data, the Republican Party's pro-bitcoin policies, and Trump's high-profile appearance at the Bitcoin Conference. The move suggests a growing recognition within the Democratic Party of the potential electoral significance of crypto-friendly policies.As the first U.S. president to appear at a bitcoin event, Trump's presence underscores the increasing importance of cryptocurrency in the political landscape. His newfound support for the industry, coupled with the Biden administration's perceived hostility, has led many traditionally Democratic voters in the tech and finance sectors to consider supporting Trump this year.However, with the Democrats' apparent change of heart, the political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency regulation appears increasingly fluid. As Harris emerges as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday and endorsed her, Harris' signature on the pro-crypto statement signals a potential major shift in the party's approach.","summary":"\"Crypto is the steel industry of 100 years ago, you're just in your infancy.

Officials have said it was part of a larger scheme across seven battleground states to keep the former president in the White House after losing to Democrat Joe Biden. Criminal cases have also been brought in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. Meanwhile, the fate of Nevada’s so-called fake electors case hangs in the balance. Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus issued a written order Friday night affirming her ruling from the bench last month that Las Vegas was the wrong venue for the case and therefore the charges must be dismissed. A spokesperson for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, confirmed Saturday in a statement that the office formally filed its appeal shortly after the judge issued her written order. “We remain confident in our case and look forward to bringing these individuals to justice and holding them accountable for their actions,” the statement says. The defendants are state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; Clark County GOP chairman Jesse Law; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. They were indicted by a grand jury in Las Vegas last December, just before a three-year statute of limitations expired. Each was charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument — felonies carrying a penalty of up to four or five years in prison. Monti Levy, one of the defense lawyers, said Saturday they “are confident that Judge Holthus made the correct decision and that her order granting the motion to dismiss will be upheld.” The defense attorneys had argued that Ford improperly brought the case against their clients before a grand jury in Democratic-leaning Las Vegas instead of in a northern Nevada city, where the alleged crimes occurred. Ford’s office, meanwhile, argued that “no one county contains the entirety of these crimes.” It wasn’t clear Saturday from court records whether oral arguments had been scheduled before the Nevada Supreme Court. The court’s clerk also did not respond to an emailed message seeking more information. Trump lost to Biden by more than 30,000 votes in Nevada.

Trump said — to rapturous applause from the Nashville crowd — that if elected, he would fire current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom the crypto world has come to view as its chief opponent in government due to his agency’s rulings on digital tokens and lawsuits against bitcoin exchanges. “I will appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future,” Trump said. His embrace of crypto comes amid high-profile endorsements from bitcoin advocates including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook and who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Trump’s remarks stand to further cement his growing alliance with other right-leaning figures in the tech world, though the novelty of his appearance at the conference was not lost on him. As he praised the audience as “geniuses,” he acknowledged he was still learning about crypto. “Most people have no idea what the hell it is,” he quipped. “So what happens when everyone figures it out? That’ll be something.” Trump offered up a proposal to create a national bitcoin “stockpile” that he said would serve as a “permanent national asset,” though stopped short of offering many details. The idea of creating a strategic crypto reserve has caught on quickly among bitcoin supporters. On Friday, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also proposed creating a bitcoin reserve, saying he would direct the Treasury to purchase 4 million bitcoins, which in today’s prices would equate to approximately $272 billion. Immediately following Trump’s remarks, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she would introduce a bill to create the reserve. However, the price of bitcoin fell slightly in the wake of Trump’s remarks Saturday, perhaps reflecting crypto traders’ unmet expectations for a more definitive commitment on the reserve idea from the presidential candidate. While the Bitcoin Conference is officially apolitical, Trump’s speech punctuated an event whose politico panelists leaned Republican, including four sitting GOP senators and three GOP Senate candidates. The sole elected Democrat, California Rep. Ro Khanna, spoke early Saturday and criticized the tendency within his own party to further entrench traditional centers of finance. “I thought the Democrats were opposed to monopoly power. … We don’t want the banks and the Fed to have a monopoly on fast payments,” Khanna said at a panel Saturday. Shortly after his morning remarks, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a group of Democratic representatives and candidates had sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee urging party leaders to be more supportive of crypto. In addition to Khanna, the letter’s signatories included representatives in purple districts in critical swing states like North Carolina and Arizona. The current administration’s “hostility,” the signees said, does not reflect “our Party’s progressive, forward-looking, and inclusive values.” “A refreshed leader of the ticket represents an opportunity to change that perception,” they wrote. In a follow-up interview with NBC News at the conference, Khanna said that positively engaging with the crypto community would be in keeping with Democrats’ desire to be “the party of the future.” “They’re passionate, they’re active on social media, and they’re mobilized,” Khanna said. “And it’s a community that’s going to vote.” Conference organizers say Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris declined an invitation to appear at the conference. The organizers declined to comment further on the matter, though conference head David Bailey criticized Harris’ absence on X. Harris’ campaign has not commented. In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Bailey said that despite Harris not appearing at the conference, the window had not closed on Democrats’ ability to win support from the crypto community. “There’s a whole progressive case for bitcoin,” he said. While that rationale may not have received as much notice, Bailey said, “my intuition is, over the next four years, it will.” On Saturday, the Financial Times reported Harris had approached top crypto companies seeking a “reset” of relations, citing unnamed sources. Bailey said it would ultimately become a political necessity for all political parties to engage with bitcoin supporters as a political bloc. “It’s not too late — in fact, everyone will have to come to terms with it,” he said. “They won’t be viable otherwise.” Outside the conference early Saturday, pro-Trump bitcoin supporters made their presence known. Chad Kozman, an Ohio resident, sported a “Free Ross/Vote Trump” shirt, referring to the community’s desire to see Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence on drug and money-laundering charges commuted, something Trump has promised he would do. Kozman told NBC News that while Trump’s overtures to the crypto community were opportunistic, it was also a sign that the community had matured beyond its individualistic roots into a voting group that had to be reckoned with. “For the bitcoin community, it’s been a really hard road to get people to see the benefits of collectivization and pulling together,” he said.","summary":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promised to make America the world leader in bitcoin and other digital currencies if elected, likening the crypto-verse to “the steel industry of 100 years ago.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hails-crypto-largest-bitcoin-conference-rcna163925","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240727-Trump-Bitcoin-Nashville-aa-447p-3d23dd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:35:26","author":"Rob Wile","authors":["Rob Wile"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.19},{"id":252783580,"title":"Donald Trump Backs ‘Strategic Bitcoin Stockpile’ in Speech to Crypto Faithful","text":"Former president Donald Trump has outlined a plan to turbocharge crypto growth and make the US a crypto mining powerhouse in his keynote address to the 2024 Nashville Bitcoin Conference on Saturday. Trump announced that if he is elected, he will create a strategic bitcoin reserve in the US. “It will be the policy of my administration to keep 100 percent of all bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires in the future…as a core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile,” he said. Right now, the US government owns more than 210,000 bitcoins that were seized via illegal operations like the online dark market Silk Road to the ponzi scheme BitConnect. It’s worth approximately $14 billion at time of writing. This move confirmed rumors spread by bitcoin enthusiasts who were hopeful that endorsement of a reserve from Trump could bolster the price of the cryptocurrency. Trump also announced plans to appoint a bitcoin and crypto advisory council, whose task will be to “design transparent regulatory guidance to the benefit of your industry,” in the first 100 days of his next presidency. He said that he wanted the US to become the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump also pledged to create a framework for ensuring the safe expansion of stablecoins, \"allowing us to extend the dominance of the USD to other places around the world,” and doubled down on his vow to scrap any effort to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or digital dollar, saying “there will never be a CBDC while I’m president of the United States.” “I will always defend the right to self-custody,” he told the exultant crowd. What got perhaps the biggest cheer was a day one promise to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. “The moment I am sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization against your industry ends,” he said, name-checking Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as the industry’s sworn enemy. He promised to make regulations friendly to crypto mining operations in the US, so workers wouldn’t have to “move to China.” Trump promised, again, to free Ross Ulbricht, imprisoned for life for his involvement with online underground market Silk Road, where people could buy items like illegal drugs before it was shut down in 2013. The crowd expected the bitcoin strategic reserve announcement. On July 22, senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming posted “Big things…in store this week” on X, two days before Fox Business reported that she would “announce legislation for a strategic bitcoin reserve” at the conference. Lummis appeared before the crowd just after Trump walked off to announce a “present to President Donald Trump”—the bitcoin reserve bill that she’d been drafting. “This is our Louisiana Purchase moment,” she said, elaborating that the bill would take “the bitcoin President Trump just mentioned and pull it into the reserve, [and] that’s only the beginning. Over five years, the United States will assemble 1 million bitcoin, five percent of the world’s bitcoin, and it will be held for a minimum of 20 years and can be used for one purpose—reduce our debt.” The bill further provides that the US will “convert excess reserves at our twelve federal reserve banks into bitcoin over five years,” so that instead of holding a depreciating asset (the US dollar, which she says has been “designed to debase at least 2 percent per year”), we’ll be holding an asset with potential for growth. There’s no arguing that the value of bitcoin has increased over time, though it’s no higher now than it was before Trump’s keynote. It peaked around $69,000 this morning and, as of just after Trump’s talk, sits around $68,400. Trump announcing his desire to add bitcoin to the country’s strategic reserve doesn’t mean it necessarily will, even if he is elected. Ari Paul, founder of BlockTower Capital, an institutional investment firm specializing in crypto, took to X about a week before the conference to put the odds of a bitcoin strategic reserve happening in the next four years at “ten to one.” The US Federal Reserve currently includes assets like gold and foreign (fiat) currencies. They’re used as credit lines to keep the US economy stable, particularly in times of crisis. Many in the crypto community have criticized it for encouraging the US Treasury to “print money” during Covid-19, which has led to lasting inflation. Adding bitcoin to the reserve could, per Lummis, “can cut our debt in half.” Trump has drastically changed his tone about bitcoin from his time as president, when he said it “seems like scam. He’s since described himself as “good” with crypto. On Saturday he praised the crowd as “high-IQ individuals” as opposed to the “low-IQ individual” he’s running against (referring to presidential candidate Kamala Harris.) He credited the room with predicting inflation: “You understand inflation more than anyone else,” he said. “They didn’t listen to you.” Trump’s running mate, Republican senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, is also a fan of crypto. He reported owning between $100,000 and $250,000 in cryptocurrencies in 2022. As of the start of the Bitcoin Conference on July 25, Trump had reportedly received around $4 million worth of cryptocurrencies in campaign donations, in Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, and the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. And because of that, we might be at the mercy of Trump. “Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar. The behavior of the current US Government is threatening the dollar,” he said. “The danger to our financial future does not come from crypto, it comes from Washington, DC.”","summary":"Appearing onstage at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump also promised to “fire” SEC chair Gary Gensler, set up a crypto advisory council, and make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-strategic-bitcoin-stockpile-bitcoin-2024/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/66a55d590971fc8e49c7ac09/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Trump-Crypto-Conference-Business-2163287644.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:32:53","author":"Jessica Klein","authors":["Jessica Klein"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.002},{"id":252783394,"title":"Robinson-Regis: Kamala Harris candidacy a historic milestone","text":"AMERICANS head to the polls in 100 days. Kamala Devi Harris, who is the first black woman since 1972 to run for president, is gearing up as the leading contender for the Democratic Party to challenge former president Donald Trump. Late US politician Shirley Chisholm made history in 1972 after becoming the first black woman to compete for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Harris was born in Oakland, California. She is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings. In 2020 she was elected the 49th vice president of the United States as Joe Biden's running mate. She is the first female vice president and the highest-ranking female official in the country's history. Harris is also the first African American and first South Asian American vice president of the US. She will turn 60 on October 20, 17 days before Americans go to the polls on November 5. On July 21, President Biden, who was under pressure from his party owing to failing health, dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House, quickly endorsing Harris to take on former president Donald Trump. Biden encouraged his party to unite behind her. After announcing that he will not seek the presidential re-election, Biden said he will fully support Harris for the Democratic nomination. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.” Meanwhile, Harris said she was “honoured” to receive Biden’s endorsement, describing the president’s decision not to seek re-election as “selfless and patriotic act.” Stressing Biden’s patriotism, Harris noted that Biden was “putting the American people and our country above everything else.” “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she pledged in a statement. Arouca/Maloney MP and leader of the PNM Women's League, Camille Robinson-Regis, told Newsday via WhatsApp on July 26, while only Americans can decide what is best for their country, the significance of Harris's candidacy as a black woman is \"undeniable, marking a historic milestone in American politics.\" She wishes Harris well in her pursuit. \"As a woman in politics, I applaud any woman who makes politics her career. As a Trinbagonian politician, I would not venture to answer questions on US thinking or Kamala’s priorities. I know what she has said are her priorities, and I wish her every success.\" She said TT must mind our own business when the time comes for our general elections, which are slated for 2025. Robinson-Regis stressed citizens must \"choose wisely, just as the American voters will mind their own and choose wisely.\" She concluded her message, wishing Harris success in her campaign. \"She made history in 2020 and I hope she makes history again in 2024.” “Before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.” Harris said this at her first campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware. “In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers and cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” Caribbean diaspora stands behind Harris Meanwhile, support has poured in for Harris from the Caribbean diaspora and their political representatives. In a Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC) report last week several politicians in New York endorsed Harris whose father is the retired Jamaican-born economist Dr Donald Harris The Haitian-American chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, has welcomed Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential elections in November and endorse Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate. “President Joe Biden has steadfastly served as an exemplary public servant for the betterment of our country for over five decades,” said Bichotte Hermelyn, the daughter of Haitian immigrants. The New York State Assembly member, who represents the 42nd Assembly District in Brooklyn, told CMC “as our president, Biden has greatly advanced our nation forward; achieving immense progress uplifting all Americans through his historic accomplishments and astute leadership”. She said the Brooklyn Democratic Party respects Biden’s “selfless decision” to drop out of the presidential election as the party focuses on defeating ex-President Donald J. Trump, and securing a Democratic-controlled US Congress and Senate. “The Brooklyn Democratic Party wholeheartedly echoes Biden’s endorsement of Harris as our next president, and we’re confident she’ll be an extraordinary partner to keep building on our strongest economy in decades, defending democracy, and improving our quality-of-life—from combating gun violence, to advancing women’s rights, to myriad more pressing issues facing Americans,” Bichotte Hermelyn said. “Vice President Kamala Harris is a fierce fighter with a proven progressive track record, deep experience in the Oval Office, and the determined drive to defeat Trump at the ballot box. As not only the first female, but also the first Black and first South Asian American VP, Harris will continue to break boundaries and build a better nation leading the White House. “As our first Party Chair who is a woman of colour, an elected official, and a Democratic Presidential Delegate, Kamala has my vote for a fairer and stronger future, as she continues to ensure the promises of our country for all people,” Bichotte Hermelyn said about Harris. Without indicating whether he will endorse Harris as the Democratic Party presidential nominee, Democratic party leader Hakeem Jeffries, whose eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens comprises a large concentration of Caribbean immigrants, lauded Biden as “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history. “In less than one term, he rescued the nation from a once-in-a-century pandemic, brought the economy roaring back from the brink of recession, enacted consequential legislation for everyday Americans and saved our democracy by defeating the Insurrectionist-in-Chief,” said Jeffries, the House of Representatives Minority Leader. “America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the second Black mayor after the late David N Dinkins to be mayor of the city, also said that America “owes a debt of gratitude to President Joe Biden for his decades of service. “He and his team took us out of covid, stabilised the country, and restored the soul of the nation. President Biden is now again delivering for the American people by passing the torch at a critical moment, when the country needs strong leadership from a new generation. “From here, the Democratic Party must continue to put working-people first and address their concerns about the cost of living, public safety, and our shared democratic values. I look forward to working with senior members of the party, as we make our push towards November, and ensure we address the concerns of New Yorkers and all Americans,” Adams said. Support for Harris has also poured in from the world of pop music. Support poured in from Janelle Monáe, John Legend, Katy Perry and Charli XCX, whose album “brat” inspired the Internet trend of “brat summer” and many Harris memes. (As a result, Harris’ campaign quickly set its X banner photo to the striking Shrek-green colour of Charli’s “brat” album cover.) On TikTok, users have remixed Harris’ speeches into songs by Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Carly Rae Jepsen and more. On July 26, former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama announced in a video that they have endorsed Harris.

Trump was the keynote speaker at Bitcoin 2024 on Saturday, a gathering of industry heavyweights in Nashville, Tennessee. The Republican presidential candidate used the event to court voters and encourage campaign donations from the tech community. Cryptocurrency has emerged as a political battleground for Republicans, with Trump claiming the Democratic Party and Vice-President Kamala Harris were “against crypto”. The audience was at its most animated when Trump declared “on day one I will fire Gary Gensler”, the SEC chair nominated by current President Joe Biden. The crowd cheered loudly and started to chant “Trump” at this declaration. Mr Gensler led a crackdown on the crypto industry, and has previously said the sector is rife with “hucksters”. The SEC brought charges against the \"King of Crypto\" Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for stealing billions of dollars from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Speaking for about 45 minutes, Trump outlined some of his ideas for the sector if he were to win November's election. He said he would make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. His support for the industry is a 180 turn from his comments in 2021, when he told Fox Business he saw Bitcoin as a “scam” affecting the value of the US dollar. Trump told the crowd at the event he would keep 100% of Bitcoin that the US government currently holds or acquires, adding that it would be a “national Bitcoin stockpile”. The former president also said he would “immediately appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council”.

In his keynote address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, the Republican presidential nominee promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a bitcoin “strategic reserve” using the currency that the government currently holds. He also promised to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler if elected and implement a crypto advisory council, teasing the crowd by asking attendees if anyone wanted to join. “We will have regulations, but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” he said. Trump’s keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference showed how radically his position on cryptocurrency has changed over time. He was not always a fan of cryptocurrencies, writing on social media in 2019 that their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” He has embraced the digital currency in recent years, and in May, his campaign began accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Throughout the nearly 50-minute speech, Trump repeatedly sought to contrast his support of cryptocurrency to the Biden’s administration efforts to regulate the industry, telling the crowd that the federal government was “blocking your way.” Trump said he wanted cryptocurrency “mined, minted and made” in the United States. The former president appealed to bitcoin fans by pointing to U.S. law enforcement seizures of the digital token. “They took it away from you,” he said. “So, as I take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans, today I repeat my promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht.” Ulbricht created the underground drug-selling website Silk Road but was sentenced to life in prison after a judge held him responsible for six overdose deaths linked to his website. Some of the nearly 800 attendees who flocked to downtown Nashville to hear Trump speak wore “Free Ross Day One” hats, in a nod to Ulbricht’s prison sentence. Tennessee’s U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn called Trump’s announcement of a bitcoin strategic reserve a “historic moment.” Trump’s remarks came a day after independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the conference and also pitched launching a strategic bitcoin reserve. ___ Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Former President Donald Trump on Saturday laid out his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump urges Nashville bitcoin conference to make US the global hub for cryptocurrency first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-urges-nashville-bitcoin-conference-to-make-us-the-global-hub-for-cryptocurrency/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Trump-calls-for-US-to-be-‘crypto.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:09:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":252782364,"title":"Trump tells Christians ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ after November","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump implored Christian conservatives gathered Friday night to vote in the November election, telling them that “in four years, you don’t have to vote anymore.” Trump made the remark toward the end of his hourlong speech at The Believers Summit, a three-day event hosted by Turning Point USA in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was talking about “the most important election ever,” which he said Republicans “must win,” before calling on attendees to cast ballots. “Christians, get out and vote, just this time,” Trump said. “You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I’m a Christian. I love you. Get out — you’ve got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote anymore. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote” The clip has gone viral and sparked controversy in the hours since his speech. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s campaign released a statement Saturday condemning what it called a promise “to end American democracy.” “When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom she means it,” the statement reads. “Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump. After the last election Trump lost, he sent a mob to overturn the results. This campaign, he has promised violence if he loses, the end of our elections if he wins, and the termination of the Constitution to empower him to be a dictator to enact his dangerous Project 2025 agenda on America.” Since she became the favorite for the Democratic nomination, Harris has continued President Joe Biden’s line of attacks on Trump, including his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, for which he has been indicted; his March comment that “it’s going to be a bloodbath for the country” if he does not get elected; and Project 2025, a blueprint for a conservative administration spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. Trump spent plenty of time in his Friday speech attacking his new likely opponent, too. The former president called Harris “a bum,” slamming her for her “border czar” role as vice president at a time when immigration has become a top concern for voters, according to a Statista poll published July 5. Harris is poised to officially become the Democratic nominee at the Democratic National Convention, which is set to begin Aug. 19, about 2 1/2 months before the Nov. 5 general election. A Fox News poll released Friday shows the vice president and Trump within 1 percentage point of each other in the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all of which have voted for the winner of the last four presidential elections.","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump implored Christian conservatives gathered Friday night to vote in the November election, telling them that “in four years, you don’t have to vote anymore.” Trump made the remark toward the end of his hourlong speech at The Believers Summit, a three-day event hosted by Turning Point USA in West Palm [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3101962/trump-you-wont-have-to-vote-anymore/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-West-Palm-Beach.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:09:04","author":"Robert Stewart","authors":["Robert Stewart"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":252782716,"title":"Kamala Harris Says \"Underdog\" Campaign Will Overcome Trump's \"Wild Lies\"","text":"US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday acknowledged the uphill climb to defeating Donald Trump in November, but said her freshly-minted presidential campaign would prevail over the \"wild lies\" of her Republican rival. As Trump prepared to address a bitcoin conference in Tennessee, Harris was speaking at a fundraising event in Massachusetts with celebrity guests including singer-songwriter James Taylor and cellist Yoyo Ma. \"We are the underdogs in this race, but this is a people-powered campaign,\" she told the crowd at the event, which her campaign said would net $1.4 million. \"You may have noticed, Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird,\" she said, the latest quip adopted by Democrats in describing the Republicans' attacks. The latest among them included Trump's remarks to a religious convention Friday night, where he accused Harris of being an anti-Semite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies. \"She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is,\" he said of the vice president, whose husband is Jewish. In perhaps his most outrageous statement of the night, he claimed Harris wanted to enshrine in federal law the right to \"rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth.\" Trump, who at age 78 is now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Joe Biden beset by concerns over infirmity. Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016. Her late-starting White House bid has enjoyed early momentum. Polls that had shown Biden steadily slipping against Trump now show Harris in a race too close to call. She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.

However on Sunday, Biden announced he would step down from the race and endorse Harris, the now presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said in a previous statement that it would be \"inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds\" about whom they confirm as their nominee.King, the author of classic horror novels like The Shining and It, and an outspoken Democrat who frequently criticizes Trump, took aim at the former president's age as he is now the oldest presidential candidate in the 2024 election at 78 years old. Biden is 81.\"Elderly Presidential candidate Don Trump doesn't dare debate Kamala Harris,\" King wrote on Saturday afternoon. The post has since garnered over 185,000 views and over 7,500 likes as of publication.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.This comes after June's first presidential debate hosted by CNN saw Trump and Biden face off on various key issues like immigration and inflation. However, while the two have faced concerns about their age and cognitive abilities, Biden failed to quell those concerns during the debate with his lackluster performance which eventually led to him ending his 2024 campaign.Since announcing her presidential campaign, Harris, 59, who has not faced any serious challengers, has managed to secure enough support from delegates to clinch the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.However, Cheung said in his statement, \"Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee.\"The Democratic National Convention (DNC) takes place in Chicago starting on August 19.Trump has previously said he would be open to debating Harris, but that the event should be hosted by Fox News rather than \"very biased ABC.\"Harris herself has also criticized Trump for appearing to back away from the September 10 debate, writing on X on Thursday, \"What happened to 'any time, any place?'\" as she referenced previous remarks Trump had made when he was expected to face off against Biden earlier this year.In addition, Harris told reporters on Thursday that she was ready to debate the former president.\"I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10 debate. He agreed to that previously,\" she said. \"Now, here he is backpedaling, and I'm ready. And I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage, and so I'm ready. Let's go.\"This is not the first time King has taken to social media to criticize Trump as he previously weighed in on the former president's assassination attempt.Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 when he was shot on stage, with a bullet hitting the upper part of his right ear. The suspected gunman, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore was also killed during the incident and two others were injured.In an X post, King made his opinions on the assassination attempt known by sharing several remarks as he pointed toward a key issue in the election, gun violence.\"An AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle was used in the Butler shooting,\" he posted last week. \"These are the guns the Republican party—and Trump—want to protect.\"","summary":"The author criticized Trump's age after the former president appeared to back out of the presidential debate against Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/stephen-kings-donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-post-takes-off-online-1931141","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437843/stephen-king-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:56:08","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":252781244,"title":"Campaigners say Harris received $20,000 per minute during fundraising effort","text":"At one point on Thursday, the Kamala Harris campaign was raising $20,000 per minute, campaigners have said. The campaign for the vice president was hosting a Zoom call for white women to “answer the call” and “show up for Kamala Harris.” “We’re raising $20,000 per minute — the system wasn’t built for this. If you can’t make your donation, keep trying,” Shannon Watts, founder of the anti-gun violence group Mom Demands Action, wrote on X on Thursday morning. Watts added that there were more than 100,000 participants and that at least $2m was raised during the fundraising effort. The Harris campaign expected to bring in another $1.4m during a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on Saturday. The event, with about 800 attendees at the Colonial Theatre, was the largest event held in the Berkshires since then-First Lady Michelle Obama visited in 2012. Her remarks at the fundraiser lasted roughly 18 minutes. Describing her past as a prosecutor, she said: “In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” The Harris campaign is targeting women voters, a group former President Donald Trump has struggled with in past elections. In 2016, Trump won 39 per cent of women, losing the group by 15 points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2020, he garnered 44 per cent of the women’s vote, losing by 11 points to President Joe Biden, Newsweek noted. According to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted between July 22 and 24, Harris leads Trump among women by 14 points – 55 to 41 per cent. This comes as Trump’s running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance is facing increasing scrutiny for his past comments about women. While Vance has been commended as an adept speaker and media performer for the Maga movement, Democrats think his conservative views on abortion and cutting rhetoric about women will push away swing voters, particularly with someone like Harris leading the charge against the Republicans. During an appearance on Fox News in July 2021, Vance criticized those he called “childless cat ladies” on the left with no “stake” in the future of the country. He pointed to Harris as being one of them despite her having two stepchildren. In a statement to Newsweek, spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said: “Once again, the left-wing media have twisted Senator Vance’s words and spun up a false narrative about his position on the issues. The Democrats are in complete disarray with the most unpopular vice president in history as their party’s nominee.” She added: “The only childlessness we should be talking about is the childless parents who lost their kids to the murderous thugs and deadly fentanyl coming across Kamala’s southern border.”","summary":"Harris campaign targets women voters as Trump’s running mate is on the backfoot over past comments","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-donations-2024-election-b2587021.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/27/17/AP24209567673554.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0yrBdTDo-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:54:40","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":252781850,"title":"Trump calls for US to be ‘crypto capital of the planet’ in appeal to Nashville bitcoin conference","text":"NASHVILLE, Tenn.

Trump wrote on Truth Social in a post Saturday morning that the Secret Service, which has been sharply criticized for its handling of security at the Butler, Pa., rally where he was wounded, was “very capable” of providing extra security. “NO ONE CAN EVER BE ALLOWED TO STOP OR IMPEDE FREE SPEECH OR GATHERING!!!” Trump wrote. The Secret Service did not confirm or deny that it would provide additional security, citing security concerns, but a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said it was accurate that the Secret Service will be increasing security for Trump’s outdoor rallies. The Washington Post had previously reported that the Secret Service has encouraged Trump to stop large outdoor rallies and his campaign was scouting indoor venues. “Ensuring the safety and security of our protectees is our highest priority,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “In the interest of maintaining operational integrity, we are not able to comment on specifics of our protective means or methods.” The Secret Service said it had previously increased security in June as the presidential campaign heated up and the candidates were appearing at more events. Trump was wounded in the ear as he spoke at a large outdoor rally on July 13 when a gunman opened fire from a nearby roof. The shooting left one rallygoer dead and injured two others in the crowd that had gathered to see the Republican presidential nominee. Law enforcement snipers shot and killed 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The FBI said Friday that Trump was injured by a bullet or a bullet fragment fired by the shooter, after lingering questions about whether a bullet or debris caused his injuries. Trump has not provided medical records about his injuries, but Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), a Trump ally and former White House physician, released a letter saying he had treated Trump for a two-centimeter wound on his ear that did not require stitches. Trump’s Saturday post followed another on Truth Social on Friday night in which he promised to return to Butler for a “BIG AND BEAUTIFUL RALLY” that would honor the firefighter, Corey Comperatore, who was killed at the rally and those injured. Trump did not say when the event would occur or if it would be outdoors. “WHAT A DAY IT WILL BE - FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!” Trump wrote. Trump has not appeared at an outdoor rally since the shooting. He is scheduled to appear at a hockey arena in St. Cloud, Minn., Saturday night for a campaign rally. After intense criticism from lawmakers for not preventing the shooting, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week. Law enforcement has not been able to determine a motive in the shooting. Cheatle previously said that an internal review of the agency’s handling of the shooting should be available within 60 days and an independent report ordered by President Biden was due in 45 days. The FBI is leading the investigation into the shooting. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to questions seeking additional information about the president’s plans for outdoor rallies.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump vowed Saturday to stage more outdoor rallies two weeks after surviving an assassination attempt and claimed the Secret Service has agreed to “substantially step up their operation” to protect him.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-07-27/trump-outdoor-rallies-extra-secret-service-14622723.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/ughiv1-trump-rallies-security_ujhaxbmcguabb7fxof4k7xr6zi.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/trump-rallies-security_UJHAXBMCGUABB7FXOF4K7XR6ZI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:49:50","author":"Justin Jouvenal","authors":["Justin Jouvenal"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":252781026,"title":"Biden Began a History-Making Month With a Debate Joke He Probably Regrets","text":"Thirty minutes before the historic June 27 presidential debate, President Joe Biden made a joke he likely regrets following his poor debate performance and eventual decision to dropout from the race.In response to accusations from Republicans and then-presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, who has accepted the party's nomination, that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his MarchState of the Union (SOTU) address since he appeared more energetic and might do the same in his debate against Trump, Biden posted a joke on his official X, formerly Twitter, page.\"I don't know what they've got in these performance enhancers, but I'm feeling pretty jacked up. Try it yourselves, folks. See you in a bit,\" he wrote on June 27. The president's post accompanied two photos of him holding a can of water featuring his face with red eyes on it, with the can's text reading, \"Get Real, Jack. It's just water.\"Newsweek has reached out to Biden's former campaign press team for comment via email on Sunday.A month since his joke, the entire political landscape has changed.The Debate On June 27, Biden and Trump faced off for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, although the politicians have previously debated during the 2020 election. The debate, hosted by CNN without a live audience, took place in Atlanta.Biden's performance was widely regarded as low-energy and unconvincing. He faced criticism from his own party, with many Democratic voters, politicians, and commentators immediately pointing to his stumbling and sometimes incoherent and hard-to-hear responses as worrisome.Questions about Biden's mental sharpness and age flared up during and immediately after the debate, following the 81-year-old's weak performance. Trump, 78, has also faced criticism for his age and mental acuity.A Biden aide, meanwhile, told Newsweek late that night that the president was battling a cold during the debate.The Aftermath Since the debate, over 30 Democratic Congress members called for Biden to step aside, urging the Democrats to put forward a new candidate at the top of the ticket.Pressure from top party leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began to mount, with Pelosi responding to calls about whether she wanted Biden in the race on MSNBC's Morning Joe two weeks after the debate: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"In mid-July, according to a Washington Post report, former President Barack Obama, who selected Biden as his running mate, confided in his allies that he is concerned about the viability of Biden's reelection campaign.Donors and public backers of Biden's campaign, like actor George Clooney who calls himself a \"lifelong Democrat\" and a Biden admirer, also faltered on their support for Biden over concerns of his ability to win the election and serve four more years.Clooney wrote a New York Times op-ed titled, \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,\" where he wrote, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"On the other hand, there have been growing calls among Republicans to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from office. The amendment would deem Biden \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" and thus, Vice President Kamala Harris would oversee the nation from its highest office.In the days following the debate, as concerns about his age and mental acuity were at a peak, Biden accidentally called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"Putin\" during a speech about the United States supporting Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. In a speech later that day, he mistakenly called Harris, \"Vice President Trump.\" The double gaffe further fueled calls questioning his capability to run the country for another term.Biden also began to slip in the presidential polls against Trump. His approval rating also fell, with the national poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight showing 55.6 percent of Americans disapproved of Biden, while 38.8 percent approved, as of July 26.Dropping OutDespite repeatedly reaffirming his commitment to staying in the presidential race, on Sunday, July 21, Biden announced his exit from the race, seemingly heeding calls from within the Democratic Party. Moments later, he publicly endorsed Harris for president.His announcement came just over 100 days before Election Day, which is on November 5, and less than 30 days before the Democratic National Convention (DNC) begins in Chicago on August 19.In a national address Wednesday night, Biden said that he dropped out of the race to \"pass the torch to a new generation,\" regardless of his own \"personal ambition\" to win and serve out a second term. The president said that the likely election between Harris and Trump would be a choice \"between moving forward or backward.\"Biden said he will continue to serve out his term, which ends on January 20, 2025.\"Over the next six months I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said, echoing his platform policies like \"lowering costs for hardworking families,\" \"defending personal freedoms,\" and \"calling out hate and extremism.\"In the past week, Harris has rallied former Biden supporters to donate and back her campaign for the Oval Office.","summary":"One month to the day after preparing to face off with Donald Trump in the first presidential debate of 2024, President Joe Biden has exited the race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/biden-began-history-making-month-debate-joke-he-probably-regrets-1931125","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437830/presidential-debate-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:47:39","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":252783422,"title":"Texas sues Biden administration over teenage access to birth control","text":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the Biden administration over a policy that allows adolescents to access birth control without their parents’ consent, arguing that the rule violates state law requiring guardians to consent to their children’s use of contraceptives. Paxton said in a statement that he was protecting parental rights, a popular GOP rallying cry used by Republicans to talk about culture-war issues such as education and transgender care. “By attempting to force Texas health care providers to offer contraceptives to children without parental consent, the Biden administration continues to prove they will do anything to implement their extremist agenda - even undermine the Constitution and violate the law,” Paxton said in a statement. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a division of the Northern District of Texas that has one federal judge, is unlikely to change much in the state, analysts said. That’s because a similar case ended in March with a ruling that required Texas providers to begin obtaining parental consent this spring without wholly striking down the rule. But it is the latest conservative effort to challenge the Biden administration’s reproductive health-care policies and Title X, a half-century-old family-planning program. With that March ruling already in place, some worry this week’s lawsuit is an attempt to build Paxton’s political clout by ending confidential care for teens not just in Texas but across the country. “It seems intended to take away people’s bodily autonomies as part of a much larger campaign across the country,” said Robin Summers, the senior counsel at the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents family-planning providers and administrators nationwide. “This would be terrible for the health of minors seeking this care.” The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Title X, has said it is within its right to prohibit providers from obtaining parental consent because its rules supersede state law. It argues that minors’ access to confidential reproductive care is crucial for their health. HHS did not respond to a request for comment Saturday morning. Confidential care can prevent sexually transmitted diseases and protect against potential infertility, Summers added, for children whose parents might abuse or disown them if they knew they were seeking that care. Texas has the eighth highest teen birth rate in the country and some of the nation’s strictest abortion limits. The new requirement for parental consent has had a swift impact on Texas providers and minors. In El Paso, one facility saw a stark drop in teens seeking appointments for contraception in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, according to a Texas Tribune article published in April. Carmen Robles Frost, a Texas mother of two, joined the state’s suit, arguing the Title X rule takes away her right as a parent to consent to her children’s medical care and use of contraception - though Texas facilities are already now required to notify parents of such care. Robles Frost also cites her Christian faith in the suit, saying she is teaching her two daughters to practice abstinence until marriage. Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent antiabortion attorney known for devising aggressive legal strategies to crack down on abortion in Texas, is representing Robles Frost. Texas entities receive approximately $18 million annually in Title X funding, according to HHS. Statewide, Title X administrator Every Body Texas serves more than 180,000 clients, many of whom are low-income, people of color or members of the LGBTQ+ community. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning. The March decision from the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling from federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has been shaped by his antiabortion beliefs. Kacsmaryk’s ruling found that the policy denied a parent “a fundamental right to control and direct the upbringing of his minor children.” The appeals court, however, left in place the rule that prohibits Title X providers from telling parents about their children’s use of contraceptives because HHS implemented it in 2021, after the original lawsuit was brought in 2020. It required providers in Texas to notify parents, but it did not strike down the HHS rule more broadly. Paxton’s latest lawsuit seeks to clarify that ruling. Kacsmaryk - a former general counsel for a conservative religious group who is the sole federal judge in the Amarillo division and was appointed by Donald Trump - will more than likely hear this case, too. Last year, he delivered on the hopes of the antiabortion world last year when he blocked U.S. government approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. (The U.S. Supreme Court allowed access to the drug in June.) Summers worries he could provide a favorable ruling to Paxton and antiabortion advocates once again. If Kacsmaryk does, she expects appeals to be filed in a case that could make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.","summary":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the Biden administration over a policy that allows adolescents to access birth control without their parents’ consent, arguing that the rule violates state law requiring guardians to consent to their children’s use of contraceptives.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-07-27/texas-sues-biden-administration-teen-birth-control-14622622.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/1brog-texas-contraceptives_cxkk7zdls3hvligk7as7wp2dci.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Texas-Contraceptives_CXKK7ZDLS3HVLIGK7AS7WP2DCI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:42:37","author":"Dan Rosenzweig,Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff","authors":["Dan Rosenzweig","Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":252783426,"title":"Usha Vance told friends Trump appalled her. Now she’s working to elect him.","text":"During her rise through America’s most prestigious schools, law firms and judicial clerkships, Usha Vance rarely - if ever - volunteered her opinions on the nation’s bitterly partisan politics to friends and colleagues. But she did express revulsion at former president Donald Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021. Vance told friends she was outraged by Trump’s incitement of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol and lamented the social breakdown that fueled his political support, according to one friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. Her view at the time contrasts with the later pronouncements of her husband and Trump’s newly minted running mate, JD Vance, who has downplayed the storming of the Capitol and called participants who were jailed “political prisoners.” “Usha found the incursion on the Capitol and Trump’s role in it to be deeply disturbing,” the friend recalled. “She was generally appalled by Trump, from the moment of his first election.” Speaking the morning after Usha Vance introduced her husband at the Republican National Convention and watched his speech from the same VIP box as Trump, the friend added, “It was surreal to see her sitting next to him last night.” That sensation is widely shared among her friends, former co-workers and fellow alumni, more than two dozen of whom spoke to The Washington Post for this story. Some watched in disbelief on July 17 when Usha Vance, 38, addressed an overwhelmingly White crowd on the convention floor that tittered uneasily as she joked about her husband learning to cook Indian food and audibly gasped when she mentioned her vegetarian diet. A spokesperson for JD Vance declined to comment for this story or to say whether Usha Vance voted for Trump in 2020 and 2016. The spokesperson did not dispute the friend’s description of Usha’s opinions about Trump and Jan. 6. When the riot occurred, Usha Vance was working as a lawyer and her husband was several months away from launching his Senate campaign. Jai Chabria, a Republican strategist for JD Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign and a family friend, said Usha’s views of the former president have changed, mirroring the evolution of her husband, once a fierce Trump critic. “Usha has had a similar shift in views and fully supports Donald Trump and her husband and will do whatever she can to ensure their victory this November,” Chabria said in a statement provided by the Vance spokesperson. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not comment for this story. In many ways, Usha Chilukuri Vance - born to prosperous Indian Hindu immigrants, raised in Southern California and employed, until she quit last week, at a San Francisco law firm known for its self-consciously progressive office culture - appears to represent the sort of cultural and economic elite whom Republicans often rail against. A self-described “Order Muppet” remembered for her circumspect manner and almost fanatically detailed scheduling habits, she is very different, temperamentally, from the freewheeling former president and his incendiary MAGA movement. Though she worked for prominent conservative judges and voted in the 2022 Republican primary in Ohio when her husband was on the ballot, she has registered to vote as a Democrat at least twice, records show: as a teenager in San Diego in 2004 and as a law student in New Haven, Conn., in 2010. In the fall of 2014 she registered to vote in D.C. without a party affiliation, according to elections officials. But the forces that propelled her to the convention have long been evident, those who know her say: extraordinary ambition and deep devotion to her husband. That ambition was contagious. JD Vance has long credited his wife as a catalyst in the evolution that led him from a troubled childhood in an Ohio steel town to the summits of finance, media and politics, calling her his “spirit guide” through the ruthlessly competitive landscape that awaited him at Yale. Her motivations and influence are key to understanding the vice-presidential nominee, who has said he “really benefits from having a sort of powerful female voice” guiding his decisions. “She unequivocally increased his odds of success,” said Dan Driscoll, a friend who attended Yale Law School with the couple. In JD’s early years with Usha, Driscoll said, “if you had … said, ‘You’re going to end up on your school board and go to your kid’s Little League games and own a small manufacturing business that employs people in your community,’ I think he would have defined that as success.” Instead, picked at age 39 to be Trump’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket, JD Vance has been anointed as the heir apparent to the leader of a movement that has transformed American politics. Vance, who greeted a raucously cheering crowd on the convention stage with an earsplitting grin, is clearly reveling in his new heights of success. That success is also drawing new scrutiny to his much more private wife, the potential second lady, Usha Vance. The ambitions of ‘Judusha’ Vance’s parents immigrated to the United States from southern India, settling in San Diego in the 1980s. Her father came from a family of prominent academics, a relative told the Indian Express, saying of Usha: “I always knew that she would excel academically and in any profession she chooses. You see, it runs in the family. Her great grandfather, her grandfather, her father - are all toppers. She follows in their footsteps.” Her father is an engineer and her mother a microbiologist. Both are academics: Vance’s mother is a provost at the University of California at San Diego, and her father lectures at San Diego State University. “I did grow up in a religious household, my parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that make them really very good people,” she said in a recent Fox News interview. Vance attended public high school; graduated in 2007 from Yale College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa; and embarked on a prestigious teaching fellowship in China. She taught English and American studies at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, according to a Yale announcement that described her as having “devoted much of her time at Yale to public education, volunteering in local elementary schools and as a Girl Scouts troop leader.” Peter Hamilton, another Yale graduate who participated in the program, recalled his surprise when he walked into Vance’s bedroom and saw the walls were covered in hundreds of color-coded Post-it notes that organized her week into 15- or 30-minute intervals. “It was kind of intense,” said Hamilton, now an assistant professor in world history at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “It really stuck with me. … I always thought of Usha as quite serious and highly intelligent, in a well-plotted-out kind of way.” Vance ended her two-year fellowship in China after only one year, according to Hamilton, enrolling in Cambridge University and earning a master’s degree for her research on “the methods used for protecting printing rights in seventeenth-century England,” according to the esteemed Gates Cambridge scholarship program. Next up: Yale Law School, where she impressed classmates by the sharpness of her intellect but left many guessing about her core political convictions. She did not join any ideological groups such as the conservative Federalist Society or liberal American Constitution Society, according to her LinkedIn page and former law firm’s biography. “People respected her intelligence,” said Doug Lieb, who was editor in chief of the Yale Law Journal while Usha worked on the review’s managing board. “She was not the sort of person who was trying to provoke controversy. I think she has a technical brain. If she thought you were technically wrong about something, she would point that out.” Like Hamilton, Lieb still vividly recalls her organizational methods. “Her notes were always, like, tabbed and highlighted and very meticulous and categorized,” said Lieb, who is now a civil rights attorney in New York and attended the Vances’ wedding. Vance appeared to poke fun at her own tendencies in a 2012 Facebook post, sharing a link to an article in the online magazine Slate - “What kind of Muppet are you, chaos or order?” - and writing, “I don’t think there’s any doubt that I am an Order Muppet.” (Screenshots of Vance’s Facebook page, which is not publicly accessible, were shared with The Post.) In an environment teeming with overachievers, Vance stood out not only for her “seemingly superhuman capacity to achieve” but as “a kind, unassuming friend who had no trouble bridging seemingly disparate social groups,” said James Eimers, a law school classmate who now works at a consulting firm that advises applicants to college and graduate school. JD and Usha met and started dating in their first year at Yale Law School. They earned the moniker “Judusha,” a melding of their names that came to imply “awe and reverence that they were intimidating as a power couple,” said Josh McLaurin, JD’s former roommate, now a Democratic state senator from Georgia who has been outspoken in his criticism of the vice-presidential nominee’s politics. The legacy of Yale Law’s most famous power couple - Hillary and Bill Clinton - still loomed over the campus, with many students bent on mimicking what one graduate called the “Clinton template”: several years spent burnishing elite credentials before returning to a (preferably Southern or Midwestern) home state to launch a political career. It was a path some predicted the Vances might follow, and one that Usha seemed to invoke with admiration in a Facebook post in August 2012, the summer before their final year in law school. “Driving through Arkansas, listening to Bill Clinton tell us about his life. Best road trip ever,” she wrote. The post was written near Chester, a tiny town in northwestern Arkansas. She tagged a companion who accompanied her: JD Vance. From San Francisco to Cincinnati Usha and JD married in Kentucky in 2014 - and were separately blessed in a Hindu ceremony. Around the same time, she embarked on a series of highly competitive clerkships for Republican-appointed judges, including U.S. District Judge Amul Thapar in Eastern Kentucky, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. of the Supreme Court. Records from the D.C. Board of Elections show that in 2015, while clerking for Kavanaugh, Vance switched her voter registration from no party to Democratic. But on Friday, the elections office told The Post that the switch to a Democratic affiliation had been a clerical error. Between and after her stints clerking, she was a litigator at Munger, Tolles & Olson, which has represented corporate behemoths such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the Walt Disney Co. The San Francisco law firm’s workplace culture makes it “a top contender in the cool, woke category” of large legal offices, according to a January 2019 article in the American Lawyer. On its website the firm touts its “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee” and its welcoming attitude toward “intersex, transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people.” When Vance began working at Munger Tolles, her husband was still years away from lashing out against “woke DEI” corporations and “far-left gender ideology.” With the 2016 publication of his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” he instead emerged as a thoughtful, center-right commentator on the White working class with one foot in Middletown, Ohio, and the other in Silicon Valley, where he worked with conservative venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Vance supported her husband as he expressed this iteration of his politics, sometimes sharing links on Facebook to his commentary in publications such as the Atlantic, where in 2016 he likened Trump to “cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it.” In her post about that article, Vance noted her husband’s “firm stand against Trump.” The Vances have raised their three children, born between 2017 and 2021, in deep-blue enclaves. In 2018 they bought a $1.4 million home in the East Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, and when in the D.C. area, they live in a $1.6 million house in Del Ray, a sought-after neighborhood in Alexandria, Va. In July 2021, JD Vance announced that he was running for the Senate in Ohio. His victories in the Republican primary and general election were widely credited to Trump’s endorsement and Thiel’s financial backing. Usha was not a fixture on the campaign trail, although she did star in an ad, calling him “an incredible father” and “my best friend.” “She doesn’t crave the political spotlight, but she was very much a part of the campaign,” said Chabria, the GOP strategist who worked on the 2022 race. Vance voted in her husband’s Republican primary that year, records show. (Ohio voters do not register by party, and can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary contests.) During the same election cycle, she donated to Blake Masters, a far-right Republican - funded, like her husband, by Thiel - who lost a Senate race in Arizona. After moving to Ohio, Usha Vance joined the board of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. During her husband’s brief tenure in the Senate, she continued to work as a litigator, resigning from Munger, Tolles & Olson on the day JD Vance was announced as Trump’s vice-presidential pick. Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval, a Democrat and the first Indian American to lead the predominantly Democratic city of just over 300,000, said he has never run into JD or Usha Vance at any social functions or community events. “I’ve never met her,” Pureval said, adding that while he strongly opposes the Republican ticket, “I wish her only the best.” A new spotlight Last week, Usha Vance moved from relative obscurity into the spotlight at a packed convention hall in Milwaukee. Ohio state Sen. Niraj Antani, an Indian American Republican and Hindu, said he was thrilled to see her onstage. “Having an Indian American potentially as the second lady is inspiring to so many,” he said. “I’ve received countless calls, texts and emails from our community wanting to meet and support JD and Usha.” Other Trump supporters were less enthused. An outpouring of racist bile directed against Usha Vance from the far right has erupted online. Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and antisemite who visited the former president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022, questioned the wisdom of having JD Vance on the ticket, asking, “What kind of values does a man have to marry somebody that far outside your race, who isn’t even a Christian?” Her appearance also generated confusion, for very different reasons, on the other side of the political spectrum. Some friends and colleagues said they have struggled to reconcile their affection for Usha Vance with the hard-right turn of her husband’s politics. Among other things, JD Vance has denigrated those crossing the border illegally from Mexico, pushed legislation that would criminalize gender transition procedures for minors, and said he would have acquiesced to Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election - as then-Vice President Mike Pence did not - by certifying fraudulent slates of electors. “Am I surprised to see Usha speaking onstage at a major political convention? No. She’s brilliant,” said Chad Callaghan, a Los Angeles-based writer and marketing director who said he was friendly with her in college. “Am I surprised to see her there to support a man who seems to be building political power by punching down at trans folks and immigrants? Yeah, that part caught me off guard.” In her speech introducing JD, which lasted less than five minutes, Usha Vance herself offered no clues to how she was processing the moment. At a convention suffused with fervor for its presidential nominee, she did not once mention Trump. But she did acknowledge in passing what so many who know her said they felt as they watched her onstage: amazement. “It’s safe to say that neither JD nor I expected to find ourselves in this position,” she said. “But it’s hard to imagine a more powerful example of the American Dream. A boy from Middletown, Ohio -” At that point Vance was forced to take a lengthy pause, looking from side to side as her voice was drowned out by raucous cries from the crowd. They were chanting her husband’s name.

Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said she “directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates” but declined to elaborate on the search. Harris is expected to make a selection by Aug. 7, in order to align with the party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by that date. Picking a vice presidential candidate will cement the Democratic standard-bearers to take on Republican nominee Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance in the November election. Harris’ sidekick can serve as a force multiplier who can campaign and raise money on her behalf, while ideally complimenting her strengths and covering any vulnerabilities. Most on Harris’ list are White, male politicians with centrist leanings who could help Harris appeal to swing-state voters, as well as business leaders and donors. They have a track record of attacking Trump and his firebrand style of politics. Walz has gained momentum with progressives, enough to vault himself into consideration, according to people familiar with the matter. Allies of Harris say chemistry between the vice president and whoever she picks is just as important as their political attributes. Harris knows firsthand the pressures of being No. 2 on the Democratic ticket and is weighing her experience as she makes a selection, according to her supporters. Harris’ ascension to become the likely Democratic nominee, after President Joe Biden’s stunning exit from the race, has accelerated what is typically a months-long vetting process of potential running mates. The pick will take place amid a furious effort by Harris to shape the Biden campaign operation in her image, define herself to voters and expand her war chest — all with roughly 100 days until Election Day. Democrats cautioned that the search must still be thorough in order to catch any red-flags. Those warnings took on new urgency as old clips emerged of Vance making disparaging comments about childless women, which have come under widespread criticism. “As the Trump team is finding out, it’s not just the legal vetting that the team has to do, but it also has to go through tweets, speeches and clips,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “You want a thorough vet, and you want to go through a substantial volume of background info to give you a picture of the person.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the vetting process. Holder’s law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, has 12 to 15 files on candidates, according to one person familiar with the process, showing Harris initially cast a wide net. Shapiro is a popular governor of arguably the most important swing state, and a skilled orator who has performed strongly in rural areas, a weakness for Democrats. Walz, a former teacher and Army National Guard member, could dash Trump’s hopes of making Minnesota competitive and mirror Vance’s Midwestern appeal. Kelly’s state doubles as a battleground and border area and he has broken with Biden on immigration issues. His wife, Gabrielle Giffords, is a former congresswoman who became a gun-control activist after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011. Harris is also looking at the Biden Cabinet for options. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are being vetted, the people said. A Harris campaign official said she is evaluating potential picks based on shared political values, including on the economy and democracy, and their ability to act as a governing partner and lead the country, if necessary. The switch from Biden to Harris has energized Democrats, who have gathered tens of thousands on organizing calls and given millions of dollars in donations since the president dropped out. The challenge for Harris is to sustain that momentum for their pick. Harris’ surrogates are fanning out to battlegrounds, including some possible running mates. This weekend, Shapiro and Walz are campaigning in their home states. Buttigieg is embarking on a tour of three ports that will take him to battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin. Those said to be under consideration by Harris have publicly said little about the selection process — though few have denied having interest in the job. Reporters at a Monday event on environmental grants peppered Shapiro with questions on about whether he would be picked, prompting him to respond, “are we not talking about concrete anymore?” Kelly told reporters Thursday outside the US Capitol that the selection process is not about him, “but I’ve always, always when I’ve had the chance to serve, I think that’s very important to do.” Democrats in Washington are playing a parlor game about whom they think would be best at Harris’ side. “I know the conventional wisdom is that she needs to pick a White man. I don’t disagree that having that kind of gender balance is good, but if you wanted to swing for the fences, you could do a Harris-Whitmer ticket that would excite a lot of people,” said former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said, referring to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has said she wouldn’t accept if asked. Daschle added that Kelly and Shapiro would also “provide a fantastic contrast” with Vance. By late in the week, the halls of Congress were buzzing with excitement over who Harris would select. Senator Laphonza Butler, a close Harris ally, called Kelly smart and said he got into public service “for all the right reasons.” Harris’ choice, she said, “is going to come down to what is her relationship, what kind of familiarity and loyalty she feels with whoever she picks.”","summary":"Harris is expected to make a selection by Aug. 7, in order to align with the party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by that date. ","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-short-list-running-mates-mark-kelly-josh-shapiro-tim-walz/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163690934-e1722114886584.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:24:56","author":"Bloomberg,Jenny Leonard,Josh Wingrove,Nancy Cook","authors":["Bloomberg","Jenny Leonard","Josh Wingrove","Nancy Cook"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.027},{"id":252780342,"title":"Insider insight: Pete Buttigieg shares what Kamala Harris is truly like in private, and the campaign strategy she needs to adjust compared to Biden","text":"Transportation Secretary and VP hopeful, Pete Buttigieg, said the public is yet to learn the full extent of Kamala Harris’ humor and tenacity – traits he said she has shown much more of in private. Buttigieg, 42, told The New York Times in a wide-ranging sit-down interview, ‘I think people do know this, but she is not just impressive, she’s smart and funny.’ ‘I actually think what’s interesting, not just TV, but the internet has picked up on the fact that she has this great sense of humor. And it’s also revealing that the GOP has tried to attack her for it, and that’s fallen flat.’ And while he at first avoided a question about how the current vice president should differentiate herself from Biden, Buttigieg stressed that Harris should ‘explain how she’s contributed to the work that brought inflation back down to three percent in this country.’ He added the Democratic nominee must highlight the ‘difference between her economic proposals and the clearly inflationary proposals of Donald Trump.’ ‘I’d like to see her reach those concerns that Americans have,’ he said. Bernie Sanders issued a similar statement earlier this week, telling the Boston Globe: ‘[Harris] needs to have an agenda that speaks to the crisis facing working families all over this country. ‘I think the Democrats are going to have to be very, very clear as to what ideas they have in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality.’ In his latest interview, Buttigieg recalled a time he really got to see Harris ‘in action’ instead of her usually funny self when he had to mock debate her while playing the role of a Mike Pence – an experience he called ‘a very strange psychological thing.’ ‘So often you hear: “Oh, this person’s really funny and loose,” but it doesn’t come through on TV,’ he said. ‘I think she’s a very convincing leader.’ However, Buttigieg still defended President Joe Biden, despite his disastrous and concerning debate performance earlier in June, saying he’s ‘really good at being president and in my view still is.’ As for why he thinks the Democratic party hasn’t put more effort into finding new nominee options – such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, who were early names thrown into the ring after Biden quit his campaign – Buttigieg said it was easiest to look toward Harris. ‘I think a lot of people looked at her, looked at what she brought, looked at the importance of quickly bringing the party together and reached that conclusion that backing her was the best way to do that,’ he told The Times. He also thinks the Trump fever will die down – and called Vance’s ‘childless cat lady’ comments and the former president labeling Harris a ‘thug’ a ‘bad look for Republicans.’ ‘The fact that they can’t think of what else to do besides go right to race and gender isn’t just revealing about some of the ugliest undercurrents in today’s Republican Party, it’s also just profoundly unimaginative, because it means that they can’t speak to how any of this is going to make people’s lives better. ‘In other words, they can’t conceive of a politics that isn’t just about the personalities.’ Meanwhile, Harris has pulled ahead of Trump in a new national poll taken two days after Biden endorsed her. The Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percent in a head-to-head general election matchup as she hits the campaign in place of the ailing 81-year-old Biden. Buttigieg also spoke with HBO’s Bill Maher last week about the attempted assassination of Trump and the role Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who has since stepped down, played. ‘I believe that President Biden and the administration will do the right thing,’ he said, prior to Cheatle stepping down as the nation called for her resignation. In his interview with The Times, Buttigieg also commented on Harris’ campaign strategy of diverting from the previous Democratic straight-laced attacks on Trump that he’s bad for democracy and leaning into calling him ‘weird.’ ‘I think we’re doing both,’ he said. ‘We’re talking about the implications for democracy and noting that he is obviously a strange person who’s getting stranger, and you’ve got to ask yourself, is that the kind of person you want in charge of the country?’ As for whether or not Buttigieg will be on Harris’ VP ticket – or even if he wants it – he remained mum. ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to talk like that knowing that the person who needs to make that decision is the person who’s going to make it, and that’s her. Not me,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTransportation Secretary and VP hopeful, Pete Buttigieg, said the public is yet&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Insider insight: Pete Buttigieg shares what Kamala Harris is truly like in private, and the campaign strategy she needs to adjust compared to Biden first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/insider-insight-pete-buttigieg-shares-what-kamala-harris-is-truly-like-in-private-and-the-campaign-strategy-she-needs-to-adjust-compared-to-biden/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/27/20/87846511-13679485-Buttigieg_42_sat_down_with_The_New_York_Times_to_discuss_his_fel-a-5_1722109604078.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:21:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":252780088,"title":"US election: I’ll end World War Three – Trump","text":"The United States Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to end World War Three if elected president.

TikTok's suit in a Washington federal court argues that the law violates First Amendment rights of free speech. The U.S. response counters that the law addresses national security concerns, not speech, and that TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance is not able to claim First Amendment rights here. The filing details concerns that ByteDance could, and would, comply with Chinese government demands for data about U.S. users or yield to pressure to censor or promote content on the platform, senior justice department officials said in a briefing. \"The goal of this law is to ensure that young people, old people and everyone in between is able to use the platform in a safe manner,\" a senior justice department official said. \"And to use it in a way confident that their data is not ultimately going back to the Chinese government and what they're watching is not being directed by or censored by the Chinese government.\" The response argues that the law's focus on foreign ownership of TikTok takes it out of the realm of the First Amendment. U.S. intelligence agencies are concerned that China can \"weaponize\" mobile apps, justice department officials said. \"It's clear that the Chinese government has for years been pursuing large, structured datasets of Americans through all sorts of manner, including malicious cyber activity; including efforts to buy that data from data brokers and others, and including efforts to build sophisticated AI models that can utilize that data,\" a senior justice department official said. TikTok has said the demanded divestiture is \"simply not possible\" -- and not on the timeline required. The bill signed by President Joe Biden early this year set a mid-January 2025 deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a U.S. ban. The White House can extend the deadline by 90 days. \"For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than one billion people worldwide,\" said the suit by TikTok and ByteDance. ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok, leaving the lawsuit, which will likely go to the U.S. Supreme Court, as its only option to avoid a ban. \"There is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025,\" the lawsuit said, \"silencing (those) who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere.\" TikTok first found itself in the crosshairs of former President Donald Trump's administration, which tried unsuccessfully to ban it. That effort got bogged down in the courts when a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's attempt, saying the reasons for banning the app were likely overstated and that free speech rights were in jeopardy. The new effort signed by Biden was designed to overcome the same legal headaches, and some experts believe the U.S. Supreme Court could be open to allowing national security considerations to outweigh free speech protection. \"We view the statute as a game changer from the arguments that were in play back in 2020,\" a senior justice department official said. There are serious doubts that any buyer could emerge to purchase TikTok even if ByteDance would agree to the request. Big tech's usual suspects, such as Facebook parent Meta or YouTube's Google, will likely be barred from snapping up TikTok over antitrust concerns, and others could not afford one of the world's most successful apps used by about 170 million people in the United States alone. © 2024 AFP","summary":"The Justice Department late Friday filed its response to TikTok's civil suit aimed at derailing a law that would force the app to be sold or face a…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/business/us-defends-law-forcing-sale-of-tiktok-app","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/af/0d/08e41e57d54221174429465184f2ea9a73f7/af0d08e41e57d54221174429465184f2ea9a73f7/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:16:26","author":"Glenn Chapman,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Glenn Chapman","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":252779882,"title":"Hungary’s nationalist leader warns of EU's demise and backs Trump in anti-Western speech","text":"Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on Saturday that the European Union was sliding toward oblivion in a rambling anti-Western speech in which he warned of a new, Asia-oriented “world order” while throwing his support for Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential bid. “Europe has given up defending its own interests,” Orbán said in Baile Tusnad, a majority-ethnic Hungarian town in central Romania. “All Europe is doing today is following the U.S.’s pro-Democrat foreign policy unconditionally … even at the cost of self-destruction.” “A change is coming that has not been seen for 500 years. What we are facing is in fact a world order change,\" he added, citing China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia as becoming the “dominant center” of the world. Orbán also alleged that the U.S. was behind the 2022 explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines built to carry gas from Russia to Germany, calling it “an act of terrorism carried out at the obvious direction of the Americans.” He didn't offer any evidence to back up the claim. The far-right leader’s remarks come amid growing criticism from his European partners after he embarked on rogue “peace mission” trips to Moscow and Beijing earlier this month aimed at brokering an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Orbán is widely considered to have the warmest relations with the Kremlin among all EU leaders. On Ukraine, Orbán cast doubt on the war-torn country becoming either a member of NATO or the EU. “We Europeans do not have the money for it. Ukraine will revert to the position of a buffer state,” he said, adding that international security guarantees “will be enshrined in an agreement between the US and Russia.” Throughout Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, Orbán has broken with other EU leaders by refusing to provide Kyiv with weapons to defend against Russian forces and has routinely delayed, watered down, or blocked efforts to send financial aid to Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow. Orbán typically uses the annual Tusvanyos Summer University platform in Romania to indicate the ideological direction of his national government and to deride the standards of the EU bloc, which Hungary joined in 2004. Hungary currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, during which Orbán has made a Trumpian vow to “Make Europe Great Again” and has openly endorsed Trump’s candidacy in this year’s U.S. presidential election. Orbán visited Trump twice this year at the former president’s beachside compound in Mar-a-Lago. Orbán said Saturday that Trump’s bid for re-election aims “to pull the American people back from a post-nationalist liberal state to a nation-state” and rehashed a slew of conservative tropes that Trump is being penalized unfairly to prevent his electoral bid. “That is why they want to put him in prison. That’s why they want to take away his assets. And if that doesn’t work, that’s why they want to kill him,” Orbán said, referring to an assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally this month. U.S. ambassador to Hungary, David Pressman, responded to Orbán's comments on Saturday in a post on the social media platform X, saying that such rhetoric “risks changing Hungary’s relationship with America.” “We have no other ally or partner … that similarly, overtly, and tirelessly campaigns for a specific candidate in an election in the United States of America, seemingly convinced that no matter, it only helps Hungary — or at least helps him personally,” Pressman said, and went on to accuse Orbán of peddling “Kremlin conspiracy theories about the United States. Hardly what we expect from an Ally.” Orbán’s remarks on Saturday aren’t the first time he’s used the festival in Transylvania to stir controversy. In 2014, Orban declared for the first time his intentions to build an “illiberal state” in Hungary, and in 2022, he sparked international outrage after he railed against Europe becoming a “mixed race” society. He doubled down on his long-held anti-immigration stance on Saturday, saying it is not an answer to his country's aging population. “There can be no question of a shrinking population supplemented by migration,” he said in his Saturday address. “The Western experience is that if there are more guests than owners, then home is no longer home. This is a risk that should not be taken.” The EU’s longest-serving leader, Orbán has become an icon to some conservative populists for his firm opposition to immigration and LGBTQ+ rights. He has also cracked down on the press and judiciary in Hungary and has been accused by the EU of violating rule-of-law and democracy standards. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
