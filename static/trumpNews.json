Gaetz has denied the allegations but resigned from his congressional seat last month after being nominated for attorney general by President-elect Donald Trump. He later withdrew from consideration following strong opposition and a challenging confirmation process in the Senate.The US House Ethics Committee, the report said, has concluded Matt Gaetz violated multiple House Rules and ethical standards during his time in office. According to a 37-page report released on December 23, as per the report, the Committee found substantial evidence of Gaetz’s involvement in prohibited activities, including prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, and accepting impermissible gifts.Former Congressman Matt Gaetz reportedly filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday, seeking to block the release of a report by the US House Ethics Committee that found he violated multiple House Rules and ethical standards during his time in office. Gaetz, who resigned from Congress in December 2024, reportedly argued that he is now a private citizen and, as such, should not be subject to the committee’s jurisdiction.The US House Ethics Committee’s upcoming report, expected to be released soon, outlines serious allegations against former Congressman Matt Gaetz. According to the news report, the committee found that Gaetz paid over $90,000 to 12 women, with the payments believed to be linked to sexual activity and drug use.The report also includes testimony about Gaetz’s involvement with a 17-year-old girl, referred to as \"Victim A,\" during a 2017 party. The Ethics panel reports that Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Gaetz, which she understood to be payment for sex. She also testified that she did not inform Gaetz of her age, and Gaetz did not inquire about it.According to CBS News, the Ethics panel found insufficient evidence to suggest that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws.The report includes testimony from several women who described sexual encounters with Gaetz, all of which were reportedly consensual. However, one woman shared concerns about the use of drugs at events and parties attended with Gaetz, indicating that the drugs may have impaired her ability to fully consent. Another woman expressed regret, stating, “When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.”According to the news report, it is found that Gaetz breached House rules and standards of conduct that explicitly prohibit prostitution, statutory rape, and drug use. The committee determined there was \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in illicit drug use, which further compounded the allegations surrounding him. In addition, the report accused Gaetz of accepting gifts, including luxury travel that exceeded permissible limits, highlighting a 2018 trip to The Bahamas as an example of such violations.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-house-ethics-committee-finds-matt-gaetz-guilty-of-sexual-misconduct-and-drug-offenses-11734960962647.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/23/1600x900/Florida-Special-Elections-1_1734961610888_1734961636372.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 01:12:24","author":null},{"id":275677114,"title":"Matt Gaetz Ethics Report: What's Next for Former Lawmaker","text":"What's NewThe future of former Congressman Matt Gaetz is unclear after the House Ethics Committee released a report alleging that the Florida Republican committed a host of ethical and potentially criminal infractions including statutory rapeThe report was released on Monday and revealed that the committee found \"substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"Why It MattersGaetz resigned from Congress immediately after being nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as U.S. attorney general last month.While the release of the report was temporarily blocked by Gaetz's resignation, the allegations prompted doubts about his ability to be confirmed to Trump's Cabinet by the U.S. Senate. He ultimately withdrew from consideration one week after being nominated.What To KnowWhile the former congressman could be facing potential criminal and civil liabilities tied to the allegations, Gaetz remains a popular figure among MAGA Republicans and at 42- years-old could also still have a long political career ahead of him.Gaetz said during a Turning Point USA event in Arizona on Sunday that he could be a candidate in the 2026 Florida gubernatorial election, become a special counsel and \"go after\" his former House colleagues or run for the soon-to-be-vacant Florida U.S. Senate seat of Marco Rubio, Trump's nominee for U.S. secretary of state.\"My friend Steve Bannon and others have suggested that I return to the House of Representatives on January 3rd,\" Gaetz added. \"But I would remind Steve, when he got out of prison, he didn't punch a guard on the way out.

That’s good news for the American people.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had insisted lawmakers would “meet our obligations” and not allow federal operations to close. But the outcome at the end of a tumultuous week was uncertain after Trump had insisted the deal include an increase in the government's borrowing limit. If not, he had said, then let the closures “start now.”\n\nJohnson's revised plan was approved 366-34, and it was passed by the Senate by a 85-11 vote after midnight. By then, the White House said it had ceased shutdown preparations.\n\n“There will be no government shutdown,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nJohnson, who had spoken to Trump after the House vote, said the compromise was \"a good outcome for the country” and that the president-elect “was certainly happy about this outcome, as well.”\n\nThe final product was the third attempt from Johnson, the beleaguered speaker, to achieve one of the basic requirements of the federal government — keeping it open. The difficulties raised questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job, in the face of angry Republican colleagues, and work alongside Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk , who was calling the legislative plays from afar.\n\nThe House is scheduled to elect the next speaker on Jan. 3, 2025, when the new Congress convenes. Republicans will have an exceedingly narrow majority, 220-215, leaving Johnson little margin for error as he tries to win the speaker's gavel.\n\nOne House Republican, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, criticized Republicans for the deficit spending in the bill and said he was now “undecided” about the GOP leadership. Others are signaling unhappiness with Johnson as well.\n\nYet Trump's last-minute debt limit demand was almost an impossible ask, and Johnson had almost no choice but to work around that pressure. The speaker knew there wouldn’t be enough support within the slim Republican majority alone to pass any funding package because many Republican deficit hawks prefer to cut the federal government and would not allow more debt.\n\nInstead, the Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, with big plans for tax cuts and other priorities, are showing they must routinely rely on Democrats for the votes needed to keep up with the routine operations of governing.\n\nThe federal debt stands at roughly $36 trillion, and the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government’s borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security. The last time lawmakers raised the debt limit was June 2023. Rather than raise the limit by a dollar amount, lawmakers suspended the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nThere is no need to raise that limit right now because the Treasury Department can begin using what it calls “extraordinary measures” to ensure that America does not default on its debts. Some estimate these accounting maneuvers could push the default deadline to the summer of 2025. But that’s what Trump wanted to avoid because an increase would be needed while he was president.\n\nGOP leaders said the debt ceiling would be debated as part of tax and border packages in the new year. Republicans made a so-called handshake agreement to raise the debt limit at that time while also cutting $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 years.\n\nIt was essentially the same deal that flopped Thursday night — minus Trump’s debt demand. But it's far smaller than the original deal Johnson struck with Democratic and Republican leaders — a 1,500-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected, forcing him to start over. It was stuffed with a long list of other bills — including much-derided pay raises for lawmakers — but also other measures with broad bipartisan support that now have a tougher path to becoming law.\n\nTrump, who has not yet been sworn into office, is showing the power but also the limits of his sway with Congress, as he intervenes and orchestrates affairs from Mar-a-Lago alongside Musk , who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency.

Getting a marriage license, checking on your taxes — couldn't do it,\" Pitts said, adding that it felt like they were being \"held hostage.\"Ransomware criminals are in the extortion business — they hack an organization's network, lock up the data, and demand a ransom for the keys. Last year, ransomware hackers walked away with a record $1 billion, and according to cybersecurity company Coveware, the number of organizations that pay has fallen from over 80% to only about 30%.When the ransomware attack hit Fulton County, the stakes couldn't have been higher. Five months earlier, former President Donald Trump and 18 others had been charged there in connection with allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election.

Four months later, the feds indicted the group's alleged ringleader, Dmitry Khorshev, who they say went by the name \"LockbitSupp\" online.CBS News scoured hacker chat rooms online until \"LockbitSupp\" finally answered. He seemed concerned about the FBI and said they had the wrong guy. He claimed to be \"apolitical\" and bragged he is a wolf who \"eats the weakest.\"\"He is a formidable adversary, right?\" Vorndran said. \"But we have really good people in the FBI as well, and that's how we've been able to get close to him.\"LockBit ratcheted up its threats in Fulton County for weeks.\"Deadline number one came and passed.

However, we also need to ensure those actions are practical and grounded in reality rather than just up in the air like the wind.'\n\n'2025 promises rapid change and fiery energy, offering opportunities to embrace new ideas and connections. Take bold, yet grounded steps toward progress. Practice being practical and focus on achieving tangible results. It's usually easier to have ideas and talk about them. However, the proof is in the pudding!'\n\nShe added that it is important when balance passion with practicality when faced with these challenges. And to avoid rushing into unprepared ventures.\n\nSome people will se beautiful new beginning in their love lives\n\n'Keep your feet on the ground while embracing the transformative power of the cosmos.'\n\nMs Smith runs the largest psychic network in the southern hemisphere, Absolute Soul Secrets, and has made many key predictions in times gone by.\n\nIn 2020 she predicted Donald Trump would get coronavirus, and Joe Biden would win the US election.\n\nMs Smith also predicted back in 2018 that when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married, they would have two children within a few short years.\n\nShe says her predictions may happen at any time, from the time of writing in December 2024 through to 2026 or perhaps even later.\n\n'My visions can be either metaphorical or literal. From the beginning of 2025, all the social and transpersonal planets are in fire and air signs, this is very significant for the weather and the general political climate,' said Ms Smith.\n\n'In June 2025, Jupiter moves into Cancer (a water sign) until June 30th, 2026. This could give us all some kind of small reprieve. Then it moves into fire. 2025 is a precursor for 2026.'\n\nRose Smith reveals her psychic predictions for 2025\n\nWeather events\n\nThe weather as a whole is going to be like 2024… there will be a lot of flooding, although saying that there will be terrifically hot days for many places in Australia, including Sydney.\n\nI see fires and a tall tower burning in the Sydney area. A massive bushfire starts in rugged mountainous terrain, the eucalyptus trees are exploding. It's very difficult for the authorities to deal with, so they decide to do nothing. Many fires are started by lightning storms, more so than usual.\n\nThe sea levels at Circular Quay could also rise – which could relate to the economy.\n\nThis may mean either Sydney or for Australia generally. It probably means the Australian economy will be underwater in 2025 or 2026, although not necessarily a recession.\n\nThe economy is not doing well. Much of it is beyond the government control, being caused by global macroeconomic factors.\n\nThere could be some major weather events in the Philippines, with storms and typhoons increase in frequency and severity.\n\nEven places that are rarely affected are copping the brunt of unseasonal or intense typhoons. Telecommunications are severely affected.\n\nRoyal Family\n\nI see frailty around King Charles and believe his health will decline further, with inflammation around him getting worse.\n\nI see 'diminishment' around King Charles when it comes to his power, which is made worse by the stressful relationships he has with his sons, particularly Harry.\n\nI also see steps with a boardwalk, these are easy steps for Prince Harry to take in order to achieve and do more.\n\nWhile 2024 was another turbulent year for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the energy around Harry heightens his importance on the world stage in 2025.\n\nThe media love to hate Meghan – she is a Leo, with a Libra moon, and in the couple's home life she is actually the compromiser, she smooths everything over.\n\nIf Harry is angry, Meghan will calm him down. She is good for him.\n\nHarry will become a leader on the world stage as he matures. \n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese\n\nI see a 'baby' or 'children' around Mr Albanese. (A baby can also mean a 'rebirth' or a lifechanging event of some kind). I have for the last two years.\n\nIt is the same baby – indicating both he and partner Jodie Haydon (his 'backbone') are very happy.\n\nThis 'baby' may just be around in spirit, but it's a very happy and celebratory time for them both, it is possible to block spirit children from entering… that's called contraception.\n\nThis vision could also relate to Australian politicians turning into a bit of a rabble or engaging in childlike behaviour instead of showing true leadership.\n\nDonald Trump and US Politics:\n\nI believe US President elect Donald Trump won't see out his full term.\n\nHis policies cause storms at sea. This is connected to the US economy and the economies of many countries including Australia, although I do see him backtracking on some but not all his proposed policies.\n\nOne symbolic definition is that the US population is going through some kind of economic storm which flows out globally.\n\nIn the US there's initially much optimism for the change to Trump's policies until the cracks start to show.\n\nI see cracks in the foot paths. City councils either can't afford to fix them or are very slow to do so. This could be actual or metaphorical.\n\nThe stock market initially rises when Trump takes office but then the 'crab claws' start. This means that many people are feeling the pinch.\n\nDespite Donald Trump's elections promises, I believe negotiations for peace with Russia fail.\n\nThe current war with Russia will worsen initially but eventually Ukraine will be free once more. The war could end in the second half of 2025 or in 2026.\n\nRussia will eventually break up into several countries, although not in 2025.\n\nDespite the announcement of BRICS currency system and Russia's major role, the economy will decline, and the value of the Russian Ruble will continue to fall.\n\nLife is getting tough there for people who are worried it's becoming 'like the old days'\n\nI hear the word 'Üranian' around tech billionaire Elon Musk, meaning he has strong but volatile energy with electricity, lightning, technology, rebelliousness and revolution.\n\nHis current relationship with Shivon Zilis will last longer than the others. I hear the words 'she is happy with him, and he is happy with her.\n\nHe respects her intelligence and treats her better than his previous partners. Also, I hear the words 'onion rings' but I can't definitely identify what this means. Perhaps, he is working through layers of self-doubt and an inferiority complex? I also see him walking barefoot on sand.\n\nThe thing about sand is that it shifts with the wind and the tide. However, because Musk is in direct contact with the elements, he can adapt very quickly. This vision also means Musk is down to earth and practical. I also see a library of books; I think Musk might be a voracious reader?\n\nI see Elton John dragged off stage at some point in 2025.\n\nSomebody has grabbed him from behind and he is helpless to stop them. He doesn't want to go.\n\nI've written the words 'no glitter', meaning this is not fun. I doubt this is a literal prediction, sadly I think it's a metaphor for Elton's slow decline and subsequent ill health.\n\nJupiterElton John\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWhat 2025 looks like for YOUR star sign: Astrologers warn of extreme weather, turbulent moods and money woes - but some will be in for a great time\n\nAdd comment","summary":"2025 is set to be the hardest year in recent times for many - with huge struggles forecast by astrologers.

We don't necessarily follow or look for those remarks and our team right now is focused on modernizing the treaty...as soon as we can.\"\n\nB.C. energy minister Adrian Dix, who was also in virtual attendance, concurred.\n\n\"I think what we have to do, and what we have to continue to do, is do the work of defending Canadian interests, Columbia Basin interests, British Columbia interests, and not be distracted in that work by the political discussions of the time,\" Dix said.\n\nThe info session also included representation from Columbia Basin MLAs, the Province of B.C. as well as Indigenous representatives from the Syilx Okanagan and Ktunaxa Nations.\n\nOriginally ratified in 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was a water management agreement between the two countries that focused on downstream flood control management and power generation. \n\nThe treaty facilitated the creation of three dams in B.C. — Mica, Duncan and Keenleyside — as well the Libby dam in Montana.\n\nHowever, when it was drafted, it was essentially done without any input from Indigenous Nations, as the resulting reservoirs flooded out Indigenous territory, affecting cultural, heritage and ecological values.\n\nAmong the key elements of a modernized treaty is a focus on ecosystem function and re-framing the agreement to treating the Columbia River as a one-river system that flows over traditional Indigenous territory and a number of federal and state jurisdictions.\n\nThat effort has been led by Indigenous governments in both countries. \n\nThe Secwépemc, Syilx Okanagan and Ktunaxa Nations were invited to participate as official observers with the Canadian delegation in 2018, and led the focus on ecosystem function along with U.S.-based Indigenous governments.\n\nDuring the info session, Jay Johnson, the lead negotiator for the Syilx Okanagan Nation, reflected on the significance of Indigenous participation in the treaty modernization efforts.\n\n\"This is a pretty profoundly important journey that we are on right now in that never in the history of the contemporary world have Indigenous communities had a voice directly at the table in international bilateral negotiations,\" Johnson said, \"and both governments had the foresight and the understanding to include the three Nations and the Untied States to include the U.S. tribes in helping to shape and form and participate in the negotiations and that's a pretty important step in the journey of reconciliation.\"\n\nMajor elements of the new AIP include increased domestic flexibility for the Canadian treaty dams, particularly for ecosystem and Indigenous values. Additionally, a new flood-risk management regime replaces the existing one, as the U.S. will now pay Canada $37.6 million (USD) indexed to inflation until 2044. Canada will receive an additional $16.6 million (USD) in recognition of other benefits that the U.S. receives due to Canada's operations of the three treaty dams.\n\nThe Canadian Entitlement is the share of the power benefit by coordinating flows in the three Canadian reservoirs for incremental power generation above and beyond what's already generated in the U.S. However, for every million-acre feet that is used for Canadian flexibility, the Entitlement will be reduced by 6.5 per cent, as there is no corresponding power benefit to the U.S.\n\nOther elements of the modernized AIP include an Indigenous and Tribal advisory body, salmon reintroduction and ensuring flows for salmon and a transboundary Kootenay/Kootenai working group.\n\nBefore the treaty is finalized, it must pass approvals processes federally in both Canada and the U.S., as well as in British Columbia.\n\nWith files from Lauren Collins","url":"https://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com/news/columbia-river-treaty-talks-continue-amid-incoming-trump-presidency-7726372","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/arrowlakes/import/2018-06/12455237_web1_treatpic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:49:24","author":"Trevor Crawley","authors":["Trevor Crawley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.227},{"id":275674926,"title":"Bank of Canada watching economy closely after half-point rate cut","text":"The Bank of Canada’s governing council expects its second straight outsized interest rate cut helped it turn a corner in its fight to tame inflation, but it is watching the economy closely amid weaker than expected growth. \n\nThe central bank’s summary of deliberations released Monday offers a glimpse into the council’s discussions in the lead up to the Dec. 11 rate cut, which lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point.\n\nMembers considered only cutting by a quarter-point, but ultimately brought the rate down to 3.25 per cent in a bid to bring it closer to its so called neutral rate, where it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic growth.\n\nThey noted that lower immigration targets are likely to weigh on economic growth next year and that tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump are a “major new source of uncertainty.”\n\nCouncil members also said they’d be considering further rate cuts, but would be taking a more gradual approach given the five consecutive cuts since June, and giving the economy time to respond to them.\n\nThe next rate decision and quarterly economic forecast are scheduled for Jan. 29.","url":"https://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com/national-news/bank-of-canada-watching-economy-closely-after-half-point-rate-cut-7727258","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241223131244-20241223131216-dfb097799665930c2f59c2c0609a29ecb2daa3b3c3d42cdb9f88fb1804bb4ac2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:49:24","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":275674648,"title":"'The Houthis cannot be deterred': The militia that defies the US and challenges the world","text":"In one of the most dangerous incidents for U.S. forces in the Middle East since the onset of the war in Gaza, a U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea by an American warship over the weekend. The incident coincided with U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Both pilots safely ejected and were rescued, while the Houthi rebels quickly claimed responsibility for the downing. However, the Pentagon has not clarified whether the friendly fire was directly linked to the ongoing combat against the Iranian-backed group. The episode underscores the broader challenge posed by Iranian proxies, not only to Israel but also to the United States and the international community. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Houthis have launched what they describe as a campaign of \"support for Gaza.\" This campaign has included barrages of missiles and swarms of drones targeting Israel—some of which caused casualties—and strikes on civilian vessels in the Red Sea, effectively crippling one of the world’s critical trade routes. One civilian ship was even seized. The Houthi attacks place the Biden administration in a difficult position, as they coincide with U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Yemen’s civil war and the Saudi-Houthi conflict. That war, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians in Saudi airstrikes, failed to defeat the Iranian-aligned militia. President Joe Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations upon entering office, and a UN-brokered cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia was reached in 2022. Over the past year, the U.S. has avoided direct, large-scale attacks on Houthi targets, seeking to preserve diplomatic efforts and prevent broader escalation in the region. Still, Washington formed an international coalition to conduct limited strikes aimed at deterring Houthi activity in the Red Sea. Israel, meanwhile, has expressed frustration over what it perceives as insufficient U.S. actions against the militia. Israel largely refrained from responding to Houthi attacks for months but launched its first strike in July, followed by additional attacks in September and last week. These strikes targeted strategic sites such as energy facilities and ports. Yet the Houthis vowed to continue their missile and drone campaigns. Earlier Monday, the IDF intercepted a drone launched from Yemen—following two failed interceptions of ballistic missiles last week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israelis to “remain patient and steadfast” and hinted at a coordinated international effort against the Houthis, possibly involving expanded U.S. operations. “We will act with strength, determination and ingenuity,” Netanyahu said Monday. “Even if it takes time, the result will be the same as with other terrorist arms.” He promised that Israel’s recent strike in Yemen “will not be the last.” As tensions remain high, the possibility of intensified U.S. and allied action could grow, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump set to re-enter the White House next month. However, the U.S.-led coalition’s ability to deter the Houthis has come into question as they had shown resilience against years of relentless Saudi airstrikes, often disregarding the severe suffering of Yemeni civilians. Two-thirds of Yemen’s population lives under Houthi control. A report Monday in The Wall Street Journal highlighted growing concerns in Washington and among international allies over the Houthis’ acquisition of advanced missile and drone technologies from Iran. Western sources have also alleged Russian involvement, pointing to intelligence about Western ships in the Red Sea supplying the Houthis. According to a U.S. defense official cited in the report, the coalition has destroyed 450 Houthi-launched drones. Despite these efforts, the Houthis' technological capabilities continue to pose significant challenges, exemplified by last week’s failure of Israel’s missile defense systems to intercept two ballistic missiles. One struck a school in Ramat Efal, while the other hit a playground in Tel Aviv. As noted by Ynet military analyst Rob Ben-Yishai, experts who spoke to The Journal believe that the Houthis on Saturday fired a derivative of an Iranian-made ballistic missile with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle, designed to evade defense systems. “The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,” a United Nations report said in November. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv William LaPlante, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, warned last month that the Houthis “are getting scary” and that he was \"just shocked” at technologies they now have access to. The rapid evolution of the Houthis’ capabilities has alarmed analysts. “In 2004, they were a besieged group hiding in the mountains,” said Mohammed Albasha, a U.S.-based Middle East security analyst for Basha Report. “Now, they’re chasing U.S. carriers with drones and missiles and striking 2,000 kilometers away in central Israel.” This transformation, analysts say, could intensify if Iran increases its support for the Houthis as it faces setbacks in Lebanon and Syria. Even if the U.S. escalates its operations, experts question whether the Houthis can be deterred. Osamah Al Rawhani, a director for the Yemen-based Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank, told The Wall Street Journal: “The Houthis don’t care what they lose as Yemenis. They want to win as a militia and take on global powers.” Dr. Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), echoed the sentiment. The Houthis “don’t have a lot to lose” and “They cannot be deterred.” Trump has not yet outlined specific plans to address the Houthi threat. However, during his election campaign, Trump subtly criticized the Biden administration’s military actions in the region, writing in August in a post on X that \" Bombs are dropping all over the place\" in the Middle East. Given his hardline stance on Iran, analysts anticipate a tougher U.S. policy on the Houthis under his leadership. Mike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security advisor, signaled this shift during a podcast interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, promising to re-designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). “They remain an outstanding issue,” Waltz said. “I guarantee what you’re going to see very soon is a redesignation of them for what they are — a terrorist organization.” President Biden removed the Houthis from the FTO list shortly after taking office, citing humanitarian concerns and the need to facilitate aid deliveries to Yemen’s civilians amid a dire humanitarian crisis. The FTO designation, first implemented by Trump in the waning days of his first term, carried severe sanctions, including penalties for any entities providing material support to the group. In January 2023, following renewed Houthi attacks, Biden placed them on the less severe Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) list, which imposes sanctions but lacks the sweeping restrictions of FTO classification. Critics have argued that the SDGT label does not do enough to curb the group’s aggression. Ben-Yishai predicted that Trump would lift the operational constraints Biden placed on U.S. forces in Yemen, potentially paving the way for a coordinated U.S.-Israel campaign to neutralize the Houthi threat. Such a strategy could involve targeting the Houthis’ leadership and degrading their ballistic missiles, drones, launch systems and production facilities—actions that Ben-Yishai said would mirror successful Israeli operations against Hezbollah’s strategic assets in Lebanon and the Assad regime’s capabilities in Syria. Israel would likely require significant cooperation from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region with aircraft carriers, missile destroyers and other assets. The geographic distance and intelligence challenges make unilateral Israeli action improbable. Ben-Yishai argued that a coordinated effort could prevent the Houthis from further destabilizing global order and the economy. He noted that while the Houthis are undeterred by strikes on their state infrastructure, leadership decapitation and precision attacks on their military capabilities could shift the balance.

The visit comes amid a surge of antisemitic incidents in Australia. Murdoch, who heads the global media conglomerate News Corp, which operates hundreds of media outlets across at least 50 countries, attended the event with his wife, Elena, and other family members. News Corp’s influential outlets, including those in the U.S., UK and Australia, employ hundreds of thousands worldwide. Rabbi Levi Wolff, leader of the synagogue and a Chabad emissary, explained that the synagogue hosted Rupert Murdoch to honor his efforts in supporting Israel and the Jewish community during an especially challenging period. He highlighted Murdoch’s decision to allow his media networks worldwide to freely support Israel during a period of intense global scrutiny, which Rabbi Wolff described as having \"a dramatic impact while Israel faced media attacks from all directions.\" Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE | Apple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv In a brief statement after receiving the honor, Murdoch said, “Israel, in the last four years, has been alone on the front line of Western democratic civilization, leading the charge.” With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, he expressed hope for a shift in U.S. policy, saying, \"I just pray that starting in another month, America gets back beside them,” in a veiled critique of the Biden administration. Rabbi Wolff emphasized the significance of Murdoch’s global influence. \"His support has a critical international impact. We wanted to thank him on behalf of our community and the Jewish people at large,\" he said, adding that Murdoch’s backing of Israel is rooted in his belief in justice, not personal ties to Jewish friends.

Jaishankar is travelling to the U.S. to meet with officials in the outgoing Biden administration, as well as the Trump administration team. \n\nMr. Jaishankar, who will be in the U.S. from December 24-29, will join Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who is already in Washington for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC).\n\nIn a statement about Mr. Jaishankar’s previously-unannounced visit on Monday (December 23, 2024), the Ministry of External Affairs gave no specific details of which U.S. officials he would meet during the week.\n\n“Mr. Jaishankar] will be meeting counterparts to discuss key bilateral, regional and global issues,” the MEA statement said, adding that during the visit, the External Affairs Minister would chair a conference of the Consul Generals of India in the USA.\r\n\nSources confirmed to The Hindu, that the Biden administration is also keen to schedule one last meeting of the NSA-level Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) before demitting office, and are working on a possible visit by US NSA Jake Sullivan to Delhi in early January. Among projects that the two sides are working on as a part of iCET, that was launched first in February 2023, is transfer of technology (ToT) negotiations, including the GE-F414 Jet engines deal that was agreed to during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in June 2023. The two sides have also discussed cooperation in biotechnology, space cooperation, quantum technologies Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors, most recently when Mr. Sullivan travelled to Delhi to meet with the government just after elections in June this year.\r\n\nIndia and the U.S. have been in close consultation over the conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, Syria and the recent change in government in Bangladesh.\n\nMr. Jaishankar and Mr. Misri are also expected to engage with members of the Trump transition team, as well as some of the top nominees for the State Department and Department of Defence about high-level meetings soon after the Trump inauguration on January 20th, as well as an early date for Mr. Trump to travel to India for the Quad Summit to be hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi next year. The visit by Mr. Jaishankar mirrors a similar visit he undertook in November 2016 as the then-Foreign Secretary, to meet with the Trump transition team. Mr. Modi had travelled to Washington within a few months of Mr. Trump’s first tenure in 2017, and officials didn’t rule out him making another visit to the US in 2025 itself.\r\n\nHowever, there was no clarity about whether Mr. Trump would invite Mr. Modi to his inaugural ceremony, although Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt had confirmed earlier this month that invitations had been sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders as “an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just [US] allies but adversaries and competitors too.”\r\n\nWhen asked about whether Mr. Modi had received an invitation, the MEA spokesperson had said that they had “no updates to share”. “As and when we have something of relevance, some update on it, we surely will bring it to your attention,” spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on December 13.\r\n\nThis is also Mr. Jaishankar’s first visit to the US since the announcement of the DoJ and Securities and Exchange Commission indictments on Gautam Adani and key Adani group officials. While both governments have brushed off the impact of the case, as well as the indictments against an Indian government official in the Pannun alleged assassination case, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had on December 5 alleged that the US State Department was orchestrating a number of “attacks” against Mr. Adani and others in order to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The US Embassy had said it was “disappointed” by the BJP’s statement.\r\n\n“I think all we can really say is that this is a regulatory and law enforcement issue that’s best left to the agencies directly involved to speak to, and wouldn’t be appropriate for us to comment from either the White House or the State Department,” a senior US official said last week, when asked if the indictments had affected the U.S.-India relationship which the official said was “in a very strong position”.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/external-affairs-minister-jaishankar-to-visit-united-states-from-december-24/article69018962.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/yc6h3s/article69018982.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI12_22_2024_000024B.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:39:24","author":"Suhasini Haidar","authors":["Suhasini Haidar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":275673664,"title":"India’s ‘steel frame’ does need a check - Premium","text":"India’s governance challenges demand urgent reforms to modernise its bureaucracy. The country’s economic story, which is marked by significant strides in growth and innovation, is juxtaposed with enduring issues of income inequality, underinvestment in critical sectors, and bureaucratic inefficiency. Central to this narrative is the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), which has for long held sway over the nation’s governance. However, persistent challenges within the IAS and the wider bureaucracy have highlighted the urgent need for administrative reforms to unlock India’s true economic potential.\r\n\nThe legacy and challenges of the IAS\r\n\nThe IAS, often called India’s “steel frame”, traces its origins to the colonial Indian Civil Service (ICS). Post-Independence, it became the backbone of India’s administrative machinery, with officers occupying pivotal roles in governance. Yet, this legacy has not been without its cracks. Political interference, lack of specialisation, and outdated personnel practices have gradually eroded its effectiveness.\r\n\nOne of the pressing issues is the politicisation of the IAS. Frequent transfers, suspensions, and promotions influenced by political loyalty rather than merit, have undermined morale and professionalism. Officers often struggle to develop domain expertise due to frequent rotations across departments, preventing them from becoming effective policy specialists in an increasingly complex governance landscape.\r\n\nCorruption and inefficiency plague the bureaucracy further. According to the World Bank’s measure of government effectiveness, India ranks only moderately, reflecting the poor quality of policy implementation and administrative independence. Without reform, these systemic inefficiencies threaten to stymie India’s economic growth and governance objectives.\r\n\nExecutive-led governance in India, characterised by centralised decision-making, has yielded mixed results. While it has facilitated rapid economic reforms and infrastructure development, it has also led to bottlenecks in policy implementation and a lack of accountability. The centralised power structure often sidelines bureaucrats’ insights and expertise, reducing their ability to act as effective policy executors.\r\n\nUnder Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, the government has attempted to address some of these shortcomings by curbing politicised transfers and introducing measures to enhance bureaucratic accountability. However, critics argue that centralising power in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) risks undermining the autonomy of senior bureaucrats, leading to further disempowerment of the IAS.\r\n\nThe need for administrative reforms in India is not new. Since Independence, over 50 commissions and committees have been tasked with reimagining the country’s administrative apparatus. The First Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) in 1966 and subsequent commissions, have consistently emphasised the need for specialisation, accountability, and merit-based promotions within the bureaucracy.\r\n\nThe Second ARC, set up in 2005, laid out a blueprint for administrative reforms. It included recommendations for lowering the permissible age of entry into the civil services, introducing performance-based promotions and lateral entry, and establishing safeguards against arbitrary transfers. However, many of these recommendations remain unimplemented, stalled by bureaucratic inertia and political resistance.\r\n\nGovernment’s push for reform\r\n\nRecognising the limitations of the IAS-centric administrative model, the Modi government has sought to diversify governance by introducing lateral entry into senior bureaucratic positions. This move is aimed at bringing domain experts from the private sector and other government services into key policymaking roles, infusing fresh perspectives and specialised knowledge.\r\n\nSince 2018, the central government has pursued lateral recruitment to bring individuals with specialised knowledge and domain expertise into specific assignments. By 2023, this initiative saw the appointment of 57 officers, many of whom were drawn from the private sector, reflecting a deliberate effort to infuse fresh talent and perspectives into governance. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) recently advertised 45 posts for lateral entry, including positions for Joint Secretaries and Directors across various ministries. This shift has disrupted the IAS’s traditional dominance, with only 33% of Joint Secretaries at the Centre now belonging to the IAS, compared to near-total dominance a decade ago.\r\n\nHowever, the lateral entry initiative has faced resistance. Critics, including retired civil servants, argue that it could undermine incumbent morale and distort promotion incentives. Opposition parties have also voiced concern about the lack of reservation provisions for marginalised groups in these appointments. The Modi government’s recent U-turn on lateral entry appointments, reportedly due to political pressure from political allies, underscores the contentious nature of this reform.\r\n\nThe U.S.’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, offers an intriguing model for reforming India’s administrative apparatus. DOGE aims to streamline government operations, reduce inefficiency, and eliminate redundant agencies, all while leveraging the expertise of leaders such as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\r\n\nDOGE’s focus on cutting wasteful expenditures and introducing accountability mechanisms resonates with the challenges faced by the Indian bureaucracy. A similar advisory body in India could help identify inefficiencies within the civil service, promote data-driven decision-making, and develop metrics to assess bureaucratic performance. A time-bound commission, such as the DOGE’s expiration date tied to the U.S. semi-quincentennial, could also ensure that reform initiatives remain focused and actionable.\r\n\nChallenges to reform\r\n\nReforming India’s bureaucracy is no small task. Despite its flaws, the IAS remains deeply entrenched in the country’s governance structure. Proposals for lateral entry, performance-based promotions, and specialised training often face resistance from within the service, where seniority-based progression and generalist approaches are deeply institutionalised. Political interference further complicates reform efforts. Proposals such as the Civil Services Standards, Performance, and Accountability Bill (2010), which sought to protect bureaucrats from arbitrary transfers, have languished in legislative limbo. Even judicial interventions, such as the Supreme Court of India’s directive to establish civil services boards in 2013, have had limited impact due to lack of enforcement.\r\n\nA multifaceted approach to administrative reform is vital to address the challenges of India’s bureaucracy. Recruitment must prioritise merit and domain expertise, with promotions tied to measurable performance rather than seniority. Protecting bureaucrats from politically motivated transfers and fostering specialisation in policymaking roles would enhance accountability and efficiency. Further, the government should invest in a robust data infrastructure to track bureaucratic performance, enabling informed decisions on placements, promotions, and policy implementation. Reform is essential for India’s economic aspirations and ensuring governance effectively serves its people.\r\n\nVinod Bhanu is the Director of the Centre for Legislative Research and Advocacy, New Delhi","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/indias-steel-frame-does-need-a-check/article69020104.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/m42ygk/article69020095.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/India_Iconic_Ambassador_71073.jpg-6147d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:39:24","author":"Vinod Bhanu","authors":["Vinod Bhanu"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.137},{"id":275673660,"title":"The GATT-ification of the World Trade Organization - Premium","text":"The Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO), which serves as a multilateral trade referee, is set to miss yet another crucial target of revitalising “a full and well-functioning dispute settlement system” by the end of 2024. It has been five years since the Appellate Body (AB), the second tier of the WTO’s two-tier dispute settlement system, has been non-operational due to the persistent blocking, by the United States, of the appointment of the Appellate Body members.\n\nThis obstruction began during Barack Obama’s administration, escalated under Donald Trump’s first presidency, and has continued under President Joe Biden, reflecting a bipartisan political consensus in the U.S. The U.S.’s hostile stance towards the Appellate Body will intensify further under what is anticipated to be a highly protectionist Trump 2.0 administration. While the WTO panels, the first stage of dispute settlement, continue to operate and render decisions resolving trade disputes between WTO member countries, this is of little significance because the losing country uses its legal prerogative to appeal to a non-operational AB, and thus stall the adjudicatory process. However, it is a fool’s errand to put the Appellate Body back on track because the real issue is the WTO’s existential crisis and its quest to be a relevant player in global trade. The larger game is not about killing the Appellate Body but, rather, making the WTO dysfunctional.\r\n\nThe promise\r\n\nTo understand the future, it is important to first reflect on the past. The establishment of the WTO in 1995 marked a milestone in international law. The rise of neoliberal ideology in the 1990s played a critical role in this development. The WTO established a comprehensive system of rules governing trade in goods, services, and intellectual property, along with a binding two-tier dispute settlement system featuring an appellate function, compulsory jurisdiction, and effective retaliation for non-compliance. The WTO’s promise of international rule of law was so compelling that it could not be matched even by the International Court of Justice. Scholars in international law began to regard the WTO as a constitutionalism project that would ensure the triumph of international law over international politics.\r\n\nAs the international trading community witnessed the transition from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) era that held sway from 1948 to 1994 to the WTO, it marked a shift from diplomacy-based trade multilateralism to a rule-based system. Celso Lafer, a former Chairman of the WTO’s dispute settlement body, described the creation of the WTO as the “thickening of legality” in international trade relations. Put differently, countries were willing to accept several restrictions on their state conduct and subject themselves to the binding jurisdiction of the WTO’s dispute settlement system including the Appellate Body.\r\n\nThe unravelling\r\n\nHowever, things began to unravel as the global landscape changed due to China’s significant rise over the last two decades. The U.S. facilitated China’s accession to the WTO in 2001, hoping this would lead Beijing to dismantle its state-led industrial policies which were detrimental to international trade, and adopt free-market principles. However, this expectation did not materialise. There is a widespread belief in the U.S. that China exploited the WTO system to its advantage. The WTO and its institutional controls hinder the U.S. from dealing decisively with China. As a result, the U.S. aims, in the words of international lawyer Daniel C.K. Chow, to “wreck” the WTO system, including the Appellate Body, which would provide it with a free hand to address the perceived Chinese threat. The U.S. can now employ trade remedial measures and develop industrial policies to counter the Chinese challenge, even if these actions violate WTO law, as there is no one to call it out. A classic example of this is the Trump administration’s decision in 2018 to impose a 25% tariff on Chinese products across various sectors. Mr. Trump’s promise to impose further tariffs during his second term, which could trigger another round of trade war, indicates that international politics, rather than international law, will dictate international trade.\r\n\nRegime change\r\n\nThis has led international lawyers such as Geraldo Vidigal to argue that there is no longer a crisis in the WTO but a regime change. As against the thickening of the legality of international trade relations that we saw from a period of 1995 to 2019, we are witnessing its thinning. In other words, while there is no complete de-legalisation of international trade relations, countries are reclaiming significant control that was previously ceded to the WTO in managing their state conduct. The legal revolution of international trade multilateralism that began in 1995 has not only been paused but is being reversed, moving us back to the era of GATT diplomacy. Understanding this “GATTification” of the WTO, as Prof. Vidigal puts it, is crucial for grasping the current state of the international trading order. No amount of technical negotiations in Geneva can obscure this fact.\r\n\nPrabhash Ranjan is Professor and Director, Centre for International Investment and Trade Laws, Jindal Global Law School.

We are taking actions to bring them back. I wish to say cautiously that there has been some progress, and we will not stop acting until we bring them all home,\" Netanyahu said in parliament, on the same day he took the stand again at his ongoing corruption trial.\n\n\"I want to say to the families of the hostages: We are thinking of you and we will not give up on your loved ones, who are our loved ones as well.\"\n\nHostage families have questioned the sincerity of government negotiation efforts, and critics have long accused Netanyahu of stalling in truce talks, prolonging the war partly to appease his far-right coalition partners.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said progress had been made.\n\n\"The possibility of reaching an agreement (for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal) is closer than ever, provided the enemy stops imposing new conditions,\" the groups said after they held talks in Cairo.\n\nDuring the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, 251 people were abducted, of whom 96 remain hostages in Gaza, including 34 declared dead by the military.\n\n'Full force' \n\nNegotiations have faced multiple challenges since a one-week truce in November 2023, with the primary point of contention being the establishment of a lasting ceasefire. \n\nAnother unresolved issue is the territory's post-war governance.\n\nHamas's armed wing said the fate of some of the hostages depends on how Israeli forces carry out their offensive.\n\n\"If the occupation army advances even a few hundred metres more in some areas where they are already on the ground, it will decide the fate of some of the enemy's hostages,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Netanyahu said: \"I'm not going to agree to end the war before we remove Hamas.\" He added Israel is \"not going to leave them in power in Gaza, 30 miles from Tel Aviv. It's not going to happen.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on October 23 that Israel had \"managed to dismantle Hamas's military capacity\" and eliminated its senior leadership. With those successes, he said, it was time to \"get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow.\"\n\nIsrael's military on Monday said three soldiers were killed in northern Gaza, the focus for weeks of an offensive Israel said aimed to prevent Hamas from regrouping there.\n\nIn parliament, Netanyahu also warned the Iran-backed Huthi rebels of Yemen, who last week fired two missiles at Israel, including one that injured 16 people in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv on Saturday.\n\n\"I have instructed our forces to destroy the infrastructure of Huthis because anyone who tries to harm us will be struck with full force. We will continue to crush the forces of evil with strength and ingenuity, even if it takes time,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIsraeli warplanes retaliated against ports and energy infrastructure, which the military said contributed to Huthi rebel operations, after a rebel missile badly damaged an Israeli school last week. The Huthis said the Israeli strikes killed nine people.\n\n-'Seize this opportunity' \n\nOn Saturday, the United States struck targets in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa, hours after the Huthis hit Tel Aviv with a missile.\n\nAmerican and British forces have repeatedly struck rebel targets in Yemen this year in response to Huthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea-area waters vital to global trade.\n\nNetanyahu also stated that he wanted to sign new peace accords with Arab countries, similar to the \"Abraham Accords\" negotiated in 2020 under Donald Trump's first United States administration.

They also found that Gaetz “knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct” the committee's work. \n\n“The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,” the report states. \n\nAhead of the report’s release Gaetz denied any wrongdoing and criticized the committee's process.\n\n“Giving funds to someone you are dating — that they didn’t ask for — and that isn’t ‘charged’ for sex is now prostitution?!?” he posted on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. “There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.”\n\nGaetz, a Republican first elected in 2017, spent the majority of his time in Washington enmeshed in scandals that ultimately derailed his nomination by President-elect Donald Trump as attorney general. His political future is uncertain, although Gaetz has indicated he would be interested in running for the open Senate seat in Florida. \n\nLawmakers paint a damning portrait of Gaetz's conduct, using dozens of pages of exhibits, including text messages and financial records, travel receipts, checks and online payments, to document a party- and drug-fueled lifestyle. The committee said it compiled the evidence after issuing 29 subpoenas for documents and testimony and contacting more than two dozen witnesses.\n\nIn addition to soliciting prostitution, the Ethics Committee report states that Gaetz “accepted gifts, including transportation and lodging in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, in excess of permissible amounts.” \n\nThat same year, investigators say Gaetz arranged for his chief of staff to obtain a passport for a woman he was sexually involved with, falsely telling the State Department that she was his constituent. \n\nIn some of the text exchanges, Gaetz appears to be inviting various women to events, getaways or parties, and arranging airplane travel and lodging. At one point he asks one woman if she has a “cute black dress” to wear. There are also discussions of shipping goods.\n\nOne of the exhibits is a text exchange that appears to be between two of the women concerned about their cash flow and payments. In another, a person asks Gaetz for help to pay an educational expense.\n\nAt least one Republican joined all five Democrats on the Ethics Committee earlier this month in voting to release the report about their former colleague despite initial opposition from GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to publishing findings about a former member of Congress.\n\nWhile ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare.\n\nMounting a last-ditch effort to halt the publication of the report, Gaetz filed a lawsuit Monday asking a court to intervene, citing what he called “untruthful and defamatory information” that would “significantly damage” his “standing and reputation in the community.” Gaetz’s complaint argues he’s no longer under the committee’s jurisdiction since he resigned from Congress.\n\n“The Committee’s position that it may nonetheless publish potentially defamatory findings about a private citizen over whom it claims no jurisdiction represents an unprecedented expansion of Congressional power that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,” Gaetz’s lawyers wrote in their request for a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe often secretive, bipartisan panel has investigated claims against Gaetz since 2021. But its work became more urgent last month when Trump picked him shortly after Election Day as his first choice to be the nation's top law enforcement officer. Gaetz resigned from Congress that same day, putting him outside the purview of the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction. \n\nBut Democrats had pressed to make the report public even after Gaetz was no longer a member and had withdrawn as Trump’s pick to lead the Justice Department. A vote on the House floor this month to force the report’s release failed; all but one Republican voted against it.\n\nThe committee detailed its start-and-stop investigation over the past several years, which was halted for a time as the Justice Department conducted its own probe of Gaetz. Federal prosecutors never brought a case against him. \n\nLawmakers said they asked the Justice Department for information about its probe, but the agency refused to hand over information, saying it doesn’t disclose information about investigations that don’t result in charges. \n\nThe committee then subpoenaed the Justice Department for records, but after a back-and-forth between Justice Department officials and the committee, the department only handed over “publicly reported information about the testimony of a deceased individual,” according to the report.\n\n“To date, DOJ has provided no meaningful evidence or information to the Committee or cited any lawful basis for its responses,” the committee said.\n\nIn releasing the report, the panel added that Gaetz was also “uncooperative\" throughout the probe. He provided “minimal documentation” in response to the committee’s requests, it said. “He also did not agree to a voluntary interview.”","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-house-ethics-committee-accuses-matt-gaetz-of-regularly-paying-for-sex-including-with-minor-girl/article69020560.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/jc3a9i/article69020594.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-12-23T180047Z_1709472815_RC2JI3AZBR0U_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-ETHICS-GAETZ.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:39:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.071},{"id":275673280,"title":"As CNN Continues to Whine About Elon Musk, Scott Jennings, Bill Hagerty Come Armed With Key Points","text":"Congress managed to avoid a government shutdown, but it wasn't before the House put out a particularly problematic bill, to the tune of a bill that was over 1,500 pages long. Elon Musk took to X to not only use his platform to speak out against the continuing resolution (CR), but to amplify others who did. It was a kind of influence liberals have not been able to handle. CNN has brought up such a narrative multiple times, and each time, as Townhall has been covering, Scott Jennings has been there to bring up some hard truths. This included on Sunday's episode of \"State of the Union.\"\n\nDuring the panel discussion, host Dana Bash brought up how Democrats have claimed that Musk is a \"co-president,\" or will really be the one to be president, rather than President-elect Donald Trump. As Bash asked Jennings, \"Is this going to wear thin with Donald Trump soon?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I mean, look, they appear to be getting along well. Musk was very instrumental in his victory,\" Jennings pointed out. He also made another key reminder about Democrats, adding, \"and I hear Democrats criticizing the idea that we have unelected people with too much influence over the government.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been a particular noteworthy offender of such a tactic, as she also rants and raves about Musk's supposed conflicts of interests. \n\n\"I invite them to pick up The Wall Street Journal from this week and find out that unelected people have been running the government for the last four years,\" Jennings also shared, something he's brought up before as well, ever since the report was published last Wednesday. The report confirmed what we knew all along, that President Joe Biden's mental faculties were rapidly declining, and White House aides were forced to adapt. \n\n\"I hear Democrats criticizing the influence of billionaires on our politics, when you have got this Soros punk running around collecting Democrat politicians like my kids collect Pokemon cards. So, I think all the criticism of Musk coming from the left is totally hypocritical, totally over the top. And he is doing something interesting, bringing some transparency to the federal government. It's not a terrible fact,\" Jennings continued to illustrate. \n\nJennings managed to put an amusing new spin on such arguments, not just to do with Pokemon cards, but also his reference to Alex Soros, who has indeed been photographed with Democratic politicians, including with Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) before the 2024 election. \n\nEven Karen Finney, who has memorably sparred with Jennings before, agreed with him this time, conceding during a back and forth with other panelists that \"Scott's right,\" acknowledging that \"those have been the talking points.\"\n\nMusk himself took notice of and shared the clip of such a panel discussion from his X account. \n\nActually, this is what an oligarchy looks like. https://t.co/gEScgjP5eT pic.twitter.com/OXqtjHAuOa— Bonchie (@bonchieredstate) December 22, 2024\n\nThis wasn't the only part of the program where Musk came up, though. Earlier, Bash spoke with Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) to ask about Musk's role. Hagerty had praised Musk's \"transparency\" in calling out what was in the bill.\n\n\"And Elon Musk, using the tool of Twitter, brought transparency to the entirety of it. The American public were shocked. We are always shocked when we see these types of monstrosities at the last minute that haven't been properly vetted,\" he aptly pointed out.\n\nBash decided to focus on such a point and bizarrely harp on how Musk posted at 4:15am on Wednesday morning that \"This bill should not pass,\" though Musk, as she herself acknowledged, posted several times beyond that about the bill. \n\nAs she brought up the timeline of when Trump himself spoke out and took issue with the bill, Bash asked Hagerty, \"did Donald Trump only pick this fight because Elon Musk backed him into a corner?\"\n\n\"I certainly wouldn't say that,\" Hagerty replied. \"And I say, thank God Elon Musk bought Twitter, because that's the only way we'd even know what's in this bill. Otherwise, the conspiracy between the government and Twitter would have continued, and this would have all been covered up,\" he argued. \"But the fact is that Elon Musk exposing this meant that every one of our offices was inundated with calls from our constituents. The American public wanted to see this change. Donald Trump was speaking on behalf of the American public.\"\n\nHagerty also reminded that Trump is not yet actually in office, though Biden \"is AWOL.\" Trump, however, still rose to the occasion while Biden wouldn't speak to the American people on the bill, a move that White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to during Friday's press briefing by going with her oft-used tactic of blaming Republicans. \"Donald Trump stepped up and said, look, this is what needs to happen. And I think all of my constituents were there--or the calls at least that I got in my office. Elon Musk's transparency helped make that happen,\" Hagerty continued. Jennings has also stressed it wasn't only just Musk and his posts over X. \"Well, I think, as a senator voting, I presume that you do your best to read the bills that you're voting on. I understand it was quite large at the beginning, but to say that it was only Elon Musk that made people aware of what was in it, that can't be true,\" Bash snootily claimed, downplaying the monstrosity of a CR. \"I'm not saying it was only Elon Musk. We were all struggling to read it, to digest an over-1,500-page bill that we were literally given just hours to comb through,\" Hagerty responded. \"I was working through it. My staff didn't sleep the night before. It's extraordinarily frustrating. But I think the added weight of the American public understanding and the simple picture that Elon Musk put forward showing the size of the stack of what we originally presented, we started out with over 1,500 pages. We got it down to 120 pages.\"\n\nBash also brought up how \"Democrats are mockingly suggesting that Elon Musk is the one calling the shots, questioning who the president-elect really is,\" with Hagerty offering that \"President Trump is clearly the leader. He's going to be the leader of the free world in 30 days. In fact, he's already the leader if you look at what's happening, people coming to see him in Mar-a- Lago, the changes that have taken place, the European Union saying maybe they're going to go ahead now and supplant Russian LNG with U.S. LNG, the U.K. stepping up its defense budget in advance of President Trump coming into office.\" He again brought up how Biden \"has gone AWOL.\"\n\nAs Bash asked if Hagerty was \"comfortable with Elon Musk's role,\" Hagerty made clear that \"media speculation, what the Democrats might say to try to get under people's skin doesn't bother me a bit.\" He also noted he's \"appreciative of the fact that President Trump has that type of talent available to advise him.\"\n\n“I think President Trump is clearly the leader.”@SenatorHagerty dismisses the suggestion by Democrats that Elon Musk, not Donald Trump, is calling the shots in the Republican Party. pic.twitter.com/B0fnKLTwve— State of the Union (@CNNSOTU) December 22, 2024","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/rebeccadowns/2024/12/23/scott-jennings-continues-to-speak-on-elon-musk-n2649491","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/354/ddb012c3-7f4f-468d-bee8-8d8a4298a572.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:36:24","author":"Rebecca Downs","authors":["Rebecca Downs"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":275673130,"title":"PJ Patterson calls Barbara Gayle’s murder ‘a wake-up call’ for Jamaica","text":"Latest News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nInternational\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nLatest News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nInternational\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nPJ Patterson \n\r\n Latest News, News \r\n\nDecember 23, 2024\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n PJ Patterson calls Barbara Gayle’s murder ‘a wake-up call’ for Jamaica \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nFormer Prime Minister PJ Patterson says last week’s brutal murder of veteran journalist Barbara Gayle is a “wake-up call” for Jamaica, noting that it underscores the urgent need for the nation to reexamine its values and “prioritise those that are life-sustaining”.\n\nGayle’s body was found at her Caymanas Country Club Estate home in St Catherine last Tuesday. She had been stabbed multiple times and had been bludgeoned. A man who was the main suspect in the killing was held two days later.\n\nREAD: Police collar main suspect in Barbara Gayle murder\n\nIn a release on Monday, Patterson remembered Gayle as “gentle, modest and conscientious” and noted that “as a legal scribe, she understood the essence of the evidence and complex points of law that eventually made her a reporter of the highest order.”\n\nJournalist Barbara Gayle at a recent Press Association of Jamaica (PAJ) Veteran’s Luncheon held at the Jamaica Pegasus hotel in St Andrew.\n\n“Her acumen for comprehensive legal reports was such that practitioners, including myself, could rely on the integrity and completeness of a Barbara Gayle story in the most intriguing and complicated trials,” the former prime minister said.\n\nHe added that as the country is engulfed in condemning the heinous crime of Gayle’s murder, “it also marks a time for sober reflection how to end such despicable crimes.”\n\nHe called for a “decisive change in the culture”, arguing that “anything less will be like recurring decimals which perpetuate our own individual vulnerability to criminal extinction.”\n\n“Anger and greed must give way to caring and tolerance at every level,” Patterson said, adding “The solution to the national dilemma has to begin with acknowledging the sacredness of life – the belief that one’s own life is of intrinsic value. That necessitates valuing and treating others with respect.”\n\nPatterson suggested that overemphasis on materialism is leading Jamaicans to a neglect of their social and moral fabric. \n\n“It is past time for Jamaica to reclaim its values and promote the attitudinal changes which emphasize the importance of respect for human life, empathy, civility and kindness,” Patterson said, noting that “The brutal murder of Barbara Gayle is a wake-up call for Jamaica to take action and promote a culture of love, compassion, and shared humanity.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nTags: Barbara Gayle murder PJ Patterson \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n SBAJ outraged over commercial banks’ refusal to align lending rates with BOJ reduction \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— The Small Business Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) has expressed outrage over commercial banks refusal to adjust their lending rates ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Pedestrian injured in Christiana collision \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica— A young woman has been hospitalised after she was reportedly pinned between a vehicle and a pole in Christiana, Manchester on Mon... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Decomposing body of doctor discovered in Westmoreland apartment \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica— The Westmoreland police division is investigating the murder of 57-year-old medical doctor Aung Naing whose decomposing body wa... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Haitians massacred for practicing voodoo were abducted, hacked to death: UN \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP)— A massacre of more than 200 people in Haiti this month followed a gang-ordered manhunt that saw victims, many of ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Accused killer of US insurance CEO pleads not guilty to ‘terrorist’ murder \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP)— The man accused of gunning down a health insurance executive in a brazen hit in New York that sparked fierce debate abo... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Forex: J$156.39 to one US dollar \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The US dollar on Monday, December 23, 2024 ended trading at $156.39 down by 44 cents according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily exch... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)— A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department regularly paid for lurid sex ses... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nHOUSE RULES\r\n\n\r\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

He had stents implanted in his coronary artery six years later.\n\nThe health scare motivated him to make lifestyle changes, including adopting a vegetarian diet, and he has since spoken publicly about his efforts.\n\nClinton’s health last made headlines in November 2022 when he tested positive for COVID-19. He said at the time that his symptoms were “mild” and he was “grateful to be vaccinated and boosted.”\n\nClinton, who led the United States for two presidential terms from 1993-2001, is the second-youngest living US president, after 63-year-old Barack Obama.\n\nHe was born mere months after fellow former US president George W Bush and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThough his prosperous time in office was marred by scandals, he has enjoyed a second life in the two decades after his presidency, which has seen him venture into numerous diplomatic and humanitarian causes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nTags: Bill Clinton Fever hospitalised \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n PJ Patterson calls Barbara Gayle’s murder ‘a wake-up call’ for Jamaica \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n Former Prime Minister PJ Patterson says last week’s brutal murder of veteran journalist Barbara Gayle is a “wake-up call” for Jamaica, noting that it ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n SBAJ outraged over commercial banks’ refusal to align lending rates with BOJ reduction \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— The Small Business Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) has expressed outrage over commercial banks refusal to adjust their lending rates ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Pedestrian injured in Christiana collision \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica— A young woman has been hospitalised after she was reportedly pinned between a vehicle and a pole in Christiana, Manchester on Mon... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Decomposing body of doctor discovered in Westmoreland apartment \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica— The Westmoreland police division is investigating the murder of 57-year-old medical doctor Aung Naing whose decomposing body wa... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Haitians massacred for practicing voodoo were abducted, hacked to death: UN \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP)— A massacre of more than 200 people in Haiti this month followed a gang-ordered manhunt that saw victims, many of ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Accused killer of US insurance CEO pleads not guilty to ‘terrorist’ murder \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP)— The man accused of gunning down a health insurance executive in a brazen hit in New York that sparked fierce debate abo... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Forex: J$156.39 to one US dollar \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The US dollar on Monday, December 23, 2024 ended trading at $156.39 down by 44 cents according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily exch... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nHOUSE RULES\r\n\n\r\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The impoverished Caribbean country has been mired for decades by political instability, made worse in recent years by gangs that have grown in strength and organisational sophistication.\n\nDespite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.\n\n“According to BINUH and OHCHR, since January 2024, more than 5,358 people have been killed and 2,155 injured,” the report said.\n\n“This brings the total number of people killed or injured in Haiti to at least 17,248 since the beginning of 2022.”\n\nThe UN Security Council “strongly condemned the continued destabilising criminal activities of armed gangs and stressed the need for the international community to redouble its efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the population.”\n\nA spokeswoman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “these crimes touched the very foundation of Haitian society, targeting the most vulnerable populations.”\n\nVoodoo was brought to Haiti by African slaves and is a mainstay of the country’s culture. It was banned during French colonial rule and only recognised as an official religion by the Haitian government in 2003.\n\nWhile it incorporates elements of other religious beliefs, including Catholicism, voodoo has been historically attacked by other religions.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Accused killer of US insurance CEO pleads not guilty to ‘terrorist’ murder \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP)— The man accused of gunning down a health insurance executive in a brazen hit in New York that sparked fierce debate abo... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Forex: J$156.39 to one US dollar \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The US dollar on Monday, December 23, 2024 ended trading at $156.39 down by 44 cents according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily exch... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)— A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department regularly paid for lurid sex ses... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Clarendon man turns himself over to police after breaking into home, destroying property \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n CLARENDON, Jamaica— A mason who turned himself in to the police after he allegedly entered a man’s home in Chateau district, Clarendon and destroyed i... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n MBJ expanding biometrics to outgoing passengers \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n MONTEGO BAY, St James — Operator of Sangster International Airport (SIA) MBJ Airports Ltd is planning to roll out the use of biometric technology for ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Kingston men charged with robbery with aggravation \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica- Detectives assigned to the Kingston Central Police Division have charged two men with robbery with aggravation following an inciden... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Nesta enlists Nigy Boy for ‘Chocolate Boy’ \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n The Demerara region of Guyana is known for its bountiful sugar production.

It added that this series of cuts forms part of the central bank’s strategy to stimulate economic growth and reduce borrowing costs for consumers.\n\nHowever, commercial banks have not adjusted their lending rates accordingly, leaving borrowers struggling under high-interest auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, and personal loans, SBAJ said.\n\nIt went on to accuse banks of prioritising profits over public interest and undermining the BOJ’s monetary policy, and has called for immediate action to address the financial strain on its members.\n\n“This is a slap in the face to small business owners who are already hanging by a thread,” said Garnett Reid, president of the SBAJ.\n\n“The BOJ is doing its part to create an environment for growth, but the banks are acting as gatekeepers, preventing these benefits from reaching the people who need them most,” Reid added.\n\nMichael Lecky, immediate past president of the SBAJ, echoed similar sentiments.\n\n“We have members who are still paying exorbitant interest rates of 15-18 per cent on loans, while the BOJ has lowered rates significantly. This disparity is not just unethical; it’s economic sabotage. The banks are profiting at the expense of the backbone of our economy—small businesses,” he argued.\n\nThe SBAJ went on to accuse the Bank Association of Jamaica (BAJ) of remaining silent amid the outrage, while it called for transparency and alignment with the BOJ’s monetary policy.\n\nIt further called for government intervention to ensure that the banks comply with the BOJ’s policy changes.\n\n“The longer this goes unchecked, the more damage will be done to our small business community and the economy at large. We need immediate action to hold these financial institutions accountable,” Reid stressed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Pedestrian injured in Christiana collision \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica— A young woman has been hospitalised after she was reportedly pinned between a vehicle and a pole in Christiana, Manchester on Mon... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Decomposing body of doctor discovered in Westmoreland apartment \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica— The Westmoreland police division is investigating the murder of 57-year-old medical doctor Aung Naing whose decomposing body wa... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Haitians massacred for practicing voodoo were abducted, hacked to death: UN \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP)— A massacre of more than 200 people in Haiti this month followed a gang-ordered manhunt that saw victims, many of ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Accused killer of US insurance CEO pleads not guilty to ‘terrorist’ murder \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP)— The man accused of gunning down a health insurance executive in a brazen hit in New York that sparked fierce debate abo... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Forex: J$156.39 to one US dollar \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The US dollar on Monday, December 23, 2024 ended trading at $156.39 down by 44 cents according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily exch... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)— A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department regularly paid for lurid sex ses... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Clarendon man turns himself over to police after breaking into home, destroying property \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n CLARENDON, Jamaica— A mason who turned himself in to the police after he allegedly entered a man’s home in Chateau district, Clarendon and destroyed i... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nHOUSE RULES\r\n\n\r\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The police, with the assistance of the Jamaica Fire Brigade, gained entry to the apartment where the body was discovered with multiple stab wounds,” Dobson said.\n\nAdding that there were no signs of forced entry nor burglary, Superintendent Dobson said that investigations are ongoing. The police are seeking the assistance of the public to solve the case.\n\n“The Westmoreland police are appealing to anyone with information that may assist in the investigation to contact the nearest police station or Crime Stop at 311. All information provided will be treated with utmost confidentiality,” he said.\n\n-Kediesha Perry\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Haitians massacred for practicing voodoo were abducted, hacked to death: UN \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP)— A massacre of more than 200 people in Haiti this month followed a gang-ordered manhunt that saw victims, many of ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Accused killer of US insurance CEO pleads not guilty to ‘terrorist’ murder \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP)— The man accused of gunning down a health insurance executive in a brazen hit in New York that sparked fierce debate abo... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Forex: J$156.39 to one US dollar \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The US dollar on Monday, December 23, 2024 ended trading at $156.39 down by 44 cents according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily exch... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)— A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department regularly paid for lurid sex ses... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Clarendon man turns himself over to police after breaking into home, destroying property \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n CLARENDON, Jamaica— A mason who turned himself in to the police after he allegedly entered a man’s home in Chateau district, Clarendon and destroyed i... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n MBJ expanding biometrics to outgoing passengers \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n MONTEGO BAY, St James — Operator of Sangster International Airport (SIA) MBJ Airports Ltd is planning to roll out the use of biometric technology for ... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Kingston men charged with robbery with aggravation \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nDecember 23, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica- Detectives assigned to the Kingston Central Police Division have charged two men with robbery with aggravation following an inciden... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nHOUSE RULES\r\n\n\r\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Trump on Saturday wrote on his Truth Social platform that the Panama Canal plays a \"critical role\" in the US economy and national security. He demanded Panama reduce fees on the canal or return it to US control, reports Xinhua news agency.\"It is ridiculous,\" said Jones Cooper, a professor at the University of Panama. Panama is the rightful owner of the canal, and the United States has no legal basis to reclaim it, he added, noting that the United States profited significantly during its occupation while Panama gained little in return. Julio Yao, a Panamanian international relations scholar, called Trump's comment the latest example of the American \"big stick\" policy. He emphasised that the Panama Canal must not be returned to the United States.According to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 by the then-Panamanian President Omar Torrijos and then US President Jimmy Carter, Panamanians recovered their sovereignty over the canal on December 31, 1999. Earlier on Sunday, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino said that the canal will \"continue to be in Panamanian hands\" after US President-elect Donald Trump threatened to retake it.Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent area belong to Panama and \"will remain so,\" and \"the sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable,\" Mulino said in a social media video post. Trump on Saturday called the Panama Canal \"a VITAL National Asset for the United States,\" threatening to retake the canal, citing \"exorbitant prices\" on US ships.Mulino said he hopes to maintain a \"respectful\" relationship with the next US government. He also pointed out that security issues such as illegal migration, drug trafficking, terrorism, and organised crime should be a priority in the two countries' bilateral agenda. He also recalled the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and added that it established the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal, \"guaranteeing its open and safe operation for all nations any position to the contrary is invalid.\"\"(The tariffs) are established based on an open hearing, considering market conditions, international competition, operating costs and the maintenance and modernisation needs of the interoceanic waterway,\" said Mulino. \"The Canal will continue to be in Panamanian hands as an inalienable patrimony of our nation and guaranteeing its use for the peaceful and uninterrupted transit of ships of all nations,\" said the Panamanian president.","url":"https://assamtribune.com/international/panamanian-scholars-depict-trumps-allegation-about-panama-canal-as-ridiculous-1562047","image":"https://assamtribune.com/images/logo.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:33:23","author":"Ians","authors":["Ians"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":275672824,"title":"Bank of Canada watching economy closely after half-point rate cut","text":"The central bank’s summary of deliberations released Monday offers a glimpse into the council’s discussions in the lead up to the Dec. 11 rate cut, which lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point.\n\nMembers considered only cutting by a quarter-point, but ultimately brought the rate down to 3.25 per cent in a bid to bring it closer to its so called neutral rate, where it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic growth.\n\nThey noted that lower immigration targets are likely to weigh on economic growth next year and that tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump are a “major new source of uncertainty.”\n\nCouncil members also said they’d be considering further rate cuts, but would be taking a more gradual approach given the five consecutive cuts since June, and giving the economy time to respond to them.\n\nThe next rate decision and quarterly economic forecast are scheduled for Jan. 29.","url":"https://calgarysun.com/business/money-news/bank-of-canada-watching-economy-closely-after-half-point-rate-cut","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/torontosun/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/boc-interest-rate-summary-20241223.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:32:23","author":"Canadian Press","authors":["Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":275672544,"title":"JD Vance appears to defend Germany&#x2019;s far-right AfD party","text":"WASHINGTON — Vice President-elect J.D.

Some of its members have downplayed the Holocaust.On Friday Musk, one of the world’s richest people and an influential adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, set off a torrent of concerned comment on Friday when he said on X, which he owns, that “Only the AfD can save Germany.” Musk, who is poised to take a role in Trump’s White House, doubled down on Saturday, tweeting “AfD is the only hope for Germany.” In addition to working at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Stradner is also a correspondent for KyivPost, which covers Ukraine. While neither organization receives U.S. government funding — though FDD, a nonprofit, gets certain tax benefits — Vance’s jibe at Stradner’s “employer” could rattle Jewish and pro-Israel foreign policy mavens who otherwise have welcomed Trump’s impending return to the White House.FDD favors a more confrontational posture toward Iran, Russia’s ally in the Middle East. It is independent and nonpartisan, but its leaders have made clear they believe Trump will be more robust than Biden in dealing with Iran in the region.FDD and the Trump-Vance transition team did not return requests for comment.

Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who is Jewish, took aim at Vance for boosting the party on the weekend of a deadly car-ramming attack on a German Christmas market. The alleged attacker, a Saudi national, posted a range of sentiments online, including some that reportedly backed AfD.“Yesterday, a right-wing terrorist murdered 5 people in Germany and @JDVance and @elonmusk are endorsing the Neo-Nazi AfD party that inspired him,” Goldman said. “You know what’s dangerous @JDVance? The antisemitism and Neo-Nazi ideology you’re supporting.”Trump’s selection of Vance as running mate unsettled some in the conservative Jewish foreign policy community because of his isolationist bent. Vance has opposed continued U.S. backing for Ukraine in its efforts to repel the Russian invasion. He has said that Israel is an exception to his desire to pull America back from its involvement in foreign conflicts. It’s not clear yet what Trump’s Ukraine plans are, other than a desire to quickly broker a peace.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/international/article-834635","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/622590","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:30:24","author":"Ron Kampeas/jta","authors":["Ron Kampeas/jta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":275672536,"title":"Sentence of Tree of Life shooter not commuted","text":"The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter’s federal death sentence remains intact, after President Joe Biden commuted 37 of the 40 sentences of prisoners on federal death row.All of the three men still sentenced to death committed crimes that were motivated by hate or terrorism.Biden’s announcement early Monday morning is among a number of measures he is taking to protect his policies and vision ahead of Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.

I would say that counts as lightning fast on the Never Trump scale, and as stunning and brave when published in The New York Times. \n\nIt’s been more than nine years since I first denounced Donald Trump as a “loudmouth vulgarian appealing to quieter vulgarians.” I’ve called myself a Never Trump conservative ever since, even when I agreed with his policies from time to time. I also opposed him throughout his run this year.Could his second term be as bad as his most fervent critics fear? Yes. Is it time to drop the heavy moralizing and incessant doomsaying that typified so much of the Never Trump movement — and that rendered it politically impotent and frequently obtuse? Yes, please.Who, and what, is Trump? He’s a man and the symbol of a movement. The man is crass but charismatic, ignorant but intuitive, dishonest but authentic. The movement is patriotic — and angry.Some of that anger is intensely bigoted and some of it misplaced. That side of the anger gets most of the media’s attention. But some of it, too, is correctly directed at a self-satisfied elite that thinks it knows better but often doesn’t, whether the subject is Covid restrictions, immigration policy or how to get our allies to pay more for their defense.\n\nFirst things first: I have never thought of Stephens as in the same class as the Never Trump grifters. He belongs in the class of Republicans who were genuinely repulsed by the populist strain of politics that Trump represents but not in the class who switched sides in order to increase their marketability in the political marketplace that can be so remunerative. \n\nFor this reason, while I often disagreed with Stephens, I was not repulsed by him in the way that The Lincoln Project folks inspired intestinal discomfort every time I saw their opinions vomited out on Twitter or now X. \n\nStephens' reaction to Trump was based on his allegiance to an older way of conducting politics and making policy. He preferred the Brahmin way of doing things, not the Andrew Jackson or Teddy Roosevelt style of politics. Oddly, many Brahmins now like the first Roosevelt president, but it is easy to do so when he is safely dead and no longer reminding him that he was one of the original Jingoists. \n\nIt’s Trump’s sulfurous contempt for that elite — his refusal to be shaped by their norms or shamed by their scorn and his willingness to call out their hypocrisy — that makes him a hero to his followers. Cases in point: How come so many who denounce Trump as a sexual predator were, 20 years earlier, Bill Clinton’s steadfast defenders? Why were the same people who demanded investigations into every corner of the Trump family’s business dealings so incurious about the Biden family’s dealings, like the curiously high prices for Hunter’s paintings?Never Trumpers — I include myself in this indictment — never quite got the point. It wasn’t that we’d forgotten Clinton’s scandals or were ignorant of the allegations about the Bidens. It’s that we thought Trump degraded the values that conservatives were supposed to stand for. We also thought that Trump represented a form of illiberalism that was antithetical to our “free people, free markets, free world” brand of conservatism and that was bound to take the Republican Party down a dark road.\n\nThe revelation that changed Stephens' mind seems odd: he now sees in Trump what Trump's fans saw all along: that he latched onto and embodied the disgust that MAGA feels for the degraded American elite and that the elite took American institutions that worked, hollowed them out, and turned them into a corrupt tool of their tyrannical aspirations. \n\nThe cardinal flaw of this version of Never Trumpism is that they were led to excuse the corruption of Washington because they hated Trump. They ignored the Hunter Biden scandal because it distracted from the \"true\" enemy--Donald Trump. It never occurred to them that Donald Trump was America's reaction--a symptom of America's immune system, not the disease itself. \n\nThere’s plenty to dislike and fear about Trump from a traditionally conservative standpoint. But Never Trumpers also overstated our case and, in doing so, defeated our purpose.How so? We warned that Trump would be a reckless president who might stumble into World War III. If anything, his foreign policy in his first term was, in practice, often cautious to a fault. We hyperventilated about his odd chumminess with Vladimir Putin. But the collusion allegations were a smear, and Trump’s Russia policy — whether it was his opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline or his covert aid to Ukraine — was much tougher than either Barack Obama’s or (at least until Russia invaded Ukraine) President Biden’s.\n\nThe worst excesses of MAGA--and there are a few--should be seen as the body politic's immune reaction to a deadly disease. They are like a runny nose and a fever, which aren't the result of the virus but of the body's destroying it. In more normal times, the affable Ronald Reagan can step into the Oval Office and chip away at the excesses of liberalism, but these are not normal times. \n\nThe body politic is suffering from a deadly disease, and Trumpism may be a blunt instrument, but a blunt instrument is just what is needed, and Stephens seems to be waking up to the fact that perhaps Trump can begin the process of healing America. \n\nStephens isn't embracing MAGA, as the convert J.D. Vance has. But he sees the wisdom of wishing for its success. That's a good start. \n\nThe vibe is shifting. Even some of Trump's biggest critics in the shrinking crowd of genuinely conservative Never Trumpers are beginning to see that the Bad Orange Man may actually accomplish some important things. \n\nSure, people who make a living attacking Trump will keep it up, as with the true sufferers of Trump Derangement Syndrome. But the few people who are capable of rethinking their prejudices are beginning to do so. \n\nThe world is healing.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2024/12/23/nyt-never-trumper-repents-n3798160","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/223/bd998435-b712-495c-ac81-360bb75265bf.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:25:25","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.04},{"id":275672060,"title":"Political Earthquake Rocks San Diego County","text":"At the beginning of December, I wrote a VIP piece about a pretty aggressive move the San Diego Board of Supervisors was contemplating in response to the Trump election and his implementation of announced immigration rejiggering plans, aka mass deportations. \n\nIntroducing the resolution and leading the charge for passage was the Democratic District 1 supervisor and chairwoman of the board, Nora Vargas. What her proposal would do was ban the use of any county resources - including the county sheriff - from being used to assist ICE and the federal government in removing illegal aliens from San Diego County.\n\n...Today’s actions will adopt a resolution and Board Policy L-2 to affirm the County shall not provide assistance or cooperation to ICE in its civil immigration enforcement efforts, including by giving ICE agents access to individuals or allowing them to use County facilities for investigative interviews or other purposes, expending County time or resources responding to ICE inquiries or communicating with ICE regarding individuals’ incarceration status or release dates, or otherwise participating in any civil immigration enforcement activities. The proposed policy does not limit or prohibit giving assistance with the investigative activities of any local, state, or federal law enforcement agency relating to suspected violations of criminal laws. She's basically codifying giving ICE the brush-off because of \"time and resources.\"I would think co-operating with ICE in a border county that is experiencing an illegal immigration flood would be worth expending \"time and resources.\" \n\nVargas's resolution passed during a tumultuous supervisors' board meeting during the first week of this month. \n\nVocal residents on both sides of the issue were at the meeting in force. \n\nThe San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 Tuesday to restrict the use of county resources for federal immigration enforcement....\"Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and our county will not be a tool for policies that hurt our residents,\" said Vargas, who made the proposal....Vargas, Vice Chair Terra Lawson-Remer and Supervisor Monica Montgomery Steppe voted yes, while Supervisor Jim Desmond was the lone no vote. Supervisor Joel Anderson was absent Tuesday due to illness, officials said.In a statement, Desmond said the decision \"to turn San Diego County into a `super' sanctuary county is an affront to every law-abiding citizen who values safety and justice.\"\n\nAs was the San Diego County Sheriff, Kelly Martinez, who made it quite clear that, as an elected official, the Board of Supervisors had no control over her department. She was going to obey all applicable state and federal laws and cooperate where she could.\n\nThe pro-illegal lobby has her firmly in their sights for spoiling their super-sanctuary plan roll-out, and they were still after her a week ago.\n\nSan Diego County Sheriff Kelly Martinez said she will not be following new policy from the Board of Supervisors that limits her cooperation with immigration authorities unless they have a warrant signed by a state or federal judge.State law allows the sheriff’s department to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in certain ways, even without a judicial warrant.Sheriff Kelly Martinez declined an interview but sent a written statement.She said she has authority over the jails, not the board, and her office will keep doing what they’ve been doing — letting ICE interview consenting people in their custody with certain convictions, and notifying ICE of upcoming release dates.Those convictions include things like sexual abuse, child abuse, battery, assault and drug charges.\n\nI sure like the cut of her jib.\n\nWhile the storm that Vargas set in motion was breaking over everyone's head, as well as drawing an unwelcome Tom Homan beady eye on the county, the voluble chairwoman herself suddenly clammed up. She couldn't be reached for comment and blamed her recurring vocal nodule issues.\n\nThere wasn't a peep out of her until Friday. Then she dropped a bombshell on her staff and the county she'd just pretty well boned with the federal government.\n\nFriday's resignation of Nora Vargas from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors rocked the political world and left many speculating. Vargas said it was due to her personal safety and security. She said she accomplished great things and brought equity to the county.

She has spoken often of her dismay at mounting public disruptions in Board of Supervisors meetings and said she has faced death threats and other extreme forms of harassment.“I have stalkers, I have people who harass me on phones, there’s all sorts of things,” she said during a recent Board of Supervisors discussion about changing meeting rules to prevent disruptions.But Vargas also had alienated a growing number of onetime supporters in her district and received a surprisingly low number of votes in her re-election race against an underfunded and virtually unknown Republican opponent.\n\nThe lightning rod chairwoman also had myriad complaints about the tenor and volume of complaints she received, claiming she felt her safety was in jeopardy due to them. The county was reportedly ponying up some serious cash for her security detail.\n\n#noravargas used $41k a month security to support her delusions of grandeur and persecution. “Look at me, No! Don’t look at me!” https://t.co/ugNTyaPAlb— Sirena (@lasirenadelmar7) December 21, 2024\n\nConsidering what overwhelmed San Diego County residents thought of this last political stunt of hers, the heat may have been too much in the kitchen.\n\nReaders react: San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas’s actions contradict her oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution.

She is facing two racial discrimination lawsuits, both by Asian men.Jeff Liu filed a lawsuit in late 2023 claiming Vargas’ office offered him a job as her policy director, but then rescinded the offer. The allegations claim Vargas’ former chief of staff, Denice García, uttered slurs at Liu and Liu claimed Vargas knew about the slurs and other alleged racist comments about him.Earlier this year, former county deputy administrative officer, Michael Vu, filed a lawsuit against the county claiming Vargas made racist remarks about Vu after he applied for the county administrative officer job. The CAO leads the day-to-day operations of the county.Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer is also named in the Vu suit as he alleges Lawson-Remer engaged in a campaign to hire former Fletcher staffer Paul Worlie as Vu’s No. 2 if Vu agreed to the deal. He did not, according to his lawsuit.\n\nThere has also been a continuing, embarrassing Department of Justice investigation into the workings of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), of which Vargas was also the chair during what seems to be a generally sloppy term in office.\n\nAs the SANDAG board of directors continues to wrestle with the fact that it was kept in the dark about issues related to the state Route 125 tolling system, several members remain suspicious about who else knew about these issues early on.Recent audits completed by SANDAG’s Independent Performance Auditor Courtney Ruby confirmed that agency executives were aware of significant financial reporting issues with operator ETAN Tolling Technologies in mid-2022 but did not tell the board until late 2023. Ruby’s office also found that when SANDAG rushed into a $28 million sole-source contract with Deloitte and A-To-Be to migrate over the back office system technology earlier this year, the agency failed to ensure that its financial accounting needs would be met. This oversight created a host of new problems that will extend the timeline for transferring over to the back office system by several months. \n\nWhen she was there, I mean.\n\nThe chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors claimed she had a doctor's appointment when she walked out of a meeting earlier this month and later posted a video on Instagram at a Padres playoff game. However, county records of Supervisor Nora Vargas' calendar obtained by ABC 10News do not show a doctor's appointment on Oct. 8.Vargas moved all of her items to the front of the Oct. 8 meeting agenda and then walked out abruptly in the afternoon, missing a consequential vote on a gun procurement ordinance. Then, she posted a story on her personal Instagram account from Petco Park, celebrating a Fernando Tatis Jr. home run in Game 3 of the National League Division Series.\n\nAt the moment, no one is going to be able to catch her in little white lies - she's deleted all her social media accounts. But I have yet to see the Democrat who can stay away from a camera and off the innerwebs for very long. \n\nThey simply haven't the intestinal fortitude to sign off completely. It's like an incurable crack addiction for them.\n\nCounty Supervisor from San Diego, Nora Vargas, has deleted her Facebook public official page and limited comments on Instagram.

Hernandez V. Banks and Banks in 2013 settled the question on whether someone with mental incapacity can enter into a legally binding contract. They can't. Yet Joe Biden, or whomever is the Pontius Pilate understudy riding out the remainder of the President's term in office until January 20th, just let a bunch more mass murderers out of prison. Before today's executive action, which is totally within Biden's Constitutional powers as president, there were 40 people who reside on Death Row after conviction on federal charges. 37 of them have now been spared the nighty-night needle and will get three squares a day, compliments of you and me, for the rest of their natural born lives. 92.5% of Death Row has been emptied out. It makes you wonder who are the three that still have an appointment to see capital punishment meted out. \n\nNotably, the president did not commute the sentences of three people whose crimes included mass shootings or acts of terrorism: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of two brothers responsible for the deadly Boston Marathon bombing in 2013; Dylann Roof, a White nationalist who massacred nine people at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Robert Bowers, who killed 11 worshippers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018.\n\nWe read in the four Gospels of the New Testament, all of which make reference to Barabbas, the man whom Jewish religious leaders wanted released instead of Jesus as was the tradition on the eve before Passover. So what did Barabbas do? He killed a Roman soldier, and instigated or participated in an insurrection or riot against Rome. Let's compare the sins of Barabbas with the people Joe Biden, or whoever is responsible for maintaining the illusion of there being a President Joe Biden, decided to let live. \n\nAmong those receiving the holiday cheer is Thomas Sanders, who in 2010 kidnapped and then shot 12-year-Lexis Roberts four times and cut her throat in Louisiana — days after the girl watched as Sanders murdered her mother on a road trip near the Grand Canyon.Christmas also came early for Anthony Battle, who murdered an Atlanta prison guard with a hammer in 1994 while serving a life sentence for raping and murdering his wife, a US Marine, in 1987 at Camp Lejeune, NC. Jorge Avila-Torrez sexually assaulted and stabbed to death two girls — Laura Hobbs, 8, and Krystal Tobias, 9 — who had been riding their bicycles in their neighborhood in a suburb north of Chicago in 2005. Four years later, he strangled naval officer Amanda Snell, 20, inside her barrack in Arlington, Va.\n\nSeveral of those who just received clemency are mass murderers. Five, maybe more, are child killers. Joe Biden took justice into his own hands by removing the possibility for them to receive the sentence meted out by a jury of their peers. This was not to appease the masses that were looking for these 37 to be spared the death penalty. In fact, the rationale for why Biden's handlers did this makes the clemencies even worse.\n\nBut guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\n\nThe executions that Joe Biden halted were ones that fall under Title 18, Chapter 228 of the U.S. Code. That code reflects amendments to it made by 1994's Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994. That act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.Joe Biden took an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Article II, Section 3 includes this clause, which Biden swore to uphold. \n\n...he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\n\nExcept for this one. In fact, he not only faithfully usurped and disobeyed the implementation of that law, he explained that the reason he did it was specifically to keep Donald Trump from keeping his Constitutional oath and enforcing the law. There was one Senator who was the primary author and sponsor of that 1994 Death Penalty Act. Anyone care to hazard a guess at whom that senator was? I'll give you a clue. It was Joe Biden. Exit polling from the 2024 presidential election showed that crime was indeed in the top five issues on which people cast ballots, and in some polling, in the top three. You've got to think this is going to have disastrous repercussions for Democrats over the next two years trying to restore their brand. If South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee this coming cycle, doesn't begin to Dresden the contested senate seat states with ads about Biden's embrace of violent crime, he's not doing it right. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, smelling that something of this magnitude was on the horizon, made this prediction last Friday. \n\nIf Biden gives clemency to the worst mass murderers and terrorists who killed many Americans, every Democrat up for election in 2026 will answer for it.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) December 21, 2024\n\nKeep in mind that before today's action, another slate of Presidential grace, commuting the sentences of 1,500 people, including the notorious \"Kids For Cash\" judge, Michael Conahan, was handed down by this White House last week. With 28 days to go, we have not yet apparently reached the breadth and depth of wanton depravity of Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. After this latest slate of clemencies, I'm sure some in the West Wing are hoping that pardoning his creepy son doesn't seem so bad. Regardless, you know these will not be the last pardons, clemencies, and/or commutations issued in this President's name. Last week, Chris Cillizza, formerly of CNN, issued an apology for not doggedly reporting on charges that Joe Biden was off his nut in the first two years of his presidency. He went on a 10-minute rant about how he and the rest of regime media let the American people down by not doing even basic investigative journalism. Everyone knows Joe Biden couldn't pick one of these former Death Row residents out of a lineup. It doesn't matter if you're a Republican, Democrat, or a member of regime media. You intuitively know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no chance this action today was ordered or drawn up by Joe Biden. This was a staff move, Jill Biden held Joe's hand steady with the pen in it, and White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zeints moved the paper. Chris Cillizza promised to do better. He vowed that he would never again let a story like that go by without reporting or commenting on it. Of course, he was talking about hammering away at Donald Trump's age over the next four years, not admitting that he's a lefty who got caught up in the mother of all scandals. I just checked Chris' X page. Nothing on today's 37 clemencies of the most heinous offenders of federal crimes. You know what's there instead? Navel gazing about his own mea culpa. \n\nI posted a video apologizing for not pushing harder in the first 2 years of Joe Biden's presidency on questions about his mental and physical decline.The video, predictably, became a political football.I posted 7 thoughts on it all.https://t.co/W31CELukqP— Chris Cillizza (@ChrisCillizza) December 22, 2024\n\nChris, in his reformed journalist mode, thinks the story is about him, not about what he apologized for in the first place - Joe Biden having no business being in the White House. He shouldn't have been there in 2021, and he sure as hell shouldn't be there now. Regime media can't get up off the floor and do better until they finish falling. Joe Biden will not stop failing as president until he no longer holds the job. The Democratic Party will find itself in the political wilderness until they finally figure out what or who got them there. Fortunately, January 20th will fix one of those conundrums. Democrats might eventually figure out how to resonate with a majority of Americans again. Look at Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 like Jon Ossoff in Georgia as a bellwether. Biden's stunt will not play well there, but will Ossoff stay silent and hope this blows over, or will he speak out and distance himself from this administration? Regime media? Hard to see how and when they recover any credibility. The government alphabet health agencies will be trusted again before media is, and that won't be for decades.","url":"https://hotair.com/generalissimo/2024/12/23/joe-biden-give-them-barabbas-and-every-other-horrible-human-being-we-locked-up-n3798155","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/355/ef801597-25c8-4d9c-8991-2d1ffbeb3a5c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:25:25","author":"Duane Patterson","authors":["Duane Patterson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":275672048,"title":"‘Shadow President Musk’ and Other Media Myths","text":"The corporate media and other Democrat advocacy groups have been desperately casting about for a way to create tension between President-elect Trump and Elon Musk. They know that much of the progressive agenda is in serious danger if the affinity that exists between these two men endures for very long. Beginning well before the election, numerous “news” stories alleged that Musk’s support of Trump created horrendous conflicts of interest. No one outside the Beltway paid any attention. Then, the demise of the 1,547 page “continuing resolution” last week inspired a new narrative — the senior partner in the alliance was Musk rather than Trump.\n\nWednesday evening, after Musk and countless other critics had denounced the bill as a legislative abomination jam-packed with pork, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took to X and thundered, “Are Republicans beholden to the American people? Or President Musk?” Likewise, when it became obvious that the original CR was a goner, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) chimed in, “Welcome to the Elon Musk presidency.” Not coincidentally, Democrat operative Julie Roginsky appeared on CNN and parroted the party line: “Elon Musk is puppeteering Donald Trump.” Mike Allen at Axios absurdly claimed that Musk was “the most powerful person in politics” and that he had “single-handedly” put paid to the spending bill.\n\nNever mind that Trump, J.D. Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy, and three dozen House Republicans collectively declared that a government shutdown was preferable to passing the monstrosity that House Speaker Mike Johnson presented for a vote. The legacy news media, however, was interested in only one facet of the CR story — that Musk had the temerity to shine a spotlight on the scam and suggest that voters should contact their representatives in Congress and share their feelings about it. In other words, he did what a truly free press corps would have done itself had it not been co-opted by the Democratic National Committee. Thus, Bloomberg’s Nia-Malika Henderson portrays Musk in the following portentous terms:\n\nMusk, with his billions and his global reach via X, is unlike anyone else in Trumpworld. Casting off cabinet secretaries and the likes of “Sloppy Steve” Bannon was much easier. Those people didn’t have Musk’s reach or celebrity — or his billions. They were sycophants who needed Trump more than he needed them. By contrast, Musk confers status on Trump by being by his side. He broadens Trump’s reach and his power. Put simply, Musk makes Trump bigger. Some Republicans have suggested that Musk should be the next speaker of the House, yet this would be a major step down.","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2024/12/23/shadow-president-musk-and-other-media-myths-n3798173","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:25:25","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":275672042,"title":"POLITICO Writer Begs Federal Workers to Stay and Fight","text":"Just what we need: a do-gooder begging federal employees to stick around in order to recreate The Resistance™ in Trump's second term. \n\nOpinion: Dear federal workers, please don’t quit. Your democracy needs you, writes @MaxStier.https://t.co/UI1eBZbRG0— POLITICO (@politico) December 22, 2024\n\nIn the great tradition of progressives arguing that the only way to save muh democracy is to ignore the people's will, Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, begs federal employees not to leave federal employment in a huff. \n\nInstead, they should stay and fight, fight, fight. \n\nver the next few weeks, U.S. civil servants will spend the holidays wrestling with a tough choice: Stay in your jobs and work for a president who openly disdains you and might try to fire you — or quit. I have already heard from many of you who would rather try your luck on the job market than wait for President-elect Donald Trump’s promised purge.I am asking you — pleading with you: stay. Your decision isn’t just about your career, or a single president. It’s part of a larger war, one waged throughout American history, over what the federal government can and should be: Is it an apolitical source of expertise and professionalism, or is it a partisan weapon for presidents to use for their own political or economic ends? Now, with Trump and his allies setting civil servants in their sights, we risk backsliding to an earlier time, when cronyism reigned — and Americans suffered. By staying in your position as long as you can, you can defend the work of our democracy.\n\n\"Our democracy.\" Stay and fight the elected representative of the American people in order to save the administrative state from having to pay even the least attention to the desire of Americans for reform. \n\nPerfect progressive projection. Rule by \"experts\" and \"bureaucrats\" is what they mean by democracy. \n\nThe irony, of course, is that the only people thinking of leaving are highly partisan bureaucrats who are dispirited by their reduced ability to impose their wills on us by fiat. They are the ones who have weaponized government and imposed outrageous regulations that have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and who work diligently to suppress free speech. \n\nGood riddance to bad rubbish. \n\nMost other federal employees will hold on to their cushy jobs for dear life, hoping to put in their 20 and retire comfortably. \n\nyou must do your best to weather the storm, because history shows us what will happen if the Trump administration succeeds in twisting the government into a partisan machine. In the 1800s, the government was inefficient, incompetent and corrupt because President Andrew Jackson instituted a “spoils system” that awarded federal jobs to his supporters and partisans, rather than qualified professionals who earned their positions on merit.\n\nYuck. Sorry, but that made me nauseous. Does anybody--including federal employees--think that the people who rise up the ranks of the bureaucracy did so by merit? That is one of the most ridiculous things I have read, and I am including the meme that Biden is \"sharp as a tack.\" \n\nThere are competent and even excellent federal employees, but if they have risen to the top tier, it is more by accident than their competence--or their competence is defined in terms of how well they weaponize their power over the Establishment's enemies and helping their friends. \n\nIt sure isn't based on serving the ordinary American. Get real. If you believe this you also believe that Woodrow Wilson was our best president. \n\nReplacing expert professionals who are motivated by their desire to serve the public with partisans whose primary qualification is their loyalty to the president would cripple the government’s ability to address threats around the world, meet the needs of our citizens and uphold the rule of law. In today’s complicated, dangerous and fast-moving world, we need a nonpartisan civil service focused on serving the American people even more than we did in the much simpler and less hazardous 19th century.As you weigh your options, I hope you will consider the profound impact your choice will have on our democracy.

His successful attack on Kevin McCarthy's Speakership came in part because McCarthy refused to quash the probe. Gaetz clearly intended to use the strange sequence this past month where Gaetz resigned his office just after winning another House term in order to force the committee to seal the results.\n\nInstead, the Ethics Committee voted to publish its final report on Gaetz. Before they could do that, though, it leaked to a number of news outlets this morning, and ... it looks pretty bad:\n\nGaetz has repeatedly denied that he broke any laws. “These claims would be destroyed in court — which is why they were never made in any court against me,” he told POLITICO Friday morning.But the committee’s 37-page report, which it decided to release in a secret vote earlier this month, alleges several instances of illegal conduct by President-elect Donald Trump’s one-time pick to serve as attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration as Trump’s AG last month as the potential public release of the investigation weighed on his chances of Senate confirmation.“The Committee concluded there was substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress,” the ethics panel said in its report, adding that he “knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct” the investigation.\n\nGaetz has repeatedly pointed out that the Department of Justice/FBI investigated these same allegations and declined to charge him. And that's true, but it's not quite on point, and it's also not the exoneration that Gaetz at least implies it to be. The language quoted here specifically refers to \"substantial evidence,\" which is not the standard for prosecution. It's not even the \"preponderance of evidence\" that would meet the standard for a successful civil lawsuit. \"Substantial evidence\" is a phrase that really doesn't have a legal meaning as much as it does a political meaning -- which is the context in which Ethics Committees operate, in fact. \n\nThis language strongly suggests that the House Ethics Committee would have taken some \"substantial\" political action, had Gaetz remained in Congress. Given the allegations here, one has to believe they would have recommended a rare expulsion from the House. George Santos got expelled by the House in a 311-114 vote the previous year over accusations of fraud and misuse of funds, allegations which almost seem quaint in comparison. The second-most recent expulsion from the House was Ohio's James Traficant two decades earlier, a Democrat who had been convicted in court of bribery and racketeering before being expelled. These allegations against Gaetz would likely have been too serious to recommend censure. Would a GOP-controlled House have expelled Gaetz over it? He must have thought so, or else he wouldn't have taken the face-saving AG appointment as a means to end the process.\n\nGaetz isn't done fighting the battle, though. He has filed for a restraining order to keep the committee from officially releasing the report, according to NBC and other media outlets:\n\nThe filing accuses the committee of an \"unconstitutional\" attempt \"to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations, in violation of the Committee’s own rules.” ...The complaint argues the report would irreparably hurt Gaetz's reputation, saying that the threatened release \"concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages.\" \n\nGaetz is about to find out that the House sets its own rules. This may not even be judiciable; the courts generally can't dictate how the House operates, since the two are co-equal branches. If the House Ethics Committee votes to change its rules or to waive them, the full House would have to be the venue to challenge that decision, not a federal court. Furthermore, the issue isn't current jurisdiction but jurisdiction when the investigation began. They had jurisdiction over Gaetz for all but the final couple of weeks while writing the report. This is also a political question, not a legal question, in other words.\n\nAs for defamation, that can be addressed in court. But does Gaetz really want to pursue that? The committee spent a lot of time finding witnesses and documentation before compiling this report. Could they have cooked it? Of course, but one has to wonder (a) how likely that would have been in a GOP-controlled House, and (b) whether Gaetz really wants to go through discovery and depositions under penalty of perjury. This sounds like public-relations bravado more than a cogent strategy to prevent the release of a report that likely won't contain any actual surprises. \n\nGaetz does have a reason to put up a PR battle, though. Yesterday he told an audience at a Turning Point USA event in Arizona that he may run for the US Senate to fill Marco Rubio's seat when a special election gets called:\n\nGaetz, who resigned from Congress after being nominated for attorney general, said he may consider running for Senate in Florida for the vacancy left by Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been nominated as Trump’s secretary of state. He also expressed interest in being appointed as a special prosecutor to investigate insider trading in Congress.“Many have asked which perch I will be fighting from next, and some of you throughout this conference have even given me a few suggestions. My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee,” he said. “Maybe special counsel to go after the insider trading from my former colleagues in Congress.”“It seems I may not have enough support in the United States Senate. Maybe I’ll just run for Marco Rubio’s vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks.”\n\nMaybe, but the more that comes out about Gaetz' activities, the less likely that seems. He may need to content himself with the good gig he landed this month at OAN as one of its featured hosts. \n\nUpdate: The committee has now published the report, although the server seems to be overwhelmed at times by the traffic. It's pretty much as advertised:\n\nIn sum, the Committee found substantial evidence of the following:• From at least 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him.• In 2017, Representative Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl.• During the period 2017 to 2019, Representative Gaetz used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, on multiple occasions.• Representative Gaetz accepted gifts, including transportation and lodging in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, in excess of permissible amounts.• In 2018, Representative Gaetz arranged for his Chief of Staff to assist a woman with whom he engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the U.S. Department of State that she was a constituent.• Representative Gaetz knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct the Committee’s investigation of his conduct.• Representative Gaetz has acted in a manner that reflects discreditably upon the House. \n\nThe report also claims that precedent does exist for releasing such reports even after a resignation. The footnote for that claim references the cases of Daniel Flood in 1980, Donald Lukens in 1990, and William Boner in 1987. The dissent at the end of the report focuses entirely on this point, and goes out of its way to declare that dissenting members \"do not challenge the Committee's findings.\" It also tacitly admits to the precedent, noting that the House Ethics Committee has not taken this action \"since 2006,\" in another case entirely regarding the scandal involving House pages. On the substantive conclusions of the committee, though, there appears to be no dissent at all.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/12/23/ethics-committee-final-report-substantial-evidence-gaetz-committed-statutory-rape-n3798159","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/ha/images/up/2023/10/gaetz-vacate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:25:25","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.699},{"id":275672032,"title":"Cheerful: Sen.

Or has the Protection Racket Media simply exited \"suck-up mode\" after many years of covering for the other side?\n\nImma stop you right there, Axios. Their reporters notice that media outlets seem to have abandoned their 24/7/365 La Resistance to Donald Trump, and calls that a \"suck-up moment\":\n\nAmid a record media trust deficit, outlets once critical of Trump are now making overtures to the former and future president, and the majority of American voters who voted for him.TIME magazine not only named Trump \"Person of the Year,\" but the magazine's CEO, Jessica Sibley, chanted \"USA! USA!\" alongside the president-elect as he rang the New York Stock Exchange opening bell.A week after Trump's victory, two executives from TelevisaUnivision, the parent of the largest U.S.-based Spanish-language broadcaster, flew to Mar-a-Lago so the president-elect could personally thank them for election support, The Wall Street Journal reported.L.A. Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong vowed (on Fox News, no less) to balance out his editorial board with conservative voices. He also has discussed plans to add a digital \"bias meter\" for editorials and opinion columns.Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (who, like Soon-Shiong, overruled his staff to kill a Harris endorsement) said at The New York Times' DealBook Summit earlier this month that he's \"actually very optimistic\" about Trump's second term.\n\nAhem. How does Axios think that the \"record media trust deficit\" occurred in the first place? Their very next bullet point makes it pretty obvious, emphasis mine:\n\n Compare that to the resistance media era that started in 2016, with outlets like The Washington Post garnering tough-on-Trump reputations (and thousands of subscriptions).This time around, national outlets — struggling to regain viewers and subscribers — are trying to signal they're no longer out for blood.\n\nThe mainstream media has been out for Trump's blood for nearly ten years now, and everyone knows it. They have not covered Trump fairly during that period; news organizations not only cast almost every story about Trump in negative terms, they rushed to support the Democrats' wildest fantasies about Trump, including \"pee tapes,\" Russia collusion, and all sorts of conspiracy-theory nonsense.\n\nAnd at the same time, the same media outlets spent all of that time refusing to cover scandals involving Democrats. The bias-unto-malice of the Protection Racket Media became most apparent in the Hunter Biden laptop story, which media orgs not only ignored but actively tried to suppress on behalf of Joe Biden. They dutifully reported Biden's spin that it was \"Russian disinformation\" as fact and used it for innumerable \"fact checks\" and arguments about the dangers of disinformation, right up until the Department of Justice used it to indict Hunter Biden for several crimes. Even to this day, the Protection Racket Media will still occasionally suggest that the Russians were behind the Hunter Biden laptop story, especially in attempting to ret-con Joe Biden's reneging on his promise not to pardon Hunter.\n\nNor is that the only scandal that the media has buried in the past four years. Reporters and their media outlets are only now beginning to acknowledge that they helped hide Biden's cognitive decline, at least from the earliest moments of his presidency but in actuality as early as the primary debates in 2019. The media buried this issue when it became clear that Biden had a shot at winning the nomination and could defeat Trump's re-election effort, as my friend John Podhoretz pointed out over the weekend:\n\nCan I point out that the implicit subject of the first five or six Democratic debates in 2019 was whether or not Biden was senile? Remember Julian Castro in September 2019? The coverup began THEN because Biden was 10 points up in the polls. https://t.co/l1j14a3W0C— John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) December 20, 2024\n\nThe mainstream media suppressed perhaps the worst constitutional crisis and scandal in American history because they wanted to keep Trump from any political benefit. And let us not forget the past four months of desperate attempts to keep Kamala Harris afloat as Biden's last-minute replacement when that cover-up collapsed. Her word salads got treated as \"brat,\" her avoidance-tic cackling as \"joy,\" and her utter refusal to engage the media got ignored entirely while the media painted Trump as the one who would refuse accountability. \n\nThe Protection Racket Medis sold out completely, sucking up to Democrats on a scale and scope that had no precedent in modern American history. And yet, Trump managed to defeat the entire corrupt establishment. Now those same media outlets are having second thoughts about whoring themselves out to the Democrat-Academia elite clique, and Axios thinks that is a \"suck-up moment.\" Maybe they've just decided to stop sucking altogether in multiple senses of the word.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/12/23/axios-mainstream-media-enters-suck-up-moment-n3798162","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/ha/images/up/2024/348/14ad40a3-f472-45a5-974c-2f4050e67830.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:25:25","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":275672022,"title":"Floating the Unthinkable Considering What's Happened - Blanket Pardoning Illegals","text":"Everyone knows we have had an unnamed cabal running this White House since 20 January 2021. \n\nIt was as plain as the nose on POTATUS face from the moment he first hid in his basement - while DOCTOR Jill did campaign stops for him, and the ones he did attend were highly scripted events with twelve chairs set fifteen feet apart - that Biden was not all there and should not even be running, less mind elected president.\n\nBut our corrupt, corrosive press enabled lie after lie to live unabated and unanswered on the airwaves - actively encouraging the spread of ones helpful to the Biden campaign while ensuring the entombment and negation of any contrary stories, however well documented and sourced.

The billion-dollar company has recently been taking an active role in moving away from hot-button political issues in a way that seems to be signaling a change in priority. For example, the company confirmed to Fox News Digital on Tuesday that it would be removing a transgender storyline from the upcoming animated Pixar series \"Win or Lose.\" \"When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline,\" a spokesman said. DISNEY-DESANTIS SETTLEMENT HUMILIATES PAST PRO-DISNEY HEADLINES: MEDIA 'AS USUAL' WERE WRONG This contrasted what had been seen as a focus on diversity and inclusion in its films over the past few years, which some have credited with its string of box office flops and disappointments in 2023. As it has begun seeing more success with non-political films such as \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" and the recent \"Moana 2,\" experts believe this could be a shift back to entertainment. \"Disney provides a product: entertainment,\" Charles Elson, a former director at the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told the Los Angeles Times. \"It shouldn’t be about politics.\" Beyond entertainment, Disney has been cited as a factor behind ABC News’ recent settlement with President-elect Donald Trump earlier this month. Trump sued the news company, owned by Disney, for defamation after host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly claimed on-air that he was found \"liable for rape\" when he was in fact held liable for \"sexual abuse,\" which has a different definition under New York law. Rather than continue with a costly trial, ABC News and Trump came to an agreement with ABC News paying $15 million to a Trump presidential foundation and museum as well as $1 million in legal fees. This move faced backlash from more liberal commentators who believed the company was caving to Trump. \"When you get into politics, you are making a statement,\" Elson said. \"And when you get out, that also becomes a statement.\" \"You don’t want to get in a fight with the head of a government that regulates you,\" he added. \"Politics is bad for business.\" DISNEY FILES MOTION TO DISMISS LAWSUIT FROM 'STAR WARS' ACTRESS GINA CARANO, CITING FIRST AMENDMENT The sentiment was shared by CEO Bob Iger in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. \"I think the noise is sort of quieted down.

They need to be entertaining, and where the Disney company can have a positive impact on the world, whether it’s, you know, fostering acceptance and understanding of people of all different types, great.\" \"But generally speaking, we need to be an entertainment-first company,\" he added.

Among the committee findings, in the report released Monday, were that Gaetz paid $US90,000 ($A144,437) to 12 women, a substantial portion of which the panel found was likely for either sexual activity or drug use. Gaetz, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned from the House of Representatives last month after he was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to be attorney general. He withdrew from consideration in the face of an uphill confirmation battle in the Senate. The release of the report came despite a last-minute legal challenge from Gaetz in federal court in Washington, DC, in which he argued that the ethics panel no longer had jurisdiction after Gaetz resigned from Congress. That did not stop the committee from its decision to make the 37-page report public. \"The committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report stated in its conclusion. While Gaetz was found to have been involved in transporting women across state lines for the purposes of commercial sex, the panel said it did not find evidence that any of the women were under 18 at the time of travel. \"Nor did the committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion,\" the report said. However, someone identified as \"Victim A\" told the panel of twice having sex with Gaetz at a party in 2017 while she was underage, receiving a $400 cash payment that she understood to be for sex. At the time, the victim had just completed her junior year of high school. She testified that she did not inform Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age. The committee did not receive any evidence indicating that Gaetz was aware that she was a minor when he had sex with her. Gaetz denied in a written submission to the panel that he had sex with anyone under the age of 18, but did not address the specific allegations related to \"Victim A,\" according to the report. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Gaetz for comment. The move to make the report public was not unanimous. Chairman Michael Guest said in a dissenting statement that the committee&apos;s findings were not being challenged, but that the panel was deviating from \"well-established standards\" in releasing a report on a former member of the House. \"The Committee&apos;s position regarding its lack of authority over former members represents a clear, well-established policy rather than an isolated interpretation,\" Gaetz&apos;s lawyers wrote in a complaint seeking to block the release of the report. Gaetz lawyers said the report would contain \"untruthful and defamatory information\" about Gaetz. A federal judge had not yet ruled on Gaetz&apos;s request at the time the report was published. Gaetz was the subject of a three-year FBI investigation into allegations of sex trafficking that produced no criminal charges.

We don't necessarily follow or look for those remarks and our team right now is focused on modernizing the treaty...as soon as we can.\"\n\nB.C. energy minister Adrian Dix, who was also in virtual attendance, concurred.\n\n\"I think what we have to do, and what we have to continue to do, is do the work of defending Canadian interests, Columbia Basin interests, British Columbia interests, and not be distracted in that work by the political discussions of the time,\" Dix said.\n\nThe info session also included representation from Columbia Basin MLAs, the Province of B.C. as well as Indigenous representatives from the Syilx Okanagan and Ktunaxa Nations.\n\nOriginally ratified in 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was a water management agreement between the two countries that focused on downstream flood control management and power generation. \n\nThe treaty facilitated the creation of three dams in B.C. — Mica, Duncan and Keenleyside — as well the Libby dam in Montana.\n\nHowever, when it was drafted, it was essentially done without any input from Indigenous Nations, as the resulting reservoirs flooded out Indigenous territory, affecting cultural, heritage and ecological values.\n\nAmong the key elements of a modernized treaty is a focus on ecosystem function and re-framing the agreement to treating the Columbia River as a one-river system that flows over traditional Indigenous territory and a number of federal and state jurisdictions.\n\nThat effort has been led by Indigenous governments in both countries. \n\nThe Secwépemc, Syilx Okanagan and Ktunaxa Nations were invited to participate as official observers with the Canadian delegation in 2018, and led the focus on ecosystem function along with U.S.-based Indigenous governments.\n\nDuring the info session, Jay Johnson, the lead negotiator for the Syilx Okanagan Nation, reflected on the significance of Indigenous participation in the treaty modernization efforts.\n\n\"This is a pretty profoundly important journey that we are on right now in that never in the history of the contemporary world have Indigenous communities had a voice directly at the table in international bilateral negotiations,\" Johnson said, \"and both governments had the foresight and the understanding to include the three Nations and the Untied States to include the U.S. tribes in helping to shape and form and participate in the negotiations and that's a pretty important step in the journey of reconciliation.\"\n\nMajor elements of the new AIP include increased domestic flexibility for the Canadian treaty dams, particularly for ecosystem and Indigenous values. Additionally, a new flood-risk management regime replaces the existing one, as the U.S. will now pay Canada $37.6 million (USD) indexed to inflation until 2044. Canada will receive an additional $16.6 million (USD) in recognition of other benefits that the U.S. receives due to Canada's operations of the three treaty dams.\n\nThe Canadian Entitlement is the share of the power benefit by coordinating flows in the three Canadian reservoirs for incremental power generation above and beyond what's already generated in the U.S. However, for every million-acre feet that is used for Canadian flexibility, the Entitlement will be reduced by 6.5 per cent, as there is no corresponding power benefit to the U.S.\n\nOther elements of the modernized AIP include an Indigenous and Tribal advisory body, salmon reintroduction and ensuring flows for salmon and a transboundary Kootenay/Kootenai working group.\n\nBefore the treaty is finalized, it must pass approvals processes federally in both Canada and the U.S., as well as in British Columbia.\n\nWith files from Lauren Collins","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/news/columbia-river-treaty-talks-continue-amid-incoming-trump-presidency-7726372","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/arrowlakes/import/2018-06/12455237_web1_treatpic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:20:23","author":"Trevor Crawley","authors":["Trevor Crawley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.227},{"id":275671292,"title":"Bank of Canada watching economy closely after half-point rate cut","text":"The Bank of Canada’s governing council expects its second straight outsized interest rate cut helped it turn a corner in its fight to tame inflation, but it is watching the economy closely amid weaker than expected growth. \n\nThe central bank’s summary of deliberations released Monday offers a glimpse into the council’s discussions in the lead up to the Dec. 11 rate cut, which lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point.\n\nMembers considered only cutting by a quarter-point, but ultimately brought the rate down to 3.25 per cent in a bid to bring it closer to its so called neutral rate, where it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic growth.\n\nThey noted that lower immigration targets are likely to weigh on economic growth next year and that tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump are a “major new source of uncertainty.”\n\nCouncil members also said they’d be considering further rate cuts, but would be taking a more gradual approach given the five consecutive cuts since June, and giving the economy time to respond to them.\n\nThe next rate decision and quarterly economic forecast are scheduled for Jan. 29.","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/national-news/bank-of-canada-watching-economy-closely-after-half-point-rate-cut-7727258","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241223131244-20241223131216-dfb097799665930c2f59c2c0609a29ecb2daa3b3c3d42cdb9f88fb1804bb4ac2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:20:23","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":275671280,"title":"Green Party’s Elizabeth May reflects on unprecedented week in Canadian politics","text":"Elizabeth May says in all her years on Parliament Hill she has never seen anything like the last week in Canadian politics.\n\nIn a year-end interview with The Canadian Press, May — now in her 13th year as the B.C. MP for Saanich—Gulf Islands — spoke about the bombshell events on Parliament Hill, the parliamentary stalemate that has paralyzed the House of Commons for months and her thoughts on the fate of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal leadership.\n\nOttawa was sent reeling last Monday as Chrystia Freeland resigned as finance minister, mere hours before she was scheduled to deliver the important fall economic statement in the House of Commons.\n\nWhile the ongoing privilege debate isn’t, in May’s view, necessarily unprecedented, Freeland’s resignation and the ensuing chaos in the House of Commons is something she says she has never witnessed before.\n\n“Chrystia Freeland’s resignation letter was the equivalent of pulling a pin out of a grenade, throwing it in the room, shutting the door,” May said.\n\n“It’s, I think, quite plausibly the beginning of her campaign for Liberal leadership.”\n\nAfter House Speaker Greg Fergus paused the ongoing privilege debate to allow the fiscal update to be tabled, May said it was utter confusion in the House around what was supposed to happen next after Freeland’s resignation.\n\nGovernment House Leader Karina Gould tabled the document, but since there was no speech to be read with it, there was no opportunity for parties to respond — even though many of them had already read it under embargo.\n\n“I remember Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and that horrible teacher saying ‘Anyone? Anyone?’ I mean, Greg Fergus was really frozen in time,” May said.\n\n“It wasn’t at all clear that there was (going to be a presentation). And then Karina Gould deposited it, but didn’t speak to it. We’ve never seen anything like that in parliamentary democracy in Canada.”\n\nAmid growing calls from his caucus to step down, Trudeau shuffled his cabinet on Friday, bringing in eight new ministers. Several members of his inner circle have said he is taking time to reflect on what he has heard and to determine his next steps.\n\nWhile the Conservative, NDP and Bloc Québécois leaders have also come out calling on Trudeau to step down, May told The Canadian Press there are two ways to answer the question about his future: as a party leader, and as a Canadian.\n\n“In the course of Canadian democracy, my job is to be leader of the Green Party of Canada, and I see that job as trying to be the grown-up in the room in any set of circumstances,” May said, adding that Greens “don’t take partisan cheap shots.”\n\n“If I were in his shoes, I would have stepped down a long time ago. But I’m not in his shoes. I’m not leader of the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party’s fortunes in the next election aren’t my problem.”\n\nAs a Canadian, May said in the face of looming tariff threats and unprecedented “Canada-bashing” by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump, it’s important to show unity as a country.\n\n“For myself, I think: It’s up to Justin Trudeau what he does, and it’s up to the Liberal Party what it does,” May said.\n\n“I don’t know what business it is of any of (the party leaders) to help the Liberal Party out by pointing out the obvious: Justin Trudeau isn’t a popular leader. You’d be better off without him. But that’s their business.”\n\nReflecting on the ongoing privilege debate in the House of Commons, May said there is a potential resolution: the Liberals should turn over the documents.\n\nAt issue is a Conservative Party motion to press the Liberals to hand over documents relating to hundreds of millions of dollars of misspending on a green-tech fund to allow the RCMP to investigate the matter.\n\nAll parties have demanded the Liberals turn them over, but the Conservatives have effectively filibustered their own motion to make it happen — and prevented any other work from proceeding since privilege debates take precedence over almost all else.\n\n“The house has requested the documentation. However many boxes there are of unredacted documents, however helpful or useless to law enforcement is irrelevant. The house has requested it. They should be turned over,” May said, adding she would also support a motion to end debate.\n\nOn climate, May reiterated her support for the carbon tax saying it’s one policy the Liberals have implemented which has succeeded in reducing emissions in Canada. Though she says the pricing policy has been made unpopular by “sloganeering” — in reference to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s “axe the tax” refrain.\n\nStill, May reiterated how Canada is the worst performer among G7 countries at living up to its climate commitments.\n\nShe pointed to a recent example of the government pushing its goal for a net-zero electricity grid to 2050 — a move she called “inexcusable.”\n\nMay believes Trump will once again pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, as he did during his first presidency.\n\n“What Pierre Poilievre does, no one knows,” May said.\n\n“Because they say they believe in climate change, and they believe in technology, not taxes, but that’s not a coherent plan either. Meanwhile, the world is moving, but too slowly.”\n\nAs for her own party’s priorities, May said heading into an election year the goal is to make gains for the Greens, but also to improve voter turnout which has steadily declined since the Liberals won in 2015 from 68.3 per cent, down to 62.6 per cent in 2021.\n\n“There’s a steady drumbeat of inevitability of assuming the polling numbers accurately predict what’s going to happen in an election,” May said, pointing to Doug Ford’s strong polling numbers in 2022 as a factor in Ontario’s historically low turnout in its last election.\n\n“That’s a huge worry for Canadian democracy. Particularly for young people who are the least likely to vote. So how do we turn that around for the people who have the most at stake — who are young people.”","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/national-news/green-partys-elizabeth-may-reflects-on-unprecedented-week-in-canadian-politics-7725769","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_241223-cpw-elizabeth-may-year-ender-may_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:20:23","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":275671420,"title":"Former Florida Congressmen Matt Gaetz’s political future uncertain after House Ethics report released","text":"(WSVN) - After the House Ethics Committee released their report on former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, some are wondering what’s next for the former congressman.\n\nWhile he’s getting ready to sit in the anchor chair for his OANN TV show early next year, he’s hinted at several political offices he may be interested in.\n\nThe 42-year-old former congressman remains an active force in Republican politics.\n\nOver the weekend, he made a comment at a conservative conference in Phoenix that could give a preview of his political future.\n\n“My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee. Maybe I’ll just run for Marco Rubio’s vacant seat in the United States Senate and enjoy some of those folks,” he said.\n\nCurrent Florida Senator Rubio will resign his seat next month to go through the confirmation process to become President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of state.\n\n7News political analyst Brian Fonseca said that while a Florida Senate appointment could be a tough sell for Gaetz, it’s not impossible.\n\n“I think Gaetz’s shot at the senate is going to be an incredible uphill battle if he decides to take that on. Much of that might rest on whether or not incoming President-elect Trump endorses Gaetz for the senate. The House Ethics Committee report was incredibly damaging,” said Fonseca.\n\nThe decision to replace Rubio, according to Florida law, falls on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ lap.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump withdrew her name from the short-list of potential appointees. On the social media platform, X, she posted in part:\n\n“After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate.”\n\nIn an unlikely but possible scenario, Fonseca said DeSantis could look at his political future outside of Tallahassee, as his current term is set to end in Jan. 2027.\n\n“One wild scenario was that DeSantis, who’s going to be termed out here in 2028, would ultimately step down as the governor Lt. Gov. (Jeanette) Nuñez would move into that seat and then (she) would appoint DeSantis,” said Fonseca.\n\nOther potential appointees said to be on DeSantis’ short-list include his lieutenant governor, Jeanette Nuñez, who like Rubio, is a Cuban American from South Florida. \n\nAdditional contenders being floated for Rubio’s replacement are Florida’s Attorney General Ashley Moody and the governor’s wife Casey Desantis.\n\nAlso on the shortlist is the governor’s chief of staff, James Uthmeier. Described as a trusted aide, he was promoted to campaign manager during DeSantis’ presidential run during the 2024 race.\n\nWhoever the governor picks will serve until a special election in 2026. Then, Florida voters will decide who serves out the last two years of Rubio’s term.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

But his resignation came after he was reelected to represent his district in Florida, and he and his allies have repeatedly floated the possibility of him going back to the House or running for a Florida Senate seat.\"I'm strongly urging Matt Gaetz to return to Congress, and on its first day next year, take a page from that old song, 'The Harper Valley PTA,' and expose all the hypocrites in the House [of Representatives] who have used tax money to cover up their sexual depravity,\" Bannon said on his podcast.He added that the report was a \"nothingburger\" and that \"if there was anything there, the DOJ would have come after Gaetz,\" referring to the Department of Justice.He also said of Congress: \"Screw their rules. Screw them. They have destroyed this country and Gaetz has to come back.\"What To KnowThe former Florida congressman, turned attorney general nominee, turned right-wing media host made a similar suggestion last week after the House Ethics Committee voted to release its report on Gaetz's conduct.He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that he would \"take the oath\" to serve in the next Congress and then file \"a privileged motion to expose every 'me too' settlement paid using public funds (even of former members).\"Bannon on Monday said Gaetz should follow through with that threat, adding that if the former congressman moves forward with hosting a primetime show on One America News Network, it would be admitting defeat.\"God, this is so obvious,\" Bannon said. \"Take the Ethics report and shove it up your ass. That's what I think. Gaetz must return like Trump returns. We don't back down. Double down.\"Among other things, the ethics panel's report said Gaetz \"regularly\" paid women for sex from 2017 to 2020 and that he engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old in 2017.It also alleged that Gaetz \"used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, on multiple occasions\" between 2017 and 2019.The former Florida lawmaker is further accused of accepting gifts exceeding the amount that members of Congress are permitted to receive, and having his chief of staff help a woman he was sexually involved with obtain a passport by falsely claiming to the State Department that she was a constituent.Gaetz \"knowingly and willfully\" tried to obstruct the House Ethics Committee's investigation into his conduct, the report said, and he \"acted in a manner that reflects discreditably upon the House.\"Gaetz responded to the report on X after it was released on Monday.\"Giving funds to someone you are dating - that they didn't ask for - and that isn't 'charged' for sex is now prostitution?!? There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses,\" he wrote.Gaetz's legal team filed a lawsuit earlier in a last-ditch effort to block the committee from releasing its report. In court filings, the former congressman's lawyers argued the House Ethics Committee didn't have jurisdiction over Gaetz since he resigned from Congress last month after President-elect Donald Trump nominated him for attorney general.Gaetz's legal team dropped the lawsuit after the ethics panel publicly distributed the report.What People Are SayingJoel Leppard, an attorney representing women who testified about Gaetz's conduct, said in a statement: \"The House Ethics Committee's thorough investigation and detailed findings vindicate my clients' accounts and demonstrate their credibility. We appreciate the Committee's commitment to transparency in releasing this comprehensive report so the truth can be known.\"Representative Michael Guest, chairman of the House Ethics Committee, dissented from the panel's decision to release the report: It \"breaks from the Committee's long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponize the Committee's process.\"Gaetz's legal team said Monday evening that he suffered serious political and reputational damage as a result of the report's release: \"Due to the Defendant's unprecedented and procedurally defective decision to publicize the Report ... Plaintiff has now suffered irreversible and irreparable harm. As such, Plaintiff concurs that the instant action has been mooted and the Court now lacks subject matter jurisdiction to order the previously requested relief.\"Gaetz floated the idea of running for Senate at a Turning Point event on Sunday: \"It seems I may not have had enough support in the United States Senate. Maybe I'll just run for Marco Rubio's vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks.\"What Comes NextGaetz has repeatedly and fervently denied the allegations against him.It remains to be seen whether he will follow through with his plan to host a primetime talk show on OAN or try to shake things up in Congress as Trump takes office.","summary":"Bannon threw his weight behind Matt Gaetz, telling him to go back to Congress and expose lawmakers' \"sexual depravity.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-matt-gaetz-house-ethics-report-congress-2005459","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2550688/matt-gaetz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:14:04","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":275670356,"title":"Trump Says US Ownership Of Greenland Absolutely Necessary, Nation Responds","text":"Greenland is not for sale, its elected leader said on Monday, responding to comments made by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump regarding the \"ownership and control\" of the vast Arctic island that has been part of Denmark for over 600 years.\n\n\"Greenland is ours.

They also found that Gaetz “knowingly and willfully sought to impede and obstruct” the committee’s work.\n\n“The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,” the report states.\n\nAhead of the report’s release Gaetz denied any wrongdoing and criticized the committee’s process.\n\n“Giving funds to someone you are dating — that they didn’t ask for — and that isn’t ‘charged’ for sex is now prostitution?!?” he posted on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. “There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.”\n\nGaetz, a Republican first elected in 2017, spent the majority of his time in Washington enmeshed in scandals that ultimately derailed his nomination by President-elect Donald Trump as attorney general. His political future is uncertain, although Gaetz has indicated he would be interested in running for the open Senate seat in Florida.\n\nRELATED | Gaetz withdraws as Trump’s pick for attorney general\n\nLawmakers paint a damning portrait of Gaetz’s conduct, using dozens of pages of exhibits, including text messages and financial records, travel receipts, checks and online payments, to document a party- and drug-fueled lifestyle. The committee said it compiled the evidence after issuing 29 subpoenas for documents and testimony and contacting more than two dozen witnesses.\n\nIn addition to soliciting prostitution, the Ethics Committee report states that Gaetz “accepted gifts, including transportation and lodging in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, in excess of permissible amounts.”\n\nThat same year, investigators say Gaetz arranged for his chief of staff to obtain a passport for a woman he was sexually involved with, falsely telling the State Department that she was his constituent.\n\nIn some of the text exchanges, Gaetz appears to be inviting various women to events, getaways or parties, and arranging airplane travel and lodging. At one point he asks one woman if she has a “cute black dress” to wear. There are also discussions of shipping goods.\n\nOne of the exhibits is a text exchange that appears to be between two of the women concerned about their cash flow and payments. In another, a person asks Gaetz for help to pay an educational expense.\n\nRegarding the 17-year-old girl, the report states there’s no evidence that Gaetz knew she was a minor when he had sex with her, the committee said. The woman told the committee she didn’t tell Gaetz she was under 18 at the time and that he didn’t know how old she was.\n\nRather, the committee said Gaetz learned she was a minor more than a month after the party. But he stayed in touch with her after that and met up with her for “commercial sex” again less than six months after she turned 18, according to the committee.\n\nBut Florida law, which states it is a felony for a person 24 or older to have sex with a minor, does not allow a claim of ignorance or misrepresentation of a minor’s age as a defense.\n\nJoel Leppard, who represents two women who told the committee that Gaetz paid them for sex, said the findings “vindicate” the accounts of his clients and “demonstrate their credibility.”\n\n“We appreciate the Committee’s commitment to transparency in releasing this comprehensive report so the truth can be known,” Leppard said in a statement.\n\nAt least one Republican joined all five Democrats on the Ethics Committee earlier this month in voting to release the report about their former colleague despite initial opposition from GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to publishing findings about a former member of Congress.\n\nWhile ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare.\n\nOn behalf of the Republicans who voted against releasing the report, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, Ethics chairman, wrote that while the members do not challenge the report’s findings, “we take great exception that the majority deviated from the Committee’s well-established standards,” to drop any investigation when a person is not longer a member of the chamber.\n\n“We believe that operating outside the jurisdictional bounds set forth by House Rules and Committee standards, especially when making public disclosures, is a dangerous departure with potentially catastrophic consequences,” Guest wrote.\n\nMounting a last-ditch effort to halt the publication of the report, Gaetz filed a lawsuit Monday asking a court to intervene, citing what he called “untruthful and defamatory information” that would “significantly damage” his “standing and reputation in the community.” Gaetz’s complaint argues he’s no longer under the committee’s jurisdiction since he resigned from Congress.\n\n“The Committee’s position that it may nonetheless publish potentially defamatory findings about a private citizen over whom it claims no jurisdiction represents an unprecedented expansion of Congressional power that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,” Gaetz’s lawyers wrote in their request for a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe often secretive, bipartisan panel has investigated claims against Gaetz since 2021. But its work became more urgent last month when Trump picked him shortly after Election Day as his first choice to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer. Gaetz resigned from Congress that same day, putting him outside the purview of the Ethics Committee’s jurisdiction.\n\nBut Democrats had pressed to make the report public even after Gaetz was no longer a member and had withdrawn as Trump’s pick to lead the Justice Department. A vote on the House floor this month to force the report’s release failed; all but one Republican voted against it.\n\nThe committee detailed its start-and-stop investigation over the past several years, which was halted for a time as the Justice Department conducted its own probe of Gaetz. Federal prosecutors never brought a case against him.\n\nLawmakers said they asked the Justice Department for information about its probe, but the agency refused to hand over information, saying it doesn’t disclose information about investigations that don’t result in charges.\n\nThe committee then subpoenaed the Justice Department for records, but after a back-and-forth between Justice Department officials and the committee, the department only handed over “publicly reported information about the testimony of a deceased individual,” according to the report.\n\n“To date, DOJ has provided no meaningful evidence or information to the Committee or cited any lawful basis for its responses,” the committee said.\n\nIn releasing the report, the panel added that Gaetz was also “uncooperative” throughout the probe. He provided “minimal documentation” in response to the committee’s requests, it said. “He also did not agree to a voluntary interview.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.nation.lk/online/house-ethics-committee-accuses-gaetz-of-regularly-paying-for-sex-including-with-17-year-old-girl-289167.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gaetz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-24 00:13:48","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer","authors":["Alanna Durkin Richer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.075}]}
