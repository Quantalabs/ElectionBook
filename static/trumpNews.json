After hours of peaceful demonstrations, dozens of protesters broke through part of the perimeter security fence, drawing riot police to the site, a Reuters witness said. The DNC security team did not respond to a request for comment on whether the protesters were arrested. \"Law enforcement personnel are currently on scene and more information will be provided when available,\" said a Chicago city spokesperson. Chanting intensified ahead of the fence breach, as protesters reached a neighborhood park on Chicago's West Side and paused to amplify their calls for a ceasefire. Amid the noise, the crowd turned its frustration toward Vice President Kamala Harris, referring to the Democratic candidate as \"Killer Kamala\". Chicago police formed a perimeter around the park on foot to contain protesters, with some police personnel on bikes. Still, the umbrella group \"March on the DNC\" drew fewer supporters than expected to a park outside the convention arena, hours before Biden was to address the gathering. They started a one-mile march near where Democratic delegates will nominate Harris as their candidate to face Republican Donald Trump in November's presidential election. Organizers had expected tens of thousands of protesters - enough to fill the park and the march route - Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesman for March on the DNC, said early Monday. By afternoon though, several thousand protesters had gathered for speeches and the park was only half full. The coalition of more than 200 groups includes those advocating for a variety of causes from reproductive rights to racial justice. Many people were coming from Palestinian and Arab communities in Illinois and neighboring states, organizers said last week. Roman Fritz, at 19 one of the youngest Wisconsin delegates, wore a scarf imprinted with the traditional Palestinian keffiyeh pattern. He planned to participate in the march but had no plans to disrupt the official events later, and said he supported Harris as the party nominee to beat Trump. Dozens of Muslim delegates and their allies, angry at U.S. support for Israel's offensive in Gaza, are seeking changes in the Democratic platform and plan to press for an arms embargo, putting the party on guard for disruptions to high-profile speeches at the convention. Some protesters were doubtful that the party will change its platform. \"It'll never happen,\" said Mwalimu Sundiata Keita, who traveled from Cincinnati, Ohio, to join the protest. \"It's the policy of the party to support Israel, and until that policy changes, that's the way it's going to be.\" Senan Shaqdeh, 54, a member of the executive committee of the Palestinian American Organizations Network, said additional buses from as far away as Florida were expected to deliver more protesters to the site of the march throughout the day. \"The Democratic Party should not expect business as usual,\" Shaqdeh said. Another large protest was scheduled for Thursday, when Harris is due to formally accept the nomination. Pro-Palestinian groups have for months protested the Biden administration's military and financial support for Israel during its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. Israel launched the offensive after it was attacked on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants who killed 1,200 people, according to Israel tallies. The protests swelled on U.S. college campuses in the spring, with police clearing student encampments, at times after confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters. \"The Democrats are the ones in power,\" Abudayyeh said on Monday. \"It's their war. They're responsible for it, they're complicit, and they can stop it.\" © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Thousands of mostly peaceful pro-Palestinian protesters marched in Chicago Monday as President Joe Biden arrived for the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, in a show of…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/thousands-march-against-gaza-war-at-democratic-convention","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/e1/50/e48d6e365376ed9646aa6702310b675f3385/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 00:00:33","author":"Andrea Shalal,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Andrea Shalal","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254470482,"title":"Trump makes his first appearance at the DNC—and boy, is it ugly","text":"Remember when Donald Trump was president, the entire world shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and his way of dealing with the deaths of a thousand Americans every day was a big shrug?

The sovereign, who hosted the ex-US president twice during her reign, is said to have ‘particularly disliked’ the way he looked over her shoulder as if ‘in search of others more interesting’. She also mused over his relationship with his wife Melania and said she believed they must have ‘some sort of arrangement’. The astonishing claims are made by Craig Brown in his new book, A Voyage Around The Queen, which is being serialised in the Daily Mail. He reports the conversation occurred at a lunch ‘weeks after’ one of Mr Trump’s visits. In his final serialisation instalment today, Brown writes: ‘Over the course of her reign, Her Majesty entertained many controversial foreign leaders, including Bashar al-Assad, Robert Mugabe, Idi Amin, Donald Trump, Emperor Hirohito and Vladimir Putin. ‘She may not have found their company convivial; upon their departure, she may even have voiced a discreet word of disapproval. ‘A few weeks after President Trump’s visit, for instance, she confided in one lunch guest that she found him “very rude”: she particularly disliked the way he couldn’t stop looking over her shoulder, as though in search of others more interesting. ‘She also believed President Trump “must have some sort of arrangement” with his wife Melania, or else why would she have remained married to him? ‘For his part, Donald Trump was confident he had been her favourite guest ever. “There are those that say they have never seen the Queen have a better time, a more animated time,” he later told America’s Fox News.’ Buckingham Palace has not commented on the claim as they do not, by convention, comment on books or biographies generally. The fascinating account will no doubt come as a blow to Mr Trump, who is currently seeking re-election as President. He adored Queen Elizabeth and has spoken openly of his admiration for her personally, and for her sense of duty. She first met him in 2018, a year after he was inaugurated as the 45th US President. The visit was mired in controversy with protesters in the streets of London and a giant ‘baby blimp’ – a balloon depicting Mr Trump as a baby – given permission to float in the air. As a result of his political toxicity it was not a ‘state visit’ but classed as a ‘working visit’, which meant little in the way of pomp and pageantry and no state banquet. His meeting with the Queen instead took place over tea at Windsor Castle, with notably no other senior royals present, but did involve the inspection of a guard of honour. Memorably, Mr Trump was said to have kept the then 92-year-old monarch waiting for ten minutes in 27C (80F) heat and repeatedly walked in front of her as they inspected the guard of honour, leaving her trailing behind. He then abruptly stopped and forced her to sidestep to get alongside him. However President Trump did get his much longed for State Visit the following year. He was clearly on his best behaviour, determined not to embarrass himself in front of his host. In return the Queen invited his four children and their spouses to the State Banquet. The trip was blunder-free until he gave a toast praising her as a ‘great, great woman’ and placed his hand on her back – breaking protocol. Mr Trump also joined the Queen at an event in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. He later boasted to Fox News of his ‘great relationship with the Queen’, saying: ‘We were laughing and having fun. And her people said she hasn’t had so much fun in 25 years. ‘Then I got criticised for it because they said we were having too much fun… I feel I know her so well and she certainly knows me very well right now, but we have a very good relationship with the United Kingdom.’ Buckingham Palace sources have said he was a ‘model’ guest who was polite and charming to staff. When Queen Elizabeth died he issued a statement saying: ‘Melania and I are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.’ He said he and his wife would ‘always cherish our time together with the Queen, and never forget Her Majesty’s generous friendship, great wisdom, and wonderful sense of humour’. He added: ‘What a grand and beautiful lady she was – there was nobody like her! Our thoughts and prayers will remain with the great people of the United Kingdom as you honour her most meaningful life and exceptional service.’ Former White House adviser Fiona Hill later wrote that Mr Trump was ‘awestruck’ by the Queen, and saw a meeting with her as a sign that he ‘had made it in life’. She said he often referred in conversation to his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was originally from Scotland, and her admiration for the monarch. He also said in an interview ahead of their first meeting: ‘I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well. ‘If you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don’t see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman.’ Asked later by interviewer Piers Morgan whether he got the feeling she liked him, he said: ‘Well, I don’t want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot.’ The late Queen was renowned for her discretion over her reign, where her unique brand of ‘soft diplomacy’ was used by successive governments to great effect. And it has long been a proud part of her legacy that no one knows much of what she thought about anything or anyone. In 2016, however, Buckingham Palace reacted angrily over a leaked conversation in which it was claimed that she ‘backed Brexit’. They complained about a story in The Sun newspaper which claimed she told former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg at a lunch in 2011 that she thought Europe was going in the wrong direction. A mortified David Cameron was also forced to apologise in 2014 after he told the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that she ‘purred down the line’ when he informed her Scotland had voted against independence. He said he felt ‘extremely sorry and very embarrassed’ in publicly confirming her delight on the referendum result over whether Scotland should remain in the UK. His remarks – which should have remained private – were picked up by a microphone.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth found Donald Trump &#8216;very rude&#8217;, a sensational new biography of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New book reveals Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s astonishing remark about Donald Trump being rude and suspected a special agreement with Melania. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-book-reveals-queen-elizabeth-iis-astonishing-remark-about-donald-trump-being-rude-and-suspected-a-special-agreement-with-melania/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/20/00/88699529-13758993-Queen_Elizabeth_II_sits_with_Donald_Trump_at_an_event_to_commemo-a-63_1724108452301.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:52:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":254470232,"title":"Democrats approve DNC party platform that hasn’t been updated since Biden dropped out","text":"CHICAGO — Delegates at the Democratic National Convention voted Monday to approve the 2024 party platform, coalescing around a vision for the next four years that had already been written before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. The 92-page document, passed in a largely ceremonial voice vote, repeatedly highlights Biden’s positions and achievements, which may differ slightly from Harris’s. The document was approved by the platform committee on July 16, less than a week after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. The platform also mentions Biden’s “second term” 20 times, emphasizing the recency of the campaign shake-up. “It makes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden and Vice President Harris have accomplished hand-in-hand, and offers a vision for a progressive agenda that we can build on as a nation and as a Party as we head into the next four years,” the Democratic National Committee said in a press release. The platform notably does not mention an arms embargo on Israel, a demand made by uncommitted delegates in addition to the thousands of protesters rallying outside the secure zone near the arena where delegates and officials are gathering. The protests come against the backdrop of developments in negotiations for a ceasefire for the war in Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday Israel had accepted the United State’s ceasefire proposal. The next step is for Hamas to accept, with further negotiations expected to take place later in the week. The document emphasizes a “strong, secure and democratic Israel is vital to the interests of the United States” while also committing to Israel’s security and right to defend itself. The platform also notes Biden’s support for a foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine that was passed by Congress earlier this year, which included $17 billion in security aid for the Jewish state. It also discusses a two-state solution after Gaza is reconstructed “in a manner that does not allow Hamas to rearm.” “It would create the conditions for a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom, and ultimately a state of their own — a contrast to [former president Donald] Trump, who refuses to endorse the political aspirations of the Palestinian people.” “There’s some language in the platform that we find helpful, some language that we don’t,” said Abbas Alawieh, a DNC uncommitted delegate from Michigan, mentioning efforts by progressive activists to add a clause to the party platform rejecting U.S. aid to Israel. “What is more important to us is what Vice President Harris leads us towards now that she is the candidate,” Alawieh said. “That platform had been worked on before the Vice President was the candidate. We need to hear from her how she plans to differentiate her policy from the disastrous policy of the last 10 months, and importantly, from … Trump’s very destructive plans.” Harris has offered a more sympathetic tone, acknowledging the suffering of both the Israeli and Palestinian people during a solo meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, pledging not to “look away in the face of these tragedies.” Even some delegates who are supporting the Harris-Walz ticket hoped there would be some changes to the platform now that Biden is no longer at the top of the ticket. “I think it’s important to emphasize that what we are asking for is an arms embargo, and that is the best move for the Harris campaign politically,” said Liano Sharon, a Michigan delegate from Lansing. “There’s tons of data that demonstrates that the people in the country want an arms embargo.” This platform specifically mentions building on the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations brokered by the Trump administration. The document now notes that Biden wants to build on it through a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Many Democratic delegates are satisfied with the language even though Biden is no longer at the top of the ticket. “Joe Biden has made it clear from day one, he’s not a Jew, but he is a Zionist,” said Daniel Hernandez, an Arizona delegate. “I think for us, we have seen unprecedented levels of support for the State of Israel and for their security.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “I think that’s the takeaway message here, that the Democratic party and Joe Biden and the Biden Harris administration and now the Harris-Walz future administration hopefully will continue to be a strong partner with our one ally in the Middle East,” Hernandez said.

Key Background On Aug. 10, the Trump campaign said it was the victim of a hack “from foreign sources hostile to the United States” and pointed to a Microsoft report published shortly before then that found Iran-affiliated groups are engaging in disinformation and hacking to interfere in the upcoming election. At the time the Trump campaign first blamed Iran for its hack, it did not present evidence, but the Microsoft report had identified a spear-phishing email sent in June to a high-ranking official of an unnamed presidential campaign. Politico first reported the hack after it began receiving emails from an “anonymous account with documents from inside Trump’s operation,” including a research document from February labeled “potential vulnerabilities” on Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who was later named Trump’s running mate. The FBI confirmed to multiple outlets last Monday it was investigating the hack after the Trump team alleged Iran was behind it, but gave few details into its investigation. Big Number 3. That’s at least how many staffers on the Biden-Harris campaign received phishing emails that were designed to gain access to the recipients’ communications before Vice President Kamala Harris took over the campaign, The Washington Post reported. Investigators reportedly did not find any of the attempts had been successful. Tangent The intelligence community noted the tactics used by Iran in the hack were “not new.” The statement continued: “Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world,” likely referencing the 2016 presidential election, when officials said Russian hackers obtained thousands of emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign that they ultimately released on a website with the intention of helping Trump win the White House.

(Photo by MIKE SEGAR/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) POOL/AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The platform—which was approved by the party platform committee July 16, five days before Biden dropped out—is written as though Biden is still the presumptive nominee and details a continuation of his policies, mentioning the president nearly 300 times, compared to just over two dozen mentions of Harris. Much of the document is dedicated to criticizing former President Donald Trump and drawing a contrast between him and Biden—Trump’s name appears 150 times in document, which states the former president “has a very different vision” from Democrats, “one focused . . . on revenge and retribution, not on the American people, but on himself.” The platform reiterates Biden’s call for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and touts his push for an “immediate and lasting ceasefire deal” to end the war between Israel and Hamas, along with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people and a $14 billion aid package for Israel that Biden signed into law, but it does not mention an arms embargo on Israel—a key demand for pro-Palestinian protesters and the “uncommitted” delegates who opposed Biden’s nomination in protest of his Israel-Hamas war policies. The platform repeats Democrats’ push for a $15 minimum wage for all workers and highlights the increase in minimum wage under Biden to $17.20 an hour for federal contractors, along with his administration’s proposal for a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers—Harris on Friday proposed up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. It calls for a minimum 25% income tax rate for billionaires and promises to tamp down on life insurance “tax shelters” and various other tax loopholes used by wealthy Americans, while “reviving [IRS] enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats.” The platform vows to protect access to abortion by fighting restrictions in court, easing access to abortion medication and supporting abortion-related legal defense services, while attacking Trump for his role in Roe v. Wade’s reversal, alleging he “undermined access to contraception as president” and “opened the door to laws that rip away access” to in vitro fertilization. What To Watch For Biden’s daughter, Ashley Biden, is expected to introduce her father ahead of his speech at the DNC on Monday. Harris and First Lady Jill Biden are expected to join the president onstage. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will also speak on opening night. Key Background The convention convenes in Chicago less than a month after Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and Harris became the party’s presumptive nominee. More than 99% of delegates formally voted to place her and vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the top of the ticket on Aug. 6 in a virtual roll call—a formality typically reserved for the convention, though Democrats will still hold a ceremonial roll call to recognize Harris and Walz’s nomination. The convention comes as Democrats have been reenergized by Harris’ entrance into the race following weeks of division and panic in the wake of Biden’s June 27 debate with Trump.

Although the Trump campaign and private-sector cybersecurity investigators had previously said Iran was behind the hacking attempts, it was the first time the U.S. government had assigned blame for the attack. The joint statement from the FBI and other federal agencies also indicated that Iran was responsible for attempts to hack Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying hackers had “sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaign of both political parties.” The goal of the hacking and other activities, federal officials said, was not only to sow discord but also to shape the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be “particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests.” “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement, which in addition to the FBI was also released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies like Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign agents’ attempts to interfere in this year’s election, and Google, which separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since May.

While the opposing party gathers in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention Aug. 19–22, the Republican presidential team, Trump and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), “will bring their America First message to voters,” a news release said. In addition, Trump surrogates will conduct daily press conferences in Chicago to get out their side of the story, the campaign said, and other events will be held in various swing states. “As they meet Americans where they are in battleground states across the country, President Trump and Senator Vance will remind voters that under their leadership, we can end inflation, protect our communities from violent criminals, secure the border, and Make America Great Again,” campaign spokespersons Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a news release. The Trump campaign continues to point out that their political opponents—Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz—have held no news conferences in nearly a month since they emerged as the opposing party’s presidential ticket. Republicans chose Trump and Vance as the candidates at their party’s convention in Milwaukee last month, days after Trump survived an assassination attempt. “As he demonstrated tremendous strength and resolve following an attempt on his life, President Trump’s convention focused on the policies and leadership to which Americans are desperate to return,” the Trump campaign said. Each day this week, the campaign will focus on a different theme. On Aug. 19, Trump and Vance will both campaign in Pennsylvania and discuss how they'd “Make America Wealthy Again.” On Aug. 20, in Wisconsin, the theme will be their “Make America Safe Again” agenda. On Aug. 21, Trump and Vance will appear together in Asheboro, North Carolina, and speak about their plans to “Make America Strong Again.” On Aug. 22, Trump will go to the U.S.-Mexico border in Montezuma Pass, Arizona, while Vance will travel to Valdosta, Georgia, to talk about improving immigration policies to “Make America Secure Again.” On Aug. 23, Trump will hold a rally in Glendale, Arizona, and will also lead a “No Tax on Tips” session in Las Vegas.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump, his running mate, and their allies are “barnstorming” across battleground states this week, his campaign announced.

Doritos acquired. I got you, @KamalaHarris,” her running mate Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said in a social post with a video of him finding a bag of Doritos and handing it to her while at the Sheetz store. Another video circulated of Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, finding the Doritos bag first and handing it to her moments after entering the store. In the video of Walz handing her the Doritos bag, Emhoff is seen holding a Doritos bag while standing next to the vice president in an aisle, which has some critics speculating that Harris was filmed getting Doritos twice. “CAUGHT: The Kamala Doritos thing at Sheetz was so fake they filmed it twice, once with Doug, once with Tim. Notice on the ‘official’ clip Tim ‘finds’ her a bag but she’s already holding one. She forgot to put it down. Totally scripted,” one person on social media claimed, posting a montage of Harris getting Doritos with Walz and separately from Emhoff. Donald Trump Jr., son of Harris’s presidential election rival and former President Donald Trump, mocked Harris and Walz on social media. “Weird and cringe,” he said in his posting of Harris grabbing a Doritos bag from Walz. “Everything they do is fake. Nothing is genuine,” another person said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Did Kamala Harris just Google ‘most popular chip in America’ and click on the first result to launch her newfound obsession with Doritos or as she calls them ‘Door-Eat-Ohs’? She’s mentioned them twice in the past three days now,” another critic chimed in. The Harris campaign stop at Sheetz coincided with the convenience store chain being in the middle of a federal lawsuit from the Biden administration for allegedly discriminating against minority job applicants. When President Joe Biden was campaigning as the leading Democratic presidential candidate in April, he also did a photo op at a Pittsburgh-area Sheetz store before his administration hit the company with the lawsuit. Trump 2024 deputy communications director Caroline Sunshine remarked that no members of the press asked Harris any questions and called it overall “an odd video.” “What an odd video — looking for a bag of Doritos. I’m not sure Kamala Harris can tell you what the price of a bag of Doritos is,” Sunshine said on Fox News on Monday. The viral video of Harris’s Sheetz stop also follows her campaign releasing a fundraising email on Friday that tells the story of the vice president eating a family-sized bag of nacho Doritos after former President Donald Trump won in 2016. “I went home and I sat on the couch with a family-sized bag of nacho Doritos,” Harris said in the the campaign email. “I did not share one chip with anybody,” Harris continued in the fundraising email. “Not even [my husband] Doug [Emhoff]. I just watched the TV with utter shock and dismay. Two things are true eight years later: I still love Doritos and we still have not stopped fighting.” Former Fox News personality Elizabeth Hasselbeck ripped Harris for binge-eating Doritos in 2016 over Trump’s win. “That’s the emotional response of the leader of the free world? To binge eat a bag of Doritos? Are you kidding me?” Hasselbeck said. “Can you imagine Putin, how he deals with things? Chugging down a bag of Sour Patch Kids because he’s depressed about something not going his way?” On the Republican presidential campaign side, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), has received criticism from Harris supporters for enjoying Diet Mountain Dew. During Trump’s press conference on Thursday, Trump talked about enjoying Cheerios.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris made a stop at a Sheetz gas station convenience store while campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, and some critics are questioning the authenticity of her new obsession with the popular Doritos brand after two different videos began circulating on social media. &#8220;Every road trip needs a snack break.

During the song, Taylor made fans laugh as she suggested she felt 55,000 years old during the number. As the lyrics said 'I'm feeling 22', Taylor used her hands to mime the huge number - in a joke about the age she felt at the time. Wembley night seven also saw the return of a stunning gown for the Folklore era - which the star hadn't worn in 15 shows. The beautiful blue dress consisted of a satin skirt complete with a lace hem, as well as a fitted corset. It was finished with a diamond-encrusted sheer cape draped over the star's shoulders, with a train attached. Sadly Taylor wasn't blessed with the hot weather of recent days for her seventh show at the stadium, as the heavens opened. 'I think when it rains for more than like 6 MINUTES we can officially declare it a rain show!' she told fans as the rain poured down. Taylor gushed over her audience, hailing them the best view to see in the sight-seeing capital As is tradition with the megastar, a lucky young fan was ecstatic to receive the hat worn by Taylor during her track '22' 'You know out of all the sights in London you could come to see, I'm pretty sure this view I'm seeing right now is absolutely the best one!' Taylor told her adoring fans During the song, Taylor made fans laugh as she suggested she felt 55,000 years old during the number. Taylor hailed Maisie Peters 'the most amazing opening act possible' during night four of her Wembley run. The songstress, 34, praised Maisie, 24, as she took to the stage in London on Monday in front of 92,000 adoring fans. Admitting that she was a 'big fan,' Taylor applauded the English singer's writing skills and said she 'crushed it.' While Paramore will perform every night, Raye, Suki Waterhouse, Holly Humberstone, Sofia Isella and Maisie will play one night each. Halting a song to speak to the audience, Taylor said: 'The plan is that we going to have a great night. 'But you guys have already had a great night as you got to be absolutely dazzled by the most amazing opening act possible.' She continued: 'It's someone who I am such a big fan of, she is amazing, she is absolutely incredible, crushed it on this stage, love her songwriting so much! 'I am of course talking about the amazing Maisie Peters!' The songstress, 34, praised Maisie, 24, as she took to the stage in London on Monday in front of 92,000 adoring fans Admitting that she was a 'big fan,' Taylor applauded the English singer's writing skills and said she 'crushed it' (Maisie pictured at soundcheck) Eagle eyed fans spotted that actor - and T Swift's ex - Taylor Lautner was in attendance for the concert on Monday. The actor, 32, who dated the singer briefly back in 2009, was seen amongst the nearly 100,000 strong crowd as he took his seat. His appearance comes amid speculation that another former flame of Taylor's, Harry Styles, could also attend the show, after he was spotted in London over the weekend. It's not the first time that Taylor Lautner has supported his ex, as he was last seen on stage during her concert in Kansas City last summer. Following their split, the songstress famously wrote heartfelt track Back To December about their relationship. Swift and Lautner met on the set of the star-studded rom-com Valentine's Day in 2009 and went on to enjoy a whirlwind romance that Autumn. Unlike many of her breakup songs, Back To December is Swift apologising to Lautner for how things ended.

The One Directon star reportedly enjoyed a three month fling with the American songstress between 2012 and 2013 before splitting following an 'almighty row'. On Sunday, after Harry was spotted strolling through London with Taylor's close friends and singing sisters Este, Danielle and Alana Haim, Swifties were sure this meant he was also in contact with the Bad Blood hitmaker. After the footage was posted on X, fans commented: 'Next notification we’re about to get is set for tomorrow and it’s Harry Styles and Haim spotted at the eras tour at Wembley': 'And ur gonna hate me for saying this… but harry hanging out with the Haim sisters means theres about a 98% chance he's also hanging out with Taylor'.

They were on holiday and had an almighty row. They are two young stars at the top of their game so who knows what will happen in the future.' Taylor, who is known to write songs about past relationships, is thought to have penned at least three songs about Harry - I Knew You Were Trouble, Style and Out of The Woods. In 2015, the singer revealed her whirlwind romance with Harry had been an experience filled with anxiety. During a performance at the Grammy Museum, she introduced Out of the Woods by telling the audience about her anxiety-inducing relationship - although she didn't mention Harry by name. 'I'm going to play you a song that I wrote about a relationship that I was in that the number one feeling I felt in the whole relationship was anxiety,' she explained as she sat at her piano. 'Because it felt very fragile, it felt very tentative. And it always felt like, \"Okay, what's the next road block? What's the next thing that's gonna deter this? How long do we have before this turns into just an awful mess and we break up? Is it a month?

What Legal Analysts Say","text":"Former President Donald Trump shared a series of images on Truth Social Sunday night suggesting that superstar Taylor Swift and a group of her followers called \"Swifties for Trump\" had endorsed him in the 2024 presidential election.Many of the images, including one of the singer-songwriter dressed as Uncle Sam with the caption, \"Taylor Swift Wants You To Vote For Donald Trump,\" appear to have been generated by artificial intelligence.He wrote in one of the captions, \"I accept!\"In 2020, Swift backed the campaign of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and there is certainly no love lost between her and former President Trump, whom she has accused of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism.\"Swift, however, has yet to endorse any presidential candidate this election cycle.The posts were met with outrage on social media, both by Trump's critics and fans of the megastar singer-songwriter. Some legal analysts believe Swift has grounds to sue the Republican nominee over the AI-manipulated \"false endorsement.\"\"I hope this inspires every Taylor Swift fan to vote for Harris. And every music fan. And every person who cares about an artist's image & prestige stole by a criminal politician. And everyone who supports women's rights. Oh, and I hope Ms. Swift sues Trump back to the Stone Age,\" attorney and former U.S. Army prosecutor Glenn Kirschner wrote on X, formerly Twitter.One of the images in Trump's post—of a woman in a white \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirt—is not fake. One image showed Jenna Piwowarczyk wearing the homemade T-shirt to a Trump rally in Racine, Wisconsin, in June. Piwowarczyk went on to explain her decision to start the movement in a YouTube video.\"By focusing more on the AI photos than on the REAL person in the photos that Trump shared, I think the media are missing an opportunity to recognize that, of all the millions of Taylor Swift fans, of course there will be many who support Trump and conservative values and also love her music. We exist. We are real,\" Piwowarczyk wrote in a statement shared by Wisconsin Right Now, a Wisconsin-focused news platform, on X.There is also evidence of an online \"Swifties for Trump\" movement. In a TikTok video posted by user @trendyandspendy, a woman can be seen posing in a bright pink MAGA hat.In an emailed statement to Newsweek Monday night, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote, \"Swifties for Trump is a massive movement that grows bigger every single day. While [Democratic nominee] Kamala Harris is guilty as sin for all the hurt she has caused every American.\"Newsweek contacted Swift's representatives for comment by email Monday afternoon.Jessica Silbey, a professor at Boston University School of Law and an intellectual property and constitutional law expert, told Billboard Monday that Trump's fake endorsement post likely violates Swift's right of publicity, which controls how your name, image and likeness are used by others.\"Everyone enjoys a right of publicity,\" Silbey told Billboard. \"This kind of use—being made to say and seen as believing things you don't—is at the core of the right.\"Sibley also told Billboard that Swift could look to sue Trump or his campaign for defamation over claims that the false presidential endorsement harmed her reputation.Last month, a bi-partisan NO FAKES Act was introduced in the Senate that aims to protect individuals' voices and likenesses from AI-generated replicas. The act would \"hold individuals or companies liable for damages for producing, hosting, or sharing a digital replica of an individual performing in an audiovisual work, image, or sound recording that the individual never actually appeared in or otherwise approved—including digital replicas created by generative artificial intelligence (AI), according to a press release on Democratic Senator Chris Coons' website.In addition, 10 states, including Swift's home state of Tennessee, have enacted legislation to regulate deepfakes, which could give her additional room to sue Trump or his campaign.Neama Rahmani, president and founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Business Insider, \"Swift could sue Trump and those who misappropriated her likeness by creating AI-generated images.\" He continued, \"Privacy torts protect people from having their name, image, or likeness used without their permission. Manipulating it using AI doesn't change things.\"Rahmani pointed to the tenacity of Swift's lawyers and said, \"I wouldn't be surprised if they send the Trump campaign a cease-and-desist letter at a minimum,\" he told Business Insider.James Walker Jr., an entertainment attorney who represents the estate of Isaac Hayes, recently filed a copyright infringement notice demanding the Trump campaign pay $3 million in licensing fees for using Hayes' composition, \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" at his campaign rallies.Walker told Business Insider that he believes Swift should pursue legal action.\"Taylor Swift is a billion-dollar brand,\" Walker said. \"She probably has her name trademarked, just like Aretha Franklin and others I've represented own their trademarks. You have to protect your brand, your trademark, and when you don't respond immediately, that's conveying that you're accepting this, and then others will do it.''Paul Michael Wilson, a trademark expert at Walker & Associates, cited to Business Insider that the Lanham Act of 1946, the federal legislation in place that controls and regulates trademark laws in the United States, gives Swift legal grounds to sue Trump.\"This is really bad—somebody should have told him not to do that,\" Wilson laughed as he spoke with Business Insider. \"Like, really?\"However, suing Trump over just one image or a series of posts would certainly be arduous and expensive. Some legal analysts wonder if a defamation or copyright lawsuit —and the publicity that would surround the action—would be worth it for Swift.Woodrow Hartzog, also a professor at Boston University School of Law, told Billboard that he's \"skeptical the juice would be worth the squeeze.\" He added, however, that Swift could take on Trump with a real 2024 endorsement, potentially of his opponent, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\"I think Swift probably has more effective political rather than legal recourse here,\" Hartzog told Billboard.","summary":"Many legal analysts urge pop superstar Taylor Swift to protect her brand after Donald Trump's posting of a \"false endorsement.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-taylor-swift-endorsement-ai-lawsuit-1941420","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2453247/trump-swift.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:34:43","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.242},{"id":254469862,"title":"Letters: BART accountability | Cruelty no answer | Not ousted | Cancel Trump | Gaza’s suffering","text":"Accountability, not cash needed at BART Re: “BART leaders’ manufactured ‘fiscal crisis’” (Page A9, Aug. 11). Thank you, Debora Allen, for once again speaking truth to power. Allen has ably represented not only the taxpayers of the BART district she represents but all working people in the Bay Area who simply want BART to be safe, clean, efficient and affordable. She has been a voice in the wilderness against a BART board and unions that have vilified her for trying to make them fiscally responsible and address safety and cleanliness issues that exacerbate BART’s loss of ridership. Her article articulates the follies and failings of a BART board that places Bay Area citizens’ interests below the demands of BART employee unions and a twisted view of what a transit system should be. We desperately need a reliable, safe and affordable way to get to work. Allen’s recommendations for greater accountability for BART should be adopted before they get another dime from us. Donald Waters Pleasant Hill Cruelty is no answer for homelessness Re: “How is the Bay Area responding to order?” (Page A1, Aug. 17). Clearing homeless people from their encampments, stripping them of their few possessions and forcing them to move elsewhere is simply cruel. People are homeless because they cannot earn enough to support and house themselves, but our archaic and barbaric laws make that a crime. Forcing them to move is not a solution. It is disgraceful that the richest nation on Earth should treat poverty with cruelty. Dan Smith Moraga Biden was not ousted; he chose to withdraw Re: “Pro-democracy crew silent on ousting Biden” (Page A8, Aug. 18). President Biden was not ousted. Yes, he was pressured to step aside by senior Democratic congressional leaders. However, the decision to run for reelection was always that of President Biden. The decision was his and his alone. He was not “ousted” nor was there a coup. We know what a coup is since the country watched the televised attempted coup on Jan. 6, 2021, and it was clearly shown, thanks to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, who was responsible. I think objective readers will note that both the Democratic Party and the bipartisan congressional committee upheld the Constitution. This is in stark contrast to the current Republican presidential nominee and his supporters. Gary Chambers Brentwood Election offers chance to cancel Trump show Beyond the risks of electing a serial liar and convicted felon to lead our country, can we all just collectively cancel this Donald Trump reality TV show in November?

Not to mention he is too old. The country needs a fresh start. Let’s elect a woman to lead our country for the first time.

The rare joint statement from the FBI, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the measures Iran is taking to \"stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions\" have increased because the nation's government \"perceives this year's elections to be particularly consequential\" for its domestic policies. Intelligence officials for the first time publicly blamed Iran-backed hackers for the targeting of the Trump campaign, which revealed last week that it had been hacked and blamed Iranian actors for stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.Three sources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CBS News that federal investigators suspected Iranian hackers targeted individuals associated with the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns. The FBI launched the probes in the early summer after both presidential campaigns experienced attempted phishing schemes targeting campaign staff, the sources said.According to Monday's statement, the intelligence community said it is \"confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties.\" \"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process,\" the statement said. A senior official with the Harris campaign said last week, \"We are not aware of any security breaches of our systems.\"U.S. officials including the director of national intelligence and the heads of the FBI and CISA have warned of campaigns by foreign adversaries to undermine American elections, and Monday's statement makes clear the approach Iran is taking \"is not new.\" In the runup to the 2020 presidential election, FBI Director Christopher Wray and then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Iran was working to \"damage\" Donald Trump's reelection efforts. And during the 2016 presidential race, Russian hackers stole and disseminated the emails of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\"This activity demonstrates the Iranians' increased intent to exploit our online platforms in support of their objectives,\" the officials warned Monday.

Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.” The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked. The agencies said the FBI continues to investigate. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. We will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Iranian state news has previously reported that a representative for the mission had denied the country was involved in trying to hack Trump’s campaign. “Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections,” the statement said. Three American news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — said this month they had received documents that appeared to have been stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign claimed the documents were part of an Iranian “hack-and-leak” operation to hurt Trump’s election chances. Last week, the FBI announced it was investigating attempts to hack both parties. On Wednesday, Google published a detailed report on an Iranian hacker group, saying it targeted both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns in May and June. The U.S. previously blamed Iran for the largest election influence operation ahead of 2020, a convoluted operation to send harassing emails to Democrats in Florida to make it seem as if they were being threatened by the Proud Boys, a far-right group that supports Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe U.S. government has formally endorsed former President Donald Trump’s claim that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The U.S. verifies Trump campaign&#8217;s statement about being hacked by Iranian hackers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-u-s-verifies-trump-campaigns-statement-about-being-hacked-by-iranian-hackers/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-US-confirms-Trump-campaign-claim-it-was.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:27:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":254469984,"title":"U.S. says Iran cyber operations targeted Trump, Harris campaigns","text":"WASHINGTON >> The United States on Monday accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both U.S. presidential candidates and targeting the American public with influence operations aimed at fanning political discord. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle,” said a statement by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the defense of government computer systems.

During a Sunday interview on CNN, the former adviser to the Obama White House warned Democrats not to take too much comfort in the “euphoria” fueling Harris’s campaign. “She’s [Harris] right to be telling people it’s good to be enthusiastic,” Axelrod noted as he reflected on the momentum Harris attracted after replacing President Joe Biden in a last-minute switch at the top of the Democratic ticket. “But you have to turn that into energetic action in order to win the election,” Axelrod said. Axelrod added that Harris needs to put in more concrete work to pull voters in battleground states into her fold to secure an Electoral College win on Election Day. “I’ve said several times here that, you know, for [a] Democrat to win those battleground states, they have to have a significant lead in the Electoral College,” he reminded his party. The United States chooses presidents using the Electoral College system. Harris and former President Donald Trump are vying to persuade voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia to support their campaigns in a bid to clinch the necessary electoral votes to win the White House. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Trump because he secured a win in the Electoral College. The same scenario happened in 2000, when Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, lost the election to GOP presidential candidate George Bush despite winning the popular vote. Axelrod said he thinks Trump currently retains an advantage in the presidential race. “If the election were today, I’m not sure who would win, and I think it may well be President Trump because it’s an Electoral College fight,” the Democratic strategist said.

Taylor Swift Fan Who Started 'Swifties for Trump'","text":"Jenna Piwowarczyk, a student at Concordia College, started a group called \"Swifites for Trump,\" to encourage Taylor Swift fans to vote for former President Donald Trump in this year's presidential election.On Sunday, the former president reposted content on his social media plaftorm Truth Social about the \"Swifties for Trump\" group and even reposted an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated photo of Swift telling people to vote for him. In his caption, Trump wrote: \"I accept!\"Piwowarczyk, 19, celebrated Trump acknowledging the group and said in a video posted to YouTube that she met Trump at a Wisconsin rally in June while wearing her \"Swifties for Trump\" shirt.\"I think this movement is super awesome and also super important because it's no secret that millions of young female voters consider themselves Swifties and we don't want them to have to choose between loving Taylor Swift and supporting conservative ideologies at the ballot box in November,\" Piwowarczyk said in the video.Swift rarely wades into politics and has yet to endorse anyone this election cycle. However, Swift spoke out against Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, in 2018 and endorsed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2020 presidential election.Piwowarczyk told Newsweek on Monday via email that the response to the group has been \"huge,\" although she doesn't expect Swift to endorse anyone this election cycle. She acknowledged that Swift has fans on both sides of the political aisle and speculated that the recent ISIS terror threat that forced the singer to cancel her concert in Vienna, Austria, wouldn't have happened if Trump was in office.Newsweek polling in May found that 22 percent of Biden's 2020 voters would be more likely to vote for a Republican if Swift endorsed them. It was a 9-point increase from January when a Newsweek poll found only 13 percent of Biden's 2020 supporters would be more likely to vote for a Swift-endorsed Republican candidate.Piwowarczyk has been to six Swift concerts, with her first being during the singer's Red Tour in 2013. Then, she went to the 1989 Tour in 2015 and the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Piwowarczyk has also seen Swift three times in her latest Eras Tour.The 19-year-old grew up in Wisconsin and attended Hartford Union High School, according to records obtained by Newsweek. While in high school she started a chapter of the Young America's Foundation, a nonprofit conservative youth organization.Her father, Jim Piwowarczyk, is the founder of Wisconsin Right Now, a digital news platform based out of Wisconsin. Jenna's written several op-eds for the outlet, including one criticizing a New York Times essay that floated the theory that Swift is a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\"At what point do the ultra-liberal figures, as many see Taylor Swift to be, become not liberal enough? This story has proven that one cannot simply be an ally of the LGBTQ to be accepted or even enough for pop culture- one must be fully submerged in the ideology,\" she wrote early this year.Republicans have been critical of Swift and speculated that she'll do a last minute endorsement of Harris and potentially change the outcome of the election. In a book that was published in June by Variety's co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, Trump reportedly said he was surprised that Swift was liberal and asked if she was \"legitimately liberal.\" He added that she's \"beautiful\" and \"talented,\" but that she \"probably doesn't like Trump.\"Nearly one-third of Trump's supporters believe Swift will vote for him in November, according to a Newsweek poll from May. About 40 percent of Trump voters consider themselves Swift fans, compared to 59 percent of Biden's supporters.Jenna, a registered voter, told Newsweek that she describes herself as conservative who votes for \"ideology rather than a party.\"Trump sharing the AI-generated images of Swift sparked strong reactions from her fans. One fan on social media questioned why he'd risk angering Swift, with some legal experts saying the singer could even sue the former president over the images.Jenna told Newsweek that she's had fans reach out to her in support of the \"Swifties for Trump\" group, as well. With a politically diverse fan base, she said Swifties who are supporting Trump are likely doing so because they're getting older and unhappy with the economy.\"My generation is realizing that a Trump administration is needed for a successful future,\" Jenna said.","summary":"Piwowarczyk told Newsweek that she believes Taylor Swift fans will vote for Trump because they're unhappy with the economy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/who-jenna-piwowarczyk-swifties-trump-taylor-swift-donald-trump-1941495","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2453281/jenna-piwowarczyk-swifties-trump.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:25:48","author":"Jenni Fink","authors":["Jenni Fink"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":254470024,"title":"Republican activist Charlie Kirk clashes with Democrat in video from inside DNC","text":"Two of former President Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters have parachuted into Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, using the nominating event in an attempt to antagonize liberals. Charlie Kirk, a Chicago area native and co-founder of Turning Point USA, sparred with a conventioneer inside the United Center, where Vice President Kamala Harris will be anointed as Democrat’s presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Republican operative Jack Posobiec donned a traditional Middle Eastern headdress Monday while questioning demonstrators at Union Park about abortion. The MAGA darlings both posted their exploits to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that has become a bastion for conservative figures since Elon Musk took it over in 2022. Kirk and Posobiec didn’t respond to interview requests. In a video posted in the convention hall on Monday, Kirk said he was reporting from “the belly of the beast in Chicago.” “We’re here to learn,” Kirk said with a smile. “I don’t really have much to learn here. But I’ve already gotten heckled once.” Another video Kirk posted earlier Monday showed Parker Short, president of the Young Democrats of Georgia, assailing Kirk about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that southern state. “You’re an anti-patriotic, anti-constitutional person crashing our party because you tried to stop our democracy,” Short said. “I got one question,” Kirk shot back. “What is a woman?” “That is so f------ weird,” responded Short, using a dis progressives have lobbed against Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, as he walked away. “Maybe you should meet one.” Some of Posobiec’s trolling didn’t appear to go over much better. In a clip from Real America’s Voice, a far-right television channel, the naval intelligence officer-turned-Pizzagate conspiracy theorist asked a demonstrator how many abortions she’d had on Monday. “I’m getting paid by George Soros to have an abortion on the stage with no drugs,” the demonstrator said, referencing the billionaire Democrat who has long been a target of conservation native conspiracy theories.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/19/republican-influencers-dnc-charlie-kirk-jack-posobiec-turning-point-usa-united-center-abortion-weird","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf24410/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2575x1470+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F56%2F36594e7449bc9c3f3680d23e61fe%2Fkirkco","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:22:05","author":"Sun-Times staff","authors":["Sun-Times staff"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":254469522,"title":"Himpunan besar-besaran di Chicago menjelang DNC","text":"CHICAGO, 19 OGOS – Satu perhimpunan besar-besaran sedang berlangsung di Chicago, Amerika Syarikat (AS) menjelang pembukaan Konvensyen Nasional Demokrat (DNC), lapor Sputnik.

The matter came to light on Aug. 10, when multiple media outlets reported that they had recently received from an anonymous source private Trump campaign materials. The documents included a dossier the Trump campaign compiled as part of its research on vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and a senior campaign official’s communications, the outlets said. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said at the time that “hostile” foreign entities had unlawfully obtained the materials and that Microsoft discovered Iranians had gained unauthorized access to a presidential campaign account. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,” Cheung said in a statement, adding that “a new report from Microsoft found that Iranian hackers broke into the account of a ‘high ranking official’ on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump’s selection of a vice presidential nominee.” The FBI, ODNI, and CISA also said that the behavior from Iran, a major U.S. adversary, was not new but that the country’s efforts to affect this year’s U.S. elections had become “increasingly aggressive.” “Iran perceives this year’s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran’s inclination to try to shape the outcome,” the agencies said.

The nearly yearlong investigation by Republicans stops short of alleging any criminal wrongdoing by the president. Instead, the almost 300-page report out Monday, the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, covers familiar ground, asserting the Biden family traded on its “brand” in business ventures in corrupt ways that rise to the Constitution’s high bar for impeachment. With Biden no longer running for reelection, next steps are highly uncertain. House Republicans have not had support from their own ranks to actually impeach the president, and removal by the Senate is even further afield. Many Republicans prefer to focus attention on the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, with some probes getting underway. The White House has dismissed the House impeachment inquiry as a “stunt” and encouraged House Republicans to “move on.” “The totality of the corrupt conduct uncovered by the Committees is egregious,” wrote the House Oversight and Accountability, Judiciary and Ways & Means panels leading the inquiry. The report said the Constitution’s “remedy for a President’s flagrant abuse of office is clear: impeachment by the House of Representatives and removal by the Senate.” Republicans have spent the better part of their time in the House majority with a hyper focus on Biden and his family’s businesses, encouraged by Donald Trump as the twice impeached and indicted former president makes a comeback bid for the White House. The impeachment inquiry has been a cornerstone of the House GOP’s effort, launched by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy shortly before he was booted from leadership and formalized in December under new Speaker Mike Johnson. Republicans are investigating many aspects of Biden family finances going back to 2009 when he was vice president to Barack Obama. In a statement Monday, Johnson was non-committal on what the House will do with the findings. “We encourage all Americans to read this report,” he said. Through bank records, interviews from some 30 witnesses, whistleblower accounts and millions of documents, House Republicans allege a years-long practice by Hunter Biden and his associates to solicit foreign business deals using the family’s proximity to power in Washington. Much of the focus of the report is not on Biden’s time as president, but on the years when the Biden family was in turmoil after the 2015 death of his oldest son, Beau, and as the vice president was bowing out of elected office, declining to run for president in 2016. All told, the House Republicans allege the Biden family and its associates received some $27 million in business payments from partners or clients in Russia, China and other countries. The report said it is “inconceivable” that President Biden did not understand what was going on. “President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family,” the report claims. The report released Monday makes more than 20 mentions of the “Biden-Harris administration,” while previous releases from the committees investigating Biden typically only made direct references to him.","summary":"WASHINGTON — House Republicans have released their initial impeachment inquiry report on President Joe Biden, alleging an abuse of power and obstruction of justice in the financial dealings of his son Hunter Biden and family associates.

Here’s what progressives want at the DNC","text":"On Monday the Progressive Democrats of America held their conference at the Chicago Teachers’ Union hall, where Senator Bernie Sanders would keynote the two-day event, ahead of the official kickoff of the Democratic National Convention. But the hall remained only half full. So speakers urged attendees to tell their friends to come down to the hall for Sanders’s speech. It was indicative of setbacks that progressives in the Democratic Party have faced in recent months. While progressives have been thrilled at Harris’s selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former moderate who passed a series of liberal policies, progressives have seen other setbacks. Earlier this month, Representative Cori Bush of Missouri, a member of the so-called “Squad”, lost her primary thanks to an onslaught of pro-Israel money. This came after Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York, another Squad member, lost his primary in the most expensive primary election in history. In addition, while Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois, another Squad member, touted Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, Harris has backed away from both of those proposals after she co-sponsored them as a senator. Representative Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who delivered a barnburner speech at the conference, told The Independent that it was important to get behind candidates who will “save our democracy” and with whom they could organize. “It doesn’t mean we’re going 100 percent of what we want in the agenda, but we are going to make real progress,” she said. In the same spirit, progressives have seen their push for a ceasefire in Gaza amid Israel’s war with Hamas continue to fall flat. Last month, Michigan Democrats convened a call to endorse Harris. During the call, Abbas Alawieh, a leader of the Uncommitted Movement, tried to speak up and voice his concerns when another delegate reportedly told him to “shut up, a*****.” The pro-ceasefire advocates held a press conference on Monday and celebrated the fact there would be a panel on Palestine. But they have yet to get two of their major concessions: support for a ceasefire or an arms embargo on Israel. “This is a question of whether Vice President Harris will take the opportunity to unite our party in a manner that is wildly popular among Democratic voters,” Alawieh told The Independent at the press conference. “We want to help Vice President Harris beat Donald Trump,” he said. But Alawieh warned that if they did not get concrete commitments from Harris, that he and his allies will not be able to make an affirmative case to voters in places like Michigan, which has a large Arab-American presence. “Absent that, we don’t have the credibiity to go back and tell to those voters, and affirmative that embraces Vice President Harris’s plan because we don’t know what her plan is,” he said. Israel is not the only area where progressives are frustrated with Harris. Since she launched her presidential campaign, she has pledged to sign a bill that would severely restrict immigration and asylum. Pro-immigrant groups have criticized her embrace of the bill and Democrats’ overall rightward turn on immigration as it remains a point of strength for Republicans and Trump. When Harris spoke in Arizona earlier this year, she said she supported “comprehensive reform” approach to immigration “that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.” Lilian Jiménez, a state representative for Illinois and an immigration lawyer, said she wants Harris to support a humane immigration policy. “I just say human rights,” she told The Independent. “I want her policies to reflect that we should treat everybody equally. We should give people an opportunity, and we should give people due process and ability to apply for status to stay in this country. And at this point, I don't care what you call it. But let's see some movement on the policy.” But at the event on Monday, many progressives were celebrating the selection of Walz as Harris’s running mate including activists from Minnesota. “I was one of the earliest members to come out for Governor Walz,” Jayapal said. “I do think she recognize all the things we all saw in Governor Walz, which is he’s from a red rural district and he’s implemented some of the most progressive policies in the state of Minnesota.” But there has been steps forward for progressives. On Monday night, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain will address the convention. Progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will address the crowd in Chicago, as well as Representative Jamie Raskin, both of whom voted against giving additional aid to Israel. And in a sign of the future of the progressive movement, after Sanders left the conference, Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of the House, delivered a speech that got people on their feet.","summary":"Israel is not the only area where progressives are frustrated with Harris","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/what-progressives-want-from-kamala-harris-b2598600.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/19/21/GettyImages-2167036995.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:14:36","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":254469362,"title":"Iran to blame for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns: US intelligence officials","text":"US intelligence officials said on Monday they were confident that Iran was responsible for the hack of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, casting the cyber intrusion as part of a brazen and broader effort by Tehran to interfere in American politics and undermine faith in democratic institutions. Although the Trump campaign and private-sector cybersecurity investigators had previously said Iran was behind the hacking attempts, it was the first time the US government had assigned blame for the attack. The joint statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal agencies also indicated that Iran was responsible for attempts to hack Vice-President Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying hackers had “sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaign of both political parties”. The goal of the hacking and other activities, federal officials said, was not only to sow discord but also to shape the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be “particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests”. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement, which in addition to the FBI was also released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies such as Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign agents’ attempts to interfere in this year’s election, and Google, which separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to US President Joe Biden and Trump since May.","summary":"Trump campaign and private investigators said Iran was behind hacking attempts; it is first time US government has assigned blame for attack.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3275109/iran-blame-hacks-targeting-trump-biden-harris-campaigns-us-intelligence-officials","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/20/4432f7d6-2ca8-41da-bcac-0980c5b8d764_aa11ce31.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:13:25","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":254469602,"title":"U.S. confirms Trump campaign claim it was breached by Iranian hackers","text":"The U.S. government has formally endorsed former President Donald Trump’s claim that Iran hacked his campaign.

Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.” The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked. The agencies said the FBI continues to investigate. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. We will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Iranian state news has previously reported that a representative for the mission had denied the country was involved in trying to hack Trump’s campaign. “Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections,” the statement said. Three American news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — said this month they had received documents that appeared to have been stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign claimed the documents were part of an Iranian “hack-and-leak” operation to hurt Trump’s election chances. Last week, the FBI announced it was investigating attempts to hack both parties. On Wednesday, Google published a detailed report on an Iranian hacker group, saying it targeted both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns in May and June. The U.S. previously blamed Iran for the largest election influence operation ahead of 2020, a convoluted operation to send harassing emails to Democrats in Florida to make it seem as if they were being threatened by the Proud Boys, a far-right group that supports Trump.","summary":"The U.S. government has formally endorsed former President Donald Trump’s claim that Iran hacked his campaign.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-confirms-trump-campaign-claim-was-breached-iranian-hackers-rcna167285","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240819-donald-trump-ew-700p-6cd522.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:12:52","author":"Kevin Collier","authors":["Kevin Collier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":254469786,"title":"Trump’s nephew insists former president is showing signs of ‘dementia’ like his grandfather","text":"Donald Trump is showing signs that correspond with his family history of dementia, according to Fred Trump III, the former president’s nephew. The “warnings signs” are evident, Fred Trump III said during an interview on The Dean Obeidallah show on Friday, accusing the former president of spewing “craziness” and failing to stick to the script during campaign appearances. “I know what I saw in my grandfather. I know what I saw in Donald’s older sister, my Aunt Maryanne,” Fred Trump said. “I just, I know the warning signs from both of my grandfathers,” he added. “Donald’s cousin, John Walters had dementia. It runs in the family. I’m not happy about it.” The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. Fred Trump III is the brother of psychologist and author Mary Trump, and the eldest son of Donald Trump’s late older brother, Fred Trump Jr. He has emerged as another vocal critic of the former president from within his own family. In July, Fred Trump III endorsed his uncle’s rival for the White House, Kamala Harris. And in a memoir which came out the same month, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way, the former president’s nephew accused Trump of musing aloud about whether people with disabilities would be better off dead instead of causing expenses for their caregivers. The comment came as a shock, Fred Trump writes, because his own son William was diagnosed as an infant with a rare seizure disorder that has caused significant cognitive and physical damage. Donald Trump has said that he supported Fred Trump III, contributed to a fund to support William, and introduced the family to officials from the National Institutes of Health who might offer assistance. “I helped him so much, more than anyone else in his life, and this is the thanks I get. I even set up [a] meeting with NIH and top doctors in the country talking about his son, who is disabled,” Donald Trump said in a statement to The Washington Post, accusing fellow family critic Mary Trump of convincing Fred to write his book. The issue of age and mental ability has been central during the 2024 presidential race as numerous Democrats questioned whether Joe Biden had the mental fitness to win before he stepped down from his reelection campaign.","summary":"Fred Trump has endorsed Kamala Harris for president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nephew-fred-dementia-family-b2598666.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/03/TRUMP-PATRIMONIO_38062.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tABNqjZF-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:10:32","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":254469128,"title":"Former MAGA Republican Rich Logis Slated to Speak at DNC","text":"Rich Logis voted for former President Donald Trump four times: twice in the primaries and twice in the general elections of 2016 and 2020.\"I was wrong about all of it,\" Logis said in a op-ed for Newsweek last year.

The FBI on Aug. 12 had announced that it was investigating reports that hackers potentially linked with Iran had targeted the Trump campaign. According to the statement, Iranian hackers appear to have attempted to hack both Trump’s campaign and the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris. The agencies placed the attempted hack into the context of “increasingly aggressive Iranian activity” during the current election cycle, saying, “this approach [by Iran] is not new.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an intelligence community assessment last month, concluding that Iranian groups are working to fuel distrust toward U.S. institutions and increase social discord. The assessment states that Iranian groups use “vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel–Gaza conflict.” The intelligence community report further states that Tehran is “working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States.” The Iranian mission to the United Nations has denied allegations of Tehran’s involvement in a cyber breach targeting the Trump campaign. The Iranian mission insists that Tehran is instead the target of cyberattacks. The mission said Tehran uses its cyber capabilities for defense and for directing proportionate responses to the attacks that Iran faces. In the Aug. 19 statement, intelligence officials vowed continued vigilance in identifying and countering such threats. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the statement said. That report found that an Iranian group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, called “Mint Sandstorm,” sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from a compromised email account belonging to a former senior campaign adviser. The MTAC report stated that the same group was also responsible for an attempted hack during the 2020 election, including a failed effort to breach the account of an unidentified former presidential candidate. In the wake of the report, Trump’s 2024 campaign team acknowledged its validity, saying that they had been hacked and had campaign documents stolen. They included a 271-page research dossier drafted while Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) was still being vetted for the No. 2 job as well as similar, albeit incomplete, materials related to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another finalist for the job. The campaign breach comes in the wake of reports that, ahead of the failed July 13 attempt on Trump’s life, Iran had independently hatched a plot to assassinate the former president.","summary":"The FBI previously said it was investigating reports that hackers potentially linked with Iran had targeted the former president's campaign.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/iran-behind-hack-targeting-trump-campaign-us-intelligence-agencies-5708488","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/13/id5704790-GettyImages-1242409189-1-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:05:01","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":254468588,"title":"Supreme Court Gives Fani Willis a New Deadline","text":"Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis has until September 30 to respond to a U.S. Supreme Court appeal seeking to move former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' election subversion case to federal court.Willis indicted Meadows, former President Donald Trump and more than a dozen others last year on charges of attempting to illegally overturn Trump's 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden with the aid of \"fake electors\" and attempts to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" additional votes for Trump.Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court last month after a previous attempt to take his case out of Willis' jurisdiction failed in a lower federal court.

But here are two points to consider (which analysts rarely address). First, unregulated rent-seeking private hedge funds are driving up rents and control some of the supply of rental property. They artificially create scarcity. This should change. Second, property taxes change the entire ownership model. It’s not just about servicing a mortgage and maintaining a property, property tax can be the key deterrent to home ownership. We can only hope that our politicians and analysts start to get real about the true costs of both renting and home ownership. It’s the only way we can begin to solve the homeless problem.

Connie Young Yu Los Altos Hills Pharmacy benefits managers harm patients The FTC’s interim July report on Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBM) and their nefarious practices is sending shockwaves nationally, confirming patients’ access to affordable medications has been sacrificed through anti-competitive practices. What started off as middlemen negotiating drug prices has ballooned into a billion-dollar industry, with only six companies controlling nearly 95 percent of prescriptions filled in the US. According to the report, this power allows PBMs to charge whatever price they prefer, steer patients to go to their own parent company’s pharmacy and force mom-and-pop pharmacies to close. PBMs have gone unchecked for too long, primarily because our policymakers felt they didn’t have finite evidence exposing their unscrupulous practices. But now they have it. I am thrilled to see the FTC signaling a lawsuit against the top three PBMs for driving up insulin costs and overcharging for cancer drugs. PBMs are harming the very people they are supposed to protect.

It was just the latest bizarre feature in an election that has already featured a debate collapse, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, a high-powered pressure campaign, the stunning withdrawal of the candidate, and even the president losing a primary American Samoa. ‘We’re delivering on President Biden’s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down,’ it says. It calls the election ‘a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around.’ Those were just a pair of the dozens of mentions of Biden, 81, who ended his campaign after a series of elected lawmakers and party officials urged him to end his run against Trump, 78. ‘In President Biden’s second term, he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the American experience. We will push for a Supreme Court that follows the rule of law, protects people’s freedoms, and abides by the highest ethical standards,’ says the platform in one section that is clearly out of date. It also mentions Donald Trump more than 100 times. It does mention Vice President Kamala Harris, who has unified the party around her after getting Biden’s endorsement. ‘President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job. It got approved by the party’s Platform Committee July 16 less than a week before Biden stepped back, in a stunning illustration of the pace of the turnaround. Now, it will serve as a general governing blueprint for Harris, who has so far been dribbling out her own policy proposals and turning down interview requests. That includes her campaign calling for a top corporate tax rate of 28 percent – in line with President Biden’s budget blueprint for the 2025 fiscal year. Other economic proposals in the platform include a $15 federal minimum wage and a $10,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. High up in the platform is a statement about the Chicago land where the convention is being held. ‘While we meet in Chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, also known as the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations,’ it says. ‘We acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten.’ ‘Over the past two years, more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide,’ goes a passage on abortion. One paragraph hammers Trump on denying the results of the 2020 election carried by Biden. It’s something Harris has not been stressing at her rallies to the extent Biden has. ‘Trump refuses to defend core tenets of our democracy: the Constitution, the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. He still doesn’t accept the plain truth, upheld by scores of courts, that he lost in 2020, even describing himself as a “very proud election denier” – and he has never agreed to accept this year’s results. After years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, he has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses now,’ says the platform. ‘He lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the January 6 attack on our Capitol and brave police, calling those insurrectionists “patriots” and “hostages” while promising to pardon them.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe platform released by the Democratic Party Sunday talks up President Joe Biden’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling the 2024 Democratic Party Platform: Exploring the Extensive Priorities Including Numerous References to &#8216;Joe Biden&#8217;s Second Term&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/unveiling-the-2024-democratic-party-platform-exploring-the-extensive-priorities-including-numerous-references-to-joe-bidens-second-term/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/19/22/88698891-13759029-image-a-3_1724101242397.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:59:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":254468528,"title":"Trump would like Musk to be his adviser if he wins election — news agency","text":"NEW YORK, August 20. /TASS/.

The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier this month that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran. \"We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns,\" the security agencies said. \"This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign, which the (intelligence community) attributes to Iran,\" they said. The intelligence community \"is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process.\" Trump's campaign said on August 10 that it had been hacked, blaming \"foreign sources\" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D. Vance. \"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. Trump's campaign implied Iran was behind the move as news outlet Politico reported it had received emails with the campaign material from a source who refused to identify themselves. Cheung cited a report from Microsoft this week that said Iranian hackers \"sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.\" The materials received by Politico included research on vetting Vance, Trump's vice presidential pick. In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump, who would go on to win the election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.

The four-night event at the United Center in Chicago will also feature New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and current First Lady Jill Biden. The delegates of the Democratic Party will vote to officially nominate Vice President Kamala Harris for President and affirm Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. President Biden had been the presumptive nominee and was expected to face off against former President Donald Trump, however, following a disastrous debate performance on June 27, he made the decision to withdraw his candidacy on July 21. Biden quickly endorsed Harris, who secured the support of enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee within 24 hours. It comes as thousands of protesters marched toward the arena where the DNC is set to take place, voicing their opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza. Several broke through a fence set up by police as officers yelled at them to retreat. Biden did a walkthrough of the area ahead of his speech as protesters shouted at him. “Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” they chanted, dubbing the president as “Genocide Joe.” Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC, told the Associated Press that the group has come to the “belly of the beast to stop the genocide.” The group has called on Biden and Harris to end US aid to Israel, which has been at war with the militant group Hamas after the events of the October 7 massacre resulted in the taking of Israeli hostages. A top Democratic congressman warned that anti-Israel protesters targeting the DNC would trigger a second Trump presidency. Congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota told The U.S. Sun that any violence and chaos were “scenes Donald Trump would love to see.” He described the protests as a “beautiful and uncomfortable part of democracy,” however, he urged any activist planning on bringing unrest at the convention to “do it peacefully, bring extraordinary change.” Phillips added that violent protests would elevate Trump’s candidacy and diminish “the very opportunity that they seek, which is to finally find peace and self-determination for the Palestinians.” “Two things can be true at once. We can support our friend and ally Israel, and we can support the Palestinian people.” He warned protesters to “remind themselves of what’s at risk” if they acted in a way that could jeopardize Democrats, adding that “the alternative” of Trump and JD Vance would be “probably the worst possible outcome for those that are opposing America’s support for Israel.” “Pragmatism is something that every protester could learn a little bit about.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nASHLEY Biden is expected to introduce her father, President Joe Biden, as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ashley Biden will introduce her father Joe at the start of the DNC schedule, along with speeches from Hillary Clinton and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/ashley-biden-will-introduce-her-father-joe-at-the-start-of-the-dnc-schedule-along-with-speeches-from-hillary-clinton-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ashley-Biden-to-intro-dad-Joe-as-DNC-schedule-kicks.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:50:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":254468552,"title":"Chuck Todd: Democrats' salute to Biden papers over a complicated place in history","text":"President Joe Biden bids farewell to his party Monday night. And whatever he says, he will get a rousing reception for one simple and deeply unusual reason: He’s no longer Democrats’ standard-bearer, and they are relieved he saw the political writing on the wall and passed the baton to someone who might have a better chance to defeat former President Donald Trump. Despite the cheers, let’s not pretend this isn’t an awkward and bittersweet moment for Biden. I’ve spent my entire professional life (over 30 years now) tracking, reporting on and watching Biden find a path to the Oval Office. I saw him try and fail … a lot. It was clearly his Holy Grail. No matter how many ways his ambition for the presidency went sideways, he always wanted to come back and try again. And despite all the failures, his candidacies always were compelling. He was always a candidate worth gravitating toward for many reporters for one simple reason: He told you everything he was thinking, even stuff you’d never expect him to say. Before Trump showed up and completely transformed the world of political etiquette and rhetoric, Biden was seen as unfiltered in a mostly net-positive way. There’s a reason no other Democrat has appeared on “Meet the Press” more than Joe Biden, and it’s not just his longevity in politics — he was a guest worth booking since he might actually express his actual thoughts, rather than come armed with just predictable talking points. There’s no greater example of this than his appearance in 2012, when he leaned forward on same-sex marriage before his running mate, the sitting president, was ready to do the same. One thing my predecessors and I learned interviewing Biden over the years is that he took every question he was asked seriously (even the dumb ones) and wanted to impress his interlocutors by also trying to answer whatever subtext was being implied. He loves being a political insider as much as he loves being a campaigner. In short, he loves the game. He loves to know who’s up, who’s down and who’s coming. Talking with Biden off the record was like talking with a fellow political reporter — he was that informed about what was happening. Frankly, that Joe Biden has been missing for nearly six years. And it’s why many of us reporters — before many elected Democrats went public — were among the first to question whether he was up for another four years. He wasn’t behaving like the Biden we had all covered for decades. To this day, I’m not sure what the truth is about Biden and the hermetically sealed bubble his staff created for him. What clearly started as a necessary concern over Covid became a crutch to keep Biden from being Biden. Maybe staffers knew something we didn’t, or maybe they just didn’t know or appreciate his best attribute. Biden built a reservoir of goodwill with many political professionals over the years because he said what he meant and meant what he said. It’s perhaps why there were plenty of public defenders of his lackluster public appearances for parts of his presidency, because those people were still remembering the Biden with whom they used to interact. It’s why there was also a lot of head-scratching about the White House staff’s apparent overprotection of Biden, because it appeared to be knee-capping the president’s best attribute: his affability. In politics, that’s an attribute in very short supply. The staff appeared to be more concerned about the unfiltered part of Biden’s reputation, especially because as he aged, the filter worked even less. But that concern took away his connection with the public. The detachment only reinforced the charge that Biden wasn’t up to the job. And maybe that’s the real answer. Ultimately, when Biden stews about being pushed aside, he will have to look in the mirror and ask whether he was honest with himself about his ability to run for another term as president — or whether his family and his staff hurt him more under the guise of trying to protect him. Either he was up to the task and his staff never gave him a chance to prove it, or he wasn’t up to the job and his staff wasn’t honest with him. Here’s a known unknown: Had Biden interacted more with the public and the media more frequently, would that have gotten the country, the party and the media used to “Grandpa Joe”? By overprotecting him and limiting his unscripted public moments, did the White House team end up raising the stakes for the few moments he did participate in, culminating in a disastrous debate performance? A president who had spent more time dealing with unscripted moments might have been in better shape on debate night even while feeling ill. But that’s not the reality. The reality is this: Joe Biden is going to be a one-term president, and history judges one-term presidents quite harshly. With the possible exception of those historians who pine for the days of James Polk, who kept to a one-term pledge, every other one-term president in our republic’s history became a one-termer because of a harsh verdict from either voters or party leaders. A lot of folks besides the first family are trying to shape Biden’s place in history. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went so far as to suggest Biden might belong on Mount Rushmore. It’s hard to take her suggestion seriously, of course — it strikes me as a party leader’s trying to appease an old friend who she knows is angry over the role she played leading the charge to get him out of the race. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Biden was the best president of his lifetime. Walz is 60, born in 1964, less than six months into Lyndon Johnson’s term in office. How many Americans would rank Biden ahead of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama? The point is that the Democratic Party is awash in hyperbole regarding Biden as the party lays out emotional padding for a soft landing justifying his unusual exit. Whether true or not, on a human level, it’s the right thing to do. Nobody wants to see their life’s work (and Biden spent nearly his entire adult life trying to get to the presidency) just tossed away in history’s dustbin. It is also fascinating that so many Democrats believe they need to publicly express over-the-top affection for Biden that seems to rival some of the over-the-top rhetoric elected Republicans have used to describe Trump’s one term. Biden is going to be a one-term president because the public lost confidence in him, period. Some people may have liked him and wanted the Biden from the Obama years but lost confidence in this version of Biden’s being able to the job. Others may have lost confidence in him because they thought he was guided too much by the progressive left. Still others may have lost confidence in him simply because he didn’t successfully put Trump in the ash heap of history. Despite his victory in 2020, Biden’s presidency wasn’t successful enough to make the GOP decide to move on from Trump. Perhaps expectations that Biden would be able to get the country to turn the page on Trump were too great — though Biden did feed those expectations himself. But it does mean the country’s expectations weren’t met. The long-term question for Biden’s legacy is whether there’s anything he did that any Democratic president wouldn’t have done. Is there anything he accomplished that was unique to Biden? Unlike Clinton or Obama, Joe Biden wasn’t a president who tried to move the party in a particular direction — beyond forward, from Trump and the coronavirus pandemic alike. Clinton moved the Democratic Party to the right, especially on security issues (both foreign and domestic), as well as on fiscal issues. Before Clinton, Democrats won the popular vote only three times in 40 years: 1960, 1964 and 1976. Since Clinton, Democrats have won the popular vote all but once (2004). As for Obama, he helped move the mainstream of the Democratic Party from center-left to simply left. Basically, he helped redefine the country from being “center-right” to being simply “center.” Since Obama, the number of people comfortable identifying as liberal has consistently gone up. Biden split the difference between his two Democratic predecessors, which inside the Democratic Party (and in the age of Trump) was the safe thing to do. He minimized intraparty rifts, and that, as a party leader, might be the most positive part of his legacy. If there’s one consistent criticism of both Clinton and Obama, it’s that they were too focused on shifting the party in their direction, while Biden was the first Democratic president since LBJ who seemed to prioritize the party as a coalition over himself. And that’s at the core of why so many Democrats in Chicago will be cheering Biden. He was a party leader who accepted the idea that he wasn’t bigger than the party. That’s no easy thing for any president to do. Most presidents get to the office by having too much self-confidence — and that’s not to say Biden lacks self-confidence. But he’s reality-based enough to make admissions like the one he made last week, when he said his continued candidacy could have ripped his party apart down the ballot and that wasn’t something he wanted to be his legacy. His place in history will have everything to do with not just the outcome this November but also the outcome of the next presidential term. The more successful Harris is, the better for Biden’s legacy. A two-term Harris presidency would be the ideal outcome for those hoping Biden is eventually lionized, since that would mean she was able to oversee the implementation of Biden’s legislative achievements and, potentially, that those policies are popular over the years to come. If Trump wins this November, Biden’s legacy gets a lot more complicated. On one hand, his most devoted loyalists would whisper “told you so,” since some of them had argued Biden was the one Democrat uniquely suited to beat Trump. But I suspect there would be louder voices in the party who would most likely blame Biden for a Harris loss even more than they blamed Harris. The argument would be that if he had gotten out sooner, there might have been a chance to nominate a stronger ticket. Harris will always owe Biden, and, in turn, Biden will get blame for her failures — and reflected glory if she succeeds, since he picked her to be his running mate. Bottom line: Biden’s legacy depends on whether Trump and Trumpism succeed or fail at the ballot box going forward. If this is the election that finally does push Trump out of U.S. politics and into U.S. history, Biden will be seen as a successful transitional president, akin to a Harry Truman or even a George H.W. Bush. But any return of Trump or Trumpism would reflect poorly on him. There’s no sugar-coating it. Echoes of a more divided time in America There are so many near-historical anomalies with this election. And I say “near” because, while so many things about the switch from Biden to Harris seem unprecedented, they aren’t. Even the possibility of having three one-term presidents in a row isn’t unprecedented. Here are just a few of the near-unprecedented outcomes we could see with this election. A Harris victory would mean a one-term president was succeeded by someone from the same party, which has happened only two other times: once by the Democrats (Franklin Pierce to James Buchanan, not exactly two of the party’s best and brightest) and once by the Republicans (Rutherford B. Hayes to James Garfield). To me, it’s no accident we have to go back to the divisive times of the 1850s to the 1890s to find similarities to the politics we are experiencing today. A Trump victory would be the second-ever comeback by a defeated president (the first was Grover Cleveland … in the 1890s). And if you are wondering when was the last time we had two or more one-term presidents in a row, you’d be right if you guessed that it took place in that same tumultuous period. Before the Civil War and the rise of Abe Lincoln, the U.S. had six consecutive one-term presidents. And after Ulysses S. Grant, we had five consecutive one-term presidents until William McKinley. We can hope it doesn’t take an actual civil war or a near-civil war to get out of this current period of polarization. But it’s sobering to realize that today’s political tumult looks a lot like what happened in the last half of the 19th century.","summary":"Analysis: Biden's ultimate legacy will depend on whether Harris wins and what happens next.

Bob Unanue, who heads the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the US, said that grocery businesses would go bust under her proposals. On Friday, Harris gave her first policy address as the Democratic presidential nominee, where she vowed to create an ‘opportunity economy.’ This included a federal ban on price gouging across the food industry. This is when retailers sharply increase the price of necessities – typically to take advantage of an adverse situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic. But Unanue told Fox News that the proposals were putting the ‘last nails in the coffin of this economy and this country.’ From day one, the Biden-Harris administration has ‘started a war’ against the middle class, he said. Unanue, who spoke at the Republican National Convention earlier this year, told the outlet: ‘They’re using a nail gun to put the last nails in the coffin of this economy and this country. ‘From day one, they put in executive orders that set this country on a disastrous path.’ During her address last week, Harris said that the cost of food soared during the pandemic when supply chains shut down and failed. But while supply chains have improved, prices are still too high, the Vice President said. Unanue told Fox News that there are always problems if the government gets in the way of the free market, and this would not help inflationary prices. He said: ‘You know, when I was a kid, if you had a lemonade stand and it cost $0.10 for the glass, the straw, the product to go to the store to get it, and then the government comes along and says, I want you to sell that lemonade for a penny. ‘You know, you just got to fold up your lemonade stand and go home.’ He added that grocery businesses tend to make a 1 to 2 percent profit margin, and hire a lot of people. ‘We’re going to put them out of business by controlling pricing,’ he said. Former President Donald Trump also slammed the economic plans, claiming that controlling grocery prices would lead to ‘rationing, hunger and skyrocketing prices.’ Economists are divided about the potential impact of Harris’ proposals. Some claim actions taken to attempt to combat price-gouging can actually make the problem worse. Gavin Roberts, the chair of Weber State University’s economics department, told CNN that when prices are high, the best policy action to take is doing nothing. This would cause consumers who are deterred by, say, high prices of beef, to instead purchase another type of meat or an alternative protein. In turn, this helps keep beef on the grocery store shelves for people who want it enough to pay the higher prices, he said. He added that the policy would not help the food industry become more competitive. ‘It’s more likely to maintain that status quo,’ he told the outlet. This is because it would keep new competition from moving in to take advantage of the bigger profit margins, which is competition that could have helped lower prices in the long run. But others have applauded the proposals. Lindsay Owens, executive director of think tank Groundwork Collaborative, told CNN that it would give government agencies more authority to ‘crack down on bad actors’ charging Americans higher prices. ‘It’s good to see this aggressive approach,’ she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Goya Foods CEO has slammed Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; economic proposals,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Grocery CEO criticizes Kamala Harris&#8217; economic proposals, alleging they are detrimental to the middle class. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/grocery-ceo-criticizes-kamala-harris-economic-proposals-alleging-they-are-detrimental-to-the-middle-class/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/19/23/88694267-13758491-Bob_Unanue_who_heads_the_largest_Hispanic_owned_food_company_in_-a-36_1724106448578.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:47:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":254468778,"title":"Donald Trump Peeking at Melania Trump’s Ballot Made Him an Instant Meme in 2016","text":"During Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, he went with Melania Trump to cast their ballots side by side. However, the former president's actions during that time quickly became a meme. Cameras caught him peeking at his wife as she cast her vote. Later that day, the event became the first major meme as it was recorded by CNN cameras and quickly spread on Twitter. Some started to doubt Donald could read while sharing on X, \"Trump not so bright watching Melania to see how to do it?! #battot\". Another user made a funny comment, \"When you don't even know if your own wife is voting for you.\" Chelsea Handler, a comedian, tweeted the picture along with the message, \"When you’re worried that your wife copied off of Michelle again.\" It was related to the reports that Melania stole some lines from Michelle Obama's speech and used them in her convention speech. One more reviewer playfully interjected, \"He was going to deport her quick and get his 4th wife if she didn't vote for him.\" Another commented that Melania seemed 'depressed' and added, \"lmao. She was probably voting for Clinton. Would you blame her? Poor she is so submissive. She looks depressed all the time.\" Several detractors also brought up the fact that Donald was breaking the law by prying into his wife's ballot. The idea of a secret ballot is to prevent bullying or intimidation of voters and to guarantee that each voter has the opportunity to cast an anonymous ballot. One user jotted down, \"Why was that allowed, every vote should be private, looks like their voting machines were staged. For the media.\" Another reviewer wrote, \"@realDonaldTrump Umm isn't that illegal!!!????? Hmmmm who's the careless one getting away with such things!!!\" One more critic said that the former President's 'got a privacy problem'. Donald announced his candidacy for president a full year before this meme gained widespread attention. As reported by ABC, he announced in 2015, \"We are going to make our country great again. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\" He declared to the US citizens at the time, \"Sadly the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back, bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.\" The former president toured crucial battleground states in 2012 as part of his presidential exploratory committee. In 2016, Donald stated his intention to stay for the long haul by transferring control of The Trump Organization to his children Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric. He also planned on withdrawing from his popular show The Apprentice. He said back then, \"They all said, a lot of the pundits on television, well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks. So I said to myself, you know, nobody is ever going to know unless I run because I'm really proud of my success.\"","summary":"Twitter users were quick to notice the moment, which had been recorded by CNN cameras, and it quickly became the main election day meme.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-peeking-at-melania-trumps-ballot-made-him-an-instant-meme-in-2016","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/711179/uploads/2e3c1430-5c90-11ef-b877-619bbf989323_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":254468554,"title":"Tim Walz’s Minnesota delegation gets curious placement at Democrats’ convention","text":"CHICAGO — In a typical party convention, the home state delegations of the presidential and vice presidential nominees can usually be assured of prime seats — conspicuous placement that ensures friendly faces and reliable support for the candidates on stage. That’s true in 2024 for the California delegation cheering on native daughter Kamala Harris but not Tim Walz’s Minnesota delegation, a reality driven by electoral politics and the unusual nature of the abrupt shift in the Democratic ticket. But one factor also keeping the vice presidential nominee’s home state more removed from the stage has to do with who makes up its delegation: the largest bloc of “Uncommitted” delegates for any of the 57 voting delegations, according to a convention organizer. Instead, Pennsylvania, perhaps the state most critical to the electoral path to 270, will be directly in front of the podium alongside California’s sizable bloc. And while President Joe Biden is no longer a candidate, his Delaware delegation will also be nestled within the larger Keystone State delegation with a place of honor, alongside the host state Illinois delegation. Minnesota’s floor placement, however, still rivals more competitive battlegrounds like Georgia and Arizona. There are 30 \"Uncommitted\" delegates — some Democrats who have refused to back Harris as the party’s nominee because of the Biden administration’s handling of Israel's war in Gaza — with 11 of them hailing from Walz’s home state. That's a fraction of the more than 4,000 delegates overall but nonetheless a potentially disruptive or vocal one, particularly if in very close proximity to the podium. Democratic officials say they aren’t concerned about protests in the hall distracting from the four-day convention. They note that inside the room of the last in-person party gathering eight years ago was a decidedly more contentious affair. In 2016, Bernie Sanders brought in a much more sizable pool of delegates who made their voice — and dissatisfaction with Hillary Clinton’s nomination — known throughout the Philadelphia convention. “We’re obviously a big tent party. We embrace the fact that there’s a lot of people with a wide diversity of views on all sorts of topics. We don’t run away from that,” Alex Hornbrook, the Democratic National Convention executive director, said in an interview. “So we feel like we can provide space for people to make their views known, while also reflecting the fact that 99-plus percent of our delegates here voted for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to be our nominees,” Hornbrook said. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who had briefly challenged Biden for the nomination, said the presence of uncommitted delegates in his state’s delegation has been a topic of discussion but that he hoped there would be no disruptions. “We have Minnesota nice. We try to be a little bit more respectful even in our protest,” he joked. “Those who would interrupt the proceedings here are only helping one person, that’s Donald Trump. No matter how profoundly they feel, no matter how righteous they believe their cause to be — I do believe people should be heard. But there’s a space and place to do so.” Unsurprisingly, some of the reddest states have seats furthest from the podium. Iowa, Arkansas and Indiana, for instance, are not on the floor but in the rear of the lower bowl of the United Center. Florida, which had once been the most hotly-contested battleground state and could be assured of preferential seating, may have one of the most remote seating arrangements, surrounded by network broadcast positions and behind a large camera riser toward the rear of the arena. “Uncommitted” delegates have asked for a speaking slot during this week’s convention, but on Monday, Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, avoided specifically answering whether the party would allow that. “I think people will be, at the end of all of this, I think people will be content, because they will see themselves in some form or fashion on that stage,” Harrison told reporters.","summary":"CHICAGO — In a typical party convention, the home state delegations of the presidential and vice presidential nominees can usually be assured of prime seats — conspicuous placement that ensures friendly faces and reliable support for the candidates on stage.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/tim-walzs-minnesota-delegation-gets-curious-placement-democrats-conven-rcna167280","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240819-tim-walz-ew-558p-e51750.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:43:29","author":"Mike Memoli","authors":["Mike Memoli"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.265},{"id":254468270,"title":"Iran to blame for hack of Trump's campaign: officials","text":"Camera IconIran has been accused of hacking Donald Trump's champagn by the FBI and other agencies.
