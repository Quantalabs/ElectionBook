This decision was not taken lightly and documentation supporting the timeline is on file,” the statement continued. “We sincerely thank the fans who were looking forward to the event and remain committed to working with promoters who meet the professional standards required to deliver successful shows.”\n\nOn Wednesday, event promoter Galdiez Mendez had criticised Kraff in a fiery social media post for allegedly not fulfilling contractual obligations and insisted that the deejay return payments allegedly made for the performance.\n\nREAD: Galiday Bounce postponed amid dispute with show’s headliner Kraff\n\nHowever, Kraff’s management team in an earlier statement had suggested that unresolved “outstanding issues” led him to cancel his appearance, adding that at no point was the performance contracted, discussed, or approved as a benefit concert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Galiday Bounce Kraff New York \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n New Year’s baby welcomed at Cornwall Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n Cornwall Regional Hospital has welcomed its first baby born in the year of 2026.

They were later pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.\n\nResidents of Granville staged a protest against the killing, accusing the police of using unnecessary lethal force.\n\nREAD: Residents protest New Year’s triple killing in Granville\n\nPolice confirmed that investigations are ongoing, including investigations by the relevant oversight bodies, and the circumstances surrounding the incident are being thoroughly examined.\n\nThe identities of the two deceased males are being verified.\n\nThe force says a strong and visible police presence has been maintained in the area to preserve public order, reassure residents, and prevent any further escalation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Killing Police St James \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Old Harbour United acquire Spanish Town Police FC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n Old Harbour United Football Club say they have acquired bottom-placed Jamaica Premier League side Spanish Town Police.

She was assisted to hospital, where she has been admitted in stable condition, the police said.\n\nIn a similar incident, a 14-year-old girl from Bond Street in Kingston was injured at approximately 12:02 am while sitting beneath a tree in her community. The teen reported feeling a burning sensation to her shoulder, after which it was discovered that she had been shot. She was also taken to hospital for treatment and is reported to be in stable condition.\n\nPolice are condemning the incidents, describing the alleged gun salutes as reckless and irresponsible, and are “once again emphasising that gun salutes are illegal, extremely dangerous, and pose a serious threat to innocent lives.”\n\nInvestigations into both shootings are ongoing as lawmen work to determine the origin of the gunfire and identify those responsible, the police said.\n\nThe JCF is urging anyone with information that may assist these investigations to come forward.\n\nPersons may contact Crime Stop at 311, the National Intelligence Bureau at 811, the Police Emergency number at 119, or make a report to the nearest police station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: gun salute injury Teen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Old Harbour United acquire Spanish Town Police FC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n Old Harbour United Football Club say they have acquired bottom-placed Jamaica Premier League side Spanish Town Police.

Tanker seizures, the expansion of navalassets and airspace restrictions that affect the daily lives of our people.\n\n“As bishops ofthe Caribbean flock, we cannot remain silent when developments threaten human dignity, regional stability and the long held vision of theCaribbean as a Zone of Peace,”he added.\n\nThe United States has amassed a formidable armada in the international waters near Venezuela, bombing several vessels Washington claims are engaged in the illegal drugs trade and in the process killing almost 100 people.\n\nCARICOM in August issued a statement regarding the increased security build up in the Caribbean and the potential impacts on member states, reaffirming “the principle of maintaining the Caribbean region as a Zone of Peace and the importance of dialogue and engagement towards the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflict”.\n\nBut Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has left no doubt where she stands on the issue and has disagreed with the CARICOM position that the region should remain a zone of peace, supporting Washington’s so-called war on drugs in the region, even as political observers say Washington’s main aim is to institute regime change in Caracas.\n\nArchbishop Gordon said that the AEC has expressed “deepconcern”that the Caribbean sea “home fisherfolk, seafarers, coastalfamilies and migrants, has become a theatre for confrontation not of our making.\n\n“Recent lethal maritime incidents, the blockade of oil tankers, and increased surveillance activity elevate risks to innocent lives and aggravate humanitarian suffering, particularly in Venezuela. These actions alsostrain maritime commerce, tourism and the welfare ofthousands whose livelihoods depend on safe and open seas.”\n\nHe said that while the AEC recognises the legitimate responsibility of states to address transnationalcrime and uphold international law, “we affirm more urgently than before that militarisation is not the road to durable security.\n\n“Heightened operations in our region, whether by global powers, orregional actors, further entrench mistrust, disrupteconomies, and endanger the most vulnerable. War, or threat ofwar, is always a defeat for humanity,” he said.\n\nThe AEC president said “we stand in solidarity with the people ofVenezuela at thiscrucial moment in their nation’s history.\n\n‘Guided by the testimonies of their own bishops and by conversations with Regional Church leaders, “we acknowledge the overwhelming desire of the Venezuelan people for democratic renewal and for leadership that restores justice, peace and integrity of their institutions.\n\n“Their quest for a nation built on these foundations deserves he attention, respect and solidarity of theCaribbean Community,” Archbishop Gordon added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: AEC Antilles Episcopal Conference Caribbean Caricom Jason Gordon prayer Roman Catholic Venezuela \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump blames bruised hand on aspirin, denies falling asleep \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump blamed aspirin for large bruises on his hand and denied falling asleep whi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n France plans social media ban for children under 15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n PARIS, France (AFP) — France will make a fresh attempt to protect children from excessive screen time, proposing a ban on social media access for chil... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trinidad central bank warns US/Venezuela tension affecting local economy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) – The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) says domestically, the fluid geopolitical tension between the United ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Saudi Arabia sets executions record in 2025, putting 356 people to death \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AFP) — Saudi authorities executed 356 people in 2025, according to an AFP tally, setting a new record for the number of i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Governor General calls for honest reflection in 2026 New Year’s message \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n Governor General Sir Patrick Allen is calling on Jamaicans to reflect honestly on 2025 and move forward with hope in 2026.

Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America via AFP\nThroughout the first year of Mr Trump’s second term, speculation has grown about his physical condition, triggered in large part by photos of dark bruises on his hands, which the White House has blamed on vigorous hand-shaking in addition to his aspirin regime.\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” the President told the outlet.\n“I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\nThe US President also confirmed to the Journal that now Attorney-General Pam Bondi made his hand bleed when she clipped him with her ring while giving a high-five during the Republican National Convention in July 2024.\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” said Mr Trump, adding that he uses makeup that’s “easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds” to conceal cuts and bruises.\n\nMakeup covers a bruise on the back of Mr Trump’s hand on February 24, 2025. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nThe chatter has also been triggered by instances of the President appearing to doze off during meetings and the Journal reported that allies and friends of Mr Trump have to raise their voices in meetings as he strains to hear them. \nThe President denied both claims in the interview.\n“Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink,” Mr Trump said of the shut-eye snaps.\nOfficial reports from White House physician Dr Sean Barbabella have described Mr Trump as being in “excellent overall health”, with the President himself crediting his “very good genetics”.\n“Let’s talk about health again for the 25th time,” the Journal quoted an exasperated Mr Trump as saying at the start of the interview. “My health is perfect”.\n\nThe President’s bruises have led to much speculation. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nDr Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the US Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services, vouched for Mr Trump’s capabilities to the Journal, saying, “As a clinician, you look for clues in people, even if they’re not your patient, and he is just with it on some fairly complex topics.”\n“I can’t even think of a single time where he said something where I don’t think he understands the issue here,” added Dr Oz.\n“He may want you to do something that is, you know, is arguable whether it’s the right path to go, but it’s a very rational approach to it.”\nIn July, the White House acknowledged that Mr Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a blood circulation issue that has caused swelling in his lower legs.\nThe President acknowledged that he had tried to wear compression socks to help treat the condition, but later stopped because “I didn’t like them”.\n\nJoe Biden speaks during a farewell ceremony on January 20, 2025. Picture: Allison Robbert/AFP\nChatter about Mr Trump’s health accelerated again after the October 10 check up which included what the President initially described as an MRI, but which he and Dr Barbabella clarified to the Journal was a CT scan.\n“It wasn’t an MRI,” the President said. “It was less than that. It was a scan”.\nThe imaging was not publicly disclosed by the White House until Mr Trump revealed it to journalists more than two weeks later while on an official trip through Asia.\nIn a statement after the Journal article was published, Dr Barbabella said Mr Trump had initially gone to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre to meet with hospital staff and wounded service members.\n“In order to make the most of the President’s time at the hospital, we recommended he undergo another routine physical evaluation to ensure continued optimal health,” the doctor said.\n“As part of that examination, we asked the President if he would undergo advanced imaging — either an MRI or CT scan — to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.\n“The President agreed, and our team of consultants performed a CT scan. \n“As we revealed in the post-examination report, the advanced imaging was perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.”\nIn a separate statement, Dr Barbabella claimed Mr Trump’s “cardiovascular health puts him 14 years younger than his age”.\n“Overall, the President remains in exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief,” he said.\n\nMore Coverage\n‘Defeat’: Trump pulls troops after setback\nLouis Casiano — Fox News\nStreets erupt as nation’s currency crashes\nJamie Seidel\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added on Thursday, “The President’s physicians and the White House have always maintained the President received advanced imaging.\n“Additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the President himself, because he continues to be the most transparent and open President in history and has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline.”\nThis article originally appeared on NY Post and was reproduced with permission\nRead related topics:Donald Trump\n\nMore related stories\n\nSecret docs reveal Howard’s doomed policy\nThe ill-fated WorkChoices policy was developed in the context of a widely held belief the government was being “undermined”, new documents reveal.\n\n‘Rampant’: Former PM unleashes on Albo\nA former prime minister has launched a blistering attack on Anthony Albanese over his response to the Bondi Beach terror attack.\n\nPM humiliated by Frydenberg’s fury\nAustralia has waited for a leader to step up after the Bondi terrorism attack.

Reuters said it could not confirm either version.\n\nSeparately, Iran International reported that a 37-year-old man was shot dead in Fooladshahr, in Isfahan province, during overnight protests. \n\nIran International said it verified the man’s identity and reviewed video footage, while provincial police confirmed the death of a 37-year-old citizen without providing further details.\n\nSix women who were detained during protests in Tehran have been transferred to the women’s ward of Evin prison, US-based rights group Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and other administration officials voiced support for the demonstrators this week. Speaking on Monday, Mr Trump pointed to Iran’s economic collapse and longstanding public discontent, while stopping short of explicitly calling for regime change.\n\nMaryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, issued a statement on the continuing protests, noting, “The four-day uprising by merchants, students, and other sectors of society signals the Iranian people’s determination to be free from religious tyranny. \n\n“This wretched regime is doomed to be overthrown by the risen populace and rebellious youth. The final word is spoken in the streets by the people and the rebellious youth, those with nothing left to lose. This regime must go.”\n\nThe unrest comes as Iran’s economy remains under severe strain from years of international sanctions, high inflation and currency depreciation. \n\nAuthorities declared a nationwide shutdown on Wednesday, officially citing extreme cold weather, and said the government offered to hold talks with representatives of merchants and trade unions over what it described as “legitimate demands”.\n\nAnother influential dissident leader, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of the late Shah of Iran, took to X and appealed to the international community “to stand with the people of Iran”. \n\nHe continued in part, “The current regime has reached the end of the road. It stands at its most fragile: weak, deeply divided, and unable to suppress the courage of a rising nation. The growing protests show this year will be the definitive moment for change.”\n\nIran has faced repeated waves of unrest over the past decade. \n\nWhile nationwide protests in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini centred on women’s rights and state repression, the current demonstrations are rooted primarily in economic grievances, with protesters in several cities now openly directing their anger at Iran’s political leadership.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News and was reproduced with permission","summary":"Unrest has deepened across Iran as protesters continue to clash with security forces, with reports that several people have been killed.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/end-of-the-road-iran-protests-turn-deadly-as-antiregime-demonstrations-enter-fifth-day/news-story/f03478aa27768f9b356cd1bcc117caea?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ef3fd8c857537a97374e138b230d6029","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 01:24:05","author":"Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp","authors":["Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":390650260,"title":"Venezuela releases more prisoners amid US pressure campaign: Rights groups  - Dominica Gazette –","text":"The government of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro has released dozens of prisoners held for protesting his disputed victory in the country’s 2024 election.\n\nThe release of at least 87 prisoners comes as the administration of United States President Donald Trump has continued its pressure campaign against Caracas.\n\nIt was the second release within a week, in what some observers have viewed as an effort by Maduro to strike a more conciliatory tone, even as he has accused Trump of seeking to topple his government and seize Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.\n\nTwo rights groups, the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners and the Committee of Mothers in Defense of the Truth, confirmed the release on Thursday.\n\n“On the morning of January 1, mothers and relatives reported new releases of political prisoners from Tocoron prison in Aragua state” in northern Venezuela, the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners wrote on social media.\n\nVenezuela’s government had previously announced the release of 99 prisoners on December 25, calling it “a concrete expression of the State’s commitment to peace, dialogue and justice”.\n\nHowever, Foro Penal, a leading Venezuelan rights group, said afterwards it was only able to verify the release of 61 prisoners at the time.\n\nMaduro claimed victory in the July 2024 vote, maintaining he had secured a third six-year term.

She has been more circumspect on strikes on Venezuelan territory, while maintaining that Venezuela has been “invaded” by “terrorist groups” and “drug cartels”.\n\nVenezuela experts have warned that many opposition groups in the country oppose US military action.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/venezuela-releases-more-prisoners-amid-us-pressure-campaign-rights-groups/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/getty_6956f53b10-1767306555-eIhuvh.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 01:11:35","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":390646366,"title":"Dollar makes a soft start to 2026 after sharpest drop in 8 years","text":"SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar made a feeble start to 2026 on Friday after struggling against most currencies last year, while the yen steadied near 10-month lows as traders awaited economic data this month to gauge the path of interest rates. A dwindling interest rate difference between the U.S. and other economies has cast a shadow over the currency market, resulting in most currencies gaining sharply against the dollar in 2025, with the yen an exception. The euro was steady at $1.1752 in early Asian hours after surging 13.5% last year, while sterling last bought $1.3474 following a 7.7% increase in 2025. Both currencies clocked their steepest annual rises since 2017. The yen was last at 156.74 per U.S. dollar after rising less than 1% against the greenback in 2025 and hovering close to the 10-month low of 157.90 it touched in November that sparked worries of intervention from Tokyo. Severe verbal warnings from authorities in Tokyo through December managed to push the yen away from the intervention zone but those fears still linger. With markets in Japan and China closed, volumes are likely to be thin and moves muted during Asian hours. Anthony Doyle, chief investment strategist at Pinnacle Investment Management, said the global economy enters 2026 with reasonable momentum, with the probability of recession remaining low. \"Outside of the United States, the central bank rate cut impulse is fading, which is a feature not a bug: fewer rate surprises reduce one-way market moves and raise the importance of selection across regions, factors and asset classes.\" The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six other units, was at 98.243 after registering a 9.4% decline in 2025, its biggest drop in eight years as interest rate cuts, erratic trade policies and worries about the Federal Reserve's independence under the Trump administration weighed. Economic data including the U.S. payrolls report and jobless data are due next week and will provide clues on the health of the labour market and where U.S. rates may end up this year. Much of the focus in the early part of the year will also be on who U.S. President Donald Trump picks to be the next Fed Chair as current head Jerome Powell's term ends in May. Investors are bracing for Trump's pick to be more dovish and cut rates after Trump repeatedly criticised the Fed and Powell last year for not cutting rates more swiftly or deeply. Traders are pricing in two rate cuts in the year compared to one predicted by a divided Fed. \"We expect that concerns around central bank independence will extend into 2026, and see the upcoming change in Fed leadership as one of several reasons why risks around our Fed funds rate forecast skew dovish,\" Goldman strategists said. The Australian and New Zealand dollars both started the new year on the front foot. The Aussie was 0.1% higher at $0.66805 after a nearly 8% rise in 2025, its strongest yearly performance since 2020. The kiwi snapped its three-year losing streak with a nearly 3% gain last year. On Friday, it was little changed at $0.5755. (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)

George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,” Trump wrote.\n\n“Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,” the president added. “He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics.”\n\nReferring to the US midterm elections on 3 November, Clooney told the Hollywood Reporter in response: “I totally agree with the current president.

They will also have to pass a civic knowledge test.\n\nBut Clooney has conceded that his French remains poor. “I love the French culture, your language, even if I’m still bad at it after 400 days of courses,” the actor told RTL radio – in English – in December.\n\nHis wife, an international human rights lawyer and dual UK-Lebanese national, speaks fluent French.\n\nClooney bought the Domaine du Canadel, a former wine estate, near the Provence town of Brignoles, in 2021.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 1, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Trump blames bruised hand on aspirin, denies falling asleep \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump blamed aspirin for large bruises on his hand and denied falling asleep while attending public meetings in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday.\n\nIn the interview defending his health, Trump also changed his previous statement about receiving an MRI scan in October, saying it was instead a quicker CT scan.\n\nTrump, who at 79 is the oldest person to assume the US presidency, told the Journal “my health is perfect” and expressed frustration with scrutiny of his well-being.\n\nTrump has based much of his political image on projecting vigor — whether through his frequent interactions with journalists, constant social media posting, or AI memes depicting him as a superhero.\n\nHowever, the first year of his second term in office has raised growing questions.\n\nHis right hand shows persistent bruising, often covered with thick makeup and at times a bandage, and his ankles have appeared swollen.\n\nOn occasion, Trump has clearly struggled to keep his eyes open, including during a televised Oval Office meeting with health representatives in November — a politically sensitive issue for someone who constantly frames his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as “sleepy.”\n\nBiden left office a year ago at 82, making him the oldest president in history — a record Trump is set to surpass during his current term.\n\nTrump rarely exercises beyond outings at his golf courses and for years has made no secret of his love for high-fat, high-sodium fast food.\n\n– Bruising and ‘blinking’ –\n\nThe Republican explained the bruising on his hand as the result of aspirin that he takes daily to thin his blood. “I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” he told the Journal.\n\nHe said he applies makeup or bandages when his hand is “whacked.”\n\nOne cut, he said, was caused when his attorney general Pam Bondi hit the back of his hand with her ring while giving him a high-five.\n\nExplanations of his health issues have been inconsistent.\n\nTrump himself told reporters that he underwent an MRI scan in October, but said at the time he had “no idea what they analysed.”\n\n“Whatever they analysed, they analysedit well, and they said that I had as good a result as they’ve ever seen,” he said initially.\n\nTo the Journal, Trump said it was not an MRI, “it was less than that. It was a scan.”\n\nTrump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, confirmed to the newspaper that a CT scan — a procedure that takes far less time than an MRI — was done “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nTrump pushed back against any idea that he falls asleep in public.\n\n“I’ve never been a big sleeper,” Trump said.\n\nInstances where he appears to be dozing off are just moments of relaxation, he said.\n\n“I’ll just close. It’s very relaxing to me,” he said. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Donald Trump Health sleep \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Old Harbour United acquire Spanish Town Police FC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2026 \n\n\n Old Harbour United Football Club say they have acquired bottom-placed Jamaica Premier League side Spanish Town Police.

The reports say the agreement came immediately after an overnight meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago at the start of the week.\n\nThe move is being described as a fixed deadline rather than an opening for negotiations. Israeli and US teams are already reportedly working simultaneously to determine what they describe as \"practical disarmament.\" This after Hamas has effectively been defeated since it launched the brutal Oct.7, 2023 terror assault on southern Israel.\n\nAnother key focus is the dismantling of Hamas’s underground tunnel network throughout Gaza, which Israeli officials consider a core element of the group’s military strength.\n\nHamas has throughout the Gaza war proven itself effective in guerilla and insurgency tactics, utilizing small teams to maneuver quickly in and out of the tunnels, even at times taking out IDF tanks with IEDs. Sometimes bombs are even attached to Israeli armor vehicles by hand in these ambushes, after which a Hamas militant darts back into an underground tunnel, as has been demonstrated in various videos.\n\nSources quoted by Israel Hayom said Israeli officials doubt Hamas that would be willing or able to relinquish most of its weapons or military capabilities within the two-month window.\n\nFrom the perspective of Hamas leadership, the moment it fully gives up its weapons means the group is effectively dead and will have no more influence to govern in the future.\n\nBut this is also exactly what the US-Israeli plan and the ceasefire calls for: the effective end of Hamas rule in governance in the Gaza Strip forever.\n\nPM Netanyahu while giving media interviews during his December US trip described that Hamas still possesses \"around 60,000\" Kalashnikov rifles and \"hundreds of kilometers\" of tunnels.\n\nHe has vowed that Hamas disarmament can be achieved \"the easy way\" or the hard way - that is through military force. But as of last summer, Hamas was insistent that it will never give up its weapons.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Hamas leadership won't be able to induce all of its fighters and 'ground troops' to give up their weapons - again, as they would fear being tracked down and killed by Israeli forces.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/us-israel-set-firm-2-month-deadline-full-hamas-disarmament","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/hamasarms.jpg?itok=EJb3PmD_","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:45:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.243},{"id":390649590,"title":"Zohran Mamdani Kicks Off Term with Bold Socialist Agenda, Aiming for Transformative Change","text":"On his inaugural day, Zohran Mamdani made headlines by issuing a flurry of executive orders, declaring his intent to “govern as a democratic socialist” during his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nFollowing a grand celebration in Manhattan, the newly appointed mayor swiftly moved to Brooklyn, where he rolled out numerous executive directives. These actions were in line with his campaign commitments to support tenant rights, including a proposal to halt rent increases.\n\nTo bolster tenant protection, Mamdani announced the establishment of specialized task forces. Additionally, he introduced measures aimed at streamlining development projects within the city.\n\nAmong his orders was the revitalization of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants, appointing Cea Weaver, a noted advocate for housing justice, to spearhead the initiative.\n\nFurthermore, Mamdani revealed the city’s intervention in an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding involving the landlord, Pinnacle.\n\nIn a decisive departure from his predecessor, one of Mamdani’s initial actions was signing a comprehensive order that nullified most of the executive orders issued by former Mayor Eric Adams after his indictment in September 2024.\n\n‘We speak about this day as a new era. And in order to fulfill that hope, we have to reckon with why so many New Yorkers have turned away from politics over the last few months, the last few years, the last few decades,’ the 34-year-old said. \n\n‘That was a date that marked a moment when many New Yorkers decided politics held nothing for them.’\n\nThe move revoked every order given by Adams after September 26, 2024, when the former Democrat was indicted by a federal grand jury following a wide-ranging corruption investigation that has seen several top officials resign. \n\nMamdani said many of the revocations were symbolic and would be reissued, including one maintaining the city’s Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nThe city’s first Muslim mayor, he has been seen with skepticism by some Jewish New Yorkers over his ardent support of the Palestinian cause. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the mayor for comment. \n\nAt his inauguration, Mamdani made it clear that he would not be moderating his left-wing views as he took office. \n\n‘I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,’ he said. \n\n‘The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations. Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously.’\n\nSocialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders – a Brooklyn native – was there to oversee the swearing in of Mamdani, while fellow lefty Queens politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also in attendance. \n\n‘This is a government of New York, by New York, and for New York,’ Mamdani promised.\n\nMamdani is New York City’s first Muslim mayor and one of the youngest men ever to occupy the position. His wife, Rama Duwaji, 28, is the city’s youngest ever first lady. \n\nDuwaji has kept a low profile during Mamdani’s campaign but showed her support during his inauguration, walking side-by-side with her husband and tearing up while he spoke. \n\nMamdani struck a more positive tone at his inauguration than in his fiery acceptance speech in November.\n\nThe democratic socialist didn’t mince words when beating his opponent, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, telling his supporters on Election Night that it would be the last time he’d utter the man’s name. \n\nMamdani had concluded his speech with a direct message to President Donald Trump: ‘I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.’\n\nThe mayor opted for a softer tone in his inauguration remarks, referring to the president only once.\n\nHe reached out to voters who backed Donald Trump in the presidential election and him in the mayoral election, saying he understood that the rocketing cost of living was their primary concern.\n\n‘Many of these people have been betrayed by the established order. But in our administration, their needs will be met,’ Mamdani said. \n\n‘Their hopes and dreams and interests will be reflected transparently in government. They will shape our future.’ \n\nMamdani met with Trump in the Oval Office in November 2025, with the Republican president full of praise for the new star of the Democrat party. \n\nMamdani , who was born in Uganda, has promised to offer free daycare and free buses across the city.\n\nHe also plans to enact a millionaire tax, with critics warning that his policies could drive out the super-rich, whose taxes fund public services in the Big Apple.\n\nMamdani referred to the ‘long-broken property tax system’ in his speech, vowing to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. \n\n‘The cost of child care will no longer discourage young adults from starting a family, because we will deliver universal child care for the many by taxing the wealthiest few,’ he declared. \n\nMamdani seemed to take a page out of Sanders’ book, echoing the veteran senator’s longtime vows to tax the wealthy to provide social services for the middle class.\n\nThe theme of embarking on a ‘new era’ was reiterated throughout Thursday’s speeches. \n\nMamdani’s campaign sparked widespread conversation about the future of the Democratic Party and whether younger politicians would continue to embrace socialist policies.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn his inaugural day, Zohran Mamdani made headlines by issuing a flurry&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Zohran Mamdani Kicks Off Term with Bold

Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2026.\nAt 8am, the local currency rose to 4.0540/4.0645 versus the US dollar from Wednesday’s close of 4.0580/4.0620.\nMarkets were closed on Thursday for New Year’s Day.\nAccording to reports, the Fed is expected to implement further interest rate cuts in 2026, amid open pressure from US President Donald Trump for a more dovish central bank leadership.\nIt noted that such expectations have weighed on the greenback, as Trump has publicly stated that he wants the next Fed chairman to keep interest rates low and never “disagree” with the US president.\nThese remarks have heightened concerns among investors and policymakers concerning the independence of the Fed.\nMeanwhile, IPPFA’s director of investment strategy and country economist, Sedek Jantan, said the local note was stronger in line with regional currencies, supported by a firmer Bloomberg Asia Dollar Index as broad-based Asian currency strength re-emerged.\nHe said in 2025, the US Dollar Index (DXY) declined by approximately 9.6%, reflecting a sustained easing in US dollar exceptionalism.\n“With Asia’s macro outlook continuing to improve, most visibly through China’s Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rising to a six-month high as both manufacturing and services returned to expansion, the ringgit is well positioned to extend its strengthening trend into 2026 against the US dollar,” he added.\nAt the open, the ringgit traded mostly lower against a basket of major currencies.\nIt appreciated against the Japanese yen to 2.5864/2.5933 from 2.5907/2.5934 on Wednesday, but it was slightly lower versus the British pound to 5.4624/5.4765 from 5.4531/5.4585, and eased vis-a-vis the euro to 4.7635/4.7758 from 4.7617/4.7664.\nHowever, the local note was mostly higher against Asean peers.\nIt rose against the Singapore dollar to 3.1541/3.1628 from 3.1550/3.1584, gained versus the Thai baht to 12.8291/12.8742 from 12.8560/12.8756, strengthened vis-a-vis the Indonesian

But let no one be in any doubt: No matter what happens, we will stand firm on what is right and wrong.\"\n\nSince returning to office in 2025 Trump has stepped up his demands for Greenland to become part of the U.S., at times even suggesting he may mount a military invasion to make it happen.\n\nLast week he sparked fresh outrage from Danish leaders by naming Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry as the U.S. special envoy to the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark but largely self-governing.\n\n\"We need it for national protection,\" Trump insisted during a press conference on December 23. \"They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago or something with a boat. Well, we were there with boats too, I’m sure. So we’ll have to work it all out.\"\n\nPolls have found that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose becoming part of the U.S. \n\nIn early December, Denmark's intelligence service branded the U.S. as a potential threat to its national security for the first time in history, citing its willingness to use economic and military power to \"enforce its will... even against allies.\"\n\nKing Frederik's speech did not mention Trump specifically, but warned that geopolitics is becoming more dangerous amid the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine and Russian covert operations against its European allies.\n\n\"Our greatest strength is to stand united – in the Kingdom of Denmark, in Europe and in NATO,\" he said, citing a new Arctic training program in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland as an example of Denmark's \"stronger defense.\"\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, is continuing to recruit unpaid interns to help push forward Trump's annexation plans — potentially at the expense of local taxpayers.\n\nIn a job listing spotted by the European news site Euractiv, and first posted in 2023, the Consulate advertises four to six month internships giving ambitious students the chance to help \"communicate U.S. foreign policy priorities to Greenlandic audiences.\"\n\nUnpaid internships are reportedly the norm in Denmark, with applicants often supported by generous student subsidies while they work and learn.

The White House had previously been vague about the details of this examination.\n\nThe interview, which was released on Thursday, saw Trump expressing regret over the decision to have this comprehensive imaging of his heart and abdomen at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He noted that the procedure sparked unnecessary public scrutiny regarding his health. A memo from his physician, shared by the White House in December, explained that the “advanced imaging” was a preventative measure appropriate for someone of his age.\n\nInitially, Trump mistakenly referred to the procedure as an MRI but later acknowledged he was unsure about which part of his body was scanned. Unlike an MRI, a CT scan is faster, though it provides less detailed images of tissue differences.\n\nAccording to a statement from Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, the president’s doctor, released by the White House on Thursday, the October examination coincided with Trump’s visit to Walter Reed, where he was scheduled to meet with staff. Trump had previously completed his annual physical in April.\n\n“During President Trump’s October visit to Walter Reed Medical Hospital, he was scheduled to engage with the staff and soldiers,” Barbabella explained. “To maximize the President’s visit, we recommended an additional routine health checkup to maintain his excellent health status.”\n\nBarbabella further noted that he advised either a CT scan or MRI to conclusively eliminate any cardiovascular concerns. The results were reportedly “perfectly normal,” with no abnormalities detected.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday that the president’s doctors and the White House have “always maintained the President received advanced imaging” but said that “additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the President himself” because he “has nothing to hide.”\n\n“In retrospect, it’s too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,” Trump said in the interview with The Wall Street Journal. “I would have been a lot better off if they didn’t, because the fact that I took it said, ‘Oh gee, is something wrong?’ Well, nothing’s wrong.”\n\nThe 79-year-old became the oldest person to take the oath of office when he was sworn in as president last year and has been sensitive to questions about his health, particularly as he has repeatedly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office. \n\nBiden, who turned 82 in the last year of his presidency, was dogged by scrutiny of his age and mental acuity at the end of his tenure and during his abandoned attempt to seek reelection.\n\nBut questions have also swirled around Trump’s health this year as he’s been seen with bruising on the back of his right hand that has been conspicuous despite a slathering of makeup on top, along with noticeable swelling at his ankles. \n\nThe White House this summer said the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older adults. The condition happens when veins in the legs can’t properly carry blood back to the heart and it pools in the lower legs. \n\nIn the interview, Trump said he briefly tried wearing compression socks to address the swelling but stopped because he didn’t like them.\n\nThe bruising on Trump’s hand, according to Leavitt, is from “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,” which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nHe said he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend but said he has resisted taking less because he’s been taking it for 25 years and said he is “a little superstitious.” Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily, according to Barbabella.\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump, in the interview, denied he has fallen asleep during White House meetings when cameras have caught him with his eyes closed, instead insisting he was resting his eyes or blinking.\n\n“I’ll just close. It’s very relaxing to me,” he said. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink.”\n\nHe said that he’s never slept much at night, a habit he also described during his first term, and said he starts his day early in the White House residence before moving to the Oval Office around 10 a.m. and working until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. \n\nThe president dismissed questions about his hearing, saying he only struggled to hear “when there’s a lot of people talking,” and said he has plenty of energy, which he credited to his genes. \n\n“Genetics are very important,” he said. “And I have very good genetics.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Debunks Health Rumors: Reveals Exclusive Insights on Recent Medical Screening and Energy Levels first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-debunks-health-rumors-reveals-exclusive-insights-on-recent-medical-screening-and-energy-levels/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1767313432_Trump-in-interview-defends-his-energy-and-health-offers-new.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:24:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":390639000,"title":"Dollar falls most since 2017 on Fed rate cut bets","text":"ReutersTrump recently teased that he has a preferred candidate to succeed Powell, but is in no hurry to make an announcement- while also musing that he might fire the central bank's current leader.\n\nThe dollar ended 2025 with the sharpest annual retreat in eight years and investors say more declines are coming if the next Federal Reserve chief opts for deeper interest-rate cuts as anticipated. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell about 8% this year and traders are betting on further weakness. After tumbling in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariff rollout in April, the greenback failed to rebound much in part on expectations that Trump will name a dovish successor to Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends next year. \"The biggest factor for the dollar in first quarter will be the Fed,\" said Yusuke Miyairi, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura. \"And it's not just the meetings in January and March, but who will be the Fed chair after Jerome Powell ends his term.\"Agencies With at least two rate reductions priced in for next year, the Fed's policy path diverges from some of its developed peers, dimming the dollar's appeal. Traders raised their bearish dollar wagers in the week through December 23, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data reported Wednesday. Options pointed to further dollar weakness in January with some moderation in the following months.

In Canada, Sweden and Australia, meanwhile, traders are wagering on hikes.Live Events The dollar gauge was little changed Wednesday after rising as much as 0.2% earlier as Labour Department data showed applications for US unemployment benefits fell last week to one of the lowest levels this year. The greenback index fell 1.2% in December.Bloomberg Trump recently teased that he has a preferred candidate to succeed Powell, but is in no hurry to make an announcement- while also musing that he might fire the central bank's current leader. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett has long been seen as the leading candidate, while Trump also expressed interest in former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman and BlackRock's Rick Rieder are also seen as being in the running. \"Hassett would be more or less priced in since he has been the frontrunner for some time now, but Warsh or Waller would likely not be as quick to cut, which would be better for the dollar,\" said Andrew Hazlett, a foreign-exchange trader at Monex Inc.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onFederal ReserveDollar FallsBloomberg Dollar Spot IndexUSD exchange rate\n\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Does that make sense?”\n\n“They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” Trump added. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years, and what it does do is it causes bruising.”\n\nThe interview appeared to be one of the most extensive conservations Trump has had with journalists on his health, as scrutiny has intensified this year over his age, fitness for office and whether he’s being sufficiently transparent with his medical information. Trump has long had bruising on his right hand, which CNN has reported predated his return to the White House. But it drew more attention after he began trying to cover it with heavy makeup and bandages and shield it from cameras with his other hand. Observers have also raised concerns about swelling in his legs and his appearing to doze during public events.\n\nTrump’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, told the Journal that the president takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily. According to Mayo Clinic, a low dose of aspirin, which “can help prevent heart attack or stroke,” ranges from 75 to 100 milligrams and 81 milligrams is commonly recommended. The Mayo Clinic also says that for aspirin therapy, the daily dose “is usually between” 75 to 325 milligrams.\n\nAspirin helps thin the blood, which can prevent clots from forming, but it also comes with the risk of excessive bleeding. In recent years, medical guidelines stopped recommending daily aspirin for many adults because the risks outweigh the benefits, and some suggest halting aspirin therapy entirely when patients are in their 70s.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor at George Washington University’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences who was a longtime cardiologist for former Vice President Dick Cheney, said the latest updates from Trump and his team raise more questions than they answer.\n\n“It’s uncommon to see that kind of bruising with one aspirin a day,” Reiner said. “My question is, ‘Does the president take any medications that have not been disclosed by the White House?’”\n\nBarbabella said Thursday that Trump “remains in exceptional health.”\n\n“President Trump’s medical evaluations and laboratory results continue to show excellent metabolic health, and have revealed his cardiovascular health puts him 14 years younger than his age. Overall, the President remains in exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief,” he said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAcross a series of events last week, Trump — who last year became the oldest president to take the oath of office — appeared with discoloration or light bruising on the back of his left hand, in addition to the more persistent bruise on his right hand that has been visible for months.\n\nThe White House has previously explained that the bruising on his right hand is due to constant handshaking along with a regular regimen of aspirin that can make such discoloration more common.\n\nReiner said 325 milligrams of aspirin each day is not a very high dose, but there’s no medical reason to take that much on a daily basis. When someone sprains an ankle, he said, they might get a 325 milligrams of aspirin every four hours, which would be considered a high dose.\n\n“Aspirin has been studied in varied doses, and the reason why 81 milligrams is given to people is that’s the dose which appears to have the best combination of protection from clotting events and bleeding caused by the drug,” Reiner said. “In other words, 325 milligrams increases the bleeding risk but doesn’t increase the efficacy. So we never use that.”\n\n“The big issue here is transparency. All of these issues just highlight how opaque The White House has been about the president’s health,” he added.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also discussed a scan he underwent in October, which he previously described to reporters as an MRI. At the time, the president gave little detail around the procedure or what physicians were seeking to explore, telling reporters they should ask his doctors.\n\nWhen asked about the scan by the Journal, Trump said it wasn’t an MRI but rather a CT scan. “It wasn’t an MRI,” Trump said. “It was less than that. It was a scan.”\n\nBarbabella said Thursday the CT scan was done “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.” Last month, Barbabella released a memo saying the October medical imaging was of Trump’s cardiovascular and abdominal systems and that both showed “perfectly normal” results. In 2018, Trump had a coronary CT scan that did show some abnormalities — a steady build-up of plaque in his blood vessels, indicating moderate heart disease.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration’s transparency about testing Trump’s received, saying in a Thursday statement, “The President’s physicians and the White House have always maintained the President received advanced imaging.”\n\n“Additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the President himself, because he continues to be the most transparent and open president in history and has nothing to hide,” she added, while criticizing Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nTrump also addressed steps he has taken to treat other conditions, including swelling in his lower legs that the White House announced in July was due to chronic venous insufficiency — a common condition frequently found in older people.\n\nTrump told the Journal he tried compression socks but “didn’t like them.” He also suggested he was not interested in taking up regular exercise.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump said. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe Journal also asked the president about his appearing to doze off at recent public events and about his hearing. Trump defended himself on both scores.\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting last month, Trump closed his eyes for several seconds at a time. Similarly, during a November 6 event in the Oval Office, the president appeared to close his eyes or struggle to keep them open. But Trump told the Journal he didn’t actually fall asleep.\n\n“I’ll just close. It’s very relaxing to me,” he said of his eyes being shut. “Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink.”\n\nOf his hearing, Trump said he only struggled “when there’s a lot of people talking,” but otherwise downplayed any concerns.\n\nBefore and after his election, Trump questioned his predecessor’s fitness to serve, even alleging Biden was unaware of actions signed in his name using the autopen, which Biden denies. Biden dropped out of the 2024 race following a disastrous debate performance that further fueled concerns and criticism over his health and ability to serve.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” said State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott.\n\n“The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including by force or coercion,” he added.\n\nChina fired missiles and deployed jets and naval vessels earlier this week in a simulation of military actions to encircle Taiwan, which Beijing claims as an integral part of its territory and has vowed to bring under its control.\n\nChinese military drills have become a frequent occurrence, causing few disruptions to life on the self-governed island, whose status the US has not officially weighed in on.\n\nBut Beijing’s assertive stance has prompted angry condemnations from Taiwanese officials, and crackdowns on formerly autonomous areas such as Hong Kong following integration with China have bolstered scepticism about the prospects of possible reunification with Beijing.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to resolutely defend national sovereignty and strengthen national defence,” Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said on Thursday.\n\nLai has called for a $40bn increase in Taiwan’s military spending, but the proposal is stalled in the country’s legislature, where the opposition party currently holds a majority.\n\n“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” the president said, adding that Taiwan must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best”.\n\nWhile US lawmakers often make strong statements of support for Taiwan, US policy towards the island has been marked by ambiguity for decades and does not include an assurance of military support in the event of an invasion by China.\n\nThe US recently approved an $11bn arms package for Taiwan, but President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he did not believe China had plans to launch an invasion of Taiwan in the near future.\n\n“I have a great relationship with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping]. And he hasn’t told me anything about it. I certainly have seen it,” Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\n“They’ve been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area.

Winning over actual car buyers was another story.\n\nShares in the world’s most valuable auto company soared in the second half, largely on the basis of its chief executive officer touting advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. But the progress Mr Musk trumpeted didn’t translate to success in showrooms – the company likely sold fewer vehicles in the last six months than a year earlier, despite record deliveries in the third quarter.\n\nOn Jan 2, Tesla is expected to report that it delivered around 440,900 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2025, down 11 per cent from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla took the unusual step this week of publishing its own average of analyst estimates that was even more pessimistic, calling for a 15 per cent decline.\n\nWall Street has grown similarly gloomy about the outlook for 2026. This time two years ago, analysts were predicting Tesla would deliver more than 3 million vehicles. That average estimate for deliveries this year has plunged to roughly 1.8 million.\n\n“Tesla investors are focused on how the company might look five, 10, 15 years down the road, and really discounting what they see in the near term,” Garrett Nelson, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, said by phone. “The question is, can they maintain that, especially when we think headwinds are going to become more apparent in the financials?”\n\nTopsy-turvy\n\nEven by the standards of Mr Musk and Tesla – two names synonymous with turbulence – 2025 was a tumultuous year.\n\nThe carmaker’s vehicle sales got off to a dismal start, partly due to the company retooling production lines at each of its auto plants for the redesigned Model Y, its most popular vehicle. Another major factor was the intense backlash against its CEO’s work for US President Donald Trump.\n\nBy early April, when Mr Musk was publicly feuding with members of the administration over tariff policy, Tesla’s stock had plummeted 45 per cent for the year.\n\nMr Musk spurred the recovery by stepping back from government and returning to work on a longtime goal: starting a ride-hailing business with cars he’s said will eventually be autonomous.\n\nIn June, Tesla launched an invite-only Robotaxi service in Austin, with safety operators on board to supervise each of the Model Ys ferrying Musk fans around the Texas capital. While the vehicles violated traffic laws on day one – drawing the attention of a federal regulator that’s opened multiple investigations into the company’s driving systems – investors have shrugged off the safety concerns.\n\nTesla’s board then proposed a new compensation package for Mr Musk in September, offering a payout potentially worth US$1 trillion (S$1.28 trillion) depending on milestones including delivering millions of robotaxis. Soon after, the comeback was complete – Tesla shares were trading higher for the year.\n\nWhen the stock closed at a new all-time high on Dec 16, the company had added more than US$915 billion in market capitalisation in just over eight months.\n\nNeed convincing\n\nBut while Tesla’s robotaxi prospects have captivated investors, car buyers have been relatively circumspect.\n\nMr Musk himself has acknowledged challenges persuading consumers to purchase what Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, a suite of features that still require human supervision. Allegations that Tesla is misleading Californians by exaggerating the automated-driving capabilities of its vehicles could lead to the state suspending the company’s sales licence for 30 days in early 2026.\n\nTesla’s attempt to distinguish itself in China’s crowded electric vehicle market with driver-assistance functions also isn’t working out, with companies including BYD and Xiaomi offering similar systems as standard features.\n\nDue largely to BYD’s far higher sales in China and surge of momentum in Europe – where Tesla has been unable to obtain regulatory approval for FSD – analysts expect the Chinese carmaker to have \n\nMoving forward\n\nAfter a widely anticipated annual sales decline – its second in a row – Tesla has more hurdles to contend with in 2026. The United States has ceased offering federal tax credits for EV purchases and leases, which Mr Musk has warned could lead to “a few rough quarters.”\n\nSome see a silver lining in the withdrawal of US policy support, which has led major manufacturers to pull back from EV investments. Ford Motor said in December it expects to record about US$19.5 billion in charges tied to abandoning EV and battery projects that were destined to lose money.\n\nMr Musk ended the year by building anticipation for Cybercab, a two-seat compact car with butterfly doors. While the prototype he first unveiled in late 2024 lacked a steering wheel or pedals, Tesla’s board chair Robyn Denholm told Bloomberg News in October that the company will sell the car with those components if required by regulators.

Mamdani, 34, took the oath of office and pledged to govern as a democratic socialist. “Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously,” he said in his speech, where he promised to freeze rents, expand public childcare, and invest in transit. The remarks were delivered to a crowd of thousands outside City Hall, with appearances by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The event was marked by diverse religious invocations, cultural performances, and progressive rhetoric — all of which drew swift condemnation from conservative figures. Why It Matters Mamdani was officially sworn in on Thursday, taking office as mayor of the nation’s largest city after New York recorded its highest mayoral turnout in decades. His victory last year stunned the political establishment, defeating Republican Curtis Sliwa and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who mounted an independent bid after losing the Democratic primary. His improbable rise was fueled by a campaign centered on a small set of concrete promises, including freezing rent, making city buses free, and guaranteeing universal child care. What To Know Mamdani’s decision to be sworn in on the Quran, the inclusion of Islamic performers, and a prayer from Imam Khalid Latif drew sharp criticism from conservative figures. He used two Qurans during the ceremony—one from his family and another once owned by Harlem Renaissance figure Arturo Schomburg. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, posted a series of critical messages throughout the day, including: “Everything is… foreign” and “All of the worst people are attending Mamdani’s inauguration today.” Loomer also accused New York Governor Kathy Hochul of “clapping for socialism” after Mamdani reaffirmed in his speech that he “was elected as a democratic socialist and will govern as a democratic socialist.” New York City Mayor Zohrarn Mamdani speaks during the ceremonial inauguration at City Hall on January 1, 2026, in New York City. “Someone make this a campaign ad,” Loomer wrote, referencing what she described as Hochul’s apparent discomfort while seated near other Democratic officials. Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican representing Staten Island, echoed concerns from the right in a more formal tone: “New Yorkers are in for a rude awakening,” she posted on X. “Mamdani’s policies will only make our city less safe and affordable but we’ll do everything we can to stop his radical & reckless agenda.” The criticism wasn’t limited to social media influencers. “Good luck NYC. You're gonna need it,” posted the account @EndWokeness, a popular right-wing platform with over a million followers on X. April Silverman, a political activist and regular Fox News commentator, called the moment “filth in one picture” and urged followers to “pray for NYC.” Affordability Takes the Stage Throughout the ceremony, Mamdani and other speakers hit on the theme that carried him to victory in the election: Devotion to using government power to lift up the millions of people who struggle with the city's high cost of living. Mamdani peppered his remarks with references to those New Yorkers, citing workers in steel-toed boots, halal cart vendors “whose knees ache from working all day,” and cooks “wielding a thousand spices.“ “I was elected as a democratic socialist, and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” Mamdani said. “I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed ‘radical.’” Mamdani inherits a city on the upswing, after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has dropped to pre-pandemic lows. Tourists are back. Unemployment, which soared during the pandemic years, is also back to pre-COVID levels. What People Are Saying Mamdani, in his speech during the inauguration, said: “We will set an example for the world. If what Sinatra said is true, let us prove that anyone can make it in New York and anywhere else, too.” Senator Bernie Sanders, at the same event, said: “Providing free and high-quality child care is not radical.

His critically acclaimed album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022’s “Un Verano Sin Ti.”\n\nWin or lose, experts say Bad Bunny’s Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he’ll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nHistoric nominations reflect the cultural zeitgeist\n\nVanessa Díaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of “P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,” says Bad Bunny’s nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a “very welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.”\n\n“Music from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,” adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. “Bad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.”\n\nMuch of this music — particularly Latin trap and reggaetón, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work — has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaetón in particular, Díaz points out, “comes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap … is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.”\n\nPetra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of “P FKN R,” says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres — including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.\n\nA victory in the major categories could have “profound, symbolic meaning,” she says. But with a caveat: “I’m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.” After all, Bad Bunny himself isn’t immune to the Recording Academy’s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in música urbana categories — despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.\n\nLocal-to-global appeal that meets the political moment\n\nAcross “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaetón aren’t abandoned but fused with música jíbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in “Pitorro de Coco.” While Bad Bunny’s previous albums also fused different genres — including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more — this album’s melange was more homegrown.\n\nLaguna sees “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” as a direct challenge to the prevailing “formula for global pop stardom,” which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then “watering down” their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.\n\n“Bad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It’s his most Puerto Rican album ever,” says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.\n\n“There’s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that’s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,” says Díaz. “And that’s why it feels like a win for all Latinos.”\n\nThe timing of the album’s release and recognition, too, feels consequential. “The U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. … We’re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,” she continues. “For a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.”\n\nLatinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.\n\nIn an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)\n\n“The content of the lyrics — which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification — there’s so much rich political and historical content,” Díaz adds. “This album is historic even without a Grammy win.”\n\nBut if Bad Bunny does win, Díaz says, it will be “akin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.”\n\nBeyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity — “the lyrics on this album align with global struggles,” he says. Take, for example, “Lo que le pasó a Hawaii” (“What happened to Hawaii”), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.\n\nThe album’s multigenerational appeal\n\nRivera-Rideau says one of the reasons “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to música urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are “a lot more digestible” to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaetón’s sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is “popular across generations,” she says.\n\nBut it only works because it is “musically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that’s only what people cared about, it wouldn’t have done as well as it did,” she explains. “Musically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he’s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.”\n\nThat intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny’s landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.\n\n“A lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it’s a difficult moment. And here’s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,” Laguna says. “There’s pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that’s very much welcomed.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The fatalities, one on Wednesday and five on Thursday, occurred in three cities predominantly home to Iran's Lur ethnic group.\n\nThe protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. However, the demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.\n\nThe most-intense violence appeared to strike Azna, a city in Iran's Lorestan province, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, online videos purported to show objects in the street ablaze and gunfire echoing as people shouted: “Shameless! Shameless!” The semiofficial Fars news agency reported three people had been killed. Other media, including pro-reform outlets, cited Fars for the report while state-run media did not fully acknowledge the violence there or elsewhere. It wasn't clear why there wasn't more reporting over the unrest, but journalists had faced arrest over their reporting in 2022.\n\nIn Lordegan, a city in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, online videos showed demonstrators gathered on a street, with the sound of gunfire in the background. The footage matched known features of Lordegan, some 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Tehran.\n\nFars, citing an anonymous official, said two people had been killed during the protests Thursday.\n\nThe Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran said two people had been killed there, identifying the dead as demonstrators. It also shared a still image of what appeared to be an Iranian police officer, wearing body armor and wielding a shotgun.\n\nIn 2019, the area around Lordegan saw widespread protests and demonstrators reportedly damaged government buildings after a report said people there had been infected with HIV by contaminated needles used at a local health care clinic.\n\n'Protests due to economic pressures' A separate demonstration Wednesday night reportedly led to the 21-year-old volunteer in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's Basij force.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member's death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, which is believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Lorestan province.\n\nThe Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.\n\n“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,\" Pourali said. \"The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.” The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, over 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Tehran. Local prosecutor Kazem Nazari said 20 people had been arrested after the protests and that calm had returned to the city, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nCurrency fall sparks protests Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters. However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.\n\nMeanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.\n\nIran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.\n\nThe protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well. The country's leaders are still reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country in June. The U.S. also bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the war.\n\nIran has said it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. However, those talks have yet to happen as U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its atomic program.","summary":"The deaths may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran’s theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded elsewhere","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-six-reported-killed-during-widening-protests-in-iran-sparked-by-ailing-economy/article70462598.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/pd59it/article70462599.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2026-01-01T103308Z_1451928677_RC21RIA1W3BA_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:10:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":390649594,"title":"Mar-a-Lago Considers Member Bans Over Unauthorized Photos of Barron Trump","text":"Members of Mar-a-Lago, the opulent Florida retreat owned by former President Donald Trump, are reportedly facing stern warnings about a potential ban after two models managed to capture photos of Trump’s son, Barron, during the club’s festive Christmas celebrations.\n\nBarron Trump, now 19, made a rare public appearance alongside his father during the holiday festivities. He has largely remained out of the public eye, focusing instead on developing his financial interests.\n\nThe incident occurred when models Valeria Sokolova and Abla Sofy took pictures of Barron while he was enjoying the holiday season with his family. This breach of privacy was initially reported by the Daily Mail.\n\nIn response, insiders have allegedly informed gossip columnist Rob Shuter that members who were found taking unauthorized photos of Barron were cautioned that their memberships could be at risk.\n\n“Melania has made it very clear that Barron’s privacy is non-negotiable,” an unnamed source reportedly stated. “Anyone caught filming or taking pictures would face immediate consequences, including the possibility of being banned from the club.”\n\nAnother insider emphasized the club’s strict policy: “The message was clear: no cameras, no leaks. Private family moments are to remain private.”\n\nThose at the New Year’s Eve celebration have said Barron was following his father closely through the dining room and spoke very little throughout the night.\n\n‘He was quiet, very reserved, wearing his usual blue suit, almost mirroring Donald,’ one insider said, according to Shuter. \n\nBarron has kept a low profile since his father took office for the second time, and has been largely absent from public view after leaving New York University’s main campus for the Fall 2025 semester.\n\nHe was last seen by his father’s side when Trump took office last January.\n\nAt that time, the president praised his youngest son, who towers over him at 6-foot-9-inches, for helping him reach a younger crowd in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n‘I have a very tall son,’ the 6-foot-3 Trump said in the Capital One Arena as the crowd erupted in cheers and Barron triumphantly raised his hands in the air, in a shift from the more reserved Barron the country is used to.\n\n‘He knew the youth vote. We won the youth vote by 36 points. He was saying – “Dad, you have to go out and do this [podcast] or that one,”‘ Trump said.\n\n‘We did a lot of them. He respects them all, he understood them very well.’ \n\nMonths later, Barron was photographed in Manhattan, debuting a much shaggier, more relaxed look. \n\nThe towering NYU’s Stern School of Business freshman also sported a loose sweater, jeans, and Adidas sneakers.\n\nBarron reportedly commuted to college from the Trump Tower apartment, home to his father and doting 54-year-old mother Melania.\n\nBut in September, his whereabouts came into question after he appeared to be absent from the school’s Manhattan campus for the first week of class.\n\nIt was later revealed he moved into the White House and started his sophomore year at NYU’s Washington campus. \n\nNYU Washington, DC is the home to the Stern Executive MBA degree program, which will allow Barron to earn an MBA in two years time. Only about 60-100 students enroll in the program, which runs $32,811 in undergraduate tradition.\n\nBarron’s transfer to the DC campus came as he apparently tried to prioritize getting his own business ideas off the ground. \n\nAccording to insiders, Barron has been busy taking meetings with business partners, developing tech projects, and setting up deals. \n\n‘Barron has been actively working on his own financial interests and has spent time with others who he is involved with in that area,’ a source told People.\n\n‘Still, he has spent a great deal of time with his family.’\n\nHe has also reportedly become more religious in recent months, with MAGA pastor Stuart Knechtle, 37, revealing last month that Barron is ‘very close’ to embracing his Christian faith fully after a late night phone call. \n\n‘I was talking on the phone with Barron Trump at 12.30 at night one night and I thought I was hitting him with everything but the kitchen sink when it came to all the evidence for God and Christianity,’ Knechtle said on The George Janko Podcast this week. \n\n‘I thought I was really on. I was pumped,’ he added. ‘Then at the very end, I came up pretty much totally open-handed with nothing.’\n\nHowever, Knechtle claimed the 6ft 9in teenager is ‘very close’ to putting his faith in Christ after he made a last ditch effort to persuade him using ‘evidence’ of dreams and revelations. \n\n‘I brought up dreams and revelations and I said, “Hey, look, Baron, I usually don’t go by this typically with as evidence, but I’ll just let lastly you know this,”‘ he said.\n\n‘I have a friend over in Africa who witnesses thousands of Muslims coming to Christ through dreams and revelations. How do you explain that? [Barron’s] like, “Oh, that’s a very, very interesting point. And you have eyewitness testimony.” \n\n‘You know, the way his mind works, it’s like that was the only thing that stuck with him and he’s very close to putting his faith in Christ. Very close. And so I pray that goes through.’\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to the White House, the Trump Organization, as well as Valeria Sokolova and Abla Sofy for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMembers of Mar-a-Lago, the opulent Florida retreat owned by former President Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Mar-a-Lago Considers Member Bans Over Unauthorized Photos of Barron Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/mar-a-lago-considers-member-bans-over-unauthorized-photos-of-barron-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mar-a-Lago-members-could-be-banned-for-taking-pictures-of-Barron.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:08:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.122},{"id":390640670,"title":"Zohran Mamdani promises to govern ‘expansively and audaciously’ in inaugural speech as NYC mayor","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani became mayor of New York City on Thursday, taking over one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics with a promise to transform government on behalf of the city’s striving, struggling working class.\n\nMamdani, a Democrat, was sworn in at a decommissioned subway station below City Hall just after midnight, placing his hand on a Quran as he took his oath as the city’s first Muslim mayor.\n\nAfter working part of the night in his new office, Mamdani returned to City Hall in a taxi cab around midday Thursday for a grander public inauguration where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the mayor’s political heroes, administered the oath for a second time.\n\n“Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously. We may not always succeed, but never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try,” Mamdani told a cheering crowd.\n\n“To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this: No longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers’ lives,” he said.\n\nThrongs turned out in the frigid cold for an inauguration viewing party just south of City Hall on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes,” famous for its ticker-tape parades.\n\nMamdani wasted little time getting to work after the event.\n\nHe revoked multiple executive orders issued by the previous administration since Sept. 26, 2024, the date federal authorities announced former Mayor Eric Adams had been indicted on corruption charges, which were later dismissed following intervention by the Trump administration.\n\nThen he visited an apartment building in Brooklyn to announce he is revitalizing a city office dedicated to protecting tenants and creating two task forces focused on housing construction.\n\n‘I will govern as a democratic socialist’\n\nThroughout the daytime ceremony, Mamdani and other speakers hit on the theme that carried him to victory in the election: Using government power to lift up the millions of people who struggle with the city’s high cost of living.\n\nMamdani peppered his remarks with references to those New Yorkers, citing workers in steel-toed boots, halal cart vendors “whose knees ache from working all day” and cooks “wielding a thousand spices.”\n\n“I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” Mamdani said. “I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed ‘radical.’”\n\nBefore administering the oath, Sanders told the crowd that most of the things Mamdani wants to do — including raising taxes on the rich — aren’t radical at all.\n\n“In the richest country in the history of the world, making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical,” he told the crowd. “It is the right and decent thing to do.”\n\nMamdani was accompanied on stage by his wife, Rama Duwaji. Adams was also in attendance, sitting near another former mayor, Bill de Blasio.\n\nActor Mandy Patinkin, who recently hosted Mamdani to celebrate Hannukah, sang “Over the Rainbow” with children from an elementary school chorus. The invocation was given by Imam Khalid Latif, the director of the Islamic Center of New York City. Poet Cornelius Eady read an original poem called “Proof.”\n\nIn addition to being the city’s first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, Mamdani is also the city’s youngest mayor in generations.\n\nFree child care and bus rides\n\nAt the watch party on Broadway, onlookers stood shoulder to shoulder gazing up at several jumbotrons and singing and dancing to stave off the cold, with some passing out hot cocoa and hand warmers. Many described feeling as though they were witnessing history.\n\nAmong them was Ariel Segura, a 16-year-old Bronx resident, who had arrived five hours earlier to secure a place near the front of the crowd.\n\n“I’m out here fan-girling a politician, it’s kind of crazy,” he said, wiping away tears as Mamdani concluded his speech. “Now it’s time to hold him accountable.”\n\nIn a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, Mamdani ran on a focused platform that included promises of free child care, free buses, a rent freeze for about 1 million households and a pilot of city-run grocery stores.\n\nMamdani insisted in his inaugural address that he will not squander his opportunity to implement those policies.\n\n“A moment like this comes rarely. Seldom do we hold such an opportunity to transform and reinvent. Rarer still is it the people themselves whose hands are on the levers of change. And yet we know that too often in our past, moments of great possibility have been promptly surrendered to small imagination and smaller ambition,” he said.\n\nBut he will also have to face the everyday responsibilities of running America’s largest city: handling trash and snow and rats, while getting blamed for subway delays and potholes.\n\nIn his speech, Mamdani acknowledged the task ahead, saying he knows many will be watching to see whether he can succeed.\n\n“They want to know if the left can govern. They want to know if the struggles that afflict them can be solved. They want to know if it is right to hope again,” he said. “So, standing together with the wind of purpose at our backs, we will do something that New Yorkers do better than anyone else: We will set an example for the world.”\n\nQuick rise to power\n\nMamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, an academic and author. His family moved to New York City when he was 7, with Mamdani growing up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims didn’t always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.\n\nHe worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before he sought public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent a section of Queens.\n\nNow that he has taken office, Mamdani and his wife will depart their one-bedroom, rent stabilized apartment in the outer-borough to take up residence in the stately mayoral residence in Manhattan.\n\nThe new mayor inherits a city on the upswing, after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has dropped to pre-pandemic lows. Tourists are back. Unemployment, which soared during the pandemic years, is also back to pre-COVID levels.\n\nYet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents.\n\nIn opening remarks to the crowd, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praised New Yorkers for choosing “courage over fear.”\n\n“We have chosen prosperity for the many over spoils for the few,” she said.\n\nDealing with Trump\n\nDuring the mayoral race, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to the city.\n\nBut Trump surprised supporters and foes alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what ended up being a cordial meeting in November.\n\n“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.\n\nStill, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.\n\nSeveral speakers at Thursday’s inauguration criticized the Trump administration’s move to deport more immigrants and expressed hope that Mamdani’s City Hall would be an ally to those the president has targeted.\n\nMamdani also faces skepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.\n\nStill, Mamdani supporters in Thursday’s crowd expressed optimism he’d be a unifying force.\n\n“There are moments where everyone in New York comes together, like when the Mets won the World Series in ’86,” said Mary Hammann, 64, a musician with the Metropolitan Opera. “This feels like that — just colder.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” said State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott.\n\n“The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including by force or coercion,” he added.\n\nChina fired missiles and deployed jets and naval vessels earlier this week in a simulation of military actions to encircle Taiwan, which Beijing claims as an integral part of its territory and has vowed to bring under its control.\n\nChinese military drills have become a frequent occurrence, causing few disruptions to life on the self-governed island, whose status the US has not officially weighed in on.\n\nBut Beijing’s assertive stance has prompted angry condemnations from Taiwanese officials, and crackdowns on formerly autonomous areas such as Hong Kong following integration with China have bolstered scepticism about the prospects of possible reunification with Beijing.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to resolutely defend national sovereignty and strengthen national defence,” Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said on Thursday.\n\nLai has called for a $40bn increase in Taiwan’s military spending, but the proposal is stalled in the country’s legislature, where the opposition party currently holds a majority.\n\n“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” the president said, adding that Taiwan must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best”.\n\nWhile US lawmakers often make strong statements of support for Taiwan, US policy towards the island has been marked by ambiguity for decades and does not include an assurance of military support in the event of an invasion by China.\n\nThe US recently approved an $11bn arms package for Taiwan, but President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he did not believe China had plans to launch an invasion of Taiwan in the near future.\n\n“I have a great relationship with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping].

He is also the first to be sworn in using the Qur’an.\n\nMamdani said a “moment like this comes rarely and rarer still is it that the people themselves whose hands are upon the levers of change”.\n\nHe said that in writing his remarks, he was advised to lower expectations. “I will do no such thing,” Mamdani said. “The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations. Beginning today we will govern expansively and audaciously. We may not always succeed but never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try.”\n\nMamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd.\n\nHe ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”\n\nHours after the ceremony, Mamdani revoked all executive orders issued by Adams after 26 September 2024, when the former mayor was indicted on federal corruption charges, later dropped by the Trump administration.\n\nThe overturned orders include a directive last month that prohibited mayoral appointees and staff “from boycotting and disinvesting from Israel and protecting New Yorkers’ rights to free exercise of religion without harassment at houses of worship”.\n\nMamdani’s office said the order was issued to ensure “a fresh start for the incoming administration and reissues executive orders that the administration feels are central to delivering continued service, excellence, and value-driven leadership”.\n\nIt was the second of a two-part ceremony after Mamdani was sworn in at midnight on Thursday in a disused subway station, where he was flanked by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and his wife, Rama Duwaji, a 28-year-old animator and illustrator.\n\nOn the steps of city hall on a bitterly cold January day, Mamdani was introduced by the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist ally who is edging toward a run for the White House in 2028.\n\n“We have chosen courage over fear. We have chosen prosperity for the many over spoils for the few,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her remarks. “We have chosen to make a new future for all of us, we have chosen a mayor who is relentlessly dedicated to make life not just possible but aspirational for working people … we have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme inequality.”\n\nMamdani was then formally sworn in by the Vermont independent senator Bernie Sanders, another political ally who in many ways laid the groundwork for Mamdani’s affordability agenda with his run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nThat effort, widely seen to have been undermined by allies of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton within the party’s national political organization, has now borne fruit, and with it the underlying political message of affordability and economic rights.\n\nSanders said in his address that Mamdani was taking power “at a time when we are seeing too much hatred, too much divisive and too much injustice”. He called for “government that works for all, not just the wealthy and the few”.\n\nSanders added that Mamdani had taken on the Democratic and Republican establishments, “the president of the United States, and some enormously wealthy oligarchs. And you defeated them in the biggest political upset in modern American history.”\n\nMamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s closest-watched politicians, whose platform promises free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about 1m households, and a pilot of city-run grocery stores.\n\nBut the estimated $10bn cost of providing those services may be hard to find. Mamdani has vowed to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and increase corporate taxes. But as a vassal city of the state government in Albany, he will need the legislative support of Governor Kathy Hochul, who running for re-election next year.\n\nHe’ll also have to deal with Donald Trump, who has labelled the new mayor a “communist” and threatened to withhold federal funding from the city. But a friendly meeting between the outer-borough New Yorkers last month, where they bonded over building more housing in the city, surprised many expecting a political firework show.\n\n“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.\n\nMamdani also faces skepticism from some Jewish New Yorkers alarmed by his criticisms of Israel’s government and failure to emphatically distance himself from the phrase “from the river to the sea”, though Mamdani has said he will no longer use it.\n\nThe extent of those sensitivities became apparent during Mamdani’s transition when his director of appointments, Cat da Costa, stepped down after tweets came to light in which she had described Jewish people as “money hungry” and called a train in Far Rockaway the “Jew train”.\n\nMamdani’s transition team called the error “an unacceptable oversight in the vetting process [that] does not meet the mayor-elect’s standards for this transition or the incoming administration”.\n\nMamdani has also sought to smooth over the tensions by persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her position, avoiding the appearance of losing Jewish police chief as well a measure of continuity to tense issue of policing.\n\nNew York mayors are typically judged on their ability to provide basic services – trash collection, curbing the city’s infestation of rats, fixing potholes and getting the subways to run smoothly.\n\nBefore ending his term as mayor on Wednesday, Eric Adams touted his administration’s anti-crime efforts, which he credited for historically low numbers of homicides and shootings. There were 301 homicides in the city in 2025, 79 less than in 2024.\n\nAdams said the New York police department had taken 25,000 illegal guns off city streets over the past four years and drive-by shootings had declined by 55%.\n\nMamdani and Duwaji will now give up their one-bedroom, rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria, Queens, to take up residence in the stately mayoral residence of Gracie Mansion, built in 1799, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\n\nLast month, Adams warned Mamdani that the mansion is haunted. “It’s a friendly ghost, as long as you’re doing right by the city,” he said. “If you don’t become right by the city, he turns into a poltergeist.”","summary":"Mayor says ‘I will govern as a democratic socialist’ at inauguration ceremony featuring AOC and Bernie Sanders\n\nZohran Mamdani vowed to “reinvent” New York City in a speech on his first day as mayor, promising “a new era” for America’s largest city and an ambitious start to his term of office.\n\nThe 34-year-old political star and democratic socialist, who a year ago was a virtually unknown state assemblyman, is the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of south Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa.

Machado recently emerged in Oslo, Norway, after spending months in hiding.\n\nThe disputed vote prompted widespread protests across the country, resulting in at least 28 deaths and thousands of arrests.\n\nOfficial records show that at least 2,000 people have since been released, while more than 700 people are still believed to be held for political reasons.\n\nThe disputed election has, in part, undergirded the Trump administration’s pressure against Maduro, whom they have accused of running a drug trafficking operation that aims to destabilise the US.\n\nThe Pentagon has surged military assets off the coast of Venezuela since August, with Trump earlier this week revealing the first attack on Venezuelan soil targeting a dock allegedly used to load drug boats earlier this week.\n\nThe US has also blockaded sanctioned oil tankers entering and exiting Venezuela, while simultaneously carrying out strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, in what rights groups say amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nMore than 100 people have been killed in the strikes so far.\n\nFrom exile, Machado has vocally supported the US pressure campaign. She has been more circumspect on strikes on Venezuelan territory, while maintaining that Venezuela has been “invaded” by “terrorist groups” and “drug cartels”.\n\nVenezuela experts have warned that many opposition groups in the country oppose US military action.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/venezuela-releases-more-prisoners-amid-us-pressure-campaign-rights-groups/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2026/01/getty_6956f53b10-1767306555-BDfRas.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:06:14","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":390628026,"title":"Zohran Mamdani begins to crack his socialist whip as he begins term as most left-wing mayor in NYC history","text":"Zohran Mamdani unleashed a series of executive orders on his first day in office after announcing that he planned to 'govern as a democratic socialist' at his inauguration.\n\nThe new mayor headed straight for Brooklyn after his lavish 'block party' in Manhattan to issue several executive orders and announcing plans in support of tenants' rights following a campaign where he promised to freeze rents.\n\nHe announced the creation of task forces to help protect tenants, as well as two that sought to make development projects easier in the city. \n\nMamdani also issued executive orders relating to housing, reviving the Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants and making Cea Weaver, a progressive 'housing justice' activist, as its leader. \n\nThe mayor also announced city action in a bankruptcy case against landlord Pinnacle.\n\nIn an immediate break with his predecessor, one of Mamdani's first moves was to issue a sweeping order canceling out most of the EOs former Mayor Eric Adams made following his September 2024 indictment.\n\n'We speak about this day as a new era. And in order to fulfill that hope, we have to reckon with why so many New Yorkers have turned away from politics over the last few months, the last few years, the last few decades,' the 34-year-old said. \n\n'That was a date that marked a moment when many New Yorkers decided politics held nothing for them.'\n\nThe move revoked every order given by Adams after September 26, 2024, when the former Democrat was indicted by a federal grand jury following a wide-ranging corruption investigation that has seen several top officials resign. \n\nMamdani said many of the revocations were symbolic and would be reissued, including one maintaining the city's Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nThe city's first Muslim mayor, he has been seen with skepticism by some Jewish New Yorkers over his ardent support of the Palestinian cause. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the mayor for comment. \n\nAt his inauguration, Mamdani made it clear that he would not be moderating his left-wing views as he took office. \n\n'I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,' he said. \n\n'The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations. Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously.'\n\nSocialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders - a Brooklyn native - was there to oversee the swearing in of Mamdani, while fellow lefty Queens politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also in attendance. \n\n'This is a government of New York, by New York, and for New York,' Mamdani promised.\n\nMamdani is New York City's first Muslim mayor and one of the youngest men ever to occupy the position. His wife, Rama Duwaji, 28, is the city's youngest ever first lady. \n\nDuwaji has kept a low profile during Mamdani's campaign but showed her support during his inauguration, walking side-by-side with her husband and tearing up while he spoke. \n\nMamdani struck a more positive tone at his inauguration than in his fiery acceptance speech in November.\n\nThe democratic socialist didn't mince words when beating his opponent, former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, telling his supporters on Election Night that it would be the last time he'd utter the man's name. \n\nMamdani had concluded his speech with a direct message to President Donald Trump: 'I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.'\n\nThe mayor opted for a softer tone in his inauguration remarks, referring to the president only once.\n\nHe reached out to voters who backed Donald Trump in the presidential election and him in the mayoral election, saying he understood that the rocketing cost of living was their primary concern.\n\n'Many of these people have been betrayed by the established order. But in our administration, their needs will be met,' Mamdani said. \n\n'Their hopes and dreams and interests will be reflected transparently in government. They will shape our future.' \n\nMamdani met with Trump in the Oval Office in November 2025, with the Republican president full of praise for the new star of the Democrat party. \n\nMamdani , who was born in Uganda, has promised to offer free daycare and free buses across the city.\n\nHe also plans to enact a millionaire tax, with critics warning that his policies could drive out the super-rich, whose taxes fund public services in the Big Apple.\n\nMamdani referred to the 'long-broken property tax system' in his speech, vowing to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. \n\n'The cost of child care will no longer discourage young adults from starting a family, because we will deliver universal child care for the many by taxing the wealthiest few,' he declared. \n\nMamdani seemed to take a page out of Sanders' book, echoing the veteran senator's longtime vows to tax the wealthy to provide social services for the middle class.\n\nThe theme of embarking on a 'new era' was reiterated throughout Thursday's speeches. \n\nMamdani's campaign sparked widespread conversation about the future of the Democratic Party and whether younger politicians would continue to embrace socialist policies.","summary":"The new mayor headed straight for Brooklyn after his lavish 'block party' in Manhattan to issue several executive orders and announcing plans in support of tenants' rights.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15427771/Zohran-Mamdani-begins-socialist-whip-NYC.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/01/22/105164877-0-image-a-8_1767307273834.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:06:14","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

'Anyone caught filming or taking pictures would face immediate consequences, including potential banning from the club.'\n\n'The message was clear: no cameras, no leaks,' another source told Shuter. 'Private family moments stay private.'\n\nThose at the New Year's Eve celebration have said Barron was following his father closely through the dining room and spoke very little throughout the night.\n\n'He was quiet, very reserved, wearing his usual blue suit, almost mirroring Donald,' one insider said, according to Shuter. \n\nBarron has kept a low profile since his father took office for the second time, and has been largely absent from public view after leaving New York University's main campus for the Fall 2025 semester.\n\nHe was last seen by his father's side when Trump took office last January.\n\nAt that time, the president praised his youngest son, who towers over him at 6-foot-9-inches, for helping him reach a younger crowd in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n'I have a very tall son,' the 6-foot-3 Trump said in the Capital One Arena as the crowd erupted in cheers and Barron triumphantly raised his hands in the air, in a shift from the more reserved Barron the country is used to.\n\n'He knew the youth vote. We won the youth vote by 36 points. He was saying - \"Dad, you have to go out and do this [podcast] or that one,\"' Trump said.\n\n'We did a lot of them. He respects them all, he understood them very well.' \n\nMonths later, Barron was photographed in Manhattan, debuting a much shaggier, more relaxed look. \n\nThe towering NYU's Stern School of Business freshman also sported a loose sweater, jeans, and Adidas sneakers.\n\nBarron reportedly commuted to college from the Trump Tower apartment, home to his father and doting 54-year-old mother Melania.\n\nBut in September, his whereabouts came into question after he appeared to be absent from the school's Manhattan campus for the first week of class.\n\nIt was later revealed he moved into the White House and started his sophomore year at NYU's Washington campus. \n\nNYU Washington, DC is the home to the Stern Executive MBA degree program, which will allow Barron to earn an MBA in two years time. Only about 60-100 students enroll in the program, which runs $32,811 in undergraduate tradition.\n\nBarron's transfer to the DC campus came as he apparently tried to prioritize getting his own business ideas off the ground. \n\nAccording to insiders, Barron has been busy taking meetings with business partners, developing tech projects, and setting up deals. \n\n'Barron has been actively working on his own financial interests and has spent time with others who he is involved with in that area,' a source told People.\n\n'Still, he has spent a great deal of time with his family.'\n\nHe has also reportedly become more religious in recent months, with MAGA pastor Stuart Knechtle, 37, revealing last month that Barron is 'very close' to embracing his Christian faith fully after a late night phone call. \n\n'I was talking on the phone with Barron Trump at 12.30 at night one night and I thought I was hitting him with everything but the kitchen sink when it came to all the evidence for God and Christianity,' Knechtle said on The George Janko Podcast this week. \n\n'I thought I was really on. I was pumped,' he added. 'Then at the very end, I came up pretty much totally open-handed with nothing.'\n\nHowever, Knechtle claimed the 6ft 9in teenager is 'very close' to putting his faith in Christ after he made a last ditch effort to persuade him using 'evidence' of dreams and revelations. \n\n'I brought up dreams and revelations and I said, \"Hey, look, Baron, I usually don't go by this typically with as evidence, but I'll just let lastly you know this,\"' he said.\n\n'I have a friend over in Africa who witnesses thousands of Muslims coming to Christ through dreams and revelations. How do you explain that? [Barron's] like, \"Oh, that's a very, very interesting point. And you have eyewitness testimony.\" \n\n'You know, the way his mind works, it's like that was the only thing that stuck with him and he's very close to putting his faith in Christ. Very close. And so I pray that goes through.'\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to the White House, the Trump Organization, as well as Valeria Sokolova and Abla Sofy for comment.","summary":"Mar-a-Lago members are being warned about a possible ban from President Donald Trump's glamorous Florida club after two models snapped photos of first son Barron","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15427817/Mar-Lago-members-banned-pictures-Barron.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/01/23/105165253-0-image-m-31_1767310963435.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/12/05/3505014852311495137/640x360_MP4_3505014852311495137.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:02:51","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig,Stephen Lepore","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig","Stephen Lepore"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.244},{"id":390649836,"title":"Singapore GDP Rises 5.7% Last Quarter on Manufacturing Surge - Bloomberg","text":"Singapore’s pharmaceutical and electronic manufacturers powered the economy in the final three months of 2025, pushing full-year growth to the fastest since its rebound from the pandemic despite fears of a shock from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. \n\nGross domestic product last quarter grew 5.7% from the same period a year ago, according to an advance estimate Friday from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

This approach was announced 12 months ago, yet the Liberal Democrats noted that only one cross-party meeting has taken place as part of Baroness Casey’s independent commission on adult social care.\n\nThe government has played down reports the pharmaceuticals deal could cost the NHS an extra £3 billion a year in drug costs, with No 10 and Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggesting the figure would be around £1 billion by March 2029.\n\nMs Cooper said: “Keir Starmer has found billions of pounds to pay off the bully in the White House but has still not found the funds to fix social care.\n\n“He needs to personally get a grip of this crisis, end this negligence and finally show whose side he’s on.\n\n“A year on from the announcement of the commission into adult social care, families are still picking up the pieces of a broken social care system and the taxpayer is picking up the tab for patients unnecessarily stuck in hospital beds.”\n\nIn response to the Lib Dem attack, the Government repeated that the £3 billion claimed cost of the deal was incorrect and no money will be cut from frontline NHS services to fund the agreement.\n\nA spokesperson said: “This deal is a vital investment that builds on the strength of our NHS and world leading life sciences sector to increase access to lifesaving medicines.\n\n“After over a decade of damage to our NHS at the hands of both the Tories and the Lib Dems, we inherited shocking delays to hospital discharge and are working to turn this around.\n\n“Thanks to our record investment, millions more appointments have been delivered, and NHS productivity is rising.\n\n“As well as working with Baroness Casey to fix our social care crisis, the NHS is also working closely with local authority and social care colleagues, so that discharge capacity can surge at times of peak demand.\n\n“We’ve issued clear guidance to support faster, safer hospital discharge, and we’re joining up NHS and social care through neighbourhood health teams so more people can get the care they need at home.”","summary":"The government has played down reports the pharmaceuticals deal could cost the NHS an extra £3 billion a year in drug costs","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-drugs-deal-trump-nhs-liberal-democrats-b2893242.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/24/14/30/CBI-annual-conference-s0fvkxby.jpeg?crop=5266.7,3511.1,x415.3,y166.3&trim=166,0,274,415&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TzTsQUDW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-02 00:01:00","author":"David Hughes","authors":["David Hughes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.673},{"id":390635674,"title":"US says Chinese military drills around Taiwan cause unnecessary tensions  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily","text":"The United States has called on China to exercise “restraint” and avoid actions that raise tensions following a series of war games around Taiwan simulating a blockade of the island.\n\nThe US Department of State said in a statement on Thursday that China’s bellicose language and military drills, which prompted sharp condemnation from Taipei, were a source of unnecessary strain.\n\n“China’s military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan and others in the region increase tensions unnecessarily. We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” said State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott.\n\n“The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including by force or coercion,” he added.\n\nChina fired missiles and deployed jets and naval vessels earlier this week in a simulation of military actions to encircle Taiwan, which Beijing claims as an integral part of its territory and has vowed to bring under its control.\n\nChinese military drills have become a frequent occurrence, causing few disruptions to life on the self-governed island, whose status the US has not officially weighed in on.\n\nBut Beijing’s assertive stance has prompted angry condemnations from Taiwanese officials, and crackdowns on formerly autonomous areas such as Hong Kong following integration with China have bolstered scepticism about the prospects of possible reunification with Beijing.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to resolutely defend national sovereignty and strengthen national defence,” Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said on Thursday.\n\nLai has called for a $40bn increase in Taiwan’s military spending, but the proposal is stalled in the country’s legislature, where the opposition party currently holds a majority.\n\n“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” the president said, adding that Taiwan must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best”.\n\nWhile US lawmakers often make strong statements of support for Taiwan, US policy towards the island has been marked by ambiguity for decades and does not include an assurance of military support in the event of an invasion by China.\n\nThe US recently approved an $11bn arms package for Taiwan, but President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he did not believe China had plans to launch an invasion of Taiwan in the near future.\n\n“I have a great relationship with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping]. And he hasn’t told me anything about it. I certainly have seen it,” Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\n“They’ve been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area.
