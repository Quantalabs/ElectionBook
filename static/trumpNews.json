An independence vote could take place as early as this fall, though current polls suggest the separatists would be unlikely to succeed, according to an AFP report.The Financial Times reported that leaders of the Alberta Prosperity Project have met with US State Department officials in Washington on three occasions since April. The report came after remarks made last week by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, which appeared to signal support for Alberta’s push for independence.US standBessent last week referred to Alberta as “a natural partner for the US” and highlighted the province’s resource wealth and “independent” nature during an interview with the Real America’s Voice.“Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they [the Canadian government] won’t let them build a pipeline to the Pacific. I think we should let them come down into the US,” Bessent mentioned in the interview, adding, “There’s a rumour they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not.”When asked whether he had any insight into the separatist push, Bessent replied, “People are talking. People want sovereignty. They want what the US has got.”What did Carney say?Carney made the remarks on Thursday while speaking to reporters alongside Canada’s provincial leaders, including Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, an advocate for the oil industry who has previously visited President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Responding to the Financial Times report and Bessent’s remarks, Carney stated, “I expect the US administration to respect Canadian sovereignty.”Addressing questions about the Alberta meetings, a senior State Department official informed AFP, “The Department regularly meets with civil society types. As is typical in routine meetings such as these, no commitments were made.”Carney said Trump had not raised the issue of Alberta’s independence or the separatist movement in Quebec, the country’s French-speaking province.Alberta’s push for independence has not historically posed a serious challenge to Canada’s unity unlike Quebec’s long-established and organised separatist movement. However, frustration with Ottawa grew in the province during former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s decade in office.Many Albertans viewed Trudeau’s climate-focused policies as harmful to the oil industry that underpins their economy, accusing his government of blocking key infrastructure projects sought by energy companies.Meanwhile, Smith on Thursday stated that she “would expect that the US administration would respect Canadian sovereignty,” adding that she would raise any concerns about interference in a referendum directly with Washington. She reiterated her support for a “sovereign Alberta, within a united Canada,” while blaming Trudeau for deepening discontent in the province.“For 10 years under Justin Trudeau's government, our province was relentlessly attacked, our economy was relentlessly attacked,” she said.Smith has suggested that Carney’s willingness to move forward with a new oil pipeline to the Pacific coast could help curb support for independence.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/canadas-carney-tells-america-to-respect-sovereignty-after-secret-meeting-with-alberta-separatists-where-us-stands-11769797513789.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/30/1600x900/logo/Carney_1769801544832_1769801549485.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 19:29:42","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":397825428,"title":"EM Assets Pare Monthly Rally on Slump in Metals, Trump Fed Pick","text":"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging market assets are falling for a second straight session on Friday, paring their monthly gains, as metals plunge and the dollar surges to its best day since July after President Donald Trump announced his pick for the top job at the Federal Reserve.Trump nominated Kevin Warsh, who’s seen as less supportive of deep rate cuts and more worried about inflation. Gold and silver suffered their biggest slides in decades, while the dollar surged toward its best day since July. A gauge of South African precious metals and mining stocks dropped as much as 9.4% in Johannesburg, the most since October. At the same time, concerns over the sustainability of artificial-intelligence investments hit Asian tech stocks that had powered this year’s gains. The MSCI index of developing world stocks has had its best start in 14 years, though it tumbled 1.9% Friday, the most in six weeks, It is still up almost 9% in the month. “Some profit-taking is not unreasonable after such a euphoric start to the year for EM equities,” said Hasnain Malik, head of emerging-markets equity and geopolitics strategy at Tellimer in Dubai. “Concerns over returns on data center capex, for example by Microsoft, cannot exist in the long-run alongside euphoria for semiconductor suppliers further up the value chain.”The MSCI index tracking developing world currencies is down 0.5%, on pace for its biggest daily drop since November, with the South African rand, a bellwether for risk appetite, dropping more than 2%, the most since April. Still, currencies remained on track for a second monthly advance. “There’s not a structural change. I think that expectations of global dollar weakness will surely remain for a while longer,” said Daniel Velandia, chief economist at Credicorp Capital Colombia. “We believe that there will still be appreciation pressures in Latin American currencies, but this trend will moderate.” Investors are waiting to see whether the two-day selloff in EM stocks is a momentary pause or the start of a correction after an $11 trillion rally since last April driven by AI stocks and gold miners. While the dollar remains near a four-year low, supporting the EM outlook, money managers are watching out for risks around Trump’s policymaking and high valuations attached to AI shares.So far, momentum and sentiment are in emerging markets’ favor. Of the 22 most-traded developing world currencies, 15 have risen in January amid a global macro backdrop that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts characterized as “friendly.”Brazil’s benchmark stock index is on track to close January with a gain of almost 13%, its best month since November 2020.Most money managers remain optimistic about further EM gains.“We’re off to a potentially multi-year cycle where EM can significantly outperform developed markets for the first time in a long time,” Yacov Arnopolin, a senior emerging-markets portfolio manager at Pimco, said at Bloomberg’s Emerging Markets Investment Forum in New York this month. Elsewhere, Ukraine bonds are rallying as Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to halt the bombing of cities and towns in Ukraine as the country prepares for an extreme cold snap.Colombia raised interest rates for the first time since 2023 as a record minimum wage increase stokes inflation pressure. The central bank lifted its benchmark rate by one full percentage point to 10.25%, which was higher than expected by all 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.--With assistance from Nicolle Yapur, Carter Johnson, Maria Elena Vizcaino, Ray Ndlovu, Leda Alvim, Pratigya Vajpayee and Carolina Wilson.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/em-assets-pare-monthly-rally-on-slump-in-metals-trump-fed-pick-11769800847625.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market3_1733466045716_1733466057117.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 19:20:47","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":397825434,"title":"Chicago grain prices fall amid profit-taking and dollar rebound","text":"(Updates with U.S. trading, updates headline, byline, dateline)*Grains pressured by profit-taking, dollar rebounds after four-year low*Wheat supported by short-covering, cold weather in US and Black Sea*Argentina's crops need rain, Brazil's soybean harvest tempers concernsBy Renee HickmanCHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) -Chicago corn, soybean and wheat futures fell on Friday, pressured by profit-taking and a rebound in the U.S. dollar, after the greenback reached a four-year low on Tuesday. Market participants were adjusting positions at the end of the month and after a volatile trading week that saw record-high precious metal prices in addition to the dollar slide. But on Friday, global stocks declined and rallies in precious metals cooled as the dollar rose.Grains and oilseed prices had climbed to multi-week highs this week on the back of a weaker dollar, but ample global supply has kept gains in check.\"It's just a risk-off environment,\" said Karl Setzer, co-founder of Consus Ag Consulting.\"We've really pounded the dollar this month,\" said Setzer, but he said most of the trade was based on \"money flow, positioning and profit-taking.\"The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat fell 7-1/2 cents to $5.34 a bushel by 12:31 p.m. CST (1831 GMT) after hitting a new nine-week peak of $5.44-3/4.CBOT soybeans fell 10 cents to $10.62-1/4 a bushel, while corn shed 5 cents to $4.2-3/4 a bushel. The dollar index continued its recovery on Friday, supported by reports that U.S. President Donald Trump could name on Friday former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as the new head of the central bank. Investors view Warsh as more hawkish on interest rates than other candidates for the post. Market jitters over Trump's policymaking, including his criticism of the Fed, had fuelled the dollar's recent slide.Chicago wheat has also drawn support this week from short-covering by investment funds and bouts of severe cold in wheat belts in the United States and the Black Sea region. After extreme cold in the U.S. Plains in the past week, traders were monitoring forecasts of deep frosts in Ukraine next week that could cause crop damage. In Argentina, recent rains improved soil moisture in parts of the country but corn and soy crops still need more rainfall to avoid yield losses, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange said on Thursday.The prospect of record soybean production in Brazil, where harvesting is in its early stages, was nonetheless tempering concern about Argentina.(Reporting by Renee Hickman in Chicago; Additional reporting by Daphne Zhang in Beijing and Gus Trompiz in Paris; Editing by Leroy Leo)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/chicago-grain-prices-fall-amid-profit-taking-and-dollar-rebound-11769799739360.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market1_1733465997762_1733466008348.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 19:02:18","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":397825420,"title":"Carney, Macklem Congratulate Warsh on Federal Reserve Nomination","text":"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem congratulated Kevin Warsh on his nomination to lead the Federal Reserve. Carney — who led the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis, while Warsh was on the Fed’s board of governors — offered praise on social media. “Kevin Warsh is a fantastic choice to lead the world’s most important central bank at this crucial time,” said Carney, who has also served as Bank of England governor.US President Donald Trump announced Friday he intends to nominate Warsh to be the next Fed chair. Warsh sat on the central bank’s board from 2006 to 2011 and has previously advised Trump on economic policy.In an emailed statement to Bloomberg News, Macklem also offered his congratulations.“I worked with Kevin during his time as a governor of the Federal Reserve and look forward to working with him again,” Macklem said.Macklem was a deputy governor at the Bank of Canada from 2004 to 2007, and senior deputy governor from 2010 to 2014. He was appointed governor in 2020.Over the past year, Macklem has repeatedly voiced support for current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is under political pressure from Trump to cut interest rates. Warsh would succeed Powell when his term ends in May.After Canada’s central bank held rates steady on Wednesday, Macklem again stressed the importance of an independent Federal Reserve. He pointed to Canada’s deep economic and financial ties with the US.“Our financial markets are particularly integrated with the US, so it would particularly affect us,” Macklem said.Powell is “doing a good job at leading the Fed based on evidence, based on facts,” he added. “I hope it stays that way.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/carney-macklem-congratulate-warsh-on-federal-reserve-nomination-11769798819803.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_3_1733465099406_1733465108677.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 18:46:59","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.586},{"id":397879756,"title":"&#8216;Enforcement alone won’t work&#8217;","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Senator Christian Tavares-Finson speaking in the Senate on Friday. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 30, 2026\n\n\n\n\n ‘Enforcement alone won’t work’ \n\nSenator Tavares-Finson gives ‘strong support’ to bill expunging criminal records \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica—Government Senator Christian Tavares-Finson has come out in ‘strong support’ of the Criminal Records (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act, which was passed in the Senate on Friday with no amendments.\n\nThe legislation, which was previously passed in the House of Representatives last December, seeks to increase the sentence threshold for eligibility for expungement from five years to 10 years.\n\nThis provision empowers the Criminal Records Rehabilitation of Offenders Board to consider applications from individuals who served sentences of more than five years but not exceeding 10 years, thereby broadening access to expungement in potentially deserving cases.\n\nIt also establishes a non-exhaustive list of factors that the board may consider when assessing an application.\n\nThese include the nature and gravity of the offence, social enquiry and psychological reports, demonstrated remorse or restitution, and the age of the individual at the time of the offence. This framework ensures that the board’s decisions are grounded in transparency, fairness, and clear evidence of rehabilitation.\n\nTavares-Finson, a criminal defence attorney, said the legislation reflects not only the firmness of the Government’s crime-fighting agenda, but also its belief in fairness, rehabilitation, and national renewal. He highlighted that Jamaica, in recent times, has achieved measurable and historic success in reducing crime, with murders falling below 700 in 2025, the first time since 1994.\n\n“This achievement did not happen by chance. It was the result of strategic policing, improved intelligence, community engagement, focused anti-gang operations, and a clear commitment to public safety,” said Tavares-Finson, while citing that the trend has continued into 2026 with a 54 per cent reduction in murders as of January 24.\n\n“These are encouraging signs that the policies being implemented are working and that Jamaica is moving steadily toward a safer future.\n\n“However, crime reduction is not sustained by enforcement alone. While law enforcement plays a critical role, we must also address the root causes of crime and the conditions that lead individuals back into conflict with the law. That is where this proposed amendment becomes both relevant and necessary,” he said.\n\nHe told the Upper House that the current proposal seeks to expand the list of offences eligible for rehabilitation and expungement, allowing more individuals who have served their sentences and demonstrated reform the opportunity to move forward without the lifelong burden of a criminal record.\n\n“This is not an abandonment of accountability. Rather, it is a recognition that justice must evolve beyond punishment toward restoration,” he said.\n\nThe Government senator argued that, “Too often, a criminal record becomes a permanent barrier blocking access to employment, housing, education, and even entrepreneurship. When individuals are denied legitimate opportunities, they are more likely to return to crime, not because they want to, but because society has closed every other door. This amendment helps to break that cycle”.\n\nTavares-Finson said that by giving deserving citizens a structured second chance, “we increase their ability to participate meaningfully in the economy, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. In doing so, we reduce recidivism, strengthen social stability, and ultimately enhance public safety, which is without a doubt the very goal of our crime-fighting strategy”.\n\nHe implored his fellow senators to pause to remember that those affected by these provisions are not statistics. “They are people, citizens of our beloved country. Many are Jamaicans who made mistakes at a young age, often shaped by circumstances of poverty, limited opportunity, or negative influence. They have since accepted responsibility, complied with the law, and demonstrated genuine change”.\n\nHe continued, “As a society rooted in strong moral and faith-based traditions, we believe in redemption, forgiveness, and the power of transformation. The proposed amendments acknowledge that growth is possible and that past wrongdoing should not permanently eclipse present character”.\n\nTavares-Finson declared that the Administration is clear in its intent that rehabilitation must lead to reintegration.\n\n“We want former offenders to return to society not as outsiders, but as productive, law-abiding citizens, employees, entrepreneurs, parents, and community leaders. By removing unnecessary legal barriers, we are empowering individuals to earn an honest living, contribute to the tax base, and participate fully in national life. This is how we replace hopelessness with purpose and prevent yesterday’s offenders from becoming tomorrow’s repeat cases,” he said.\n\nAccording to the senator, “compassion, when paired with accountability, is not weakness; it is sound governance and smart crime prevention”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Christian Tavares-Finson Criminal Records (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act law rehabilitation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29.6 per cent decline in fire-related deaths for 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB) is reporting a 29.6 per cent decline in deaths related to fires in 2025, marking another year of prog... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump picks former US Fed official as next central bank chief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-President Donald Trump said Friday he would nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to be the next US cen... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trench Town Rocks to emphasise Bunny Wailer family’s cultural impact \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n Evelyn Carridice, the sister of the late Bunny Wailer, has announced that Trench Town will officially open Reggae Month 2026 with a community-led cult... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Bag: Shopping with Chef Lumley in Papine, pepper prices ‘hot’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n ST ANDREW, Jamaica – Food prices were higher at the Papine Market compared to our shopping trip at the Linstead Market last week.

Regrettably, at the start of last year, we had a triple death at a home in St Ann, and that would have resulted in the number that we are seeing…and those ages range between one and seven,” he told JIS News.\n\nThe commissioner also reported that 84 people were injured as a result of fires in 2025, including on-duty fire fighters and civilians.\n\n“About eight firefighters [and] 76 civilians were injured, consisting of 74 adults –69 males and five females, and two children – one male and one female. This reflects an increase of [15.15] per cent when compared to the 66 [injured] civilians recorded in 2024,” he said.\n\n“Injuries to firefighters would have been reduced by 38.4 per cent when compared to 2024,” he added.\n\nIn addition to loss of life and injuries, Commissioner Beckford also pointed to the wider social consequences of fires.\n\n“For last year, we saw 1,862 persons, including 506 children, being made homeless as a result of fires and this is in comparison to the 1,636 persons, including 440 children, who were made homeless in 2024, representing an overall increase of about 13.8 per cent,” Beckford said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: fire-related deaths JFB Stewart Beckford \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump picks former US Fed official as next central bank chief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-President Donald Trump said Friday he would nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to be the next US cen... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trench Town Rocks to emphasise Bunny Wailer family’s cultural impact \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n Evelyn Carridice, the sister of the late Bunny Wailer, has announced that Trench Town will officially open Reggae Month 2026 with a community-led cult... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Bag: Shopping with Chef Lumley in Papine, pepper prices ‘hot’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n ST ANDREW, Jamaica – Food prices were higher at the Papine Market compared to our shopping trip at the Linstead Market last week.

(Photo by KEVORK DJANSEZIAN / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 30, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Trump picks former US Fed official as next central bank chief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-President Donald Trump said Friday he would nominate former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to be the next US central bank chief, a move that has sparked cautious optimism among observers.\n\nThe decision caps a highly publicized search for a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom the president has repeatedly lambasted for not cutting interest rates more swiftly.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that Warsh “certainly wants to cut rates,” but added that he did not wish to question Warsh on commitments to do so.\n\n“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, announcing his choice.\n\n“On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting,’ and he will never let you down,” Trump added.\n\nWarsh, 55, was the youngest person to serve as a Fed governor, a role he held from 2006 to 2011.\n\nTrump considered Warsh for the top Fed job too during his first presidency, but eventually chose Powell — a decision he quickly soured on.\n\nPrices of precious metals — seen as safe haven investments — sank Friday in a sign that investors were reassured by Trump’s choice. The dollar pushed higher.\n\n“I think markets are broadly happy at the moment,” Atlantic Council international economics chair Josh Lipsky told AFP.\n\n“It is a pick that another Republican president may have made,” Lipsky said. “He cares about the history of the Fed, the process of the Fed, central bank independence, he’s talked about this before.”\n\nPowell’s chairmanship ends in May, and it remains unclear if he will also step down from the Fed’s board of governors, which would free up another vacancy Trump could fill.\n\n– Senate hurdle –\n\nWarsh will need to be confirmed by the US Senate, where he will face tough questions from lawmakers amid growing concerns about threats to Fed independence.\n\nTrump’s attempt to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook, and his administration’s investigation into Powell over renovation costs at the bank, have sparked worries about the institution’s insulation from politics.\n\nAn erosion of Fed independence could have negative ramifications for the economy, experts warn.\n\nWarsh must now get through a Senate Banking Committee hearing while “maintaining the confidence of both markets and the president,” said economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nAfter that, he must pass a confirmation vote in the Senate with a simple majority.\n\nBut Republican Thom Tillis of the banking committee reiterated Friday his plan to oppose the confirmation of Fed nominees — including the next chairman — until the probe against Powell is resolved.\n\nThe panel’s top Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren, warned that Warsh’s nomination “is the latest step in Trump’s attempt to seize control of the Fed.”\n\nWith 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the committee, a single Republican’s opposition could trigger an impasse.\n\n– Economic challenges –\n\nWarsh was once seen as an inflation “hawk” favoring higher interest rates to curb price hikes.\n\nBut he has stepped up criticism of the Fed recently, endorsing policy positions of the Trump administration.\n\nAs Trump continues to call for lower rates, analysts are monitoring if Warsh defends the bank’s independence.\n\nHe will need to convince markets and policymakers that he is upholding the Fed’s dual mandate of stable prices and low unemployment — despite political pressure.\n\nAlready, the Fed’s job has become increasingly challenging as US tariffs fuel worries of stubborn inflation, while the employment market cools.\n\nPolicymakers walk a tightrope in deciding if they should keep rates higher to curb inflation or lower them to support the economy.\n\nWith the labor market likely deteriorating further and inflation expected to ease, the next Fed chief could uncontroversially reduce rates, Tombs said.\n\nBut it remains to be seen if he will still push for cuts if inflation proves sticky in months ahead.\n\nTrump’s selection ends a race that narrowed to four contenders — Warsh; Fed governor Christopher Waller; Rick Rieder of BlackRock; and Trump’s top economic adviser Kevin Hassett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: central bank chief Donald Trump Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trench Town Rocks to emphasise Bunny Wailer family’s cultural impact \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n Evelyn Carridice, the sister of the late Bunny Wailer, has announced that Trench Town will officially open Reggae Month 2026 with a community-led cult... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Bag: Shopping with Chef Lumley in Papine, pepper prices ‘hot’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 \n\n\n ST ANDREW, Jamaica – Food prices were higher at the Papine Market compared to our shopping trip at the Linstead Market last week.

It said the exercises would take place from Jan. 27 to Jan. 29 within a circular area with a radius of five nautical miles.\n\nIran said the designated airspace, from ground level up to 25,000 feet, would be restricted and hazardous for the duration of the drills.\n\nThe warning comes as the United States steps up its military posture in the region amid escalating tensions with Tehran.\n\nUS Air Forces Central (AFCENT) earlier announced it would conduct a multi-day readiness exercise across the US Central Command area of responsibility to demonstrate rapid deployment and sustainment capabilities.\n\nThe United States has said that all options, including military action, remain on the table in dealing with Iran, as Washington and Israel seek to change Tehran’s ruling system. Iranian officials have warned that any US attack would draw a “swift and comprehensive” response.\n\nThe US military has also announced a major multi-day exercise in the Middle East, sharply raising tensions after weeks of unrest inside Iran triggered by anti-government protests that began in late December.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, US Central Command said the drills would “demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower across” the Middle East, underscoring operational readiness across multiple locations. US officials declined to give details about the timing or locations of the exercise.\n\nThe military activity follows the arrival of a US aircraft carrier strike group in the region. Two US officials told Reuters that the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers have entered the Middle East, expanding President Donald Trump’s options to defend US forces or potentially take military action against Iran.\n\nTrump said last week the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran, though he added that he hoped it would not be used. The warships began deploying from the Asia-Pacific region earlier this month as tensions rose over Iran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to intervene if Iranian authorities continued to kill protesters, but said the demonstrations had since abated. He said he had been told that killings were subsiding and that there was currently no plan to execute prisoners.\n\nWhile the US military has often surged forces into the Middle East during periods of tension, it staged a major buildup last year ahead of June strikes on Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nIn addition to the carrier and warships, the Pentagon is moving fighter jets and air-defence systems to the region. Over the weekend, the US military said the exercise would show its ability to deploy and sustain airpower across the Middle East.\n\nA senior Iranian official said last week that Tehran would view any attack as an “all-out war against us.”\n\nThe United Arab Emirates said on Monday it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for any hostile military actions against Iran. The US military’s Al Dhafra Air Base, south of Abu Dhabi, is a key hub for US Air Force operations in the region.","summary":"I have been absent for some time, but now I remember why I used to love this blog.

He also called on countries to clear their outstanding dues.The warning was addressed publicly during a Friday afternoon briefing, when a UN spokesperson was asked about the letter and responded that, \"when it comes to paying, it's now or never\".Expanding on the organisation's financial vulnerability, spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters, \"We do not have the sort of cash reserves and the sort of liquidity to keep functioning as we've done in previous years - and this is something that the secretary-general has warned with increasing strength each year.\"While Guterres did not single out any country, the appeal comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has moved to cut Washington's financial support for multilateral bodies. His administration has announced plans to withdraw from several UN agencies and has also promoted what Trump calls a \"Board of Peace\" initiative.Against this backdrop, Al Jazeera reported that some experts believe the initiative is aimed at sidelining the United Nations.Commenting on the proposal, Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said, \"Trump's board appears to be a kind of pay-to-play, global club, judging from the USD 1 billion fee for permanent membership.\"\n\nHe further added, \"Instead of handing Trump USD 1 billion checks, governments should work together to protect the UN and other institutions established to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law, the global rule of law, and accountability.\"Under the existing system, UN membership fees are calculated based on factors such as national gross domestic product, debt levels and economic capacity, with the United States contributing 22 per cent of the core budget, followed by China at 20 per cent.Despite this framework, Guterres said that by the end of 2025, unpaid dues had reached a record USD 1.57 billion, without identifying the countries responsible.Reiterating the urgency of reform, he warned, according to Al Jazeera, \"Either all Member States honour their obligations to pay in full and on time - or Member States must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"Even as financial pressures mount, the UN earlier this month approved a USD 3.45 billion budget for 2026, reflecting a 7 per cent reduction from last year as the organisation attempts to curb spending.However, despite these cost-cutting steps, Guterres cautioned in his letter that the UN could exhaust its cash reserves by July.He also pointed to what he described as an outdated rule that requires the organisation to return hundreds of millions of dollars in unused funds to member states each year.Highlighting the impact of this mechanism, Guterres said, as reported by Al Jazeera, \"In other words, we are trapped in a Kafkaesque cycle expected to give back cash that does not exist.\"Reflecting the scale of the challenge, figures published on the organisation's website show that as of Thursday, only 36 of the UN's 193 member countries had fully paid their regular 2026 contributions.

At the current gold price of US$5,500 per ounce, central banks’ gold value would be US$6.37 trillion, which would bring central bank reserves (including gold) to US$19.37 trillion. Thus, gold represents nearly 33 per cent of total reserves which in turn would be 16.5 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025.\nThe Trump administration’s policy gyrations and high levels of fiscal debt have caused major investors to reduce their dollar weighting in key portfolios, with the US dollar depreciating at least 6.4 per cent in real effective exchange rate terms in 2025.

The market has been spooked by Trump’s call to increase defence expenditure to US$1.5 trillion by 2027, compared with US$900 billion in 2026.\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which front-loaded tax cuts and increased spending, was estimated by the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget to raise federal debt by US$15 trillion, or as much as US$31 trillion if tax cuts are made permanent, increasing the debt-to-GDP to an eye-popping 172-190 per cent of GDP.\n\nWith these long-term fiscal concerns, the US dollar is depreciating slowly against other reserve currencies, but massively against gold. Oddly, it seems that almost all central banks would like the price of gold to continue increasing, since it bolsters their total reserve power.

Since the liquidity of gold turnover is as high, if not higher, than sovereign debt bonds, gold for large investors is as good as cash, even though prices may be volatile.\nGiven geopolitical uncertainties, central banks in advanced economies behave differently from the rest. Central banks in the West (US and European Union) have around 19,000 tonnes of gold or 52 per cent of total official gold holdings. In the US, France, Germany and Italy, gold comprises around 80 per cent of reserves today.

After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, emerging markets increased their reserves to protect their exchange rates. However, if a net settlement system is applied using a gold-backed Brics currency unit, the amount of foreign exchange reserves could technically be reduced by up to 70-80 per cent.\nWhat we are witnessing is a moment in which the global community has to decide between believing in the authority of central banks to determine the value of fiat currencies by influencing interest rates or believing in gold as a major store of value. US President Donald Trump’s policy gyrations and growing fiscal debt have shown that the US dollar poses risks to investors.\nThe safer store of value is gold held in domestic vaults that would not be subject to confiscation risks.

Since the liquidity of gold turnover is as high, if not higher, than sovereign debt bonds, gold for large investors is as good as cash, even though prices may be volatile.\nGiven geopolitical uncertainties, central banks in advanced economies behave differently from the rest. Central banks in the West (US and European Union) have around 19,000 tonnes of gold or 52 per cent of total official gold holdings. In the US, France, Germany and Italy, gold comprises around 80 per cent of reserves today. The Brics grouping of emerging market economies has over 6,100 tonnes, or at least 16.8 per cent.\nChina has only 2,300 tonnes, compared with 8,133 tonnes held by the US. For Brics to match the West in gold holdings, its members have to buy aggressively.\n\nWith estimated Brics foreign exchange reserves at around US$5 trillion, they have lots of foreign currency to sell to buy gold. But why do they need such large reserves? The answer lies in the real-time gross settlement system in which the full amount of debt from a given transaction needs to be settled immediately at the time of settlement between central banks.\nThis makes the US dollar the premier foreign exchange reserve settlement currency. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, emerging markets increased their reserves to protect their exchange rates. However, if a net settlement system is applied using a gold-backed Brics currency unit, the amount of foreign exchange reserves could technically be reduced by up to 70-80 per cent.\nWhat we are witnessing is a moment in which the global community has to decide between believing in the authority of central banks to determine the value of fiat currencies by influencing interest rates or believing in gold as a major store of value. US President Donald Trump’s policy gyrations and growing fiscal debt have shown that the US dollar poses risks to investors.\nThe safer store of value is gold held in domestic vaults that would not be subject to confiscation risks. But where the price will settle will depend on the psychology of governments, investors and central banks who must hedge their bets against structural risks that have not been encountered since 1971, when the US dollar delinked from gold.\nThe complex path forward is mission impossible. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, when the unspeakable chases the uneatable, it is time to think the unthinkable.","summary":"This year started with a bang – from the United States’ intervention in Venezuela and the investigation opened against US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to US President Donald Trump’s renewed claims on Greenland and the potential for US action following instability in Iran.\nAmid these crises, gold prices are now over US$5,500 per ounce, up over 27 per cent from the price on January 1.

He also talked about the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that their strained ties continue to make peace efforts “difficult.”\nWhat Did Trump Say On The Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal?\nWhile addressing the media at the White House, the US President stated that both the leaders ‘hate each other,’ which is making the peace talks difficult.\n“Zelenskyy and Putin hate each other, and it makes it very difficult. But I think we’re getting very close to getting a settlement.” He added, “I think that we have a good chance of getting it settled,” Trump said.\nAdd India.com as a Preferred Source \nIt is to be noted that the US President’s statement came after talks with Putin. During the conversation, Trump requested a temporary halt to attacks on Ukraine amid extreme winter conditions.\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and various ‌towns ‍for a week, ‍and he agreed to do ‌that,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. “It was very ‍nice. A lot of people ‍said, ‘Don’t waste the call, you’re not going to get that.’ And he did it,” he added.\nHarsh Weather Affecting The Region\nExplaining the context of his request, Trump pointed to unusually harsh weather affecting the region. “It’s extraordinary. It’s not just like cold, it’s extraordinary cold. Record setting cold, over there too, they are having the same, it’s a big pile of bad weather,” he said, drawing a comparison with a cold snap in Washington.\nReiterating his remarks, the US President added, “They’ve never experienced cold like that. And I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week. And he agreed to do that, and I have to tell you, it was very nice.”\nViolence Continues On The Ground\nTrump’s comments come even as violence continues on the ground. Ukrainian officials on Thursday said three people were killed in an overnight Russian drone attack in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, while Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia could be preparing for another major assault.\nThese major developments come ahead of America mediated peace talks which is expected this weekend. Meanwhile, Russia has invited the Ukrainian President to Moscow for talks to end the nearly four-year-long conflict, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Thursday.\nUshakov further stated that Moscow would ensure President Zelenskyy’s security during his visit, Russia Today reported.","summary":"Home News Zelenskyy, Putin HATE each other: Donald Trump issues BIG statement on Russia-Ukraine peace deal Donald Trump said that progress was being made toward ending the Russia–Ukraine conflict.

Following a year of regulatory rollbacks and sustained efforts by the Trump administration to dismantle federal climate policy, this move is expected to trigger wide ranging ripple effects—undermining international efforts to curb climate change, accelerating environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, and increasing risks to human health, safety, and long-term development.\n\nSince its adoption, the Paris Agreement has been instrumental to global climate action initiatives—mobilizing countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, expand renewable energy, strengthen climate adaptation, and protect vulnerable communities. The agreement requires member states to regularly update their emissions-reduction targets and submit plans for achieving them, serving as a vital framework for sustaining collective progress and maintaining transparent communication among nations. \n\nAmnesty International warns that these actions by the Trump administration risk defunding “key multilateral and bilateral climate institutions and programming,” a shift that would have significant repercussions for not only the United States but for the broader international community. The organization warns that U.S. funding for United Nations (UN) agencies is expected to cease imminently, which would halt lifesaving support for climate-sensitive communities and disrupt critical climate monitoring and mitigation efforts. \n\nSpecifically, the U.S. withdrawal is expected to undermine global efforts to address climate-induced displacement, disaster recovery, and infrastructure rebuilding. Communities in developing countries are projected to bear the heaviest burdens, as reduced support will leave them more vulnerable to escalating climate-driven losses. \n\nBefore the withdrawal, the UN was already grappling with a severe funding crisis – one made worse by the U.S.’s refusal to pay its assessed contributions to the regular budget and its sharp cuts to foreign assistance. The U.S. has also withdrawn from the board of the UN Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), a crucial mechanism supporting vulnerable communities facing climate-driven disasters. Its previously pledged USD 17.5 million remains uncertain, raising further concerns about the fund’s ability to operate effectively. \n\nWith this move, the United States becomes the only nation to exit the agreement in history, joining Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the few states not party to it. With the U.S. being a major global actor in climate change negotiations, the withdrawal risks reducing diplomatic pressure on other wealthy nations to scale up contributions. \n\n“The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement sets a disturbing precedent that seeks to instigate a race to the bottom, and, along with its withdrawal from other major global climate pacts, aims to dismantle the global system of cooperation on climate action,” said Marta Schaaf, Amnesty International’s Programme Director for Climate, ESJ and Corporate Accountability. \n\n“The US is one of several powerful anti-climate actors but as an influential superpower, this decision, along with acts of coercion and bullying of other countries and powerful actors to double down on fossil fuels, causes particular harm and threatens to reverse more than a decade of global climate progress under the agreement,” she added.\n\n“For us, the fight against climate change continues. The fight for a just transition continues. The fight to get more resources for climate mitigation and adaptation, especially for those most vulnerable countries continues and our efforts will not waver in that part,” said UN Spokesperson to the Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric.\n\nOn January 22, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released its annual State of Finance for Nature report, which monitors global finance flows toward nature-based solutions. The report found that investments in activities that harm the climate are roughly 30 times the investments for ecosystem conservation and restoration. \n\nAccording to figures from UNEP, the private sector makes up approximately 70 percent of global financing that harms the environment, only giving back 10 percent of funding that works to protect it. In 2023, roughly USD 7.3 trillion was invested into global activities that harmed the environment, with USD 4.9 trillion coming from private sectors and USD 2.4 trillion coming from the public sectors, which aim to maximize support for fossil fuel usage, agriculture, water, transport, and construction. \n\nThis, compounded with President Donald Trump’s renewed “drill, baby, drill” policy, is expected to further destabilize global climate efforts by accelerating fossil fuel dependence, undermining emissions-reduction targets, and widening the financial gap for urgent climate adaptation and ecosystem restoration. \n\nJeremy Wallace, a professor of China studies at John Hopkins University, told reporters that the U.S.’s expanding reliance on fossil fuels sends a signal to the international community that scaling back climate ambition is acceptable. This risks encouraging other major emitters to pursue weaker energy transitions and less lofty emissions-targets. \n\nChina, for instance, recently pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by only 7-10 percent over the next decade, a target that has been widely criticized by climate experts as unambitious and insufficient to meet global emissions-targets. \n\n“If the domestic market in the US continues to be dominated by fossil fuels through the fiat of an authoritarian government, that will continue to have an impact on the rest of the world,” said Basav Sen, climate justice project director at Institute for Policy Studies. “It will be that much harder for low-income countries, who are very dependent on fossil fuel production and exports, to be able to make their transitions with the US saying that we won’t fund any of it.”\n\nIPS UN Bureau Report\n\n© Inter Press Service (20260130175026) — All Rights Reserved.

While some people are planning to avoid it, others like taking a look behind the doors of the White House. The film follows the First Lady in the three weeks leading up to Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration in January 2025.\n\nIn the film, Melania, 55, makes generic statements in support of her husband, in an unconvincing voice-over, the documentary makes it clear to viewers that the First Lady is not very fond of Donald.\n\nMeanwhile, the president doesn’t always support his First Lady, as in one stiff moment towards the end of the documentary, Trump, 79, brands Melania “difficult” as they prepare to spend their first night in the White House together.\n\nDirected by filmmaker Brett Ratner, the documentary reveals a stiff and unnatural portrait of Melania Trump, who is seen strutting in her expensive heels, between her comfortable penthouse in New York City, at Mar-a-Lago, and, finally, in the White House.\n\nThe footage does no favors for the couple’s image and viewers rarely see the couple interacting, and when they do, it’s contrived and painful to see. For example, as the Trumps prepare to spend their first night in the White House, following many inauguration events, it is painful to watch. When Melania finally kicks off her shoes and sits down, she says, “Welcome home,” with an unnatural giggle.\n\n“That was an amazing evening, and it was an amazing day. The inauguration was incredible,” Trump says. “And you had your first lady with you right by your side,” a voice-over says.\n\n“Nobody like her. She’s very difficult. But nobody like her,” the Donald responds. “She’s not diff— she’s great,” he instantly corrects himself, seemingly aware that the cameras captured the candid moment.\n\nBest review ever.\nOn the Amazons Melania “documentary”:\n“If they showed this film on a plane, people would still walk out.” – Variety 💀 pic.twitter.com/FWamDuCnK2\n— The Left Bible (@theleftbible) January 28, 2026\n\nThis documentary offers viewers nothing of Donald and Melania as a happy and loving couple and basically focuses on Melania’s journey from private citizen to the First Lady for the second time. However, in certain places, the audience does burst out laughing, especially when Trump is speaking on the phone and bragging about the election results to his bored spouse, who does admit she doesn’t watch and probably doesn’t care.\n\n“Nothing like it has happened before. Ever. A landslide,” Trump boasts excitedly, to which she responds dryly, “That’s for sure.” While viewers keep laughing, Melania tries to end the conversation. Whether she does or not, she promises to watch the coverage of the election later on the news.\n\nScanning the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, one from Karl Quinn of The Age reads, “It’s impossible not to feel that the real purpose of this portrait is not insight, but rather distraction from the awfulness and corruption of her husband’s regime.”\n\nGeorge Simpson of The Express wrote, “In the end, what transpired was mostly dull behind-the-scenes movements offering little new insight into the private world of Mrs. Trump.”\n\nFranck Sheck of The Hollywood Reporter, wrote, “To say that Melania is a hagiography would be an insult to hagiographies. This is a film that fawns so lavishly over its subject that you feel downright unpatriotic not gushing over it.”\n\nHowever, some viewers did enjoy the documentary, with one writing, “We loved it. A life that most people in the world could not fathom. I enjoyed seeing a small glimpse of it.”\n\nMelania releases in theaters across the country and around the world on Friday, January 30, 2026.","summary":"Love it or hate it, the First Lady’s documentary, Melania, is getting people talking.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-shades-melania-in-documentary-calls-her-very-difficult","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/donald-trump-melania-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 01:16:52","author":"Anne Sewell","authors":["Anne Sewell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.058},{"id":397886136,"title":"Trump expects Iran to seek deal to avoid US strikes","text":"Washington - President Donald Trump predicted on Jan 30 that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal rather than face American military action, despite Tehran warning that its arsenal of missiles would never be up for discussion. \n\n“I can say this, they do want to make a deal,” Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \n\nAsked if he had given Iran a deadline to enter talks on its nuclear and missile programmes, he said “yeah, I have,” but refused to say what it was.\n\n“We have a large armada, flotilla, call it whatever you want, heading toward Iran right now,” Mr Trump said, referring to a US naval carrier group in waters off Iran.\n\n“Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that’s good.

That outcome could be reached by the Iranians doing the right thing, and we hope that happens,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Iran’s top security body – secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani – met Tehran’s ally Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\nNo details of their talks emerged, but Moscow has offered to mediate between Washington and Tehran.\n\nIran’s top diplomat said on Jan 31 that his country’s missile and defence capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table.\n\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing”.\n\nBut, he emphasised, “Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” adding there were no plans to meet with US officials on resuming talks.\n\nUS news site Axios reported this week that Washington officials say any deal would have to include a cap on Iran’s arsenal of long-range missiles, the removal of enriched uranium from the country and a ban on independent enrichment. \n\nMr Serhan Afacan, director of IRAM, the Ankara-based Centre for Iranian Studies, told AFP that trying to link a nuclear deal with other issues would likely “be impossible.” \n\n“For now, the ballistic missile programme remains a red line, as it sits at the core of Iran’s defence architecture,” he said. \n\n‘Reducing’ tensions \n\nIran has warned that it would respond instantly with missile strikes against US bases, ships and allies, notably Israel.\n\n“We are not limiting the geography of confrontation to the sea alone and have prepared ourselves for broader and more advanced scenarios,” the head of Iran’s Defence Council, Ali Shamkhani, said on Jan 31, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference in Istanbul with Araghchi, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Israel was pushing for the United States to attack Iran, and urged Washington to “not allow this to happen”.\n\nIran has blamed the United States and Israel for the protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances and peaked on Jan 8 and 9, accusing the two countries of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that turned peaceful demonstrations into “riots”.\n\nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has confirmed 6,563 people killed in the demonstrations, including 6,170 protesters and 124 children, as internet restrictions imposed on Jan 8 continue to hinder access to information inside the country. \n\nBut rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher, with estimates in the tens of thousands. \n\nIranian authorities give a toll of more than 3,000 deaths in the protests, but say the majority were members of security forces or bystanders killed by “rioters”.

His administration also has clamped down on forms of legal immigration, with broad travel bans and reviews of refugee and asylum cases.The number of available visas also was expanded under former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump during periods of his 2017-2021 presidency.Employers in the seasonal businesses - including hotels - have clamored for more visas. Some construction businesses have complained of a lack of workers during Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown.Groups that favor lower levels of immigration oppose the visas, saying they undercut wages for U.S. workers.Trump has made it harder for tech businesses to obtain workers through the H-1B program, tacking on a $100,000 fee that has triggered a legal challenge.A temporary rule making the additional H-2B visas available will be formally published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the notice said.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/us-to-add-65000-seasonal-h-2b-guest-worker-visas-for-2026-1933915","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/01/31/2005121-vvv.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 01:14:59","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":397885340,"title":"Resurfaced post exposes new Cleveland Browns coach Todd Monken's real thoughts on Donald Trump","text":"A 2017 social media post by new Cleveland Browns head coach Todd Monken has given fans a clear indication of his political leanings. \n\nMonken, who joined the ailing Browns this week from the Baltimore Ravens, was effusive in his praise for Trump just months after the president's 2016 election victory.\n\nHe wrote: 'Don't get the Trump hatred.

The court issued its decision on Thursday, but it did not formally release its ruling or explain its rationale. Local television station TVN first reported on the decision, which has been reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by a court official. The ruling gave Washington a victory amid the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry over global trade routes and President Donald Trump's efforts to exert dominance in Latin America. The court said in its decision that the contract held by Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong's CK Hutchison, violated Panama's constitution by giving the company exclusive privileges and tax exemptions. The contract also lacked a requirement for environmental impact assessments and said the government had to seek Panama Ports' approval before granting other concessions, the court said. \"Disproportionate rights and prerogatives are granted to PPC, creating conditions that effectively eliminate competition and result in a monopoly in practice, even though no monopoly is formally declared,\" the nine-member court said in a unanimous decision. \"Furthermore, it places in private hands decisions that should be in the public interest ... prioritizing private interests over the general welfare of society.\" The decision could complicate CK Hutchison's proposed $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide - including the Panamanian terminals - to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. Trump had championed the proposed sale - particularly of Panama Ports' assets - as a victory because it put operations at the canal under a majority U.S. ownership. But China opposed the sale and threatened to block the deal. After the ruling, China's foreign ministry said it would take \"all necessary measures\" to defend the rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and Hong Kong's government criticized what it described as coercive interference by foreign governments in international trade relations.

By Friday evening, more than 600,000 documents had been published online. Millions of files that prosecutors had identified as potentially subject to release under the law remain under wraps, however, drawing criticism from Democrats.\n\nHere’s what we know so far about the files now being reviewed by a team of Associated Press reporters:\n\nEpstein talked politics with Steve Bannon, ex-Obama official\n\nThe documents show Epstein exchanged hundreds of friendly texts with Steve Bannon, a top advisor to President Donald Trump, some months before Epstein’s death.\n\nThey discussed politics, travel and a documentary Bannon was said to be planning that would help salvage Epstein’s reputation.\n\nIn March 2019, Bannon asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.\n\nA couple of months later, Epstein messaged to Bannon: “Now you can understand why trump wakes up in the middle of the night sweating when he hears you and I are friends.”\n\nThe context is unclear from the documents, which were released with many redactions and little clear organization.\n\nAnother 2018 exchange focused on Trump’s threats at the time to oust Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he had named to the post just the year prior.\n\nAround the same time, Epstein also communicated with Kathy Ruemmler, a lawyer and former Obama White House official. In a typo-filled email, he warned that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”\n\nBannon did not immediately respond to a message from the AP seeking comment. Ruemmler said through a spokesperson she was associated with Epstein professionally during her time as a lawyer in private practice and now “regrets ever knowing him.”\n\nHe also chatted with Elon Musk and Howard Lutnick about island visits\n\nBillionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk emailed Epstein in 2012 and 2013 about visiting his infamous island compound, the scene of many allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nEpstein inquired in an email about how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter, and Musk responded it would likely be just him as his partner at the time. “What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?” he wrote, according to the Justice Department records.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Spokespersons for Musk’s companies, Tesla and X, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday.\n\nMusk has maintained that he repeatedly turned down the disgraced financier’s overtures. “Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,” he posted on X in 2025\n\nEpstein also invited Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to the island in December 2012. Lutnick’s wife enthusiastically accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. The two also had drinks on another occasion in 2011, according to a schedule. Six years later, they emailed about the construction of a building across the street from both of their homes.\n\nLutnick has distanced himself from Epstein, calling him “gross” and saying in 2025 that he cut ties decades ago. He didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe records also have new details on Epstein’s incarceration and suicide\n\nEpstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019, and found dead in his cell just over a month later.\n\nThe latest batch of documents includes emails between investigators about Epstein’s death, including an investigator’s observation that his final communication doesn’t look like a suicide note. Multiple investigations have determined that Epstein’s death was a suicide.\n\nThe records also detail a trick that jail staffers used to fool the media gathered outside while Epstein’s body was removed: they used boxes and sheets to create what appeared to be a body and loaded it into a white van labeled as belonging to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.\n\nThe reporters followed the van when it left the jail, not knowing that Epstein’s actual body was loaded into a black vehicle, which departed “unnoticed,” according to the interview notes.\n\nAssociated Press reporters across the country contributed to this story, including Michael R. Sisak and Philip Marcelo in New York, Cal Woodward in Washington, Safiyah Riddle in Montgomery, Alabama, and Meg Kinnard in South Carolina.","summary":"The Justice Department said it was disclosing more than 3 million pages of documents, as well as thousands of videos and photos, as required by a law passed by Congress.\n\n\nThe post Huge cache of Epstein documents includes emails financier exchanged with wealthy and powerful appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2026/01/30/huge-cache-of-epstein-documents-includes-emails-financier-exchanged-with-wealthy-and-powerful/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Justice_Department_Jeffrey_Epstein_14041-697cd9b46e97a-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 01:10:36","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":397886518,"title":"UN says it could have zero cash by July as US withholds dues","text":"ReutersUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres \n\nThe U.N. chief ⁠has told member states the organisation is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse,\" citing unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces the global body to return unspent money, a letter seen by Reuters on Friday showed. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly spoken about the organisation's worsening liquidity crisis ‌but this is his ‌starkest warning yet, and it comes as its main contributor the U.S. is retreating from multilateralism on numerous fronts. \"The crisis is deepening, threatening programme delivery and risking financial ‌collapse. And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future,\" Guterres wrote in a letter to ambassadors dated January 28. The U.S. has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to its regular and peacekeeping budgets. U.S. President Donald Trump has described the U.N. as having \"great potential\" but said it is not fulfilling that, and he has launched a Board of Peace which some fear could undermine the older international body.Live Events Founded in 1945, the U.N. has 193 member states and works to maintain international peace and security, promote human ‌rights, foster social and ‍economic development, and coordinate humanitarian aid. In his letter, Guterres said \"decisions not to honour assessed contributions that ‍finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally ‌announced.\" He did not say which state or states he was referring to, and a U.N. spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. 'KAFKAESQUE CYCLE' Under U.N. rules, contributions depend on the size of the economy of each member state. The U.S. accounts for 22% of the core budget followed by China with 20%. But by the end of 2025 there was a record $1.57 billion in outstanding dues, Guterres said, without naming the nations that owed them. \"Either all Member States honour their obligations to pay in full and on time - or Member States must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules ‍to prevent an imminent financial collapse,\" he said. U.N. officials say the U.S. currently owes $2.19 billion to the regular U.N. budget, another $1.88 billion for active peace-keeping missions and $528 million for past peace-keeping missions. The U.S. State ‍Department did not ⁠immediately respond to a request for comment ⁠on the Guterres letter. Guterres launched a reform task force last year, known as UN80, which seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency. To that end, states agreed to cut the 2026 budget by around 7% to $3.45 billion. Still, Guterres warned in the letter that the organisation could run out of cash by July. One of the problems is a rule now seen as antiquated whereby the global body has to credit back hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent dues to states each year. \"In other words, we are trapped in a Kafkaesque cycle expected to give back cash that does not exist,\" said Guterres, referring to author Franz Kafka who wrote about oppressive bureaucratic processes.

He takes the fat pill, or the fat shot, and he was in London, and he said, ‘It costs $87 here. It costs $1,300 in New York.

It was for him. It didn’t work. And he brought up a good point, but it didn’t work.”\n\nJD Vance interrupted Trump with a chuckle-worthy response and jokingly said, “He’s not talking about me.”\n\nThe President continued, “He knows who I’m talking about. He’s going crazy, begs me not to — begs me not to talk about him. No, it’s not that great. Vice president — no — but he begs me not to mention his name.” Interestingly, this is the second time Trump has narrated this story at a meeting.\n\nAs Donald Trump proceeded to wrap up the meeting, he asked Vance, “JD, if you would like to say something, you can… He is, after all, the Vice President of the United States.” Vance’s reply to this was: “It’s okay, sir. I’m here for the free coffee.”\n\nPresident Trump: “JD, if you would like to say something, you can… He is, after all, the Vice President of the United States.”\nVice President JD Vance: “It’s okay, sir.

He denied it and said, “Some people said he closed his eyes. Look, it got pretty boring. I didn’t sleep. I just closed them because I wanted to get the hell outta here.”\n\nTrump mentioned how cabinet meetings can veer towards a boring side, adding, “I love these people. There are a lot of people. It was a little bit on the boring side, but I didn’t sleep. I didn’t sleep, by the way. I don’t sleep much.”\n\nHe blamed the journalists for photographing him when he was blinking and said, “Some of them got me in a blink.

Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!”\n\nA spokesperson for the Virgin Group said that the word “harem” referenced three adult members of Epstein’s team. They added that, had the full facts about Epstein’s past been known, Branson would not have used this term — nor had contact with Epstein.\n\nBranson then delivered lengthy public relations advice to Epstein, who by then had pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and had completed a brief work-release incarceration.\n\n“I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you've been a brilliant advisor to him,” Branson wrote, “that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17 ½ year old woman and were punished for it, that you've more than learnt your lesson and have done nothing that's against the law since and, yes, as a single man you seem to have a penchant for women. But there's nothing wrong with that.

Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!”\n\nA spokesperson for the Virgin Group said that the word “harem” referenced three adult members of Epstein’s team. They added that, had the full facts about Epstein’s past been known, Branson would not have used this term — nor had contact with Epstein.\n\nBranson then delivered lengthy public relations advice to Epstein, who by then had pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a minor for prostitution and had completed a brief work-release incarceration.\n\n“I think if Bill Gates was willing to say that you've been a brilliant advisor to him,” Branson wrote, “that you slipped up many years ago by sleeping with a 17 ½ year old woman and were punished for it, that you've more than learnt your lesson and have done nothing that's against the law since and, yes, as a single man you seem to have a penchant for women.

The demonstration disrupted a January 18 service at Cities Church in St Paul.\n\nA magistrate judge ordered Lemon released to await trial after a night in custody following his arrest late on Thursday by the FBI.\n\nDressed in a cream-colored double-breasted suit, Lemon spoke only to say \"yes, your honor\" when asked if he understood the proceedings. His attorney confirmed the not guilty plea.\n\n\"He is committed to fighting this. He's not going anywhere,\" said Lemon attorney Marilyn Bednarski.\n\n\"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" Lemon told reporters after the hearing. \"I will not be silenced. I look forward to my day in court.\"\n\nA grand jury indictment charged Lemon, who is Black, with conspiring to deprive others of their civil rights and violating a law that has been used to crack down on demonstrations at abortion clinics but also forbids obstructing access to houses of worship. Six other people who were at the protest, including another journalist, are facing the same charges.\n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets of Minneapolis and other U.S. cities on Friday to denounce an immigration crackdown in which federal agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens, sparking one of the most serious political crises Trump has faced.\n\nFree press advocates voiced alarm over the arrests. Actor and activist Jane Fonda went to show support for Lemon, telling journalists the president was violating the Constitution. \"They arrested the wrong Don,\" Fonda said.\n\nTrump, who has castigated the protesters in Minnesota, blamed the Cities Church protest on \"agitators and insurrectionists\" who he said wanted to intimidate Christian worshippers.\n\nOrganizers told Lemon they focused on the church because they believed a pastor there was also a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee.\n\nMore than a week ago, the government arrested three people it said organized the protests. But the magistrate judge in St. Paul who approved those arrests ruled that, without a grand jury indictment, there was not probable cause to issue arrest warrants for Lemon and several others the Justice Department also wanted to prosecute.\n\n\"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand,\" Abbe Lowell, Lemon's lawyer, said in a statement, invoking constitutional free speech protections.\n\nIn the livestream archived on his YouTube channel, Lemon can be seen meeting with and interviewing the activists before they go to the church, and later chronicling the disruption inside, interviewing congregants, protesters, and a pastor, who asks Lemon and the protesters to leave.\n\nIndependent local journalist Georgia Fort and two others who had been at the church were also arrested and charged with the same crimes.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Dulce Foster on Friday ordered Fort's release, denying prosecutors' request to hold her in custody, according to court documents.\n\nThe Justice Department, over the past year, has tried to prosecute a succession of Trump's critics and perceived enemies. Its charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who both led investigations into Trump, were thrown out by a judge.\n\nLemon spent 17 years at CNN, becoming one of its most recognizable personalities, and frequently criticizes Trump in his YouTube broadcasts. Lemon was fired by CNN in 2023 after making sexist on-air comments for which he later apologized.\n\nTrump frequently lambastes journalists and news outlets, going further than his predecessors by sometimes suing them for damages or stripping them of access-granting credentials.\n\nFBI agents with a search warrant seized laptops and other devices this month from the home of a Washington Post reporter who has covered Trump's firing of federal workers, saying it was investigating leaks of government secrets.\n\nPress advocates called the FBI search involving the Post reporter and the arrests of Lemon and Fort an escalation of attacks on press freedom.\n\n\"Reporting on protests isn't a crime,\" said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute. Jaffer called the arrests alarming, and said Trump sought \"to tighten the vise around press freedom.\"\n\nTrump has said his attacks are because he is tired of \"fake news\" and hostile coverage.\n\nLegal experts said they were unaware of any U.S. precedent for journalists being arrested after the fact, or under the two laws used to charge Lemon and Fort. They include the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a 1994 measure that prevents obstructing access to abortion clinics and places of worship.","summary":"A magistrate judge ordered Lemon released to await trial after a night in custody following his arrest","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/don-lemon-not-guilty-minnesota-protest-b2911308.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/13/14/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YN7aN9fl-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-31 01:07:37","author":"Jana Winter,Jane Ross and Andrew Goudsward","authors":["Jana Winter","Jane Ross and Andrew Goudsward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":397884820,"title":"US cannot keep oil prices below $50 per barrel, Jeffrey Sachs tells TASS","text":"MOSCOW, January 31. /TASS/.

Americans are paying more interest on credit cards than ever. \n\nDrawing attention to these rising costs, President Donald Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The proposal has drawn a mix of bipartisan praise and backlash from top bankers.\n\nRelated Content\n\nAs of November 2025, the average credit card interest rate reached 20.97% for all accounts and 22.30% for accounts with balances, according to the Federal Reserve’s G.19 Consumer Credit report. Collectively, Americans owe a staggering $1.23 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, the highest level on record, the New York Fed reported.\n\n \"We will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,\" Trump posted on his social network Truth Social. Researchers at Vanderbilt University found a 10% rate cap would save Americans about $100 billion in credit card interest annually, but card issuers would likely cut back on rewards to lower-tier credit cardholders by as much as $27 billion to remain profitable. \n\nWhile the rate cap would help make good on Trump's campaign promise to bring down rising costs for Americans, the measure would only be temporary. And industry groups say it could have unintended consequences for consumers who are already struggling financially.\n\nThe American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America issued a joint statement in response to Trump’s proposal, warning the cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small businesses.\"\n\nThe ABA said that the proposed rate cap would force issuers to close or drastically reduce credit lines of 74% to 85% of open credit card accounts, impacting as many as 159 million cardholders.\n\nJPMorgan $JPM Chase Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum echoed those concerns during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. He claimed a rate cap would cause consumers to \"lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most.\"\n\nHow credit card interest rates got so high\n\nCredit card issuers use a formula to set the annual percentage rate (APR) consumers are charged when they carry a monthly balance. A credit card’s APR is a variable interest rate based on the prime rate — a benchmark interest rate linked to the Federal Reserve — plus a margin set by issuers.\n\nTo determine the margin, lenders assess how likely you are to repay your monthly credit card balance based on your credit score, payment history and income. As with most lending products, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate.\n\n“The market largely sets credit card rates,\" said Jason Steele, founder of CardCon and a veteran credit card expert. \n\nWhen Steele began writing about credit cards in 2008, the prime rate plummeted to 3.25% as the Fed responded to the financial crisis. It stayed there for seven years and was down near zero through much of the pandemic, he explained. But as inflation climbed, the Fed aggressively hiked rates to combat it, pushing credit card APRs higher, too. The prime rate reached 8.5% in July 2023, and currently sits at 6.75%.\n\n\"If you go all the way back to around 1980, it soared right up into the 20s,\" Steele said. \"That was the prime rate, which is incredible, if you think about it, because the credit cards [rates] are above that.\"\n\nUnlike a mortgage or auto loan that’s secured by an asset, credit cards are unsecured debt because there’s no collateral securing it if you default on your account. That’s why card issuers charge higher interest rates to account for the greater risk they assume.\n\nMatt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, noted that credit card rates have been relatively stable since the Credit Card Act of 2009, moving primarily in response to Fed actions. After that law passed, he noted, First Premier Bank briefly carried an APR of 79.9% as issuers tested what the market would bear.\n\nCredit card rewards programs push APRs higher\n\nCredit cards with coveted travel points and cash-back rewards come at a steep cost card issuers make up for it through charging higher APRs, Steele said. \n\nIn 2022, card holders earned $41.1 billion in rewards, up 58% from $26.1 billion in 2019, according to a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). With ABA data showing that 80% of Americans have at least one credit card that offers rewards, the consumer demand for plastic with perks isn’t going away anytime soon.\n\n\"Credit cards that don't offer rewards will always have a lower interest rate than a similar card that does,\" Steele said. Non-rewards cards typically offer rates two or three percentage points lower. \"Cash-back rewards are really never worth paying a higher interest rate.\"\n\nSchulz noted that a 10% rate cap could result in credit card issuers scaling back their rewards offerings, noting that the cap would be “a seismic change” for the industry. Plus, to make up for the lost revenue gained in higher APRs, credit cards might jack up their annual fees or reduce 0% balance transfer offers, Schulz noted.\n\nHow to avoid high credit card APRs\n\nIt’s unclear if a rate cap will ever materialize, but you don’t have to wait for that to happen to get a handle on credit cards with high interest rates. Here are expert tips to save money and avoid paying steep rates.\n\n1. Pay balances in full. \n\n“It’s always, always, always better to avoid interest by paying your credit card balance in full and on time,” Steele said. This helps you avoid those high rates and, as a bonus, you’ll avoid a vicious debt cycle.\n\n2. Make multiple payments within a month. \n\nIf you carry a balance, pay as much as possible, as early as possible in the billing cycle, Steele recommends. Because credit card interest is assessed based on your average daily balance, paying down the balance before the due dates saves on interest. “If I get my paycheck today but my due date is the 30th, if I pay it down now, I'm essentially saving seven days of interest on that payment,\" he said.\n\n3. Request a lower rate.\n\nIf your rate is too high, you can simply request a lower one. “People don't realize that they can just call their credit card issuer and ask for a lower rate,\" Schulz said, adding that it works more often than people think. Credit card issuers would rather work with you and keep you as a customer rather than risk you defaulting on your payments or taking a 0% balance transfer offer elsewhere.\n\nA 2024 LendingTree survey found that 83% of people who asked for a lower credit card rate received one, with the average reduction around 6.7 percentage points. That translates to annual savings of more than $1,600, LendingTree reported.\n\n4. Consider balance transfers\n\nIf you have good credit and are struggling to get ahead with high interest rates, 0% balance transfer cards remain “about as good a weapon as you can have against credit card debt,” Schulz said. \n\nIf you don’t qualify because of your credit score, consider a personal loan instead. According to NerdWallet, average personal loan rates are closer to 14.48% for borrowers with good credit — far lower than average credit card APRs.\n\n5. Choose no-frills cards over rewards cards\n\nFor anyone carrying a balance, Steele advised steering clear of rewards cards entirely and looking for simpler cards with the lowest interest rates. Shop around, especially with credit unions, which already have their rates capped at 18% by law.\n\n\"Credit unions exist to benefit their membership, whereas public corporations exist to benefit their shareholders,\" he said.\n\n6. Avoid retail cards like the plague\n\nRetail store cards have astronomical interest rates, usually 30% or higher, Schulz said. Those rates “used to be a rate that people only got as a penalty rate when they were late,” he added. \n\nYou’re better off choosing a general credit card with a lower rate so if you do run into trouble paying your balance in full, you’re not stuck with an outsized interest payment.\n\n📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief","summary":"Capping interest at 10% could save Americans billions, but banks say it would shut millions out.

Traders aren’t pricing another rate cut until June, at the earliest.The tension in Trump’s demand for cheaper borrowing costs may ultimately be resolved by a weakening labor market or lower inflation. Such a backdrop would greenlight Warsh to push for more rate cuts, and possibly win support from other policymakers.But if those conditions don’t play out, then delivering on his promises will prove much more difficult, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins.Live Events“The last thing an economist needs is to be given an opportunity to put their theories to test,” Perkins said. “It will be his reputation on the line, a sort of winner’s curse.”Withering CriticismWhile Warsh is not viewed as being as close to Trump as Kevin Hassett, the White House insider he beat out for the Fed job, his views have fueled worries that he, too, might buckle to White House demands for much lower rates despite persistent price pressures.His previous withering public criticism of the Fed and praise for Trump came as the White House hammered policymakers for not cutting rates fast enough. An unprecedented Department of Justice investigation related to the overspend on renovations to the Fed’s headquarters has only stoked concerns that Trump is seeking to remold the US central bank.Analysts warn that pushing rates much lower during a time of persistent inflation and surging debt could rattle investor confidence, sending bond yields — and real borrowing rates — higher. “He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,” said Donald Kohn, who served as vice chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 financial crisis when he worked alongside Warsh, who was a governor at that time. Ultimately, a Fed chair will be driven to do what is right for the economy, and any rhetoric used to secure the job should be viewed through that political lens, according to Michael Faulkender, former deputy to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.“Irrespective of what someone says when they are a candidate for the position, a Fed chairman knows that his responsibility is to keep inflation low,” he said.Still, since Trump returned to office in January 2025, Warsh has called for lower rates and, according to the president, told Trump in December he favored more cuts. Productivity BullIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in November, Warsh detailed some of the approach he would take as Fed chair: “Fundamental reform of monetary and regulatory policy would unlock the benefits of AI to all Americans. The economy would be stronger. Living standards would be higher. Inflation would fall further.”Warsh expanded on that theme in a Dec. 4 podcast hosted by Aven Financial Inc., when he said, “This is the most productivity-enhancing wave of our lifetimes — past, present and future.”Those comments suggest a willingness by Warsh to assume that AI-driven productivity gains will insulate the economy from inflationary pressures and allow the Fed to cut rates even in the face of robust economic growth. Warsh’s Wall Street Journal article “veers too far into the world of praising the new world order that Donald Trump has created, meaning that the rules of monetary gravity no longer apply to the Fed when Trump is in the Oval Office,” Peter Conti-Brown, a professor and Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a Substack column.Aside from his bet on productivity, Warsh’s plan to reduce the Fed’s balance sheet as a vehicle to allow interest rates to come down has been greeted with skepticism.“It offers an easy way to sound hawkish and serious about inflation while providing cover to later advocate for the rate cuts this White House wants,” Stefan Koopman, a senior macro strategist at Rabobank, wrote in a note.In a Bloomberg survey conducted in early December, a majority of economists favored Fed governor Christopher Waller as the best choice on the administration’s shortlist. Warsh was favored by 13% of respondents.Long-Time HawkAppointed to the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2006 by President George W. Bush, Warsh was noted for advocating higher rates even in the depths of the financial crisis, warning often of impending inflation. He has long been critical of the Fed’s bond-buying programs and resigned from the Fed in 2011 soon after then-Chair Ben Bernanke embarked on a second round of purchases aimed at stimulating the overall economy. During the financial crisis, Warsh helped broker the sale of Wachovia Corp. to Wells Fargo & Co., and was the architect of a plan to supply the country’s nine biggest banks with billions of dollars of capital in the fall of 2008.Warsh will need to be confirmed by the US Senate. That process has been complicated by the DOJ probe into the Fed as a key Republican lawmaker has vowed not to approve any Fed nominees until that matter is resolved.Regardless of who has the top job at the Fed, their ability to dictate policy will be limited. Rate decisions can only be taken by a majority of the Federal Open Market Committee, where the chair has just one vote. Even Powell, who enjoys wide respect on the panel, in December faced a stiff challenge in seeking broad support for a third straight rate cut.If he struggles to lower rates, Warsh might reshape the central bank through other avenues. And in the wake of Fed missteps — its delayed response to the pandemic inflation surge and supervisory shortcomings exposed by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank — there’s no shortage of those calling for reform. They include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has repeatedly accused the Fed of having strayed from its primary mandate of setting monetary policy.“We get crisis — whether it’s financial crisis, economic crisis, global pandemic crisis — then we get the blame, and policymakers and politicians, they look and they blame the Fed,” said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University. “It suggests to me that even if it doesn’t succeed, attempts at reform are coming.”Reform CallsWhether reform is aimed at truly improving the institution, or serves as an excuse for gaining greater control over rates, is a separate question. Trump has said he wants a majority on the Fed’s Board of Governors that shares his view of the economy.That raises questions about what other changes the White House may seek. Bessent has suggested the Fed curtail the deployment of its balance sheet and most recently proposed changing who is eligible to lead the 12 regional reserve banks. Given the Trump administration’s history, other changes could include severe staff cuts.Should Bessent pursue a true shakeup, the Fed chair will play a pivotal role in that process, said Mark Spindel, who along with Binder co-authored the book The Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.“The chair has a lot of control over the board staffing and what research questions get asked and answered,” Spindel said. Additionally, “a majority of the board has a lot of control over the system. They could essentially engineer replacements to certain district bank presidents, should they wish.”Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onKevin WarshKevin Warsh newsKevin Warsh latest newsKevin Warsh fedwhite houseKevin Warsh latestFederal ReserveUS Federal Reservewall street journal\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onKevin WarshKevin Warsh newsKevin Warsh latest newsKevin Warsh fedwhite houseKevin Warsh latestFederal ReserveUS Federal Reservewall street journal \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"Kevin Warsh has been nominated by President Donald Trump as the next chair of the US Federal Reserve and faces an early test as he seeks to deliver on promises of major policy change.

In the background, another individual sits in a leopard-print chair, their feet propped on a table.\n\nAs with much of the content in the Epstein files, the timing and location of these images remain unknown, and no additional context is provided.\n\nThese images are part of over three million documents released by the US Department of Justice last night.\n\nThe documents also reveal that Andrew extended an invitation to Jeffrey Epstein for dinner at Buckingham Palace shortly after Epstein’s house arrest concluded.\n\nThe former prince promised ‘lots of privacy’ to the convicted paedophile shortly after he was granted his freedom following a conviction for soliciting a minor. \n\nIn the astonishing email, from September 2010, Epstein requested ‘private time’ while on a visit to London, to which Andrew replied: ‘We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.’\n\nIt is not clear if the offer was taken up. But just two days later, the pair were back in email contact, with Epstein asking the then-prince ‘g [Ghislaine Maxwell] is here with me…what are you doing?’\n\nAndrew replied to say he had a ‘lunch with a Saudi Prince and then out to secret intelligence firm’, before telling Epstein: ‘Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.’\n\nThe exchange came during what must have been one of Epstein’s first sojourns outside the US, having served a 13-month sentence for sex crimes mostly in his Palm Beach mansion following a sweetheart plea deal with prosecutors.\n\nThe previous month, Epstein had offered to set up a dinner for Andrew with a ‘clever, beautiful and trustworthy’ 26-year-old Russian woman, saying: ‘She has your email.’\n\nThe prince, who would have been 50 at the time, replied that he would be ‘delighted to see her’. And he cheerfully asked the convicted child sex predator, whose house arrest had finished just days earlier: ‘Good to be free?’\n\nAndrew faces a fresh round of humiliation after the largest-yet Epstein document dump, containing thousands of references to him. Lord Mandelson and Bill Gates were also dragged further into the Epstein mire. \n\nAccording to Epstein, the Microsoft founder caught a sexually transmitted disease from ‘Russian girls’ – then suggested secretly slipping his wife Melinda antibiotics.\n\nThere are also new emails relating to Sarah, formerly the Duchess of York, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie – including pictures of them from Andrew’s electronic Christmas cards. \n\nSeveral emails refer to the well-chronicled debts of Sarah – who took money from Epstein to help pay them off. One email sent in August 2009 shows her thanking him for being ‘the brother I have always wished for’.\n\nIn another email, Ms Ferguson calls Epstein ‘my dear spectacular and special friend’ and ‘a legend’.\n\nEpstein’s madam – and Andrew’s long-term friend – Maxwell is also heavily referenced in the documents. In one email to Andrew, she joked that ‘five stunning redheads’ would now have to ‘play with ourselves’ because the former duke had said he should spend time with his children instead of visiting ‘the Island’, thought to be Epstein’s private property in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nThe email exchange – in which Andrew calls himself ‘The Invisible Man’ – from August 2002 reveals the prince begging Maxwell’s forgiveness if he turns down her offer and holidays with his family instead.\n\nShe replies, ‘I will not be remotely offended’, but then jokes that a woman whose name was redacted ‘who is now coming and five other stunning redheads will all just have to play with ourselves’.\n\nElsewhere in the files, a 25-year-old masseuse said to have worked for Epstein in 1999 said she ‘didn’t feel good’ about being asked to massage Andrew – because she thought she was being asked ‘to do more’.\n\nThe unnamed woman submitted a statement to a private investigations team in 2021 that was sent to Maxwell’s defence team, the files show. She said: ‘I was only involved with Jeffrey for a year. \n\n‘I never saw him like a creepy guy. There were never any young girls. I saw Prince Andrew and Donald Trump. [Epstein] wanted me to give Prince Andrew a massage, but I didn’t feel good about that. I wonder if he was offering me to him to do more.’\n\nAndrew and President Trump have consistently denied any wrongdoing. But the former prince’s explanations in his car-crash Newsnight interview in November 2019 looked flakier than ever following the raft of new emails disclosed in the files.\n\nHe notoriously told Emily Maitlis he had gone to New York in 2010 to ‘end his friendship’ with the convicted paedophile because that was ‘the right thing to do’.\n\nBut one of the newly released emails shows Andrew telling Epstein: ‘See you tomorrow afternoon. Really looking forward to seeing you and spending some time with you after so long.’ In another email days before they met in New York, Andrew wrote to his friend, saying there were ‘some interesting things to discuss and plot’.\n\nFar from cutting ties with Epstein, the prince later wrote a ‘Happy Christmas’ email to ‘Dear J’, adding that it had been great to spend time ‘with my US family’, the documents reveal.\n\nBut there was some potentially welcome news for Andrew regarding American prosecutors’ requests to interview him as a witness to Epstein’s child sex crimes. \n\nAfter a prosecutor from the Southern District of New York complained of ‘zero cooperation’ from Andrew in 2020, a new email reveals an internal FBI memo stating: ‘He’s not a big part of our investigation.’\n\nElsewhere in the files, the former prince expressed ‘frustration’ at not being able to go on holiday because of the 2003 Iraq War, which cost the lives of 179 British personnel.\n\nLess than two weeks after British troops were sent in to topple Saddam Hussein, Andrew whined he would ‘love to be able to get away’. He wrote to Maxwell on March 31 that year: ‘With this war on, the media would go bananas if I was to be known to be out of the country whilst this was on. I am becoming frustrated at this slight caging!’\n\nReleasing the files, US deputy attorney-general Todd Blanche compared the amount of evidence reviewed to ‘two Eiffel Towers’ worth of material.

We have lost one of the comic giants of our age,\" Guest wrote in a statement.\n\nBut she is perhaps best known by modern audiences for her role in \"Schitt's Creek,\" created by Eugene Levy's son, Dan Levy.\n\n\"I used to mostly get people named Kevin who'd come up to me and ask me to yell 'Kevin!' in their faces,\" O'Hara told People, in reference to her famous line in \"Home Alone.\"\n\n\"Now it's mostly about (her character) Moira and 'Schitt's Creek.' I've never gotten this kind of attention in my life. It's crazy.\"\n\nThe role brought her an Emmy for best lead actress in 2020. She was also awarded a Golden Globe and a SAG Award.\n\nAs news of her death spread on Friday, fellow performers and other luminaries were quick to react.\n\n\"Mama. I thought we had time,\" Culkin wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture of the pair of them in \"Home Alone.\"\n\n\"I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you but I had so much more to say. I love you.\"\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said he and other Canadians were mourning O'Hara's death.\n\n\"Over 5 decades of work, Catherine earned her place in the canon of Canadian comedy,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Canada has lost a legend. My thoughts are with her family, friends, and all those who loved her work on screen.
