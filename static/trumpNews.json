This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,’ he told reporters in Green Bay with just six days until what could be one of the closest elections in history.\n\n‘For Joe Biden to make that statement — it’s really a disgrace,’ he added. \n\nThe former president pulled off the stunt less than 24 hours after Biden referred to his supporters as ‘garbage.’\n\nWisconsin notably is one of the seven battleground that could ultimately decide the election and polls show the state is essentially a coin-flip.\n\n‘The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,’ Biden was initially quoted as saying.\n\nThe White House later clarified his words with an apostrophe in the transcript, and claimed the president was only talking about comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’\n\nKamala Harris tried Wednesday to distance herself from her chief’s remarks \n\nThe side of the truck was emblazoned with a Trump sign and had an American flag on the window. \n\nAs the 78-year-old leaned out the side, wearing an orange reflective vest, he took questions from the press.\n\nOne asked if he owes Puerto Rico an apology over comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling it a ‘floating island of garbage’ during his Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.\n\n‘I love Puerto Rico. And Puerto Rico loves me. I don’t know anything about a comedian’, Trump said. \n\n‘Nobody has done more for Puerto Rico than me. Nobody gets along better with Puerto Rico. They love me and I love them.’ \n\nThe Republican nominee was in Wisconsin for a rally with NFL legend Brett Favre.\n\nThe retired Green Bay Packer quarterback told the crowd: ‘Just like the Packers organization, Donald Trump and his organization is a winner and the United States of America won with his leadership\n\n‘I can assure you we’re not garbage. How dare you say that. Looking out I see police officers, teachers, nurses, grandparents, students. I see everyday Americans that make this country great.’\n\nTrump then took the rally stage still wearing the orange vest as the crowd roared.\n\n‘I have to begin by saying, 250 million Americans are not garbage,’ he opened by saying. \n\n‘Kamala and Joe call all of us garbage. I call you the heart and soul of America. You built our country,’ Trump said to massive applause.\n\nHe recounted the offer he got to drive the garbage truck just minutes before landing in Wisconsin.\n\n‘Sir would you like to drive a garbage truck?’ one of his staffers petitioned. \n\nHe said he thought it sounded ‘kind of cool’ and was up for it before he was told, ‘Sir we have a vest.’ \n\nThen came the next challenge: Climbing the dauntingly high steps up into the garbage truck.\n\n‘How the hell do you get into the truck,’ Trump joked, noting how ‘it was way up high.’\n\nHe admitted thinking, ‘If I don’t get up there this is going to be very embarrassing.’ \n\nThe former president revealed that with all the cameras rolling he really ‘had the adrenaline going.’\n\nBut after the event he panicked: ‘Where is my jacket?’ \n\nHis concerns were quickly alleviated, he said. \n\n‘It actually makes you look thinner,’ Trump said while smiling, mentioning that he appreciated the flattery. \n\n‘They got me and I said now I want to wear it on stage,’ he told the cracking up crowd. \n\n‘I may never wear a blue jacket again,’ he continued on, stoking the crowd’s laughs.","summary":"Donald Trump trolled President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by riding a&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-mocks-kamala-harris-and-joe-biden-by-arriving-at-his-wisconsin-rally-on-a-garbage-truck/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1730336091_rewrite-this-title-Trump-trolls-Harris-and-Biden-by-riding-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:55:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":261737590,"title":"Predicting the Outcome of the Presidential Election by Billionaire Hedge Fund Guru Ken Griffin","text":"Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin has said that Donald Trump is likely to win next week’s election – but he said the margin will be razor-thin.\n\n‘The expectation today is that Donald Trump will win the White House,’ the Citadel founder said on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Griffin – whose $42 billion fortune makes him the 37th richest person in the world – noted the race is ‘almost a coin flip.’ \n\nA prominent Republican donor, Griffin has contributed around $100 million to the GOP during this election cycle, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGriffin is also notorious among retail investors for his involvement in the 2021 GameStop stock frenzy, where he was accused of helping hedge funds who faced big losses if the share price went too high. \n\nWhile Griffin said he expects Trump to secure a second term in the White House, he admitted that the race is very tight.\n\n‘We are at that moment of peak uncertainty,’ he said while speaking as part of a panel at Saudi Arabia‘s Future Investment Initiative summit.\n\n‘It is a race that Trump is favored to win but it is almost a coin toss.’\n\nHe added that the clarity brought by an election victory, for either candidate, will be good for markets. \n\n‘This uncertainty will be behind us,’ he added.\n\nWhile Griffin has donated millions to Republicans, he has notably not donated directly to Trump’s campaign.\n\nThe investor has especially focused his donations on candidates in primary races, particularly open primaries, according to Bloomberg. \n\nGriffin’s comments come after legendary investor Stan Druckenmiller said the stock market is ‘convinced’ that Trump will win the election. \n\n‘I would have to guess Trump is the favorite to win the election,’ the billionaire said in an interview earlier this month. \n\nHe said there are clues in bank stocks and in cryptocurrency that markets are pricing in a Trump victory – amid reports that major hedge funds are positioning themselves to profit if Trump wins a second term.\n\nDruckenmiller made the comments during an interview on October 16 with Sonali Basak.\n\nShe asked what the ‘Druckenmiller playbook’ is around this election cycle and what he thinks the mostly likely scenario is for what will happen next month. \n\n‘It’s an evolving situation, and if you had asked me this 12 days ago, I would have said, “I don’t have a clue, it’s still a total toss-up, and I don’t have any conviction who is going to win the election,”‘ the 71-year-old billionaire said.\n\nBut he said he likes to look to the stock market for indicators as to the future of the economy – and as a clue during elections. \n\n‘I remember how right the market was on Ronald Reagan in 1980, despite what the pundits were saying,’ he said.\n\n‘And I must say in the last 12 days, the market and the inside of the market is very convinced Trump is going to win.\n\n‘You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto, you can even see it in DJT, his social media company.’\n\nDruckenmiller, who has a net worth of around $6.9 billion, made his name managing money for George Soros for more than a decade. He also funded Nikki Haley’s primary campaign against Trump. \n\nDuring the interview, he added that he would not endorse either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris in this election cycle – and would likely not vote for either. \n\nMeanwhile Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase – the largest bank in the US – has reportedly privately endorsed Harris, despite keeping quiet publicly. \n\nThe chief executive has reportedly not made his stance known publicly because he is afraid that Trump will retaliate against people and companies who opposed his run if he is elected. \n\nIt comes as big fund managers have sensed a shift in momentum away from Harris, and are buying stocks that would benefit from a Republican victory, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFor example, GEO Group, a private-prison operator, has jumped 21 percent this October, on track for its best month since 2022, while bitcoin miner Riot Platforms has surged 34 percent.\n\nThat is despite the polls still largely indicating that the candidates are neck and neck. \n\nTrump has the lead in prediction markets, where people place bets on the outcome of the election, Fortune reported. \n\nYet, polls for the New York Times/Siena College and Reuters/Ipsos show Harris with a one percentage point lead over Trump as of Wednesday.","summary":"Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin has said that Donald Trump is likely&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/predicting-the-outcome-of-the-presidential-election-by-billionaire-hedge-fund-guru-ken-griffin/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/30/16/91465813-14020343-Billionaire_hedge_fund_manager_Ken_Griffin_has_said_that_former_-a-2_1730304749762.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:47:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":261737244,"title":"Trump Seizes Unity Mantle from Harris After Biden's 'Garbage' Comment","text":"Former President Donald Trump got a rare gift on Wednesday: for once, he had the opportunity to paint himself as a unifier and his opponent as a divider.That was thanks to U.S. President Joe Biden, who appeared to refer to Trump's supporters as \"garbage\" during a Zoom call with Latino voters on Tuesday.The White House released a statement afterward clarifying Biden's remarks, saying he was referring to the \"hateful rhetoric\" at Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden over the weekend.

(AP) — Donald Trump walked down the steps of the Boeing 757 that bears his name, walked across a rain-soaked tarmac and, after twice missing the handle, climbed into the passenger seat of a white garbage truck that also carried his name.\n\nThe former president, once a reality TV star known for his showmanship, wanted to draw attention to a remark made a day earlier by his successor, Democratic President Joe Biden, that suggested Trump’s supporters were garbage. Trump has used the remark as a cudgel against his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\n“How do you like my garbage truck?” Trump said, wearing an orange and yellow safety vest over his white dress shirt and red tie. “This is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden.”\n\nTrump and other Republicans were facing pushback of their own for comments by a comedian at a weekend Trump rally who disparaged Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Trump then seized on a comment Biden made on a late Wednesday call that “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”\n\nThe president tried to clarify the comment afterward, saying he had intended to say Trump’s demonization of Latinos was unconscionable. But it was too late.\n\nOn Thursday, after arriving in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for an evening rally, Trump climbed into the garbage truck, carrying on a brief discussion with reporters while looking out the window — similar to what he did earlier this month during a photo opportunity he staged at a Pennsylvania McDonalds. \n\nHe again tried to distance himself from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, whose joke had set off the firestorm, but Trump did not denounce it. He also said he did not need to apologize to Puerto Ricans.\n\n“I don’t know anything about the comedian,” Trump said. “I don’t know who he is. I’ve never seen him. I heard he made a statement, but it was a statement that he made. He’s a comedian, what can I tell you. I know nothing about him.”\n\nA spokesperson for Trump said the joke doesn’t reflect his views, but the former president has not addressed it himself. \n\n“I love Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico loves me,” Trump said from the garbage truck. \n\nHe ended the brief appearance by telling reporters: “I hope you enjoyed this garbage truck. Thank you very much.”\n\nWhen he took the stage a short time later, he was still wearing the orange vest.","summary":"Donald Trump boards a garbage truck to draw attention to Biden remark  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-garbage-truck-wisconsin-1b9b2882b59639ba0dc898b0b45e395b","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/74f5762/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+312/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb0%2F26%2F1cefda397b7d8f6d3210aa0ecf2a%2Fa8ad043ec8f7447d9c8c12a8cfe93c50","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:41:00","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon,Jonathan J.

I’ve had it with this s–t.” \n\nSo has pretty much everyone else. \n\nNo one incarnates this willed stagnation better than Harris fave and current Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. \n\nKhan’s fought from the start to hamstring people like Elon Musk — visionaries actually pushing American tech and industry ahead into the future. \n\nThe tech titan bought Twitter in 2022; the FTC then began a campaign of blatantly targeted regulatory harassment against the Tesla founder. \n\nOf course, this was political in nature: Khan simply dislikes Musk’s views and wanted to use her power to punish him for them. \n\nBut it’s part of a pattern with her of taking big swings against big companies for the sin of their success (though, thank God, she usually whiffs them). \n\nShe went after Meta for buying VR company Within, and failed. \n\nShe did the same when Microsoft bought gaming major Activision Blizzard. \n\nBut the insidious power of the regulatory state is such that Khan doesn’t even need to win in court: She and her biz-hating cronies reportedly celebrate the dozen-plus deals preemptively abandoned by big firms scared of the federal onslaught as “victories.”\n\nWrong, wrong, wrong. \n\nThose are failures. \n\nThe blob doesn’t know how to innovate. \n\nThe blob doesn’t know how to engineer. \n\nCan you imagine where we’d be today if the FTC and FCC and the whole rest of the alphabet soup had strangled, say, Intel or Apple or any Nvidia in the cradle?\n\nThe more than 2,000 federal agencies include the likes of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, the Stakeholder Engagement Division at Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Defense Department Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\nThe federal workforce grew from 2.07 million in 2015 to 2.18 million in 2022, a 5.3% jump, and that doesn’t include the military, intel agencies or the ever-growing ranks of “Beltway bandit” private contractors.\n\nWorse, these faceless, gray-souled tinpot tyrants don’t restrict themselves to stupid interventions in industry. \n\nThe same cadres come up with and enforce the nonsensical DEI mandates that have spread like a virus through the federal government itself and almost as widely in the private sector (though happily there has been real pushback there, with John Deere and other big names backing off). \n\nThe Biden-Harris administration implemented a whole of government DEI push early in office; it has embraced again and again the most extreme rules around gender identity and race, and has done everything it could to make sure that big name companies got the idea as well. \n\nAnd that’s to say nothing of its effort to stifle and strangle free speech. \n\nThose range from trying to set up a literal Ministry of Truth — the abortive Disinformation Governance Board — to leaning hard on social-media platforms in efforts to suppress viewpoints they disapprove of. \n\nOr the Biden-Harris war on US energy production, a major crusade for this administration since Day 1. \n\nCan you imagine a starker contrast to Trump?\n\nThe man is a serial entrepreneur: He understands that the economic dynamism of America is a key — perhaps the key — element of its global pre-eminence. \n\nLook at his embrace of Musk, making the tech titan one of his most prominent surrogates. \n\nAnd look, too, at his first term: an economy untrammeled by progressive dementia around pronouns and equity and green nonsense, combining fantastic growth with historically low inflation. \n\n(And to ex-Prez Barack Obama, who tried to take credit for it, we can only say: You didn’t build that.) \n\nTrump knows enough to stand aside and let Musk, Palmer Luckey and other visionaries charge ahead. \n\nHe unleashed the power of our domestic energy industry as well, instead of doing his best to kill it. \n\nAs the man himself put it during his massive Madison Square Garden rally, “I’m asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. I’m asking you to dream big again . . . . This will be America’s new golden age.” \n\nIf you love your country and the future, the choice is clear: Vote Trump in 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump wants to let Americans dynamism off the leash; Kamala Harris wants to smother it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/30/opinion/the-2024-choice-on-regulation-trump-wants-america-unleashed-harris-wants-it-strangled/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/JTEGEHRW.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:38:53","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":261737066,"title":"Donald Trump pokes fun at President Biden by driving a MAGA garbage truck","text":"Donald Trump is trolling President Biden for calling MAGA folks “garbage” … by riding around in a swing state in a custom garbage truck.\n\nTrump pulled up on the media in a MAGA garbage truck Wednesday in Wisconsin … saying the truck was in honor of Kamala Harris and Biden.\n\nThe garbage truck was waiting for Trump to land at an airport in Green Bay … and he got in the passenger seat and answered questions about Biden and Puerto Rico.\n\nBiden called Trump supporters “garbage” Tuesday in response to a comedian at a Trump rally in New York joking that Puerto Rico was a floating pile of garbage.\n\nTrump is distancing himself from Tony Hinchcliffe … claiming he knows nothing about the comedian or his Puerto Rico joke.\n\nRiding shotgun in the garbage truck, Trump claimed no one has done more for Puerto Rico than he has … and he kept saying he loves Puerto Rico and its people.\n\nTrump donned a bright orange vest in the garbage truck … and he’s wearing it at his rally in Green Bay.","summary":"Donald Trump is trolling President Biden for calling MAGA folks &#8220;garbage&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/donald-trump-pokes-fun-at-president-biden-by-driving-a-maga-garbage-truck/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-Trolls-President-Biden-With-MAGA-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:37:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":261737480,"title":"US Elections: President Biden’s ‘garbage’ gaffe gives Donald Trump political boost","text":"US President Joe Biden has inadvertently thrust him back into the political spotlight just a week before the US Presidential Elections following his comment during a virtual event defending Puerto Ricans, CNN reported on Wednesday.His remarks, made in response to a comedian’s derogatory comment about Puerto Rico at a Donald Trump rally, have opened a door for Trump to shift focus away from his own controversial campaign tactics.Biden criticised the comedian’s description of Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” asserting that the people of Puerto Rico are “good, decent, and honourable.” However, his defence sparked a political uproar, detracting from Vice President Kamala Harris’s key closing speech on Tuesday evening, CNN reported.“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something… I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m–in my home state of Delaware–they’re good, decent, honourable people,” Biden said during his virtual remarks in a get-out-the-vote call meant to help Harris.“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, adding, “His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”The White House quickly attempted to clarify Biden’s remarks, stating he was referring to the “hateful rhetoric” at the Trump rally rather than the former president’s supporters. Biden himself took to social media to explain that his use of “garbage” referred to the comments made about Puerto Rico, not to Trump’s supporters, as reported by CNN.“Earlier today, I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage–which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote on X.Biden’s remarks drew immediate parallels to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” comment in 2016, which became a rallying cry for Trump and his supporters. In the aftermath, Harris felt compelled to address the controversy on Wednesday, emphasising her belief in representing all voters, regardless of their political affiliations, CNN reported.“Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the Democratic nominee said. “You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,” Harris said.“I am sincere in what I mean: when elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,” she added.However, Trump wasted no time seizing upon Biden’s comments. At a rally, he referenced Biden’s words, suggesting they were worse than Clinton’s, and positioned his campaign as one that welcomes diverse support from various demographic groups. The Trump campaign quickly framed Biden’s remarks as indicative of a broader disdain for his supporters, as reported by CNN.“Wow. That’s terrible. That’s what it says. That’s what it says. So, you have, remember Hillary, she said ‘deplorable’ and then she said ‘irredeemable,’ right? But she said deplorable; that didn’t work out. ‘Garbage’ I think is worse, right?” Trump said.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/us-elections-president-bidens-garbage-gaffe-gives-donald-trump-political-boost/","image":"https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:33:29","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":261737562,"title":"This shouldn’t be a dead-even race — and it doesn’t have to be","text":"With less than a week to go, let’s talk about expectations, specifically the widespread expectation that this shouldn’t be a dead-even race.\n\nThe idea usually comes from liberals and Democrats, who tend to believe that Donald Trump is such a uniquely dangerous threat to democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law that it boggles their minds to see him running neck-and-neck with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe foremost problem is that liberals and Democrats presume too much. They presume that all Americans, by dint of being American, believe in democracy. They think that if Trump and the Republicans would stop “playing politics,” they’d snap out of their rightwing fever. \n\nThey won’t, however, because they are not “playing politics.” This is their politics. They look at other human beings, but do not see other human beings. They see something less than human, animals perhaps, or vermin, that deserve not respect as much as annihilation. Cheating is acceptable. Violence is, too. Anything’s permissible when you are convinced that your enemy’s victory threatens your very existence. \n\nThis is not to say that they do not believe in democracy. They do, but it’s an exclusive kind, one just for them – a democracy for white people. This is not to say that they don’t believe in equality. They do, but it’s an exclusive kind – an equality between men. Women have their place in society, but it’s always subordinate to a man’s place.\n\nWhere liberals and Democrats make a mistake is in presuming that universal democracy is the rule of American politics and that “playing politics” is the radical departure from it. It isn’t a departure, because universal democracy isn’t the rule. It’s one kind of politics, the good kind, that is necessary in the fight against the bad kind of politics.\n\nThe bad kind of politics didn’t begin with Donald Trump. It won’t end with him either, not even if Kamala Harris defeats him. Millions of people in this country are going to vote for him, because they want what they believe he represents, and that’s not a shame in the way some liberals and Democrats say. It is, rather, just the way things are.\n\nWhat Trump has done is bring out into the open the bad politics that had previously been hidden under the surface of the Republican Party. As long as it lay hidden, where Republicans could plausibly deny its existence, the good kind of politics could be deprived of a good fight. \n\nBut now that the bad kind of politics is out in the open, and now that it’s on brink of destabilizing nearly 250 years of democratic progress in America, the good kind of politics has a chance to settle the score, and establish a new national consensus in which universal democracy is, if not the rule, then the political norm against which the bad kind of politics will face a serious numerical disadvantage over decades. \n\nMore than 20,000 people showed up for Donald Trump’s fascist rally at Madison Square Garden, the site of the last major fascist rally in 1939. But more than 75,000 people showed up for Kamala Harris’ rally last night at the Ellipse in Washington, the starting point of Trump’s attempted paramilitary takeover of the US government in 2021. \n\nIt’s a pattern in our history. Whenever the fascists come out of the shadows, anti-fascists stand ready to face them. Heather Cox Richardson wrote that, “in 1939, as about 18,000 American Nazis rallied inside Madison Square Garden, newspapers reported that a crowd of about 100,000 anti-Nazis gathered outside to protest. It took 1,700 police officers, the largest number of officers ever before detailed for a single event, to hold them back from storming the venue.”\n\nTrump wanted a show of force with a rally in the media capital of the world, said Jonathan V Last. But then Harris turned out nearly four times as many. “This is the kind of power Trump understands,” Last said. “And I suspect that when he saw her crowd, he lost his shit.”\n\nI don’t want to make too much of crowd sizes, but the difference between 20,000 people and 75,000 people is probably similar to the difference between the public’s perception of the election and the reality of it, which is to say: It’s probably not as close as it seems. \n\nIt looks close, because national polling averages make it seem so, and they make it seem so, because rightwing pollsters game the polling averages by manufacturing numbers favorable to rightwing politics.\n\nThe election looks close, moreover, because the Washington press corps habitually plays along with rightwing politics, thus giving the impression that Harris is doing worse than she actually is. (Consider the dust-up over Joe Biden’s “garbage” comment. He didn’t say what he’s said to have said, but Harris is being forced to deny it anyway.)\n\nAnd the election looks close because the waves of disinformation and lies that have been coming from the Kremlin are amplified by Trump, the Republicans, the rightwing media apparatus and the world’s richest man, who has himself reportedly met with Vladimir Putin. \n\nIf the race is indeed close, liberals and Democrats would benefit from reassessing their assumptions and realizing that they may be taking for granted past victories over the question of whether democracy should remain the exclusive kind or be expanded to be universal. To say the race shouldn’t be this close may sound savvy and sophisticated, but what it actually does is overlook the necessity of political combat. \n\nNo one in power ever gave freedom. \n\nFreedom has always been taken from those in power.\n\nIt’s a pattern in our history.\n\n“Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant,” Harris said on the Ellipse Tuesday night. \n\n“Across the generations,” she said, “Americans have preserved that freedom, expanded it, and in so doing, proved to the world that a government of, by and for the people is strong and can endure.” \n\nShe added: “The patriots at Normandy and Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall, on farmlands and factory floors … did not struggle, sacrifice, and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms … only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant.”\n\nNo, they didn’t. \n\nI think we will rise to the occasion again.","summary":"With less than a week to go, let’s talk about expectations, specifically the widespread expectation that this shouldn’t be a dead-even race.\n\n\nThe idea usually comes from liberals and Democrats, who tend to believe that Donald Trump is such a uniquely dangerous threat to democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law that it boggles their minds to see him running neck-and-neck with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe foremost problem is that liberals and Democrats presume too much.

City staff say the incident is indicative of a lack of civility that’s grown all too common at community events.\n\nOn Oct. 24, residents, city staff and Berkeley Councilmember Rashi Kesarwani gathered at the Berkeley Adult School for a community meeting on missing middle housing.\n\nThe event was going as planned when about 30 minutes in participants started to demand a chance to speak. Soon after, a man approached Kesarwani, who was trying to calm the crowd, and attempted to snatch a microphone from her hands, said Rubén Hernández Story, Councilmember Terry Taplin’s chief of staff who was at the event in place of his boss.\n\nIn an audio recording of the incident, Kesarwani can be heard shouting at the man to “step away from me.” It was at that point that a man from the audience intervened and Kesarwani left the event, Story said, sharing doubts someone would have grabbed her if she were a man.\n\nKesarwani has since filed a police report and the incident is under investigation, the Berkeley Police Department confirmed.\n\n“There can be zero tolerance for becoming physically aggressive with anyone at a public meeting, especially a public servant simply trying to do their job,” Kesarwani said in a statement last week. “I’m also deeply saddened that a small group of residents proceeded to disrupt the meeting with screaming, shouting, and chants.”\n\nProtest is woven into the fabric of Berkeley, Story acknowledged. But the aggression toward staff and councilmembers appears to be worsening, he said.\n\nDuring any given council meeting, the room becomes filled with chants, disruptions and insults lobbed at officials on a variety of topics. Residents are passionate about whether the city weighs in on the conflict in the Middle East, the types of policies adopted to address homelessness and public safety, and, as last week’s event showed, housing.\n\nDuring council meetings, in which police are present, Story noted that barriers exist between the dais and public speakers’ podium.\n\n“We have seen this on the national level, the local level, this growing trend of members of the public who treat elected officials and city staff very terribly,” Story said. “People want to solely blame the rise of (Donald) Trump and the Tea Party, but in the liberal Bay Area that excuse comes out as paper thin.”\n\nA report by the National League of Cities asserts that threats to city officials have grown in recent years. Citing Princeton University’s Threats and Harassment Dataset, the League notes 240 threats to officials have been reported through June of 2024, a 15% increase from the first half of 2023 and 60% greater than those reported in the first half of 2022.\n\nThe treatment has cost Berkeley at least one councilmember so far. Rigel Robinson, the youngest person to be elected to the Berkeley City Council in 2018, abruptly resigned this January because of escalating harassment, exhaustion and a need to focus on his family.\n\nFormer Councilmember Lori Droste said Kesarwani is the last person deserving of abusive treatment. As both a friend and legal aid to the councilmember, Droste said she feels “fiercely protective” of Kesarwani and lauded her as a hard worker dedicated to engaging with residents and unafraid to take stances she believes are right in the face of dissent.\n\nDebate and dialogue is expected in policy making, but physical intimidation and assault are not, Droste said.\n\n“You have to ask yourself why would someone want to do this if they get that kind of abuse,” Droste said. “I just think that it’s important that if people are going to be physical, that there needs to be consequences.”\n\nWhile individuals may face legal consequences, Story said the greater community is also punished by what he described as toxic behavior from a small group of people who don’t represent the views of the entire community.\n\nBoth Droste and Story said the disruptions bog down city processes. Droste noted the city has been discussing missing middle housing since she proposed the issue be studied in 2019.\n\nThe council was about to finally put an end to the discussion this summer, but ultimately postponed allowing construction of duplexes, triplexes, townhomes and other “gentle density” projects in all residential neighborhoods after hours of public comment and council discussion to allow staff to consult local tribal leaders about the change.\n\nAnd while a number of factors contribute to what Story described as a “staff crisis at city hall,” including poor pay, unmanageable workloads and a lack of support from supervisors, according to a 2023 Auditors report, being shouted at by community members doesn’t help, Story said.\n\nIn addition to staff leaving the city, Story said the chaos discourages residents from attending meetings and sharing their opinions on important city issues, preventing staff from capturing a full picture of community wants and needs.\n\n“The more you make it not a safe space where people can go talk to local electeds, the more you’re hampering the process,” Story said. “We’re all people who care about Berkeley and we all have opinions on how to get things done. I just wish people could really see people are taking time to serve on City Council and they don’t deserve this level of ire.”","summary":"Protest is woven into the fabric of Berkeley but the aggression toward staff and councilmembers appears to be worsening, city staffers say.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/30/recent-row-at-a-berkeley-community-meeting-underscores-growing-incivility/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SJM-L-RKESARWANI-XXXX-2.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:29:33","author":"Sierra Lopez","authors":["Sierra Lopez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":261736530,"title":"Trump MSG rallygoers sound off about Biden’s ‘garbage’ diss: ‘We’ll take out the trash Nov. 5’","text":"Former President Donald Trump’s supporters who attended Sunday’s Madison Square Garden rally think President Biden’s dismissive comments branding Trump voters “garbage” are just trashy — and they say the remark has given them a jolt of enthusiasm before Election Day. \n\nDemocrats went into full-blown damage control mode by Tuesday night, with White House spokesman Andrew Bates attempting to redirect the target of Biden’s insult to the rally itself.\n\n“The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden Rally as ‘garbage,'” Bates claimed in a hastily fired-off statement amid a deluge of criticism.\n\nRoast comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe made a controversial joke at the jam-packed campaign event in which he called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage,” prompting a meltdown among left-leaning outlets who blasted the gathering as racist, even comparing it to a Nazi rally.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters The Post spoke to are taking President Biden’s barb in stride, and saving their outrage for the ballot box.\n\nRemy Baron, 45, Queens\n\nRemy Barron, who was at the MSG rally to see “the big boss” Trump, said Biden’s remarks were “the same old rhetoric from the Democrats,” but was steadfast in his commitment to supporting the former president’s reelection bid.\n\n“We don’t care about all the garbage the Democrats say about President Trump.

Recent surveys suggest Harris has a slim lead over Trump, but many polls there and in other swing states are within the margin of error. Harris leads Trump by 0.7 percentage points in Wisconsin in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted polling average.\n\nTrump’s appearance at the rally in an apparent attempt to pay homage to sanitation workers came 10 days after he made a widely publicized appearance at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, preparing french fry orders and handing out meals to supporters at the drive-thru window.

He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community.”\n\n“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something. I don’t — I — I don’t know the Puerto Rican that — that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m fr- — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”\n\nPolitico White House bureau chief and MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire publishes an item reading: “Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.”\n\nNBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez tweets: “Pres. Biden tonight: ‘Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community…just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage?…The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.'”\n\nGutierrez tweets: “A White House spokesman says Pres. Biden was referring to the comedian who supported Trump and insulted Puerto Rico.”\n\nLemire tweets: “President Biden tonight, on Zoom with Latinos, denounced attacks on Puerto Rico [.]. In somewhat rambling remarks, Biden said the ‘only garbage’ he saw was intolerance of Trump supporters who believed that[.] A WH spox said POTUS was talking about hatred of comedian who made the joke[.]”\n\nLemire tweets: “The full Biden quote from the Zoom tonight, which is being taken out of context.” Accompanying the text is a screenshot of a transcript which has Biden saying: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” The apostrophe suggests Biden was referring specifically to insult comic Tony Hinchcliffe.\n\nWhite House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates tweets out the same quote with the same “supporter’s” formulation.\n\nGutierrez tweets: “White House provides this transcript.” It includes the following quote: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters’ — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” Unlike the snippet posted by Lemire, the apostrophe is after the last “s” in “supporters,” again suggesting Biden started to talk about Trump fans before backtracking to criticize the former president.\n\nGutierrez tweets out video of Biden’s comment, showing that Biden paused after “supporters” as if ending a sentence before starting a new one about Trump.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is asked about the video during an appearance on CNN. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania, or any Americans, even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”\n\n@JoeBiden posts on X: “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”\n\nAround 10 p.m.\n\nWhite House press office makes public “official” transcript of Biden’s comments: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”\n\nThe Black List founder and CEO Franklin Leonard calls Biden’s comment a “nothingburger” during a CNN panel appearance, adding: “As someone who had a stutter growing up, it’s very obvious to me that there’s an apostrophe at the end of supporters there.

That number is pacing ahead of the cumulative 2020 election vote total of 155 million votes. It’s clear the American people are passionate about having their vote count toward their candidate of choice—at least once every four years.\n\nWhen it comes to the highest seat in the land, America’s presidential election is designed unlike any other election in our Union. In this case, a specific voting method is used to determine the victor: the Electoral College. Instead of using the popular vote to determine the election’s winner, a group of electors have the last word.\n\nIt’s ironic that this method is used to select the president, especially considering that the United States constantly praises the power of meritocracy, lauds “one person one vote” and clings to an unwavering belief in democracy. Under this system, the cream of the crop always rises to the top. But is that, in fact, true?\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 27: Dr. Phil speaks at a campaign rally for Republican presidential ... [+] nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden on October 27, 2024 in New York City. Trump closed out his weekend of campaigning in New York City with a guest list of speakers that includes his running mate Republican Vice Presidential nominee, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Tesla CEO Elon Musk, UFC CEO Dana White, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, among others, nine days before Election Day.

In the video, he said, “This country was built on hard work, added value and talent, not on equal outcome, not on DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion]. This country was built on hard work.” The crowd cheered loudly at his remarks.\n\nGiven the tone, I believe his comment was meant to lean into a narrative that hard work—not race, gender and/or sexual orientation—are the leading drivers of success. This notion implies that this is how America was built: through meritocracy and dedicated labor—not on government polices intended to create concessions to lower standards and give those who are undeserving equal outcomes.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nTrump Vs.

Looking back at the history of the United States, many programs, polices and laws were structured to reward individuals based on identity rather than hard work. Or as the NAACP put it, “This country was absolutely built on hard work Dr. Phil…on the backs of Black, Brown, and immigrants from all across this WORLD! Many of which who were forced to do so! SLAVERY. Let us know when you’re ready to tell the WHOLE story.”\n\nLet’s look at how DEI shaped our system of voting, and how the Electoral College was designed, as well as how its creation is very similar—or even identical, I’d say—to DEI today’s DEI programs.\n\n383436 02: Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, center, carries a ballot box ...

(Pool Photo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe system of electors was designed and implemented as a way to level the playing field for a group of Americans who could never win or have access to power without it. Sounds quite similar to DEI today, doesn’t it? Except those who benefited from the electors were Southern white men.\n\nThe majority voice of the delegates from the slaveholding Southern states opposed the popular vote, because it would put them at a disadvantage. The populations in the North and South were almost equal, but one-third of those living in the South were enslaved. They weren’t even recognized as being human, simply due to their race, so they certainly weren’t allowed to vote.\n\nThis disparity would cost the South power, and they realized their voices and clout could never be leveraged in a democracy they were actively responsible for creating. Therefore, they lobbied for a new system. A more controlled, indirect method of electing the president. One that provided a compromise between two separate systems: 1) the election of the president by a vote in Congress and 2) the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\n\nThe result? The Electoral College.\n\nOnce the system was agreed upon, the Founding Fathers had to figure out how to ensure their privilege and power wouldn’t be available to any Black Americans. In 1787, the Three-Fifths Compromise was proposed at the Constitutional Convention, to count enslaved people in the South as three-fifths of a white person for purposes of taxation and representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College.\n\nBlacks lost (among many, many other things) two-fifths of themselves, their power, their identity, their dignity, their voice, their presence, and their opportunity to live the American Dream, and it was written in the Constitution.\n\nOur Founding Fathers agreed this was the best way forward. At the time, future President James Madison went on the record as to why direct popular vote elections for the highest office wouldn’t work:\n\n“There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.”\n\nCould it be that the Electoral College is the oldest and most influential equity program in our country?\n\nSince such an equity program from the past would fall under DEI efforts today, let me suggest that the Electoral College is a DEI program intended to enforce control, rather than concede it.\n\nWe’re currently debating DEI, the idea of proactively providing a group of historically underserved Americans in corporate America and at colleges and universities the opportunity, not the guarantee, of an equal playing field. Yet the Electoral College seems to do just that.\n\nMarch 1867, Harper's Weekly political cartoon by American cartoonist Thomas Nast, depicting an ... [+] African-American man casting his ballot into a ballot box during the Georgetown election as Andrew Jackson and others look on angrily (Photo by Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nSince the Electoral College process is part of the original design of the U.S. Constitution, a Constitutional amendment would need to be passed to change it. Over the years, 700-plus actions have been filed to change or amend the Electoral College, to shift to the modernized system of “one person one vote” toward the popular vote count. Of any element in the Constitution, this feature is the most challenged. But nothing has been passed by Congress and sent to the States to be ratified as a Constitutional amendment.\n\nFew media outlets on either side of the political spectrum take the time to explain the extent to which race and slavery contributed to the creation of the Electoral College. These origins are simply ignored.\n\nToday in corporate America, meritocracy is, in many ways, equivalent to the concept of the popular vote. And in many ways, the design and development of the Electoral College operates similar to the way today’s DEI programs are designed to function.\n\nIn order to create a fair system in an environment that is historically unfair, concessions need to be designed to ensure fair outcomes. Sport leagues accomplish this goal with revenue share. The NFL, NBA and others ensure fairness by helping the teams that need assistance, to enhance the league’s overall quality. Similarly, the worst team at the end of the season is first in line for the number one draft pick in the next year’s draft. Or after a team scores a touchdown or a basket, the other team gets the ball back.\n\nIt’s called competitive balance, and it seems to be okay in some situations and cases—but not when it comes to DEI programs.\n\nRight from the start, the South’s baked-in advantage—the bonus electoral votes it received for owning slaves, while not allowing those enslaved to vote—made a difference in election outcomes. Slaveholder Thomas Jefferson edged out his opponent, incumbent president and abolitionist John Adams. Southern slaveholders and their allies won the White House until Abraham Lincoln’s 1860 victory. Soon after Lincoln’s death, the Reconstruction Era, the redemption of the old South and the birth of the Jim Crow regime grew from winners of the Electoral College—not from the popular vote.\n\nMore than two centuries later, the Electoral College continues to adversely impact Black voters. Five of the six states whose populations are 25 percent or more Black have been reliably red in recent presidential elections. Three of those states have not voted for a Democrat in over four decades. California has the most overall registered Republican count of any state with 22+ million, but you wouldn't know it on Presidential Election Day. Under the Electoral College, votes are simply and quietly submerged. Not to mention that in 2016, Hillary Clinton had what was, at the time, the highest ever popular vote total—yet still lost.\n\nMany of the same people complaining about the unfairness of current DEI programs don’t seem to recognize that they’re where they are today because their ancestors were beneficiaries of a DEI program.\n\nIn 2025, I’d like to propose a new compromise to whomever is President: Either allow DEI in corporate environments to accomplish what it set out to do—level the playing field for those who have been at an historic disadvantage—or get rid of America’s largest and oldest DEI program, the Electoral College.\n\nWhat’s fair for some should be fair for all.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn. \n\nDoug Melville\n\nEditorial Standards\n\nForbes Accolades","summary":"This week, a Dr. Phil clip went viral stating America was built on hard work not DEI.

The ongoing visa controversy, which stems from Harry's candid drug use admissions in his memoir Spare, has sparked intense debate about his future in the United States.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, however, has offered a compelling perspective on why Harry's position might be secure: \"It is most unlikely that Trump would risk an embarrassing episode involving the royal family by expelling Harry if it was discovered that he had not revealed his drug taking on his Visa application.\" This assessment suggests that diplomatic considerations might outweigh any personal animosity between the former president and the duke, as per Express UK.\n\nFor those who may not know, the controversy began when Harry, 40, detailed his experiences with cocaine, marijuana, and psychedelic mushrooms in his memoir. This prompted the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, to file a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, demanding access to Harry's immigration records.\n\nIts primary argument centers on whether the duke received preferential treatment during his visa application process, as drug use typically poses significant obstacles for visa applicants. Trump himself has weighed in on the matter during an interview with GB News, stating, \"We'll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they'll have to take appropriate action.\" However, when pressed about whether this could mean deportation, Trump remained notably noncommittal, responding with, \"Oh I don't know. You'll have to tell me.\"\n\nImmigration experts provide additional context as to why Harry's position might be secure. Virginia-based immigration attorney Eileen Blessinger explained that officials must consider the broader implications when making decisions about high-profile cases. \"There could be an economic impact in the US, and also a cultural impact,\" she noted. \"That's all going to weigh heavily in favor of getting someone a waiver.\"\n\nThe Sussexes have (seemingly and strategically) maintained a low profile during the election season, with Fitzwilliams noting that while they have encouraged Americans to vote, they've avoided explicitly endorsing any candidate. This diplomatic approach might help minimize any potential political targeting. Moreover, the duke and duchess appear to have established contingency plans, reportedly purchasing a holiday home in Portugal. However, sources suggest this is more likely a vacation property rather than an emergency exit strategy.\n\nImmigration lawyer Stacy Cozart Martin highlighted that a 'lot of immigration is discretionary,' and high-profile individuals often receive different considerations than average applicants. Amid all this, as the election approaches, the Heritage Foundation continues its pursuit of Harry's visa records, having recently filed a 13-page motion to reopen the case. However, the foundation's efforts may prove futile, as legal experts emphasize the unprecedented nature of publicly releasing immigration records.","summary":"Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams offers a compelling perspective on why Harry&#39;s position might be secure saying, &#34;It is most unlikely that Trump would...&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/the-unexpected-reason-prince-harry-could-secure-his-stay-in-the-us-if-donald-trump-wins-election","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/722071/uploads/c71447c0-951d-11ef-8dce-5d247b128bb6_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:15:00","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.056},{"id":261736450,"title":"Experts sound alarm over Trump's promise to let RFK Jr. 'control' health agencies","text":"Public health experts reacted with alarm Wednesday to reports that former President Donald Trump promised anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F.

As President Xi Jinping decides on the size of China’s stimulus package, he has to consider the possibility that Donald Trump, who started a trade war in 2018, may soon be in the White House for a second term.\n\nAfter Xi’s policy pivot in late September to meet his economic growth target of 5%, investors are looking at the gathering of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, usually held in late October. Concrete details have so far been largely lacking, pausing the enthusiasm of markets. In 2023, Chinese legislators increased the government’s fiscal deficit, the first intra-year revision since 2000, in a tacit acknowledgment that the post-Covid economic recovery was stalling. Investors will be hoping for considerably more this year.\n\nThat this year’s NPC will convene from Nov. 4 to 8, which means policy details are unlikely to emerge until after we get some clarity on the US election, might be a sign that Beijing is on high alert. A possible Trump win will only muddy the already-chaotic debate among senior officials on the size of fiscal borrowing as well as how the money should be spent.\n\nUntil recently, Xi’s stimulus was entirely a domestic affair. Ministry-level officials have promised the largest one-time debt swap in recent years to improve municipal finances. The state will also buy unsold housing to stabilize property prices, as well as boost banks’ capital buffer to increase their willingness to lend in a weak economy. All these are sensible blueprints to lift China out of deflation.\n\nBut a Trump win can change Beijing’s priorities again. His hawkish rhetoric on Chinese imports, as well as the wide latitude that the US president enjoys in setting and imposing tariffs, directly threatens Xi’s ultimate passion of transforming China into a high-end manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nChina has certainly reacted to Trump’s moves before. After Huawei Technologies Co. was placed on the US trade blacklist in 2019, state resources were poured into industrial upgrades. Huawei alone received over $1 billion in government grants last year, more than quadruple the amount in 2019, in part a reflection that President Joe Biden has furthered Trump’s tough trade policies. Bank lending to industrial firms has also soared in that time.\n\nAs such, it’s possible that Xi will bring out a bigger bazooka if he has to deal with Trump again. Nomura Securities economist Lu Ting reckons that Beijing’s stimulus could be 20% greater under this election outcome. \n\nSenior officials are starting to give us the impression that the government is reluctant to resolve the core tensions ailing the economy. In a recent media briefing, the Ministry of Finance commented that local governments still had unused 2.3 trillion yuan bond quota to tap this year. It’s as if their funding gap wasn’t an urgent issue and that municipal fiscal austerity wasn’t a key reason behind this year’s slowdown. Lately, state media has gone quiet over what Beijing’s stimulus might look like, while diligently broadcasting the three-day BRICS Summit that Xi attended in Russia with great fanfare.\n\nIt’s understandable that Xi wants to fight back against Trump’s unpredictable bullying. But without a solid domestic economy and buoyant consumers flexing their muscles to multinationals, what leverage does he have? China’s president needs to stay focused on his internal affairs.\n\nBloomberg/Shuli Ren","summary":"They might have to meet again.

Since then, the HAWK systems have been stored as reserve weapons.\n“These missiles remain valuable to Ukraine, as they can effectively counter drones and cruise missiles from Russia,” Lee told This Week in Asia.\nLee noted that transferring the HAWK missiles to Ukraine would not require additional personnel, as Kyiv’s forces are already trained to operate them.\n\nYoon previously indicated that South Korea could consider supplying lethal aid to Ukraine, depending on the extent of North Korea’s military support for Russia.\nHowever, Yoo the lawmaker stressed that the option should be a last resort. “It’s good to have this option available as a deterrent against further escalation by Russia,” Yoo said, adding, “But it’s a last resort. We’re not there yet.”\nHe cautioned Seoul against rushing into action, highlighting that former US president Donald Trump has pledged to resolve the conflict early if elected.\n“If Trump’s election indeed results in an early end to the war in Ukraine, moving too aggressively or hastily by supplying lethal weapons might be unwise,” Yoo said.\nHong Hyun-ik, a senior researcher at the Sejong Institute, echoed this caution. “The deployment of North Korean elite troops abroad could reduce immediate threats to the South, even if the government appears to be emphasising this issue amid domestic political challenges,” Hong told This Week in Asia.\n“We should pursue diplomatic outreach to Russia instead of entering a dangerous tit-for-tat escalation.”\n\nOn Tuesday, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) briefed members of the National Assembly’s defence committee, reporting that an advance team of North Korean troops specialising in short-range ballistic missiles appears to be moving towards frontline positions.\nThe NIS was verifying intelligence indicating Kim Yong-bok, the deputy chief of the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army and a close aide to leader Kim Jong-un, could be part of this unit, it said.\nMany of the North Korean soldiers dispatched to Russia are part of the elite “Storm Corps”, mostly in their early 20s, with some possibly as young as their late teens, according to NIS.\nTo overcome language barriers, Russian military instructors were reportedly teaching North Korean soldiers about 100 military terms in Russian, it said.\nBy December, close to 11,000 North Korean troops are anticipated to be stationed in Russia, with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, who is currently in Russia, likely discussing related matters during her visit, according to the spy agency.\n\nNato confirmed North Korean troops have been positioned in Russia’s Kursk region, indicating a potentially complex development in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nAmid reports that Seoul is considering sending a team of officials to Kyiv to monitor the activities of North Korean troops, the NIS stated that it was “worth reviewing” this “rare opportunity” to gather valuable military intelligence.\nThe agency added that South Korea may have a responsibility to accept North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) seeking asylum from Ukrainian forces, and they are exploring the possibility of questioning these POWs for potential defections.\nHowever, opposition lawmakers strongly oppose this plan, threatening to impeach Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun if he sends “any single soldier” to Ukraine, as an “observer” or to interrogate potential North Korean prisoners of war.","summary":"President Yoon Suk-yeol warned of a “grave situation” if North Korean troops join the conflict, prompting Seoul to weigh its options for supporting Ukraine.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3284520/south-korea-mulls-missile-aid-ukraine-amid-fears-about-north-korean-troops-russia","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/30/883d6e3b-1324-40de-898a-ebea19b469ad_3108ecc6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 00:00:20","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":261735172,"title":"'I don’t know anything about the comedian': Trump pleads ignorance as backlash grows","text":"Facing mounting backlash, Donald Trump on Wednesday again sought to distance himself from the racist “jokes” made by a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally Sunday.\n\nTony Hinchcliffe, who has a history of racist remarks, called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean,” and said, “these Latinos, they love making babies, too, just know that.

Doing so is a felony,\" the joint statement continued.Newsweek reached out to the secretary of state's press team, the Washtenaw County sheriff's office and the Michigan attorney general's office for comment via email on Wednesday evening.Benson's office told WLNS that the student's ballot was put through the tabulator and will be counted in the coming general election, as once ballots are processed, it is not possible to retrieve them.The joint statement added that \"noncitizen voting is an extremely isolated and rare event.\"The charges in Michigan were leveled as Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, along with his allies, raise concerns of mass voting by noncitizens.Michigan, with its 15 Electoral College votes, is a key battleground state for Trump and Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris.As of Wednesday evening, the state was in a near deadlock, with polling aggregations from 538, The New York Times and Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin showing Harris up by just around 1 percentage point, while The Hill aggregate shows an even tighter race, with Harris up by 0.3 points, 48.5 percent to Trump's 48.2 percent.As of Wednesday evening, 538's forecast model predicts Harris has a 59 percent chance of winning the state, while Trump is at 41 percent.President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, flipping it from Trump, who narrowly won it in 2016.","summary":"The international university student charged in Michigan asked for his cast ballot back, according to a local news outlet.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/chinese-student-accused-illegal-vote-tried-retrieve-ballot-report-1977660","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2508465/michigan-polls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:52:24","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":261736630,"title":"Chinese citizen charged with illegally voting in Michigan, authorities say","text":"(CNN) — Michigan prosecutors charged a Chinese citizen with voter fraud and perjury after he allegedly cast a ballot in the 2024 election, authorities announced Wednesday.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told CNN that the 19-year-old Chinese man who allegedly voted is a student who lives in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. Authorities said the man isn’t a US citizen, and therefore can’t vote in federal elections.\n\nThe announcement from Michigan’s secretary of state and attorney general, and local prosecutors in Ann Arbor, comes as former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies spread concerns about mass voting by non-citizens. Experts say illegal voting by non-citizens is extremely rare, and when it does happen, it is usually caught quickly.\n\nThe Chinese man – a student at the University of Michigan – cast his ballot on Sunday and then reached out to local election officials later that day in an attempt to get the ballot back, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\nThe man registered to vote at the polling place on Sunday, the source said. He used his university ID and other documents to demonstrate his residency in Ann Arbor while filling out a same-day voter registration forms, the source said. The Detroit News first reported the details.\n\nThe suspect is legally present in the US, the source added. If he is convicted, he could potentially be deported over the incident, legal experts said.\n\n“Investigations in multiple states and nationwide have found no evidence of large numbers of noncitizens registering to vote. Even less common is a noncitizen actually casting a ballot. When it does happen, we take it extremely seriously,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, both Democrats, said in a statement.\n\nThey also said that “any noncitizen who attempts to vote fraudulently in Michigan will be exposing themselves to great risk and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nInvestigators in Michigan are still looking at whether this was an isolated incident, an accident or possibly part of an attempt by China to interfere in the 2024 election, and federal investigators are also looking into the matter, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is also a Democrat, said in a statement that her office has launched an “independent, parallel investigation” into the situation.\n\nAuthorities did not identify the Chinese student accused of voting in the election. He is facing one count of illegally attempting to vote and one count of perjury – both felonies.\n\nIt appears that the student’s vote can’t be nullified after the fact and will be counted.\n\nWashtenaw County Clerk Lawrence Kestenbaum told CNN ballots can’t be retrieved once they have gone through the tabulator. Unlike vote-by-mail, ballots cast at in-person voting locations don’t contain any identifying information about the individual voter, making it impossible to determine which one belonged to the student, Kestenbaum said.\n\n“There’s a box of ballots underneath the tabulator and all of the ballots — they all look the same … there’s no way to go back and undo it,” Kestenbaum said in an interview.\n\nExperts said this is a standard election procedure to maintain secrecy.\n\n“An in-person ballot is placed in a tabulator or ballot box, intermingled with other ballots. This is to preserve secrecy, so you can’t go into the ballot later and confirm who a particular parson voted for,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights official and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.\n\nAfter the charges were announced, Michigan GOP operatives and state lawmakers seized on the news to criticize Democrats for not requiring proof-of-citizenship to vote.\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy, an election law expert at Stetson University, said this is one of the “downsides” of the secret ballot, which was instituted to prevent vote-buying.\n\nEarlier in US history, different color ballots were sometimes used for different political parties, making it easier to meddle in the process. The secret ballot for in-person votes ensures “no one can trace a particular vote to a particular voter,” Torres-Spelliscy said.\n\n“Plucking out an improperly cast ballot is basically impossible because it looks like every other ballot cast by an eligible voter,” Torres-Spelliscy, a CNN contributor, said, adding that the Chinese national who voted in Michigan “swore under penalty of perjury that he was an American citizen, thus this explains why poll workers would give him a ballot.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

We have many people in the U.S. who are in need of financial assistance who would be much more appreciative of the aid. The hard-hit residents of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, who experienced the devastation from hurricanes Helene and Milton, should have priority over aid to any foreign countries. These southeastern states need the humanitarian aid, including food and water, and need funding for long-term projects to rebuild infrastructure. Maybe we should use the money to provide grants and very low interest loans to devastated U.S. residents to help them rebuild their homes, businesses and lives. The devastation and financial difficulties of people losing homes and businesses in western wildfires, and the people experiencing hurricane damage in areas of Texas and Louisiana, should also receive assistance. Our government should cut back some foreign aid and make those funds available to states hard hit by natural disasters.

Applicants are also interviewed.\n\nAn Egyptian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if US funding for the schools were to stop under a second Trump administration, Egypt would have to develop alternative plans for financing, management and partnerships.\n\nThe schools provide critical skills to thousands of young Egyptians like Zeyad Maged, a third-year student at Elsewedy International School for Applied Technology and Software in New October City in the Giza Governorate.\n\n“Last year, I led a capstone (final year) project with my team focused on environmental sustainability, developing a website to promote recycling and foster a healthier community,” said the 17-year-old, who specialises in software development.\n\n“The school provides full scholarships, covering the costs of laptops, uniforms and books, he added.\n\n“All of this comes at a very high quality.”\n\nTeaching ‘critical topics’ \n\nTrump, who is running against Vice President, Kamala Harris, has put Biden’s climate and energy agenda in the crosshairs on the campaign trail, meaning that billions in clean energy funding could hinge on who wins the 5 November election.\n\nBiden’s policies include tax breaks and incentives for electric vehicles and stricter environmental regulations for power plants and automobiles. Trump has also threatened to, once again, pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nMohamed Azzazy, head of surveys at the Natural Resources Department at the University of Sadat City, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the curricula in the 10 applied technology schools prepare young people for environmental sustainability challenges.\n\nREAD: Egypt accepts UAE offer to establish solar energy farms worth $900m\n\n“Students today must engage with critical topics like global warming, renewable energy, carbon footprints and biodiversity to ensure a sustainable future,” Azzazy said.\n\n“These subjects are often missing from conventional Egyptian education, particularly in practical application, but the schools are bridging that gap,” he said, adding that the schools offered hands-on activities like clean-up operations and recycling workshops.\n\nEgypt wants to accelerate the provision of renewable energy that could ease electricity shortages and supply green power to Europe, but faces challenges in funding updates to its grid and unlocking investments for new wind and solar plants.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, USAID in Egypt allocated approximately $200 million in grants to various sectors, including agriculture, coastal communities, renewable energy, and education.\n\nAccording to the USAID website, the schools and other education initiatives account for $70 million of funding from 2021 to 2026, with plans to expand the number of schools to cover 15 governorates, up from the current eight.\n\nUSAID did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nAmr Basila, the Director of the operation and management unit for the International Applied Technology Schools, said the institutions provided internationally certified credentials, hands-on experience and access to job markets in competitive fields including artificial intelligence, digital arts, software engineering and logistics.\n\n“Though still emerging in Egypt, these sectors offer significant opportunities for workforce development and economic growth,” he said.\n\nSome Egyptian observers fear that if Trump wins again, funding for such projects could be cut.\n\nMohamed Rabie El-Dehy, deputy head of the independent Dialogue Centre for Political and Media Studies in Cairo, noted that, in 2017, then-president Trump said he intended to reduce US aid to the Middle East, particularly for climate change and renewable energy programmes, by around 30 per cent.\n\n“Environmental schools of this kind were not established until the Biden administration.

It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”\n\nDuring an Oct. 30 press briefing at the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden was talking about the comedian’s comments and not Trump supporters as a group.\n\nIn Rocky Mount, Trump reminded the audience of when then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called his supporters “a basket of deplorables” in 2016.\n\n“Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters, he called them garbage, and they mean it, even though, without question, my supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe Biden,” Trump said.\n\n“My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans, and you just can’t be president if you hate the American people, and there’s a lot of hatred.”\n\nNorth Carolina is a battleground state that both candidates covet.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat presidential candidate to win North Carolina in 30 years. Trump prevailed in 2016 and then edged Biden by 1.3 percent of the vote in 2020.\n\nRoy Cooper, a Democrat who has served as governor since 2017, spoke in Raleigh before Harris took the stage, as did Attorney General Josh Stein, who is running for governor against Republican nominee Mark Robinson.\n\nA FiveThirtyEight average of polls on Oct. 30 showed Trump with a slight lead over Harris at 48.3 percent to 47.2 percent.\n\nAccording to the state elections board, more than 3.1 million people in North Carolina have already cast ballots during early voting, which ends on Nov. 2.\n\nThe western portion of the state was severely impacted by flooding and mudslides from Hurricane Helene, displacing many residents.\n\nThe mountains of western North Carolina are considered a Republican stronghold.\n\nThe 25 counties that compose the disaster area have 1.3 million registered voters.\n\nIn Rocky Mount, Trump praised the early voting turnout in North Carolina and encouraged Republicans to “just go out and vote.”\n\nEarlier on Oct. 30, before departing for her day of rallies, Harris was asked about Biden’s “garbage” comment.\n\n“Listen, first of all, I think he clarified his comments, but let me be clear I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” she said.\n\nHarris was then asked if she was concerned that voters would be offended.\n\n“I’m sincere with what I mean, when elected president I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,” she said.\n\nTrump told audience members in Rocky Mount that Harris and Democrats have insulted Republicans “for the past nine years.”\n\n“They’ve bullied you, they’ve demeaned us, they’ve demonized us and censored us, and weaponized the power of our own government against us,” Trump said.\n\n“Kamala and her party have called us racists, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemable Nazis, and they’ve called me Hitler.”\n\nTrump said his father told him to “never use the word Nazi” and “never use the word Hitler.”\n\n“Now we’re called Nazis, and I’m called Hitler. I’m not Hitler,” the former president said.\n\nTrump vowed to end inflation and “stop the massive invasion of criminals into our country” and “bring back a thing called the American dream.”\n\nHe also said he would return America to energy independence and “drill baby drill.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump chastised President Joe Biden for appearing to call his supporters 'garbage' while Harris vowed to 'represent all Americans.'","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-harris-hold-dueling-rallies-in-north-carolina-5750896","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/30/id5750980-harris-raleigh-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:32:49","author":"Jeff Louderback","authors":["Jeff Louderback"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.014},{"id":261733628,"title":"Nevada Republicans reject Biden trash dump on Trump voters: ‘So now we’re deplorable garbage’","text":"MESQUITE, Nev. — Voters in this largely GOP enclave in the northeast part of largely Democratic Clark County don’t like President Biden dumping on them and their Trump-voting swing-state neighbors as “garbage.” \n\nIn a get-out-the-vote video call Tuesday, the lame-duck president brought up “insult comic” Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Donald Trump’s Sunday Madison Square Garden rally. \n\n“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American,” Biden said.\n\nThe White House scrambled Wednesday to recast Biden’s trash talk as limited to Hinchcliffe, but the damage was done for Trump supporters.\n\n“I’m in shock,” said GOP volunteer Sandy Sorenson, a 26-year resident of this desert city. “I’ve never considered myself garbage and anybody I know, that’s reprehensible. I just can’t believe somebody would call my friends and myself garbage.”\n\nNot only would she not call Democratic voters “garbage,” Sorenson said, “I wouldn’t even call him garbage,” referring to Biden.\n\nKaren Campbell, another party volunteer, said, “I think it’s disgusting. It’s along the lines of Hillary Clinton’s ‘deplorables.’ So now we’re deplorable garbage, I guess to them. I think that’s totally inappropriate.”\n\nCampbell scoffed at Biden’s retraction, saying, “Well, he misspeaks a lot. . . . I don’t really care to be called trash or garbage or even a deplorable,”\n\nOne voter who walked in was particularly unimpressed with Biden’s remark.\n\n“How would he know? Unless he’s there in the garbage dump himself, how would that bozo possibly know that?” asked Lee McCord.\n\n“He’s a loser,” she added. “He was stuck on us. He cheated his way in, we all know that, because there’s nobody in their right mind that would vote for somebody without a brain in their head, and it’s been a failure his whole 40-odd years in office.”\n\nMcCord said she would not call Harris-Walz voters “garbage” but would use the word “brainless” instead.\n\nMesquite’s population is just under 23,000, and the retirement-friendly community is expected to grow in the coming years. Despite a solid Republican base, there are a fair number of Harris-Walz signs on display in front yards and along main drag Pioneer Boulevard.","summary":"MESQUITE, Nev. — Voters in this largely GOP enclave in the northeast part of largely Democratic Clark County don&#8217;t like President Biden dumping on them and their Trump-voting swing-state neighbors as &#8220;garbage.&#8221; White House attempts to walk back the &#8220;garbage&#8221; remark fell flat with GOP voters.

In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Tuesday night, Trump praised Musk as “a great cost cutter.”\n\n“He’ll cut costs without anybody even knowing it,” Trump claimed. “Nobody’s going to know. Nobody’s going to feel it. He will cut costs, and he feels he can save $2 trillion. If he does that, our budget is more than balanced.”\n\nNeither Musk nor Trump have detailed which programs would face cuts, but during his term as president Trump pushed for cuts to health care, food assistance, and other programs that help low- and moderate-income families.\n\nTrump’s last federal budget proposal suggested cuts to popular programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nBy contrast, under the Biden-Harris administration health care coverage has been expanded and legislation has lowered the costs of prescription drugs for many—despite opposition from Republicans in Congress.\n\nTesla CEO Musk is pushing for cuts that could affect the vast majority of Americans who don’t have the kind of wealth he enjoys at the same time he is spending millions to elect Trump. America PAC is operating what Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner called an “illegal lottery,” handing out millions of dollars to registered voters in swing states. The scheme has come under scrutiny and Musk and the PAC have been sued by the DA’s office in Pennsylvania court.\n\nIf Trump wins the election and Musk accepts a role in the administration, he could get billions in tax breaks. An analysis published by the progressive outlet The Lever determined that if Musk divested in his positions from several of the companies he has an ownership stake in to work with Trump, he could defer the capital gains taxes from that transaction.\n\nMusk and other überwealthy individuals like him already received massive tax cuts under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump signed into law. The legislation also cut taxes for large corporations but did not spur the economic growth that Trump had long touted it would.\n\nMusk’s zeal to cut government spending is also curious since he has been the beneficiary of massive government spending throughout the course of his career. His company SpaceX rakes in hundreds of millions from NASA, which is completely financed by taxpayers.\n\nMusk has also admitted that assessments predicting the U.S. economy could be severely hurt by Trump’s economic proposals are “about right.”\n\nTrump backs economic policies that would preserve tax cuts for those at Musk’s level of wealth, while his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a different path. The Democratic nominee supports cutting taxes for middle-income earners but taxing billionaires to fund social services and health care.\n\nOther billionaires who stand to benefit from Trump’s tax policies have also taken actions supportive of his candidacy. The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, which both endorsed President Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 election, recently announced they would not endorse a candidate this year. Both publications are owned by billionaires.\n\n“It’s billionaires in Donald Trump’s club,” Harris told a radio interviewer who asked her about the newspaper’s decisions. “That’s who’s in his club. That’s who he hangs out with. That’s who he cares about.”","summary":"Multibillionaire Elon Musk, who is currently spending millions to help elect Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said Americans will face “hardship” if cuts to government spending are made in a possible Trump presidency.\n\n\n\nMusk made the comments during a virtual town hall meeting held by his political action committee, America PAC.\n\n\n\n“We have to reduce spending to live within our means,” Musk said. “That necessarily involves some temporary hardship, but it will ensure long-term prosperity.”\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\nx\nYouTube Video","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/10/30/2281022/-Trump-sugar-daddy-Musk-Tax-cuts-for-me-hardship-for-thee?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1362323/story_image/GettyImages-2180769486.jpg?1730322168","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:30:05","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":261734042,"title":"Swing House district seen as a bellwether for 2024 will be decided by these 2 factors: expert","text":"Control of the House of Representatives will likely come down to a handful of contested seats, and one military-heavy congressional district that could play a decisive role in determining the next House speaker is especially hard-fought.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, in which Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal is running against Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Virginia), the winner will likely be determined by a razor-thin margin at the very last minute. FiveThirtyEight's aggregated polling data shows that Cotter Smasal is within the margin of error, and the district is increasingly being seen as a bellwether for the 2024 election at large given that it will be among the first races to have a winner announced next Tuesday.\n\nThe district was previously represented by Democrat Elaine Luria after she defeated the Republican incumbent, before Kiggans unseated Luria in 2022. And while former Democratic Governor Ralph Northam won the district in 2017, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin won a majority of the 2nd district's voters in 2021. It's also a swing district in presidential elections, as former President Donald Trump took the 2nd district in 2016, while President Joe Biden won it in 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: These 7 down-ballot races could determine control of Congress\n\nSojo Akomolafe, who is the chair of the political science department at Norfolk State University, said VA-2 is \"the quintessential definition of a swing district.\" And he opined that the eventual winner would be determined by two factors: Voter enthusiasm and Black voter turnout.\n\n\"It’s not depending on the party but on who the candidate is, how vibrant that candidate is,\" Akomolafe said. \"That means, until the very last minute, you’re not sure who’s going to win it.\"\n\nKiggans has sought to keep her reelection campaign focused on bread-and-butter issues, like local infrastructure projects and strengthening the Department of Veterans Affairs, given the strong military presence in the district. However, Cotter Smasal has painted her as a MAGA extremist, given Kiggans' appearance at a Trump rally in Virginia and her kind words for Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, whom she called \"so kind\" and saying that both she and Greene \"want the same thing.\" Kiggans also recently campaigned with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the far-right firebrand who chairs the House Judiciary Committee and scheduled multiple hearings concerning allegations about Biden and his son, Hunter, that ultimately failed to yield articles of impeachment or a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. \n\nLike the presidential election, abortion could end up being a decisive issue in the VA-2 race. Cotter Smasal has campaigned hard on restoring the abortion rights that were gutted in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Cindy Arnold, a Virginia Beach resident the Post identified as a \"former Republican,\" supports Cotter Smasal largely due to that issue.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Just thirsty for a change': This deep-red state is poised to oust its two-term GOP senator\n\n\"Abortion is a big issue — I have granddaughters,\" Arnold said. \"And just — character. Able to do the job and know about reality. If she can’t say who won the last presidential election, I’m sorry. Years ago I probably would have split tickets, but I don’t think that’s possible these days.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cotter Smasal sought to shore up Black turnout by campaigning alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York). During their joint appearance, Cotter Smasal said that if Democrats took back the House, she would be eager to cast her vote for Jeffries as speaker, noting that he would be the first Black Speaker of the House in U.S. history.\n\nClick here to read the Post's report in its entirety (subscription required). \n\nREAD MORE: Ted Cruz dodges key issue that's become major 'political liability' for GOP","summary":"Control of the House of Representatives will likely come down to a handful of contested seats, and one military-heavy congressional district that could play a decisive role in determining the next House speaker is especially hard-fought.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, in which Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal is running against Rep.

Contracts to buy previously owned homes jumped by the most in four years in September, the National Association of Realtors reported today. Pending sales turn into actual sales a month or two later.\n\nBut almost immediately after the Fed’s September meeting, home loan rates began climbing again, as stronger-than-expected data including a jump in spending and big job gains allayed concerns about a recession and fueled expectations that the Fed would cut rates more slowly.

The Postrider’s Lars Emerson and Michael Lovito have also questioned Lichtman’s claims about his record.\n\n“I think [it is] an example of kind of the replication crisis and kind of junk science,” Silver said in a recent podcast. \n\n“A lot of the variables are subjective … these are things that if you know the answer already, you can overfit and kind of p-hack your way into saying, ‘Now we can predict every election perfectly.’”\n\nSilver wrote in a New York Times op-ed last week that his “gut says” Trump will become the 47th president, though his own model says that outcome has a 55 per cent chance of coming to pass – essentially a coin flip.\n\nLichtman developed “The Keys to the White House” with academic Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981 and used the model to go back over past election cycles retrospectively. \n\nThe one blemish on his record is the 2000 election, which he wrongly predicted Al Gore would win.\n\n“Of course, the answer is no,” Lichtman added Tuesday in reference to questions about whether he’d change his keys, though he admitted to being nervous about his call holding up.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 42 years and every four years, I have butterflies in my stomach,” he said. \n\n“This year, I think I have a flock of crows in my stomach. Of course I’m anxious. Not because of the polls, but primarily because I’m worried about the future of this country.”\n\nLichtman, a registered Democrat, has been fiercely critical of Trump. \n\nRecently, he announced he was cancelling his Washington Post subscription over the paper’s decision not to endorse a candidate this cycle or in future cycles.\n\n“There is more election anxiety this year than I have ever seen and I go back to Kennedy-Nixon,” he reflected. \n\n“I have never seen this kind of election anxiety because a lot of people believe that the future of the country is on the line here and that democracy in this country could be a thing of the past.”\n\nThis article was originally written by the NY Post and has be republished with permission.","summary":"Allan Lichtman, 77, has been dubbed by some the election “Nostradamus” due to his track record of predicting nine of the past 10 presidential contests.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/election-nostradamus-stands-by-us-election-prediction-that-kamala-harris-will-beat-donald-trump/news-story/6417184de684e4057e6dee779029eefc?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/eecfec0e70e58cf618f74f4b769eba60","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:27:33","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":261736098,"title":"Watch — Donald Trump Rides Garbage Truck to Wisconsin Rally: ‘250 Million People Are Not Garbage’","text":"Former President Donald Trump rode in a garbage truck on Wednesday to his Wisconsin rally in response to President Joe Biden trashing millions of Americans as “garbage.”\n\nVideo shows a garbage truck approaching Trump’s plane in Green Bay, Wisconsin, American flags waving in the air.\n\nWearing an orange vest, Trump sent a very pointed message: “Hello everybody. This is Donald Trump, and 250 million people are not garbage.”\n\nTrump then hopped in the garbage truck, heading off to his next rally in the crucial battleground state.\n\nTrump, speaking from the passenger window of the garbage truck — which had “TRUMP” and “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” on the side, asked the press, “How do you like my garbage truck?”\n\n“This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,” he added, reiterating that 250 million people are going to be “very happy, because we’re going to bring the country back.”\n\n“We’re a nation in decline. Very, very serious decline, and we’re going to bring our country back,” he added.\n\nSupporters were loving it across social media.\n\n“He always makes sure he is one of us!

She doesn’t have the intellect, the stamina, or that special quality that real leaders must have to lead. We know what that is. It’s a special quality,” he said, adding that Biden’s comments were “the direct result of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”\n\n“Kamala and her party have called us racist, bigots, fascist, deplorables, irredeemables, Nazis, and they’ve called me Hitler,” Trump said, reminding Americans that these offensive characterizations from the left are not new.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris tried to save face for Biden, telling reporters that he “clarified his comments.”\n\n“But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” she added, failing to say if she sympathizes with voters who do feel offended by or insulted by the “garbage” comment.\n\nRELATED — Kamala Dodges on if She Sympathizes with People Offended by Biden Calling Them “Garbage”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump rode in a garbage truck on Wednesday to his Wisconsin rally in response to President Joe Biden trashing millions of Americans as \"garbage.\"\n\n\nThe post Watch — Donald Trump Rides Garbage Truck to Wisconsin Rally: ‘250 Million People Are Not Garbage’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/30/watch-donald-trump-rides-garbage-truck-to-wisconsin-rally-250-million-people-are-not-garbage/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/10/Trump-Arrives-in-Garbage-Truck-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:25:07","author":"Biden Calling Them,Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Biden Calling Them","Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":261733164,"title":"Trump puts focus on Biden's \"garbage\" remarks","text":"Trump puts focus on Biden's \"garbage\" remarks\n Former President Donald Trump criticized President Biden for comments he made on a video call with Latino activists in which he appeared to call Trump supporters \"garbage,\" comments the White House alleges were misconstrued.

The narrowly divided county, which is led by Democrats, is often seen as a political bellwether.\n\nIn U.S. history, perhaps the most famous wrong call was in the 1948 presidential election. The Chicago Daily Tribune, now called the Chicago Tribune, published an erroneous banner headline declaring, “Dewey Defeats Truman.” In other words, Thomas Dewey defeated then-incumbent President Harry S.

Sanchez also revealed the lavish weekend getaway to an undisclosed European city in an Instagram Story picked up by the tabloid Hello!, Semafor also reported.\n\nHello! said the weekend celebration started in Venice, then continued to Geneva, Switzerland, with the Daily Mail adding that a birthday bash took place at the Ritz Carlton in Geneva.\n\nWhile Perry “no doubt received tons of love from her fiancé Orlando Bloom and their daughter Daisy Dove, it was her friends who came in clutch as well.” Hello! gushingly reported. Sanchez, her close friend, was by her side “for a luxurious and beautiful celebratory getaway,” Hello! said. Perry, incidentally, is a Harris supporter and one has to wonder if she agreed with Bezos’ decision to kill the endorsement for her chosen candidate.\n\nBut as Sanchez and Bezos reportedly enjoyed their luxurious getaway, editors and reporters who work for the news organization he bought in 2013 were dealing with the calamitous fallout of his decision, according to reports.\n\nRetired executive editor Marty Baron called the decision an act of “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” In a joint statement, Washington Post legends Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein said the decision “ignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy.”\n\nThe newsroom was rocked by a tidal wave of resignations from columnists and cancellations from digital subscribers, who expressed anger and dismay that the venerable, Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization had abandoned its role in standing up to the threat described by Woodward and Bernstein. As of Tuesday, the number of cancellations had exceeded 250,000, or about 10% of all paid circulation, NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik reported.\n\nChief Executive and Publisher Will Lewis tried to explain the decision to not endorse in this year’s presidential race or in future elections, by saying it was a return to the Post’s roots of trying to remain “independent.”\n\nAt the end of Bezos’ reported luxury weekend, he published a column on Monday to defend his decision as a matter of principle. Similar to Lewis, he said that ending presidential endorsements ends a “perception of bias.” He also tried to dismiss suggestions that he spiked the column as a way to benefit his business interests with a potential Trump administration.\n\nBut Folkenflik said that few people inside the paper bought these arguments. For one thing, the Post has endorsed presidential candidates since 1976 and did so after Bezos bought the newspaper in 2013. In its 2016 and 2020 endorsements of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, the Post’s editorial board called Trump “the worst president of modern times” and a “grave danger to the nation and the world.”\n\nTo journalists like Baron, the most problematic issue with Bezos’ decision is that the Post didn’t reveal it until 11 days before the election in a very tight race.\n\n“If this decision had been made three years ago, two years ago, maybe even a year ago, that would’ve been fine,” Baron said in an interview with NPR’s Morning Edition on Monday. “It’s a certainly reasonable decision. But this was made within a couple of weeks of the election, and there was no substantive serious deliberation with the editorial board of the paper. It was clearly made for other reasons, not for reasons of high principle.”","summary":"Reports say that Bezos and Sanchez enjoyed a luxury European getaway to celebrate Perry's 40th birthday while the Washington Post began to hemorrhage subscribers and public good will.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/30/jeff-bezos-and-lauren-sanchez-partied-with-katy-perry-in-europe-amid-post-crisis-reports/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sanchez-Bezos-.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:19:45","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.224},{"id":261732380,"title":"Trump trolls Harris and Biden by riding a GARBAGE TRUCK to his Wisconsin rally","text":"Donald Trump trolled President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by riding a MAGA garbage truck to his rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday night in response to President Joe Biden's gaffe.\n\n'How do you like my garbage truck?

During a press briefing on Wednesday, Jean-Pierre insisted that Biden was not calling Trump supporters garbage, but instead was calling comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about Puerto Rico \"garbage.\" \"He does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump as garbage. That is not what he views,\" the press secretary said of Biden. \"He has said multiple times that he is a president for all. It doesn't matter if you live in a red state, it doesn't matter if you live in a blue state. He has said it himself. I have said it on his behalf. He believes that he's a president for all. And it doesn't matter who you voted for, doesn't matter if you voted for him or not. He's a president for all. But hateful rhetoric, hateful rhetoric that he hears. And this is something that we've done many times from here. We will call that out. We will call that out.\" WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO PLAY CLEAN UP AFTER BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ During a virtual call with Voto Latino, Biden was asked about Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after Hinchcliffe told a joke, referring to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage.\" He responded by saying, \"Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. He's a failed businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends that he has and accumulating wealth for those at the top. He says immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country – give me a break. He wants to do away with the birthright citizenship. Who the hell has said that in the last hundred years? And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something. I don't -- I -- I don't know the Puerto Rican that -- that I know -- or a Puerto Rico, where I'm fr- -- in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters -- his -- his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.\" Now the White House is insisting that Biden would not speak badly about people that support Trump, but his past comments about MAGA Republicans seem to say otherwise. Sept. 5, 2022 – Laborfest, Milwaukee, Wisconsin On Sept. 5, 2022, Biden gave a Labor Day speech to workers in Milwaukee, where he went after MAGA Republicans and Trump supporters. WHITE HOUSE DENIES THAT BIDEN REFERRED TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS ‘GARBAGE’ \"Look, extreme MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and our economic security, they embrace political violence,\" Biden said before attempting to clear up that he was only talking about MAGA Republicans and not all Republicans. \"The definition of democracy is you accept the will of the people when votes are honestly counted. These guys don’t do it.\" He continued, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and saying MAGA Republicans in Congress continue to defend the \"mob\" that stormed the building that day. \"This was an attack on American democracy,\" he said. \"We have to be stronger and more determined and more committed to saving American democracy than the MAGA Republicans and that guy… who are destroying democracy, because democracy is at stake.\" Sept. 9, 2022 – Democratic National Committee, Forest Heights, Maryland While speaking at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Forest Heights, Maryland, on Sept. 9, 2022, Biden sharpened his attacks against Trump and MAGA Republicans for posing a threat to democracy. TRUMP CALLS FOR SUPPORTS TO ‘FORGIVE’ BIDEN IN SHOW OF UNITY AFTER PRESIDENT CALLS SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ \"Extreme MAGA Republicans just don’t threaten our personal and economic rights; they embrace political violence,\" the president said. \"Think about it. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They threaten our very democracy. They – and that’s not hyperbole – to this day, they defend the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\" Oct. 23, 2022 – Interview with MSNBC During an interview on Oct. 23, 2022, with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart, Biden called out \"mega MAGA\" Republicans who \"think it’s alright to threaten violence.\" \"I think we’re at one of those inflection points in history, where we’ve reached a point where there has been such a division that you have what I call the mega MAGA republicans, who think that it’s all right to threaten violence… think that’s not inappropriate, talk about how they are concerned about security but yet you saw what happened on Jan. 6, the whole world saw it.\" BIDEN CALLS TRUMP SUPPORTERS ‘GARBAGE’ DURING HARRIS CAMPAIGN EVENT AS VP PROMISES UNITY AT ELLIPSE RALLY He said the country had a leader who concluded the truth didn’t matter, then used the old modern version of \"the old racist kind of baiting,\" seen 40 to 50 years ago, that Biden said, did not take it seriously. Sept. 28, 2023 – Campaign Reception in Tempe, Arizona Biden attended a campaign reception in Tempe, Arizona on Sept. 28, 2023, where again, he singled out MAGA supporters and accused them of posing a threat to democracy. \"Their extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it,\" Biden said of MAGA republicans. \"My friends, they're not hiding their attacks; they're openly promoting them. Attacking the free press as the enemy of the people. Attacking the rule of law as an impediment. Fomenting voter suppression and election subversion. \"This MAGA threat is a threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions,\" he later told attendees. \"It's also a threat to the character of our nation that gives our Constitution life, that binds us together as Americans, a common cause. None of this is surprising, though. They've tried to govern that way before. Thank God they failed. But they haven't given up.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked about the contradictions between Jean-Pierre’s statements on Wednesday and remarks made by Biden in the past against MAGA Republicans, the White House referred Fox News Digital to a speech given by the president on Sept. 1, 2022. \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" Biden said at the time. \"Now, I want to be very clear…very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans,\" the president continued. \"But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.\"","summary":"The White House claims President Biden would never speak badly about Trump supporters, but his history of bashing MAGA Republicans tells another story.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-past-comments-about-maga-republicans-come-back-haunt-him-white-house-spins-garbage-remarks","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/10/931/523/file-63.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 23:16:35","author":"Greg Wehner","authors":["Greg Wehner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.352}]}
