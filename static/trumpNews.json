{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":23657,"news":[{"id":394958012,"title":"Carney Is Offering a Rehab Program for Bruised US Allies","text":"At times, Donald Trump’s address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday felt rambling and unfocused, but don’t be fooled: The US president has just told his country’s European allies that when it comes to Greenland, he’s making them an offer they can’t refuse.The world Trump described in Switzerland was that of a Capo di Capo who sees US allies not as partners but ungrateful recipients of protection. It was an approach foretold by Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney on the same stage a day earlier, in the best speech on international affairs I’ve seen a leader make in recent memory. The contrast between the two is worth dwelling on.Trump’s address was far less coherent, but just as clear and momentous. It spelled out both his assessment of the overwhelming extent of US power, without which Europe in his view would “not exist,” and his willingness to use that leverage to extract anything he considers important enough to call national security. That turns out to cover a wide field including, just in this one speech, pharmaceuticals prices, trade deficits and Greenland — on the subject of which Trump warned any European leaders listening : “You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.”To interpret the raspy, Vito Corleone-like menace in that last phrase, bear in mind that the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world had moments earlier said that he knew he’d probably have to use “excessive force” to get what he wanted on Iceland – which of course he went on to say he would never do.Unlike in The Godfather, no one will be waking up to a severed horse’s head tomorrow. Trump delivered his threat instead as a series of anecdotes in which he revealed how he’d already — one leader at a time — strong-armed the Europeans into accepting higher tariffs and drug prices. He even imitated Emmanuel Macron, using a mocking imitation of a French accent to mimic the French president as he said “no, no, no” to increasing drug prices, before switching to a meek “yes” under threat of tariffs.And what happens if you still try to say no? Trump recalled another time when a Swiss leader kept telling him he couldn’t raise tariffs to 30%. She annoyed him by being too pushy — so he put them up to 39%.This shakedown of America’s traditional allies couldn’t have made clearer how Trump has torn up the Western order his predecessors built. It clearly irritated the president that Carney had offered a game plan a day earlier for what he called “middle powers” to get together and respond.The first stage in Carney’s recovery program for American allies was to accept that the so-called liberal world order is gone for good and that there’s no point invoking it or pining for it. Great powers will do what they do to secure their perceived interests — so recognize the world for what it is. The second stage is for those left behind to form what amount to coalitions of the beaten up, so as to survive.Carney described his attempts to build a whole variety of connections and alliances with other lesser powers that would reduce the vulnerabilities of each in their areas of interest or exposure. It’s a technique familiar to anyone who has watched weaker animals group together to fight off a predator, in a nature film.But nations and humans can surely do better. And because this requires collective action it must, inevitably, mean finding new vehicles and mechanisms to recreate the rules and conventions that brought “the West” 80 years of peace and prosperity – only this time without American power to enforce them, however selective that may have been. It’s just that getting there will take time and, in the interim, it isn’t obvious how to navigate between Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Xi Jinping’s China and Trump’s US.Carney’s done a better job than most, standing up to US bullying when he can, bending when he must and looking for ways to strengthen Canada’s position for the future. He listed his efforts to diversify and solidify his nation’s markets, supplies, and security relationships since taking office, in the face of a barrage of threats from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. Canada’s central banker-turned politician was talking his own book, of course, and who knows if he’ll succeed. But this was a grown-up assessment of what the future holds for America’s abandoned allies — from London to Berlin, from Tokyo to Sydney.All of America’s allies are going to need this kind of pragmatism to manage Trump, while at the same time acknowledging their weaknesses, building up their military and economic strength and diversifying trade, energy and security relationships so as to end their overdependence on American money and power.The US President clearly heard Carney’s speech, and understood it was directed at him. “Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump warned. “Remember that, Mark, next time you’re going to make one of your statements.” But he should heed Carney’s words.When the US president claims his country gained nothing from allies for shouldering the costs of their protection over the last eight decades, he is fundamentally wrong. The US has gained a great deal, especially through market access, investment, borrowing, arms sales and military support for draining military operations such as Afghanistan. In the longer term, the diversification and reorientation that Carney foresees among his so-called middle powers will cost the US dear, too.More from Bloomberg Opinion: This column reflects the personal views of the author and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Marc Champion is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe, Russia and the Middle East.

We got great reviews. I can’t believe it,” he said.\nEmphasising the tone of the coverage, Trump added, “We got good reviews in that speech. Usually, they say, he’s a horrible dictator type person.”\nIt was at that point that Trump leaned directly into the label.\n“I’m a dictator,” he said, before quickly qualifying the remark.\n“But sometimes you need a dictator.”\nHe then pivoted to what he framed as the underlying philosophy of his governance, arguing that his decisions were driven less by ideology and more by pragmatism.\n“It’s all based on common sense,” Trump said.\n“It’s not conservative or liberal or anything else. It’s mostly, let’s say, 95 per cent common sense, and that’s what we have,” he added.\n\nEarlier in the day at Davos, Trump acknowledged that his rhetoric had created tension but insisted that his intentions were being misread.\n“People thought I would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” he said.\n“I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\nTrump also addressed the controversy surrounding Greenland, an issue that had dominated headlines in the run-up to the World Economic Forum meeting.\nAfter weeks of tough talk that had unnerved NATO allies, the US President signalled a clear step back, ruling out both military action and the use of tariffs as leverage.\nHe said discussions were moving toward a cooperative outcome involving Western Arctic allies.\nAfter meeting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump described the emerging understanding in sweeping terms.\n“It’s a deal that everybody’s very happy with,” he told reporters.\n“It’s a long-term deal. It’s the ultimate long-term deal. It puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals.”\nHe added emphatically, “It’s a deal that’s forever.”\nTrump later said that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the United States would continue, aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold in Greenland, economically or militarily.\nStressing the shift in tone, he announced that tariffs previously scheduled to take effect would not be imposed.","summary":"Donald Trump called himself a dictator at Davos, defended his leadership as common sense, and announced cooperative Greenland talks with Denmark and NATO.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/donald-trump-calls-himself-dictator-davos-summit-us-president-dictator-greenland-denmark-tariff-remarks-ws-l-9847918.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2026/01/MixCollage-22-Jan-2026-06-49-AM-5387-2026-01-6d7b855ac6c9fd29fbb4fb408230a08c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:33:41","author":"News18,Vani Mehrotra","authors":["News18","Vani Mehrotra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.1},{"id":395051996,"title":"Trump's Board of Peace poses latest in a series of US challenges to UN","text":"United Nations, Jan 22 (AP) US President Donald Trump’s ambition for the ‘Board of Peace’ to play a role in global conflicts beyond Gaza appears to be the latest US attempt to sidestep the UN Security Council, raising new questions about the relevance of the 80-year-old world body and uncertainty about its future as a primary force in brokering peace worldwide.\nTrump is establishing the board, to be composed largely of invited heads of state, as the UN has embarked on major reforms intended to modernise an organisation founded on the ashes of World War II and make it a more viable global player in the 21st century.\nA decades-long reform effort gained new impetus after the Trump administration last year set out to eliminate billions of dollars in funding to international organisations and humanitarian assistance at large.\nCutting life-saving humanitarian efforts, consolidating major agencies and moving personnel out of New York headquarters are just a few of the changes the UN has made as it courts continued support from the US, traditionally its largest donor.\nTrump and his allies have blasted the organisation for not reaching its full potential and accused it of having “bloated” and redundant agencies that push “woke” ideology. The US refused to pay its mandatory dues to the UN last year.\nThe Security Council — the UN’s most powerful body with the clout to authorise military action — has failed in recent years to end wars, including in Gaza and Ukraine. It’s a point Trump has hit on since the beginning of his second term and he did so again several times this week.\n“The UN just hasn’t been very helpful. I’m a big fan of the UN’s potential, but it has never lived up to its potential,” Trump told reporters during a White House press briefing.\n“The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled. I never went to them. I never even thought about going to them.” Despite his complaints, he added that “I believe you got to let the UN continue, because the potential is so great.” The Security Council in November authorised the Board of Peace to serve as a transitional body to oversee a US-brokered ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, as Trump proposed. But in forming the board, he has described its role as a mediator for other global conflicts, a potential rival to the UN Security Council.\nRetired US Ambassador Robert Wood, who served at the US Mission to the United Nations under Republican and Democratic leaders, said if Trump is trying to replace the Security Council with a Board of Peace dealing with issues beyond Gaza, “I don’t think there’s going to be a lot of interest.” “What I would say to UN member states, including the United States: Let’s try to work together to try to make the United Nations a better instrument. It really is the best instrument we have, given all its warts,” Wood told The Associated Press.\n“But trying to recreate something new in this type of era, with all the divisions that exist and the fact that most of the developing world puts a lot of emphasis on the United Nations and the conflict resolution mechanism, I just don’t see how this would work.” UN officials on Wednesday dismissed concerns, saying it is unlikely that decades of multilateral peacebuilding with the participation of more than 190 member countries could be replaced.\n“There have been any number of organisations — regional organisations, defence alliances and others — that have coexisted with the UN over the 80 years that the UN’s been in existence,” Farhan Haq, UN deputy spokesperson, said Wednesday.\nHe added, “It’s too early to tell what the Board of Peace will look like.” Who will join Trump’s board —————————– It was not immediately clear how many countries would accept Trump’s invitation to join the board.\nEight Muslim countries — including Qatar, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates — accepted the invitation on Wednesday but reaffirmed their commitment in a joint statement to support the board’s original mission aimed at advancing peace and reconstruction in Gaza and the Palestinians’ right to statehood.\nFrance, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has said it will not accept Trump’s invitation, while the three other members with vetoes — Russia, China and Britain — are still assessing it.\nAs of Wednesday, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia had also declined. Slovenia’s main concern was that the board’s mandate is too broad and it could seriously undermine the international order based on the UN Charter.\nOne European diplomat told The Associated Press that EU countries “feel a bit awkward” about the effort and would prefer that there be discussions on the Board of Peace plan regarding Gaza before engaging on this broader initiative.

He said allies had a 'chance to say yes and we will be very appreciative', but warned: 'You say no, and we will remember.' \n\nFrom his speech, he headed off to a meeting with Nato boss Mark Rutte, from which he emerged on Wednesday night claiming to have struck a deal – although there were no details of what his apparent 'framework' would look like. \n\nFor 72 minutes in the afternoon, straight off his delayed flight from Washington and seemingly weary from it, Mr Trump had the Swiss business forum captivated, deviating wildly and going off script as his speeches often do. \n\nHe mocked the aviator sunglasses worn by French president Emmanuel Macron the previous day to cover an eye infection. He hit out at 'Somali bandits', labelled Europe 'unrecognisable', and suggested he had wanted to bring Second World War battleships out of retirement. \n\nBut though it took some 20 minutes for him to get to the issue, it was the subject of Greenland that most exercised the leader of the free world. \n\nWarming up, he warned America wants 'strong allies, not seriously weakened ones' and singled out Britain for not using North Sea oil. \n\nEurope must 'get out of the culture they've created over the last ten years', he said. If they want a 'strong and united West', they must get a grip of 'energy, trade, immigration and economic growth'. \n\nThen, teasing the 2,300 delegates packed into Davos' congress hall, he turned his sights on the subject world leaders had been bracing for. \n\n'No current issue makes the situation more clear than what's going on with Greenland,' he said. Pausing for effect, he added with a smile: 'I was going to leave it out of the speech, but thought I was going to be reviewed very negatively.' \n\nWhile Mr Trump said he has 'tremendous respect for both the people of Greenland and the people of Denmark', he insisted 'every Nato ally has an obligation to be able to defend their own territory'. \n\n'The fact is no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States. We're a great power, much greater than people even understand,' he said. \n\nTo justify his claim, Mr Trump reminded Denmark that in the Second World War the country 'fell to Germany after just six hours of fighting'. The US was 'compelled' to send forces to hold Greenland but 'after the war, which we won big... we gave Greenland back to Denmark'. \n\n'How stupid were we to do that?' he asked, given the island is 'right smack in the middle' of the US, China and Russia. \n\nOf the Danes, he demurred: 'How ungrateful are they now.' \n\nMr Trump described Greenland, home to nearly 60,000 people, as a 'vast, almost entirely uninhabited and undeveloped territory'. \n\nHe dismissed arguments that he only wants the island for its valuable rare earth metals, saying it is for 'international security' – despite America being allowed to deploy its own troops to the territory. \n\nOnly the US can make it 'safe for Europe and good for us', he said. 'That's the reason I'm seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States.'\n\nThe only reprieve during his blistering attack on allies came when, for the first time, he ruled out seizing the territory by force.\n\nHaving bemoaned Nato, saying, 'We give so much and we get so little in return,' Mr Trump said of Greenland: 'We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that, OK... That's probably the biggest statement I made... I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.'\n\nEven his ally Nigel Farage on Wednesday night said that, while the world would be a 'better, more secure place' if the US took Greenland, 'you must respect the rights and views of the Greenlanders'.\n\nMr Trump also apparently forgot that the US is the only country to have invoked Article 5 of the Nato agreement (an attack on one is an attack on all) after 9/11, and that thousands of servicemen and women died in Afghanistan fighting America's war as 35 member states answered the call.\n\n'The problem with Nato is that we'll be there for them 100 per cent, but I'm not sure that they'd be there for us,' he said. \n\nThen, despite having brought world relations to the brink over Greenland, he proceeded to call it Iceland four times. \n\n'They're not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you,' he said. 'I mean, our stock market took the first dip [on Wednesday] because of Iceland. So Iceland's already cost us a lot of money.' \n\nIn another moment, he said of Nato: 'Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me.' \n\nThe demand for the 'piece of ice' is 'a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades', he said.\n\nThis would be 'just as we have acquired many other territories throughout our history' as 'many of the European nations have'. He also said he would be meeting Volodymyr Zelensky and wants a deal to end the 'bloodbath' in Ukraine.\n\nBut he was scathing of Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who had earlier given a speech railing against a return to 'great powers' using economic coercion. 'Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,' said Mr Trump. 'I watched your prime minister [on Wednesday]. He wasn't so grateful.\n\n'They should be grateful to us. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.'\n\nHe also mocked Mr Macron, who on Tuesday had given a tough speech against 'bullies' while wearing Top Gun-style aviator sunglasses because of an eye condition.\n\n'I watched him [on Wednesday] with those beautiful sunglasses,' Mr Trump said. 'What the hell happened?'\n\nHe then impersonated the French president's accent, saying, 'I watched him sort of be tough' – before relaying how he had forced Mr Macron and other European leaders back down over pharmaceutical prices, a clear warning over Greenland. 'I actually like him,' he said of Mr Macron. 'Hard to believe, isn't it?'\n\nHe then attacked Switzerland in a similar vein, saying 'they make beautiful watches' but were paying 'nothing' when they exported Rolexes to the US.\n\nHe warned that he could put tariffs back up to 39 per cent on Swiss firms but 'I don't want to hurt people'.\n\nIn a bizarre conclusion to his speech, Mr Trump said he had wanted to renovate America's 'great big gorgeous' battleships from the Second World War until he was told modern ones are '100 times more powerful'.\n\nTurning to the home front, the President said he was 'cutting crime down to nothing' in the US before turning his ire on 'Somalian bandits' – another favourite refrain.\n\nReferring to alleged fraud by the Somali diaspora in Minnesota, the state presided over by Democratic vice-president nominee Tim Walz, he said: 'How did they go into Minnesota and steal all that money?\n\n'You know, they're pirates. They're good pirates, but we shoot them out of the water just like we shoot the drug boats out.","summary":"Drawing heavily on the Second World War, he said his country had saved the 'big beautiful piece of ice' from Germany before the 'stupid' US 'gave it back' to Denmark, who should be 'grateful'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15486265/Trump-worlds-leaders-Greenland-buy-island-warning-Nato-allies.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/22/00/105717147-0-image-m-24_1769040889274.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/01/21/1333405427957415496/640x360_MP4_1333405427957415496.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:23:23","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.025},{"id":395049164,"title":"Gobernadora evita fijar postura clara sobre Groenlandia ante preguntas sobre Trump  - Puerto Rico Tribune –","text":"MADRID, España – La gobernadora de Puerto Rico, Jenniffer González Colón, evitó fijar una postura concreta al ser cuestionada sobre su opinión en relación a Groenlandia y las recientes expresiones del presidente de Estados Unidos Donald Trump dirigidas a presionar la compra del territorio a Dinamarca.\n\nDurante un intercambio con periodistas, la mandataria ofreció respuestas de carácter general sobre la política internacional de Estados Unidos y la importancia de los intereses estratégicos del país, sin entrar en detalles específicos sobre Groenlandia ni sobre si coincide o discrepa de las posturas de Trump. \n\nAl abordar la pregunta, la gobernadora señaló que en asuntos de política exterior y seguridad nacional existen “elementos que usted y yo no tenemos a la mano” y que pueden llevar a decisiones que no son evidentes para el público.

He also hinted at consequences if his ambitions were thwarted.\n\n“People thought I ‌would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting.\n\nHe announced afterwards on his Truth Social platform that he had arrived at a “framework of a future deal” with respect to claiming Greenland, after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe details of that framework remain unknown, but Trump agreed to lift the tariffs he had threatened to slap on European allies starting February 1.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from his Davos speech:\n\n‘Would you like me to say a few words on Greenland?’\n\nTrump opened his remarks about Greenland with an attempt at humour.\n\n“I was going to leave it out of the speech, but I think I would have been reviewed very negatively,” he quipped.\n\nAfter a lengthy critique of Denmark, which he claimed was too weak to protect Greenland, Trump repeated his key position on the territory.\n\n“We need it for strategic national security and international security. This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","url":"https://puertoricotribune.com/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech/","image":"https://puertoricotribune.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624-2HwALZ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:14:55","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pr","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395051658,"title":"Noem and Lewandowski waged campaign to oust Trump’s border leader: Sources","text":"The lengths that the officials have gone to nudge Scott toward the exit were described by two people as “evil.” The tactics, the sources said, included actions that would negatively impact the families of senior CBP staff.\n\nNoem and Lewandowski view Scott as a threat to their success atop the 260,000-person department because Scott, a federal agent of three decades, has voiced concerns about the approach the duo has taken to enforce immigration laws.\n\n“[Scott] asks questions or challenges them when they make decisions that they may not have knowledge of, or should I say, have no experience with,” the first source wrote in a text message.\n\nNoem and Lewandowski plotted to promote two Border Patrol agents viewed as loyalists who would continue the flashy, sometimes questionable tactics CBP personnel have used while assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“This is supposed to be the time that we’re supposed to be elbows to elbows and rising to the top with all the support that we have from the president, but now we have to deal with this BS instead of trying to really fix the immigration system,” said a second person.\n\nNoem and Lewandowski are not without their reasons. DHS has been under pressure from the White House to increase deportations and expeditiously install the border wall, among many other responsibilities. Getting the president’s agenda done is the priority, according to administration officials.\n\nLaw enforcement vs. politicians\n\nScott was a Border Patrol agent for 30 years and served as chief during Trump’s first term. The Senate confirmed him in June 2025. As CBP commissioner, he oversees 67,000 federal employees and the nation’s largest law enforcement agency. CBP is responsible for securing the nation’s borders, while ICE handles immigration enforcement inside the country.\n\nSources said Scott first took issue with DHS leadership because he believed Lewandowski had worked beyond his 130-day cap as a special government employee at DHS, which would render the instructions Scott gave him irrelevant.\n\nLewandowski has been in the role for a year, and all eight sources said he is very involved in daily operations. The DHS did not answer how many days Lewandowski has worked.\n\nScott was also concerned about Noem and Lewandowski’s approach to immigration enforcement. He had pushed back on how the Border Patrol could be used to help ICE because both agencies had different missions, and the optics could have a lasting, negative effect on the Border Patrol.\n\n“Noem and Lewandowski see people like Rodney Scott, Tom Homan, and Todd Lyons as threats because they carry institutional credibility that doesn’t depend on proximity to power or press,” a fourth person said.\n\nThe DHS and ICE have been under intense pressure from the White House since last January to amp up arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants, including in a tense showdown last May, when White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller “eviscerated” ICE officials in Washington for not hitting Trump’s goal of 3,000 arrests per day.\n\nSources said it appears DHS has chosen to go after Scott’s inner circle to interfere with his work and ultimately drive him out of his position by resigning. Noem does not have the authority to fire Scott; only Trump can do so.\n\n“The most evil was when they attacked other people in retaliation to get to [Scott],” the first person said. “Corey Lewandowski said that he wanted to make it as tough on these people as possible, their families, their children, everybody.”\n\nPink slips fly\n\nScott unexpectedly received an order from DHS leadership in October to fire a senior employee with less than 30 minutes’ warning, according to three sources.\n\n“[Scott] was like, ‘Hey, listen, they missed an email. They were driving,'” the first person said. “‘We don’t care. We want them fired.’ So we’re talking government employees who have done their jobs for all these years, some may be close to retiring.”\n\nScott was told to fire Andrea Bright, CBP’s head of Human Resources, who had been in charge of hiring 8,000 new CBP employees funded by the One Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\n“She is like that gal that has worked for the government human resources for so many years that all the other agencies seek her out because she’s so smart,” said the first person. “She was the one at CBP who was responsible for moving some of those Border Patrol officials to ICE to take over those field offices.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported in October that DHS was planning to move lower-ranking Border Patrol agents to leadership positions at ICE. Scott was accused of slow-rolling that effort, though those aware of it said the pace was not in his control and was affected by the speed of the White House Office of Personnel Management.\n\nAbout a month ago, Scott learned that his chief of staff, James Kernochan, had been abruptly moved to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nScott’s deputy, John Modlin, who had previously been the head of Border Patrol in Tucson, Arizona, was given seven days to decide whether to resign, retire, or relocate his family to Boston for an unrelated homeland security job.\n\n“I don’t think for one minute Donald Trump knows that a 30-year veteran of the Border Patrol who grinded out the whole entirety of the Biden administration, most of it in Washington, is getting treated like he just walked in off a f****** bus,” said a fourth person. “He’s not some schlub.”\n\nCBP’s Executive Assistant Commissioner of Enterprise Services Ntina Cooper, an award-winning government employee who personally briefed Trump on border wall plans, was also let go.\n\nThe DHS-aligned source said Scott “overpromised and underdelivered” on installing the border wall quickly, saying that progress had been “incredibly slow.”\n\n“When the promise of building two miles in a week is underdelivered on … pressure starts to come from the White House,” the same person said.\n\nThe Trump administration installed 20 miles of wall in its first year, compared to none being built in new areas of the border 30 months into the president’s first term.\n\nHalf of the wall installed thus far was funded through the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which CBP could not spend until September. The other half came from unused money from fiscal 2018, which two sources said Noem did not know was available for use.\n\nThe same official who defended Noem and Lewandowski said the border was secured before Scott was confirmed in his position in June, largely by the Coast Guard and Department of War assets.\n\nCBP data shows that illegal immigrant arrests at the southern border did drop to below 10,000 per month in many of the first six months of 2025, down from 100,000 to 250,000 arrests monthly under Biden. Given that the border went from a crisis state to quiet, agents have been sent nationwide to help ICE.\n\nNew leaders brought in\n\nIn an internal memo obtained by the Washington Examiner, Scott told senior officials across the agency in December about his new deputy, whom the DHS had selected for him. The new appointee was Joseph Mazzara, previously special counsel to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whom Noem later tapped to serve as acting general counsel at DHS headquarters.\n\nAll matters were now to go through Scott’s deputy commissioner, rather than him, sources said the DHS told Scott.\n\nScott also shared that three new officials would move into his office, none of whom he had selected.\n\nLast week, a senior CBP official, Steve Schorr, was abruptly fired.\n\n“[Scott] told him to do something, and one of those new three folks told him that nothing is to leave that office till it goes through them [even though they are ranked below him]. So they fired him — they guy that’s a year away from retirement,” said the fourth person.\n\nSeven sources said they anticipate that if Scott resigns or Trump is convinced by Noem and Lewandowski to fire him, DHS will move Michael Banks, the national chief of the Border Patrol, to take over as CBP commissioner. Banks had retired from the Border Patrol as a GS-14, below the rank required to oversee it.\n\nBanks has strong ties to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who told the Washington Examiner in an interview last week that his work on the border with Banks was a leading reason Trump won in 2024, suggesting close ties between Texas and the Trump administration.\n\n“After he was elected, Trump called me and thanked me for what I did in the busing program because he said it shined a white hot spotlight on a very important issue, and suddenly he was able to gain traction on that issue, and that was one pivotal reason why he was elected to be president,” Abbott said.\n\nIn place of Banks, those involved anticipate Noem and Lewandowski want to push Gregory Bovino to be Border Patrol chief. Bovino, the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, regional leader was tapped last June to oversee a temporary surge of agents into Los Angeles. \n\nFive people said Noem made that decision and told Bovino he would report directly to her, an unprecedented move to have Bovino go around Scott and Border Patrol’s national chief, Mike Banks. The DHS and CBP did not address or dispute this point when asked for comment.\n\nBovino has led Border Patrol to other cities and is currently in Minneapolis.\n\nA united front\n\nWhen asked for comment on the list of concerns that sources shared, the White House, DHS, and agencies shared similar statements that maintained Trump’s team was united in its mission.\n\n“This is one team and we have one fight to secure the homeland. President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country,” the DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Everyone is on the same page: the President’s page. Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, Todd Lyons, Corey Lewandowski, Rodney Scott, Gregory Bovino, and Mike Banks are patriots who wake up every day to make this country and its people safer.”\n\nICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said Lewandowski “has been a force in helping” federal law enforcement and Noem “is the most effective” DHS secretary in history.\n\n“The President’s entire immigration and homeland security team – including Secretary Noem and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott – are on the same page and have worked seamlessly together to deliver on the President’s agenda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social on Monday praising Scott for a “great interview,”, a move that was met with relief among those who spoke with the Washington Examiner. DHS and CBP personnel who shared information anonymously, as they are not permitted to speak with the press, said they fear being “polygraphed” by the secretary’s team upon publication of the story and that DHS would search for those who spoke out.\n\nTRUMP’S BORDER SECURITY MEASURES GO FAR BEYOND A WALL. HERE’S WHAT THEY ENTAIL\n\nScott was asked about the claims in an email. In a statement sent from CBP, Scott focused on the results of the Trump administration.\n\n“Under President Trump, U.S. Border Czar Homan, and Secretary Noem, we have delivered the most secure border in American history,” Scott said. “We are operating with the President’s vision and innovative and efficient execution, not the old ways. We are all working to implement the President’s agenda.”","summary":"EXCLUSIVE —&#160;Senior Trump administration officials, including a Cabinet member, tried to force out President&#160;Donald Trump’s&#160;top border official over disagreements about how to reach the president’s deportation goals&#160;and ethical concerns,&#160;eight&#160;sources alleged during conversations with the&#160;Washington Examiner.

In what was his only on-camera statement, Trump described Modi as a “fantastic man” and a “friend,” signaling a positive personal rapport between the two leaders. When asked about the prospects for a trade deal, Trump assured, “We are going to have a good deal.”Earlier this month, Trump linked India’s trade treatment to its purchases of Russian oil. He claimed that New Delhi had reduced imports due to US pressure, noting, “They wanted to make me happy. Basically, Modi is a very good man. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy.” The US President also warned that India could face swift trade consequences if it failed to align with Washington’s stance on Russian energy, saying, “We do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly. And it would be very bad for them.” India, however, has denied making any assurances to curb Russian oil imports, emphasizing that its energy decisions are guided by national interest and price stability rather than external pressure.Trade ties between India and the United States remain under strain. The Trump administration currently imposes tariffs of up to 50% on most Indian exports, with penalties linked to India’s engagement with Russia and its participation in the BRICS grouping. In response, India has introduced retaliatory duties on selected US agricultural imports. Key issues remain unresolved as Washington continues to press India to open its agricultural markets an area New Delhi considers sensitive and non-negotiable. Simultaneously, Trump has linked tariff relief to India’s energy policy, warning that further penalties could follow if Russian oil imports continue. Despite these ongoing tensions, his remarks about Modi suggest a personal and professional relationship that may influence the course of the trade negotiations.Trump’s praise for Modi highlights a personal rapport amid ongoing trade disputes, signaling cautious optimism for India-US agreements.","url":"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/donald-trump-calls-pm-modi-fantastic-friend-and-suggests-trade-breakthroughcould-this-end-months-of-tariff-tensions-between-india-us/articleshow/127027684.html","image":"https://staticimg.publishstory.co/thumb/127027959.cms?imgsize=317110&width=1280&height=720&resizemode=8","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:09:48","author":"Nancy Jaiswal","authors":["Nancy Jaiswal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.048},{"id":395051018,"title":"Fire scare at Davos as Congress Centre evacuated: Is Trump affected?

The fire is believed to have broken out in a wooden hut near the hotel complex housing the conference centre, though the exact cause of the incident has not yet been disclosed.\n\nItalian journalist Lilli Gruber, who was inside the venue at the time, described tense scenes as people were asked to leave immediately.\n\n“We are outside the Congress Centre, we have all been evacuated. We left all our things inside because there seems to be a fire in a hotel nearby. There are helicopters flying overhead, it' s full of firefighters,\" she told local media.\n\nSmoke divers were also seen operating near the main WEF venue, while emergency workers were deployed outside a nearby hotel where civilians appeared to be undergoing an evacuation. Helicopters were observed flying overhead as firefighters secured the area.\n\nA live broadcast on Italian channel La7TV was briefly disrupted amid the evacuation. One of the network’s reporters said, “There are helicopters flying overhead, it’s full of firefighters, and there’s an evacuation emergency underway.” The outlet reported that a fire had broken out at a nearby hotel.\n\nFox News reporter Edward Lawrence later confirmed that the evacuation had ended, posting video of emergency crews at the scene.\n\n\"Fire crews in Davos checked it out and ended the evacuation. We are back for my live [report],\" Lawrence wrote on X, adding that crews were investigating the source of a smell that caused people in the area to begin coughing.\n\nA White House official said the incident did not affect US President Donald Trump, who is attending the WEF. Another official confirmed that Trump had left the Congress Centre earlier in the evening and was not impacted by the evacuation.\n\nThe incident came just hours after Trump delivered a closely watched speech at the forum and met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, during which he announced progress on a long-term framework deal related to Greenland.\n\n“It’s a deal that everybody’s very happy with,\" Trump told reporters. “It’s a long-term deal.

There's a massive opportunity","text":"One of the last things my late father did, before his death aged 89, was to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nAfter years of scepticism, and not fully understanding what Bitcoin was, he grasped how important cryptocurrency is going to be.\n\nIt isn’t a flash in the pan, it’s not a financial bubble – it is now a credible alternative to gold and the stock market. My father, as he had been throughout his life, was ahead of the game.\n\nHe saw the implications faster than most people. But this is going to be the year when millions of ordinary investors catch up, when the general public stops sniggering and starts paying attention. Crypto is going mainstream.\n\nThat word, ‘cryptocurrency’, is one of the things that has held it back. For a start, Bitcoin and similar tokens are not the kind of currency you carry in your pocket as cash. You’ll probably never go to the supermarket and pay with a cryptocoin.\n\nCrypto, in most cases, isn’t cash – it’s wealth. There’s a big difference. Think of it like this. Imagine you own a £1 million apartment, and the kitchen needs a refit. You hire a builder who charges you £10,000. You obviously don’t pay him by transferring 1 per cent of the property to him. That would be a terrible transaction – even though the value will be the same.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is the equivalent of buying property, not like putting money aside to pay for expenses. Like property, it works best as a long-term commitment.\n\nIn financial jargon, it’s ‘a store of value’ in a ‘digital asset’.\n\nThat phrase ‘digital asset’ confuses a lot of people. It implies something invisible, a commodity that exists only as a stream of 1s and 0s on a computer hard drive.\n\nUnlike gold, you can never hold a -Bitcoin in your hands or cash it in at a High Street dealer.\n\nFor most people, gold has little practical use other than as jewellery, but everyone knows it is valuable. That’s why, at times of international tension, its value soars: the price of gold has risen from around £3,300 to more than £3,500 per ounce since the start of this year.\n\nCryptocurrency, of course, doesn’t have the same physical solidity. Many people are hesitant to invest in it for that reason. But think about it: we all trust digital assets, not just as -investments in our ISAs, but for everyday banking.\n\nAlmost everyone manages their finances on phone apps and banking websites. Few of us queue up in bank branches with a cheque book or a bag of coins any more. It’s all done on a smartphone. In other words, digitally. Even cashpoints are largely redundant, even if many lament the loss.\n\nIn the same way, investors who put their money into gold don’t usually have bars and ingots around the house; they have digital records of their investments.\n\nYou might own shares in a house-building company, but that doesn’t mean there are bricks with your name on them or even a physical paper share -certificate. It’s all digital.\n\nThe main cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tether and XRP – are as solid as banking apps and some of them have been around as long. They are no longer the enfants terribles of the financial markets.\n\nHorror stories used to abound: of investors who stored the password to their crypto account on a laptop or USB stick. If that device was lost or erased, they forfeited their access to their coins... for ever. But that’s no longer how it works.\n\nIn 2024, cryptocurrency went mainstream as the US securities regulator, the SEC, recognised Bitcoin as a commodity, and now regulated vehicles called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the most common method of accessing cryptocurrency.\n\nIt’s hacker-proof, audited, efficient – and boring. And last month England, Wales and Northern Ireland passed a law designating digital assets as personal property. Crypto has, it seems, started to grow up.\n\nFor many investors, of course, it has already offered extremely lucrative returns. Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in the world by far in the past 15 years. Even in the past five, it has outperformed gold, despite the latter’s recent meteoric rise.\n\nIf you’d bought $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2011, when the value per coin was $1, your holding would be worth about $6,765,500 today (roughly £5 million). The overall global value of all digital assets is currently about $3.2 trillion (£2,370 billion).\n\nDriven by Donald Trump’s support, last summner the value of one Bitcoin went as high as $120,000 – and has currently settled at just under $90,000.\n\nBut such stellar leaps are part of the image problem it needs to shed. As long as it’s seen as a Get Rich Quick scheme, the general public will stay away.\n\nCryptocurrencies might look like Concorde but the reality is they’re more like a budget airline: unfashionable and prone to glitches, but relentlessly practical and ruthlessly focused on getting the job done. And like budget airlines, they will come to dominate the market.\n\nThey are, in short, the future of finance, and this success will come from being unglamorous and reliable.\n\nJust as no one needs to know how hedge funds work to save into an ISA, it isn’t necessary to understand what a ‘blockchain’ is, or a ‘non-fungible token’, before investing in digital assets.\n\nBut one aspect of this new technology is important to grasp. Many critics of crypto complain that creating it uses too much energy, because so many computers have to chug away, performing billions of calculations, in order to ‘mine’ each coin and maintain the network. Rows of warehouses, crammed with mainframes work night and day, consuming vast amounts of power to do so, all over the world. Bitcoin alone uses about as much -electricity annually as Poland.\n\nInstead of treating that as a disaster, we need to see it as a massive opportunity. Bitcoin is doing something that until now has been impossible – it takes energy and turns it into portable wealth.\n\nGold can’t do that. Gold just sits there, a lump of metal. Crypto creation can harness all the world’s excess and unwanted energy, the power that can’t be stored in batteries or consumed by the national grid.\n\nIn Texas during 2024, for example, a massive eight terawatts of energy generated by wind and solar power was wasted, because it wasn’t immediately needed. That’s enough to keep Transport for London, and all its Tube trains, running for five years.\n\nBrazil’s wastage was even worse. Wind turbines whizz around, solar panels heat up, and a lot of that energy cannot be translated fast enough into the grid to be used. The demand isn’t there. But it could be, if we funnelled it all into crypto-creation.\n\nGlobally, tens of billions of dollars of ‘clean’ energy evaporate each year because grids cannot cope. Crypto can absorb that and turn it into something with permanent value.\n\nBest of all, in the case of -Bitcoin, it is truly international, controlled by no government, and devoid of politics. This is an investment that cannot be devalued by central banks. Local economies might collapse, inflation might run riot in failing countries, but cryptocurrency is elevated beyond all that.\n\nThis is the point in its evolution when I would urge small investors to consider buying in. But that doesn’t mean going all-in. It’s not about punting your house, it’s about acknowledging that a 5 per cent allocation of your portfolio offers protection against financial pitfalls such as inflation, currency devaluation and government blunders.\n\nIt’s like an insurance policy – you don’t purchase one because you’re expecting an imminent disaster, but because it would be foolish not to.\n\nCryptocurrency is going to change the world, just as computers began to do 40 years ago. Anyone who saw the potential in Microsoft or Apple in the 1980s, or Facebook and Google in the 2000s, was making a canny investment.\n\nWe have the opportunity to do the same now. That $3.2trillion of digital assets could easily be worth $10trillion in three to five years. That’s just the law of big numbers, and it’s a realistic prospect.\n\nWill Nutting is the founder of Nutstuff, a twice weekly investor newsletter.

To curb soaring residential utility prices driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, the plan, if enacted, will force tech giants to pay their own way by funding new power-generation projects through emergency auctions.\n\nThe move is intended to stabilize costs for consumers but hurts independent power providers like Constellation Energy and Vistra, whose stocks fell on news of price caps. Meanwhile, power infrastructure leader GE Vernova (GEV 2.48%) surged on the news, as it is well positioned to provide gas turbines and grid solutions for the buildout.\n\nGE Vernova is up 77% over the last year, but it could still be a smart investment given this recent news. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nSurging demand is fueling unprecedented growth for GE Vernova\n\nGE Vernova provides technology and services for the electric grid. Its equipment includes gas, steam, and wind turbines, along with power grid infrastructure, and it generates nearly one-quarter of the world's electricity. Investors have piled into GE Vernova thanks to incredibly strong demand for its gas turbines and grid equipment, driven by the growing use of AI and the data centers that power it.\n\nIn the third quarter, gas power orders increased 50% from last year while equipment orders more than doubled. GE Vernova received orders for 20 units of its heavy-duty gas turbines, which are huge machines designed to run continuously and provide baseload power, and 13 orders for its HA turbines, its more advanced high-efficiency units.\n\nWhat has investors bullish is its growing backlog and capacity commitments. Demand has been so high that customers are paying GE Vernova just to hold a spot in the manufacturing line. It has 33 gigawatts (GW) of firm orders and another 29 GW in slot reservation agreements. And since demand is outpacing supply, it can charge higher prices for future slots.\n\nMore energy infrastructure is bullish for GE Vernova\n\nGE Vernova has already enjoyed robust demand, and the recent news from the Trump administration should give it a further boost. The administration is looking to make hyperscalers pay for new power plants through emergency auctions and fund their own energy needs. The goal is to prevent tech companies from buying up all available electricity to maintain stable, affordable prices for households.\n\nThe auction would support the construction of about $15 billion in new power plants, a White House official told Bloomberg. The plan proposes offering developers 15-year contracts, giving utilities a green light to place huge equipment orders, and tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms would be responsible for paying over the duration of the contracts, whether they use the power or not.\n\nAnalyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies said that GE Vernova is the \"clearest winner\" from this potential market intervention, since it is a top supplier of the power generation equipment and grid solutions required to meet these capacity needs. Investors should bear in mind that the administration and governors signed a \"statement of principles\" that isn't legally binding but could serve as a strategic roadmap and be a step toward alleviating pressure on the power grid.\n\nA smart stock to buy for the future of domestic energy\n\nGE Vernova's upside is from natural gas buildout, which should serve as a tailwind for years to come. But another important part of its business is its services business, where it earns recurring revenue from maintaining, upgrading, and repairing its massive fleet of assets. In the third quarter, it earned $1.74 billion from power equipment, while power services generated $3 billion in revenue.\n\nThis aspect of its business provides visibility into future earnings over the next decade and beyond. Right now, GE Vernova has a total remaining performance obligation for services of $81.2 billion. Of this backlog, 53% will be recognized within the next five years, and 91% will be recognized over the next 15 years.\n\nWith tailwinds from growing turbine purchases and years of service revenue from its massive installed base, GE Vernova is an excellent stock that can benefit from this booming demand for years to come.","summary":"Recent news from the Trump Administration sent GE Vernova soaring last week.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/21/is-ge-vernova-the-smartest-investment-you-can-make/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F852014%2Fpower-lines-out-in-a-rural-setting-getty.jpg&w=1200&op=resize","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:05:00","author":"Courtney Carlsen","authors":["Courtney Carlsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":395047410,"title":"I'm doctor who treated Dick Cheney and Donald Trump's mental health needs to be probed now'","text":"A cardiologist who previously oversaw former Vice President Dick Cheney's medical care has urged Congress to scrutinise President Donald Trump's mental fitness. Dr Jonathan Reiner, a veteran heart specialist and prominent public figure, justified his appeal by pointing to public remarks and correspondence from the president which he believes raise \"serious concern\". His call came shortly after Trump released a statement to European leaders outlining his personal views on America's foreign policy goals. In a fresh letter addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump linked his failure to secure the Nobel Peace Prize to his political ambitions regarding Greenland . He wrote: \"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America\", reports the Mirror US . Trump continued by arguing the annexation would be crucial for worldwide security: \"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States.\" \"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\" Taking to X, Dr Reiner responded to the correspondence by suggesting it represented a red flag. \"This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness,\" he wrote. Dr Reiner added: \"Tonight the Pres endorsed a primary challenger to Sen Bill Cassidy. So it seems endorsing RFK Jr for HHS Sec wasn't enough to win the President's support. Dr. Cassidy's legacy will be more Hep B infections, more measles deaths, and a decimated CDC, FDA, and NIH. Self before country.\" The doctor's worries about Trump's health and capacity to govern aren't exactly new. Earlier this year, he responded to Trump's remarks about his own wellbeing, when he revealed to the Wall Street Journal that he routinely takes a higher dose of aspirin to thin his blood. Speaking to CNN, Dr Reiner said: \"That actually makes no sense. First of all, when we use any kind of anticoagulant, medications to prevent clotting, those don't thin the blood. It's not like changing something from gumbo to chicken soup. It doesn't make it thinner. It makes you less likely to clot.\" Throughout his political journey, Trump has consistently maintained he's in good health, a claim backed by his doctor, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, who has confirmed his regular scans \"reveal no abnormalities.\"","summary":"Dr Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist who cared for former Vice President Dick Cheney, has called for a congressional inquiry into President Donald Trump's fitness for office after concerning public statements","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/im-doctor-who-treated-dick-36587342","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36587341.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Departs-White-House-En-Route-To-Florida-For-The-Weekend.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 01:00:00","author":"Maria Leticia Gomes","authors":["Maria Leticia Gomes"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.019},{"id":395046164,"title":"‘I won’t use force’ for Greenland: Key takeaways from Trump’s Davos speech  - Trinidad Tribune – Latest","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said he would not take over Greenland by ​force, but he stuck firmly to his demand for control over the Danish territory during a speech in Davos, Switzerland. He also hinted at consequences if his ambitions were thwarted.\n\n“People thought I ‌would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting.\n\nHe announced afterwards on his Truth Social platform that he had arrived at a “framework of a future deal” with respect to claiming Greenland, after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe details of that framework remain unknown, but Trump agreed to lift the tariffs he had threatened to slap on European allies starting February 1.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from his Davos speech:\n\n‘Would you like me to say a few words on Greenland?’\n\nTrump opened his remarks about Greenland with an attempt at humour.\n\n“I was going to leave it out of the speech, but I think I would have been reviewed very negatively,” he quipped.\n\nAfter a lengthy critique of Denmark, which he claimed was too weak to protect Greenland, Trump repeated his key position on the territory.\n\n“We need it for strategic national security and international security. This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624-uUyj4G.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:55:35","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395046304,"title":"Dana Bash Recalibrates Both Sides of ICE Protest, and Sen.

That sounds far more intentional than an accidental slip-up.\n\nNews Avoidance Syndrome – PUBLIC BROADCASTING SERVICE\n\nReally?

At PBS, they typify the lack of real interest.

So it seems more than revealing to look at how the network addressed this major disturbance in town on The PBS News Hour.\n\nWith a lengthy report on the actions in Minneapolis, here is a rundown of how many details the show provided about that BLM mob that stormed the church during Sunday services:\n\nMentions of Black Lives Matter: 0Mentions of Don Lemon: 0Mentions of the federal laws that were violated: 0Amount of sentences the field reporter dedicated to the incursion: ONE\n\nSeriously.

Keir Starmer has finally discovered a backbone and stood up to Donald Trump.\n\n‘I will not yield,’ he declared today. ‘Britain will not yield on our principles and values about the future of Greenland under threats of tariffs, and that is my clear position.’\n\nTo be equally clear, this dramatic riposte wasn’t delivered to Trump face to face.\n\nSir Keir instead chose to deliver it at Prime Minister’s Questions, flanked by the massed ranks of his own MPs. And when pressed by Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, he quickly reverted to type, mouthing the well-worn platitudes about the importance of maintaining the Special Relationship.\n\nBut credit where it’s due. Our Prime Minister finally brought the fire.\n\nAnd this may yet prove to be more than a one-off. Yesterday I was talking to one of Starmer’s allies following Trump’s savage attack on his Chagos deal.\n\n‘Trump will damage the Conservatives and the populists in the UK and Europe, lots of whom seem to have had their brains melted into thinking the average Brit relishes seeing outsiders criticise their country as much as they do,’ they claimed.\n\nKemi Badenoch, for one, has not had her brain melted. Indeed, she’s been having a good week. The polls show the voters responding positively to her pre-emptive sacking of Tory turncoat Robert Jenrick. And the defection of a second MP to Reform’s ranks ruffled few Westminster feathers.\n\nBut she is in danger of repeating the dangerous mistake currently being made by many on the Right. Which is to view Donald Trump as the enemy of their enemy – Starmer – and so to treat him as their friend.\n\nAt PMQs, Badenoch thought it would be a clever ruse to use Trump’s new-found criticism of the Chagos policy to bait him.\n\nBut for the first time in several weeks, Starmer was able to turn the tables. Trump had attacked him over Chagos ‘for the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain in relation to my values and principles on the future of Greenland,’ he fired back. ‘He wants me to yield on my position, and I’m not going to… Given that was his express purpose, I’m surprised the Leader of the Opposition has jumped on the bandwagon.’\n\nThe reality is that Starmer is right. Trump couldn’t point to Chagos on a map. He has zero understanding or appreciation of the strategic implications of the deal that Britain has struck with Mauritius.\n\nHe was indeed simply using the issue as a stick to beat his uppity ally for failing to endorse his Greenland adventurism.\n\nAnd the fact that Badenoch couldn’t recognise that points to a wider issue – and the point at hand. Since his re-election, many on the Right have viewed Trump as some sort of political hero over the water.\n\nHe would help turn the tide on assaults on free speech. He would help prosecute the argument on immigration. He would finally vanquish the effete, woke, liberal elite.\n\nBut as Starmer is belatedly starting to recognise, there is political capital to be earned from starting to define yourself against the Godfather of the Maga movement – rather than attempt to ingratiate yourself with him.\n\nTo people focused on paying the bills and keeping food on the table, Trump has largely been an abstract, if occasionally amusing, curiosity.\n\nBut Britain can spot a bad ’un a mile off. And the President’s increasingly erratic arrogance and aggression are starting to cut through.\n\n‘It’s beginning to get pick-up in the polls,’ another Labour source told me. ‘People don’t like him. And they don’t like British politicians associating with him.’\n\nWhat Trump’s UK groupies in Reform and elsewhere need to realise is he appals most Britons – which means being associated with him is toxic.\n\nThere is significant lingering suspicion of the EU. But if the choice presented in a future referendum was a closer embrace of Brussels or a closer embrace of Maga Washington, all bets would be off.\n\nSimilarly, Red Wall Britain is desperate for an end to the small-boat invasion, and the control of our borders. But that doesn’t mean it fancies a British version of the murderous machismo being exhibited by some of Trump’s ICE stormtroopers.\n\nAnd even if Badenoch, Nigel Farage and their allies don’t recognise the political necessity of distancing themselves from Trump, they should consider doing so for another reason. It’s the right thing.\n\nOver the past few years, a passionate debate has been raging about the true character of Britain. And Trump is now providing us with a timely litmus test of who we are as a nation.\n\nWe have always been a country that stood against bullies. We abhor arrogance. As the Brexit vote proved, we are a people with a hunger for standing on our own two feet, for redefining ourselves as a sovereign nation.\n\nSo, it’s time for our political class, collectively and unequivocally, to tell Donald Trump where to get off. This is about values – the values of the West itself.\n\nYesterday, upon his arrival at Davos, Trump launched another attempt to force his supposed allies to back his Greenland occupation.\n\n‘We won the war – we won it big. Without us you’d all be speaking German, with maybe a little bit of Japanese,’ he smirked.\n\nThis is not a man who needs a few careful words of admonition. But someone who should be told to stick his version of the Special Relationship where the sun doesn’t shine.\n\nKeir Starmer has belatedly stood up to Donald Trump. It’s time for Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage to do the same.","summary":"Stop all the clocks. Cut off the telephone.

In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports.\n\nThe deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official.\n\nBut on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee, said it was “left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals”.\n\nHe said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold “until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken”.

He also hinted at consequences if his ambitions were thwarted.\n\n“People thought I ‌would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting.\n\nHe announced afterwards on his Truth Social platform that he had arrived at a “framework of a future deal” with respect to claiming Greenland, after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe details of that framework remain unknown, but Trump agreed to lift the tariffs he had threatened to slap on European allies starting February 1.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from his Davos speech:\n\n‘Would you like me to say a few words on Greenland?’\n\nTrump opened his remarks about Greenland with an attempt at humour.\n\n“I was going to leave it out of the speech, but I think I would have been reviewed very negatively,” he quipped.\n\nAfter a lengthy critique of Denmark, which he claimed was too weak to protect Greenland, Trump repeated his key position on the territory.\n\n“We need it for strategic national security and international security. This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","url":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech/","image":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624-tcTqjt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:53:35","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"jm","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395049620,"title":"‘I won’t use force’ for Greenland: Key takeaways from Trump’s Davos speech  | Barbados Gazette –","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said he would not take over Greenland by ​force, but he stuck firmly to his demand for control over the Danish territory during a speech in Davos, Switzerland.

He also hinted at consequences if his ambitions were thwarted.\n\n“People thought I ‌would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting.\n\nHe announced afterwards on his Truth Social platform that he had arrived at a “framework of a future deal” with respect to claiming Greenland, after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe details of that framework remain unknown, but Trump agreed to lift the tariffs he had threatened to slap on European allies starting February 1.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from his Davos speech:\n\n‘Would you like me to say a few words on Greenland?’\n\nTrump opened his remarks about Greenland with an attempt at humour.\n\n“I was going to leave it out of the speech, but I think I would have been reviewed very negatively,” he quipped.\n\nAfter a lengthy critique of Denmark, which he claimed was too weak to protect Greenland, Trump repeated his key position on the territory.\n\n“We need it for strategic national security and international security. This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624-vjkSl1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:50:07","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395050280,"title":"Trump flags Greenland deal 'everybody's ⁠happy with'","text":"US President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force, while suggesting a deal's in sight to end a dispute over the Danish territory ‍that risked the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations in decades. In Davos, Switzerland, Trump backed down, for now, from weeks of rhetoric that shook the NATO alliance and risked a new global trade war. Trump had threatened at the weekend to impose rising tariffs on eight European countries' US-bound exports. But after meeting ​with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the Swiss Alpine resort, Trump said Western Arctic allies could forge a new deal over the strategic island territory of 57,000 people that satisfies his desire for a \"Golden Dome\" missile-defence system and access to critical minerals while blocking Russia and China's ambitions in the Arctic. \"It's a deal that everybody's ⁠very happy with,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \"It's a long-term deal. It's the ultimate long-term deal. It puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals.\" \"It's a deal that's forever,\" he added. Trump earlier in the day had delivered more than an hour of scolding and dismissive threats aimed at countries already unnerved by his push to seize territory from a longtime US NATO ally. European diplomats said the president's sudden shift in tone didn't resolve the dispute but helps defuse an open rift between allies as they work to sort out their differences in private. It remained unclear what kind of agreement could meet Trump's demands for outright \"ownership\" of a territory that its residents and leaders have said is not for sale. \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland,\" a NATO spokesperson said. No date or venue was ‌provided for such negotiations. \"What happens in Greenland is of absolutely no consequence to us,\" said Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking ‍to his National Security Council. Trump said on his Truth Social platform that the US and NATO had \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,\" and that \"based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.\" It was the latest in a series of reversals of major policies or threats by Trump ahead of deadlines he has imposed during his second term in office. Denmark said the issue should be handled through private diplomacy rather than on social media. \"What is crucial for us is that we get to end this with respect for the integrity and sovereignty of the kingdom (of Denmark) and the right of the Greenlandic people to self-determination,\" Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told public broadcaster DR. Rasmussen said he had spoken with Rutte but declined to provide details on what had been agreed. Trump acknowledged financial markets' discomfort with his threats and ruled out force during his speech to the World Economic Forum. \"People thought I would use force, but I don't have to use force,\" Trump said. \"I don't want to use force. I won't use force.\" The change in posture sparked buying on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index posted its biggest one-day percentage gain in two months, adding 1.16 per cent for the day. Trump's more ​hawkish comments on Greenland on Tuesday helped deliver the sharpest equities selloff in three months. Emboldened after a year in office that saw major institutions and allies bend to his will, Trump chastised Europeans on their soil on issues ranging ‍from wind power and the environment to immigration and geopolitics. He cast himself as a defender of Western values. \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones,\" Trump said. \"I love Europe and I want to see Europe go good, but it's not heading in the right direction.\" Calling Denmark \"ungrateful,\" he played down the territorial dispute as a \"small ask\" over a \"piece of ice\" ​and ​said an acquisition would be no threat to the NATO alliance, which includes Denmark and the US. \"No nation or group ​of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States,\" said Trump, who four times during the ​speech mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland. \"You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.\" His remarks drew uncomfortable looks and light laughter from the audience in Davos, but most were silent. On Thursday, Trump was expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As part of the trip, Trump was working to build support from dozens of world leaders to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts, even as diplomats ‍say it could harm the work of the United Nations.

So what was true and what wasn't?\n\n'After the war we gave Greenland back. How -stupid were we to do that? But we did it'\n\nTechnically, the US couldn't 'hand back' Greenland to Denmark after the Second World War because it never took ownership or sovereignty over the island to begin with.\n\nGreenland (which Trump repeatedly confused with Iceland throughout his speech) has remained under Danish sovereignty since the early 18th century.\n\nTrump is partially correct, however, in alluding to the period after Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark in 1940. The US assumed responsibility for Greenland's defence in a 1941 agreement with the Danish ambassador to the US. (At the time, the US was officially neutral in the war and had rejected a British plan to occupy the island.)\n\nAlthough it established numerous military bases there, making Greenland a de facto US protectorate for defence purposes, the land remained Danish territory.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE\n\n'I settled eight other wars'\n\nThe man who is still smarting that he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize is exaggerating – although time may tell by how much. Trump was involved with three ceasefires in conflicts between India and Pakistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan and Israel and Iran.\n\nHe also played a key role in achieving Israel's ceasefire with Hamas, even if peace there is hardly 'settled'. Ditto a long-standing dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over a dam on the Nile, and a confrontation between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nOther wars that he's claimed to have ended – between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and between Thailand and Cambodia – have since erupted into renewed violence.\n\nSome, like one between Albania and Azerbaijan, never began in the first place.\n\nVERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE\n\n'In 2025, for the first time in 50 years, the United States had reverse migration'\n\nAlthough some liberal economists insist this is -nothing to boast about, Trump's claim stems from a report this month by a Washington think-tank the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt found the number of people emigrating to the US compared to the number leaving the country was close to zero or even negative last year.\n\nThe last time the US experienced this phenomenon, also known as 'negative net migration', was even longer ago than Trump claimed – during the Great Depression between 1931 and 1940, according to fact-checkers at the Poynter Institute.\n\nVERDICT: TRUE\n\n'China makes almost all of the windmills and yet I haven't been able to find any wind farms in China'\n\nTrump has often repeated this claim, insisting this month that China makes turbines to 'sell them to suckers like Europe, and suckers like the United States' but don't use them themselves.\n\nIn fact, while China still relies heavily on coal, it has about 44 per cent of the world's wind farm capacity, the highest compared with any other country and nearly three times that of the US.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE\n\n'Grocery prices, energy prices, air fares, mortgage rates, rent and car payments are all coming down, and they're coming down fast'\n\nThe cost of living – not foreign affairs – is the key battleground in American politics.\n\nMortgage rates have decreased from around 7 per cent when Trump took office in January 2025 to a little over 6 per cent now. Air fares and car prices have also fallen.\n\nFood and energy prices have risen, however. Eggs, milk and bread may be cheaper – but meat, fruit and vegetables are not.\n\nConsequently, grocery prices have roughly increased at the same rate as they did during the last year of the inflation-prone Biden administration.\n\nEnergy is also significantly more expensive – nearly 7 per cent higher than a year ago – despite petrol prices having gone down.\n\nVERDICT: PARTLY TRUE\n\n'We've never gotten anything from Nato'\n\nHardly so. Ironically, the only time the alliance has invoked Article 5, stating that an attack on one member is an affront on all, was after the terror attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.\n\nNato troops – including a contingent from now-scorned Denmark – fought and died alongside US forces in Afghanistan.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama supported a 'surge' in the conflict, the number of non-US Nato troops doubled to more than 132,000 in 2011.\n\nVERDICT: FALSE","summary":"For over an hour yesterday, Donald Trump delivered a speech to leaders at Davos that was at times focused and at others resembled incoherent rambling.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15486097/TOM-LEONARD-just-Donald-Trumps-outlandish-assertions-Greenland-Nato-true.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/21/21/105715391-0-image-a-107_1769032560209.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:45:05","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":395051406,"title":"‘I won’t use force’ for Greenland: Key takeaways from Trump’s Davos speech  - Bahamas Spectator –","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said he would not take over Greenland by ​force, but he stuck firmly to his demand for control over the Danish territory during a speech in Davos, Switzerland.

That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624-hTh4PW.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:44:09","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395047412,"title":"Investigation launched at Donald Trump's Doonbeg golf resort after envelope with 'powder substance' discovered","text":"United States President Donald Trump's Irish golf resort has been declared safe after a suspicious package was discovered at the prestigious course. A security alert at US President Donald Trump 's Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Co Clare has been lifted on Wednesday, January 21 after an envelope believed to contain a powder substance was delivered to the site. A cordon was put in place at the resort over the incident and the Irish police service An Garda Siochana and the Irish Defence Forces Explosive Ordnance Disposal team responded to the incident. \"The package was subsequently deemed safe and the cordon has been lifted,\" a Garda spokesperson said. \"Investigations are ongoing.\" The US president's son, Eric Trump, stayed at the hotel after landing in Dublin on Tuesday, January 20. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump posted an aerial view of the Doonbeg site. He highlighted that it will be the venue of the Irish Golf Open later this year. The Irish Mirror reported that the 42-year-old businessman left Doonbeg early on Wednesday morning and flew to Davos in Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum. The five-star hotel was previously the target of a bomb threat, which led to a police investigation. The hotel was not evacuated during the incident. It is currently closed for winter at the time. Gardai searched the site, but found nothing suspicious. The US president and Eric Trump are currently in Davos, Switzerland, attending the World Economic Forum. The event, which runs from January 19 to January 23 is running under theme of \"A Spirit of Dialogue\". Donald Trump started his speech at the summit by saying it was great to be back among friends and a \"few enemies\". He said that \"Europe is not going in the right way,\" adding: \"I love Europe, I want to see it do good but it's not going in the right direction.\" Trump's speech at Davos comes days after he threatened tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his acquisition of Greenland. He went on to say that he is \"seeking immediate negotiations to acquire Greenland\". \"It's the US alone that can protect it so it's good and safe for Europe,\" he said. \"And that's the reason I'm seeking the immediate negotiations for the acquisition of Greenland by the US.\" \"This would not be a threat to NATO, it would greatly enhance the alliance,\" he said. \"The US has been ungracefully treated by NATO.

Thousands of officers have been deployed under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.\n\nFor years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. \n\nThat guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.\n\nMemo contradicts training materials\n\nThe memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to the whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. \n\nNew ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo's guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure. \n\nIt is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. \n\nThe memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: \"Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\"\n\nThe memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be. \n\nWhen asked about the memo, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had \"full due process and a final order of removal.\"\n\nShe said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person's arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have \"recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,\" without elaborating. \n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person's home since the memo was issued relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.\n\nICE now targeting Maine \n\nThe Trump administration is now targeting its mass deportation campaign on Maine, a state with relatively few residents in the U.S. illegally but with a notable presence of African refugees in its largest cities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security named the operation \"Catch of the Day,\" an apparent play on Maine's seafood industry.\n\nReports of a surge in immigration arrests have struck fear in immigrant communities of Portland and Lewiston and prompted backlash from Gov. Janet Mills and other Democrats, including a refusal to help immigration agents obscure the identity of their vehicles by issuing undercover licence plates. \n\n\"We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,\" Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said, adding that the decision reflects her disgust over the tactics of immigration officers elsewhere. \n\nCitizens have formed networks to alert neighbourhoods to the presence of ICE agents and bring food to immigrants in their homes. Portland's superintendent said the school district is developing an online learning plan for its students, more than half of whom aren't white. Many businesses have posted signs saying ICE agents aren't welcome. \n\nPortland Mayor Mark Dion said Wednesday that members of his community see immigration officers' presence in the city as \"unpredictable and a threat to their families.\"\n\n\"While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach,\" Dion said at a news conference where he was joined by other local officials. \n\n\"This council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, we stand with them.\"\n\nICE didn't respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans for Maine, where increased enforcement began on Tuesday, according to Homeland Security. \n\n\"We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state. On the first day of operations, we arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child,\" McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nA message seeking comment from U.S. Customs and Border Protection was not immediately returned.\n\nCourt lifts restrictions on ICE tactics in Minnesota \n\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, an appeals court suspended a decision that restricts immigration officers' aggressive tactics in Minnesota.\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was persuaded to freeze a judge's ruling that bars officers from using tear gas and other steps against peaceful protesters while the administration pursues an appeal. Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota's Twin Cities, began in early December.\n\nAn injunction ordered last week by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez harms \"officers' ability to protect themselves and the public in very dangerous circumstances,\" lawyers for the government argued.\n\nMinnesota remains a major focus of immigration sweeps by agencies under Homeland Security. State and local officials who oppose the effort were served with federal grand jury subpoenas Tuesday for records that might suggest they were trying to stifle enforcement.\n\nMother-of-three Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer in her car in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.","summary":"Federal immigration officers are asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, according to an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press, as the Trump administration prepares to ramp up immigration enforcement in Maine.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-immigration-enforcement-ice-no-warrants-9.7055362?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/8add4058-3140-45bb-ae75-8be6d41c850b,1769037178574/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%28173%2C246%2C2736%2C1539%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:36:03","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395046218,"title":"House approves repeal of 20-year mining ban near Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness","text":"Federal lawmakers have taken a major step toward opening a tract of land near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness to mining.

That’s not the Casa Rosada speaking and it confirms what we already knew since last year, when Donald Trump returned to the White House with Javier Milei serving as President here.\n\nThe construction of the link between the two world leaders could be said to have begun beforehand when Milei, already installed in Balcarce 50, made a series of undisguised efforts to ingratiate himself with a Trump campaigning against the Democratic administration.\n\nThe La Libertad Avanza leader’s bet paid off and Argentina’s automatic alignment with Washington has brought great benefits to Milei – for now.\n\nThe United States guaranteed key financial stability, along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as the pre-midterm clouds gathered last October.\n\nBlindly following US foreign policy has saved Milei’s government from having to debate or think out any of its own. This could be right or wrong; it is what it is. Backing everything Trump decides or says regarding the world is the line.\n\nThe US State Department spokesperson indeed emphatically highlighted “the alignment around shared priorities of economic growth, democratic government and regional stability,” underlining, in case of any doubt, that “the United States praises the continuous leadership of Milei and the efforts of his government to boost Argentina’s role as a constructive partner via market-oriented reforms, greater global participation and cooperation in security matters.”\n\nWe should return to an earlier question: Will it work out well? And we could add: For whom? And for what?\n\nOver and above the key financial aspect of US aid, as far as the productive sector goes and for international trade, the economies of the two countries compete more than complement each other. It remains to be seen how those characteristics pan out in the delayed trade agreement pre-announced in late 2025. That’s without even mentioning Trump’s fight to the finish with China,one of Argentina’s main trade and investment partners. One point here about Milei – without any yelling, song and dance or uncomfortable visits, he is consolidating his ties with Beijing.\n\nThe most delicate question perhaps looks remote. Argentina has accompanied Trump’s exits from international organisations, snubbed an invaded Ukraine despite welcoming its president at Milei’s inauguration, backed Washington's military intervention in Venezuela and now looks expectantly at Trump’s latest whim, annexing Greenland, to the indignation of Europe (our brand-new trade partners via the agreement with Mercosur).\n\nThe U-turn is completed by Milei’s decision to agree to joining Trump’s Board of Peace, the multinational organisation arbitrarily assembled by the Republican leader to reconstruct the Gaza Strip and guarantee its security (and more).\n\nThe remote can sometimes become up close in unexpected places. The last time Argentina followed the controversial and spasmodic US approaches to the Middle East, it was hit by two sanguinary terrorist attacks. Never clarified or tried but with Iran always under suspicion. In more recent days Argentina’s decision to brand an Iranian military force as a terrorist organisation motivated a threat of reprisals from its régime. \n\nTrump’s dangerous whims could drag Milei and our country into unforeseen – and unnecessary – conflicts.","summary":"The relationship between the United States and Argentina is at a peak given the empathy between Trump and Milei. Argentina’s now-automatic alignment with Washington has given the government financial support and stability, but also prevented it from defining its own foreign policy agenda.

And we made it very, very clear that this is not in the interests of the (Danish) kingdom.”\n\nWithin a day, European members of the NATO alliance were promising troops for a Danish-led military force to strengthen the giant island’s weak defenses against the alleged threat of invasion by other, more distant conquerors: Russia (around 6,000 ice-choked kilometers from Nuuk to Murmansk) and China (about three times as far, Nuuk to Shanghai).\n\nOddly, not even the keenest strategist looking for plausible reasons to buy more submarines or whatever had hit upon this particular excuse before. But that was Donald Trump’s pretext for taking Greenland: “The US needs Greenland for the purpose of national security…It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building.”\n\nHardly anybody actually believes this. The ‘Golden Dome’ is a proposed space-based anti-missile defense system that, like former president Ronald Reagan’s fanciful and ultimately abandoned “Star Wars” project would protect the United States from attack by nuclear missiles.\n\nIt consists of an early-warning system based on a constellation of satellites in orbit and interceptors, also space-based, to shoot down incoming missiles. It would cost around a trillion dollars, but no contract has been signed yet, even for initial design work. Trump would probably be dead long before such a system became operational, if it ever did.\n\nHowever, it does let Trump claim that he is ‘protecting US national security’, which plays much better domestically than ‘seizing rare earth minerals’. Average American voters will never know that bases in Greenland are completely irrelevant to a space-based system, so they might go along with it.\n\nWhy is Trump himself so obsessed with Greenland? The best guess in NATO circles is that it’s an extension of his old mania for putting his name on every hotel he owned. He can’t actually put his name on Greenland, but it would get him in American history books as the man who increased the extent of the US by a quarter. As simple and as stupid as that.\n\nNATO’s response and more tariffs from Trump. NATO’s European members realized they had to react to the verbal beating that the Danish and Greenland foreign ministers got at the hand of Trump’s two principal consiglieri, J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio.\n\nMoreover, they had to do it within the framework of Trump’s pretended Russo-Chinese threat to Greenland, or else openly recognise him as an adversary.\n\nSo, in two days, they scraped together a small ‘reconnaissance force’ from eight European NATO members (France, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) and sent it to Greenland to figure out what kind of European forces would be a convincing deterrent to hypothetical Russian and Chinese invaders.\n\nIt didn’t work. Rather than thank the Europeans for finally picking up the load, Donald Trump blasted them for having “journeyed to Greenland for purposes unknown.”\n\nHe warned that “these countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.”\n\nIn fact, they were trying to take away Trump’s pretext for invasion, and they were severely punished for it.\nIn the same Truth Social post last Saturday, he imposed 10 per cent tariffs on all the countries that contributed to the Greenland mission, to begin on Feb. 1 and continue until “such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase” of Greenland.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, it looked as if the charade of NATO unity still had a couple of years to run before it collapsed irrevocably, but suddenly it could be just a couple of weeks — or, at the latest, June 1, when Trump will raise the tariffs to 25 per cent on NATO members that are still refusing to sell the Greenlanders out.\n\nWhat about Canada? And to one side stands Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, giving cautious verbal support to European military support for Greenland but abstaining from any Canadian military contribution to its defence.\n\nBizarre in a way, because Canada is far closer to Greenland than any other NATO country. (It has a short land border on Hans Island.)\n\nThe problem is, of course, that all the (false) arguments the US uses to justify annexing Greenland apply equally to Canada. And Trump has used them in the past about Canada as well.

It is understood that the business man landed in Dublin on Tuesday, before heading to the golf resort to stay the night. A cordon was put in place at Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Co Clare, over the incident. A Garda spokeswoman said: “The package was subsequently deemed safe and the cordon has been lifted. “Investigations are ongoing.” It is believed that Mr Trump left Doonbeg early on Wednesday to attend the annual economic forum in Davos, Switzerland. His father, Donald Trump, was expected to cause further controversy at the forum and in his speech doubled down on his desire to acquire Greenland. However, after declaring he wanted “immediate negotiations” to “discuss the acquisition” of the mineral-rich Arctic island, Trump has made a U-turn on his threat to put tariffs on the UK and Nato allies who opposed his ambitions to annex Greenland. Trump did appear to rule out taking the territory with military intervention in his speech, telling the gathering: “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. “But I won’t do that. I don’t have to use force, I don’t want to use force, I won’t use force.” UK Prime Minister has continued his defence and said he would “not yield” in his stance over Greenland in the face of the US President's demands.

His address partly focused on his renewed wish for the United States to acquire Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory. In his speech, Trump said that NATO and Europe benefited from U.S. security support. He claimed leaders “loved” him until “the last few days” when he mentioned “Iceland,” mistakenly naming Greenland. “They called me daddy,” Trump stated. “A very smart man said, ‘He’s our daddy, he’s running it.’”\n\nNewsom’s post echoed reactions that quickly spread online as video of the exchange circulated. The governor’s press office shared the “grandpa” line from its official X account along with a clip of Trump’s remarks.\n\nTrump’s comments about Greenland were part of a larger message in Davos. He argued that U.S. control of the Arctic territory would improve security. This proposal has faced pushback from Denmark and other European leaders. It also dominated discussions at the summit as officials considered how to respond to Washington’s demands.\n\nDuring the same speech, Trump mentioned Newsom directly. He recalled what he described as a friendly relationship in the past. “I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president,” Trump remarked, calling Newsom “a good guy,” while also criticizing Democratic leadership and crime in California cities.\n\nTrump suggested that Newsom should seek federal help for addressing crime, offering his support. “And if he needed it, I would do it in a heartbeat,” Trump said, according to reports from the speech.\n\nThis exchange highlighted a growing political divide between the Democratic governor and the Republican president. They have frequently clashed over immigration enforcement, federal deployments, and disaster response since Trump returned to the White House. Newsom has emerged as a leading Democratic voice against Trump. He has urged global leaders not to yield to Washington’s threats as the administration intensifies its demands regarding Greenland.\n\nTrump’s appearance in Davos also attracted attention for his repeated references to Greenland while confusing it with Iceland, a separate country and NATO member. Multiple reports noted he mixed up the two as he outlined his demands and mocked European leaders.\n\nNewsom did not directly respond to Trump’s offer of help during the speech. However, his office has recently criticized Trump’s approach to European allies and the use of U.S. leverage in disputes related to Greenland.\n\nThe World Economic Forum, which brings together political and business leaders each year in Davos, has been dominated this week by discussions on trade, security, and the future of the transatlantic alliance. The Trump administration suggests it is willing to link tariffs and defense commitments to territorial and policy objectives.\n\nNeither the White House nor Newsom’s office provided additional comments on Newsom’s “grandpa” post beyond the message shared on X.","summary":"The California governor mocked Trump after the president claimed Greenlanders call him “daddy.”","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/newsom-fires-back-at-trumps-daddy-jab-with-savage-grandpa-dig","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gavin-Newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:30:49","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.214},{"id":395048752,"title":"Donald Trump appears to mix up Greenland and Iceland four times","text":"Donald Trump appeared to repeatedly mistake Iceland for Greenland in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland overnight.\n\nIn his speech, the president referenced Iceland four times in a context that seemed to fit his previous remarks on Greenland.\n\n\"I'm helping Europe, I am helping NATO, and until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Wall Street cashes in as TACO Trump 'chickens out'﻿\n\n\"(NATO is) not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you.

Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, sent a letter to the White House on Wednesday afternoon. They reiterated the state’s need for aid following the Lee and Elk fires in August and severe flooding in southwest Colorado in October.\n\n“The consequences of continued denial will be severe, long-lasting, and far more costly if left unaddressed,” the congressional letter states. “Disaster funds are critical for the safety and well-being of some of Colorado’s most rural residents.”\n\nThe delegation’s letter followed Gov. Jared Polis’ formal appeal of President Donald Trump’s denials, filed Friday. Last year, the congressional members also asked for federal aid after each of the disasters.\n\n“Whether fires or floods, Coloradans have been deeply impacted by these natural disasters,” Polis said in a statement on the appeals. “With this appeal, we hope that the federal government steps in to help Coloradans recover stronger.”\n\nThe disasters caused nearly $39 million in claimed damage, according to a presentation from the Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to the state legislature. The federal government typically picks up 75% of the tab, leaving — for now — the state on the hook for more than $29 million that the federal government would typically cover.\n\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn recent months, Trump and his appointees have taken several actions targeted at Colorado, from relocating the Space Command headquarters out of state to vetoing a bill that would help complete a clean water pipeline for rural communities in southeastern Colorado.\n\nThe denials issued in December were the first the state had received in 35 years, according to state officials. Division Director Kevin Klein told state lawmakers he didn’t expect the federal government to help out with these or future disasters. Without the promise of help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, he called on the legislature to invest in state emergency management infrastructure to minimize future costs.\n\n“I don’t see us getting FEMA money for disasters for the near future, at least,” Klein told lawmakers.\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"Colorado's elected leaders have renewed their plea with the Trump administration to approve tens of millions of dollars in aid for floods and wildfires last year after the president denied the requests.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/21/colorado-fire-flooding-disasters-appeal-congress-trump/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TDP-L-LEE-FIRE_JAC8871.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:27:23","author":"Nick Coltrain","authors":["Nick Coltrain"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":395045146,"title":"Trump's DOJ Admits DOGE May Have Misused Social Security Data and Assisted Advocacy Group's Effort to 'Overturn Election Results'","text":"The Department of Government Efficiency may have misused Social Security data and assisted an advocacy group whose aim was to \"overturn election results,\" the Department of Justice admitted in a new court filing.\n\n The Jan. 16 filing from Trump's DOJ states that the Social Security Administration identified \"communications, use of data, and other actions\" by DOGE that were potentially outside of the agency's policy.\n\n SSA found that a political advocacy group contacted two DOGE employees requesting to analyze state voter rolls. The advocacy group was not identified in the filing, but it states that the group's aim \"was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States.\"\n\n One of the DOGE team members signed a \"Voter Data Agreement\" with the advocacy group in his role as an SSA employee, the filing claimed.\n\n \"At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group\" nor the executed agreement, per the filing. \n\n \"This agreement was not reviewed or approved through the agency’s data exchange procedures,\" the filing noted, adding that SSA learned of the agreement during an unrelated review in November 2025.\n\n The following month, SSA made two Hatch Act referrals to the government ethics office. The Hatch Act restricts federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. \n\n It is unclear if DOGE shared Social Security data with the advocacy group.\n\n \"Email communications reviewed by SSA suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls, but SSA has not yet seen evidence that SSA data were shared with the advocacy group,\" the filing stated. \n\n SSA said DOGE needed access to Social Security records because it existed to \"modernize technology and to 'maximize efficiency and productivity,' \" per the filing. The DOGE team were said to have completed privacy and ethics training.\n\n The agency also learned that DOGE members used the unapproved third-party server Cloudflare to share data. It has not yet been determined exactly what data was shared to Cloudflare or whether the data still remains on the server.\n\n The review of DOGE is ongoing.\n\n The filing is the Trump administration’s first time acknowledging that DOGE inappropriately handled Social Security data, according to CNN.\n\n The explosive findings come after former SSA chief data officer Charles Borges claimed in August 2025 that DOGE workers created a copy of data of over 300 million Americans in a cloud computing server.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Elon Musk served as the inaugural head of DOGE from January until May of 2025, when President Donald Trump announced the Tesla CEO would be leaving his White House role after his special government employee contract ended.\n\n In February 2025, more than 20 civil service employees resigned from DOGE, saying they refused to use their technical expertise to \"dismantle critical public services,\" per a joint resignation letter obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n Trump and Musk had a public fallout last year but have seemingly rekindled. On Jan. 4, Musk posted on X about having a \"lovely\" dinner with the president and first lady Melania Trump.","summary":"The Social Security Administration says it learned that DOGE members used the unapproved third-party server Cloudflare to share data","url":"https://people.com/doge-social-security-data-court-filing-11889731","image":"https://people.com/thmb/HniXdZA4Ksl26QYp9EFN6T4TLlI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x275:747x277)/elon-musk-012126-11ef997434ac4485afa74fd8c64dfd6f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:26:27","author":"Raven Brunner","authors":["Raven Brunner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":395047836,"title":"‘I won’t use force’ for Greenland: Key takeaways from Trump’s Davos speech","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said he would not take over Greenland by ​force, but he stuck firmly to his demand for control over the Danish territory during a speech in Davos, Switzerland. He also hinted at consequences if his ambitions were thwarted.\n\n“People thought I ‌would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting.\n\nHe announced afterwards on his Truth Social platform that he had arrived at a “framework of a future deal” with respect to claiming Greenland, after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe details of that framework remain unknown, but Trump agreed to lift the tariffs he had threatened to slap on European allies starting February 1.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from his Davos speech:\n\n‘Would you like me to say a few words on Greenland?’\n\nTrump opened his remarks about Greenland with an attempt at humour.\n\n“I was going to leave it out of the speech, but I think I would have been reviewed very negatively,” he quipped.\n\nAfter a lengthy critique of Denmark, which he claimed was too weak to protect Greenland, Trump repeated his key position on the territory.\n\n“We need it for strategic national security and international security. This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.\n\n“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.\n\nHe proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.\n\n“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.\n\nStill, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.\n\n“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”\n\nEarlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.\n\n“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.\n\nHours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.\n\nRutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.\n\n‘You follow us down, and you follow us up’\n\nSpeaking about the US economy and its global influence, Trump described the US as the driving force of global growth.\n\n“The USA is the economic engine on the planet. And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.\n\n“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.\n\n“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”\n\nHe then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.\n\n“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\n“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”\n\nTariffs and the trade deficit\n\nDefending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.\n\n“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.\n\n“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.\n\nTrump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.\n\n“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.\n\nTrump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’\n\nSpeaking about Venezuela’s economy and oil sector, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.\n\nTrump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to abduct Maduro and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.\n\n“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.\n\n“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”\n\nTrump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.\n\n“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.\n\n“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”\n\nHe went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.\n\n“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.\n\n“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”\n\nOnto the topic of energy\n\nTrump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.\n\n“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.\n\n“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”\n\nHis statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.\n\nTrump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.\n\nWhile Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.\n\n“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.\n\n‘Canada should be grateful’\n\nFrom his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.\n\nWhile Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.\n\n“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.\n\n“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nTrump says he is meeting Zelenskyy\n\nTrump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.\n\n“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”\n\nA post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.\n\nStill, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.\n\n“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.\n\n‘Those beautiful sunglasses’\n\nAt one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.\n\n“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.\n\nMacron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.","summary":"Trump reiterated his push for US control of Greenland, criticised Europe and laid out his foreign policy priorities.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/22/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T160018Z_1256876561_RC2Q5JAEGBFE_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769027624.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:26:26","author":"Apps Support,Elizabeth Melimopoulos","authors":["Apps Support","Elizabeth Melimopoulos"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":395045804,"title":"World News | Pakistan PM Accepts Trump's Invitation to Join Board of Peace on Gaza","text":"Islamabad [Pakistan], January 22 (ANI): Pakistan has decided to join the US President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" to support the implementation of the Gaza Peace Plan under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan, said on Wednesday.\n\"In response to the invitation extended to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif by the President of the United States, Donald J.

While President Trump continues to insist that the US should own Greenland, his broader focus on the Arctic region has led Washington to order new icebreakers, a first batch of eleven involving a contract of US$ 3.5 billion for the so called Arctic Security Cutters.\n\nFor these ships, which can navigate seas covered in solid ice, the US has turned to the world expert: Finland.\n\nFinland is the undisputed world leader when it comes to icebreakers. Finnish companies have designed 80% of all those currently in operation and 60% are built in Finnish shipyards.\n\nThe country leads out of necessity, explains Maunu Visuri, president and CEO of the Finnish state-owned company Arctia, which operates a fleet of eight icebreakers.\n\n“Finland is the only country in the world where all ports can freeze over during the winter,” he says, adding that 97% of all goods in the country are imported by sea.\n\nUnder US law, Navy and Coast Guard ships must be built domestically, but in this case the president waived that requirement for national security reasons.\n\nFour of the icebreakers will be built in Finland the first should be ready by 2028. A further seven of the “Arctic Security Cutters”, are to be built in the US, using Finnish designs and expertise.\n\nIn Helsinki, capital of Finland there is an ice testing center at the Aker Arctic Technology's with a scale model of an icebreaker floating in a 70-meter-long simulation tank. It cuts a clean channel through the frozen water surface.\n\n“It is essential that it has sufficient structural strength and motor power,” says ice performance engineer Riikka Matala.\n\nMika Hovilainen, the firm's chief executive, adds that the shape of the ship is also crucial. “You have to have a hull shape that breaks the ice by pushing it down,” he says.\n“It's not cutting, it's not shredding.”\n\nThe US orders are part of an effort to catch up with the number of Russian icebreakers.

Many of these organizations, which Trump and his administration hold in disdain, are engaged in areas related to climate change—a reality the billionaire and current resident of the White House dismisses as merely a “leftist” invention.\n\nAccording to Trump, these entities do not serve the interests of the United States and have ineffective and hostile agendas, meaning they do not faithfully comply with U.S. directives.\n\nTrump’s personality, marked by megalomania, arrogance, and warlike tendencies, can be characterized as pathological narcissism. His approach to international relations has been defined not just by his National Security Strategy presented in late 2025 (3) but also by his unwavering aim to act as a global emperor among other roles.\n\nHe sees himself as a king in the United States, an interim president in besieged Venezuela, and a “Daddy” in Europe, publicly expressing intentions in early 2026 to unilaterally assume roles previously fulfilled by the UN, effectively positioning his country as the sole arbiter of governance concerning human rights and territorial sovereignty.\n\nTrump also dictates how to deal with occupied, invaded, or colonized countries, deciding their fates and the potential uses of their lands. This has been evident in his numerous comments regarding Gaza, where he has endorsed crimes, occupation, colonization, and genocide against the Palestinian people by the Israeli regime.\n\nWhile Trump does not explicitly claim the intent to officially assume the functions granted to the UN, his actions advocate for a behavior that practically replaces the international organizations established post-World War II, which his administration views as a constraint.\n\nThe blonde president believes that the White House should dictate international conflicts according to U.S. interests, positioning himself as the central figure.\n\nIn European media—where criticism is often veiled since the political and financial elite fear confronting Trump lest they face a barrage of threats—it is suggested that Trump’s aim is not so much to legally assume UN responsibilities but rather to construct a world order where the U.S. plays a predominant role, diminishing traditional multilateral institutions to their bare minimum. Europe seeks to minimize its reality of becoming a mere backyard.\n\nIn my view, Trump wishes to ignite the world. He is a dangerously unhinged egotist. For instance, in a letter sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Donald Trump claims that having not received the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer feels obligated to pursue this objective.\n\nIn this correspondence, he questioned Norway’s decision and tied it to his desire to take control of Greenland, insisting that while peace “will remain paramount,” he can now focus on what is good and right for the United States.\n\nHe further asserted his supposed right over Greenland: “I have done more for NATO than anyone since its founding, and now NATO should do something for the United States. The world will not be safe unless we have total and complete control of Greenland,” Trump declared in his note to Støre.\n\nThe concept of respecting international law, adhering to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and promoting multilateralism gives Trump hives. In response, the criticisms from his allies regarding Washington’s goal to use self-created mechanisms rather than traditional international forums like the UN General Assembly quietly surface. He has even named this new creation: the Council for Peace.\n\nThe contentious president, inherently combative, violent, and verbose, who does not hesitate to lie; the politician who supports wars and genocides, proposes establishing a Council for Peace. This is while he seeks to diminish the relevance of traditional multilateral institutions.\n\nA Council designed as a platform for U.S. leadership, not for mediating global conflicts, which in no way serves as an alternative to the UN in terms of peace and security. It aims to impose U.S. criteria, not to mediate. Replacing the 193 member countries of the UN does not provide a governance alternative; it equates to imposing and advancing toward a global dictatorship.\n\nTrump’s attacks on the UN are incessant. At the end of 2025, he openly declared that “perhaps the United States has become the real UN” (4), criticizing the international organization for its ineffectiveness in stopping and resolving wars, such as the conflict between NATO and Russia. This marks an undeniably hypocritical statement given that the U.S. has played a central role in fueling a hybrid war against the Russian Federation, utilizing NATO and the Ukrainian regime as a proxy.\n\nTrump’s invective regarding Ukraine is deeply self-serving and false. It is a sordid diatribe that seeks to mask Washington’s pivotal role in much of the international conflict landscape.\n\nWherever one looks, one finds the hand and interests of the United States and its allies: the attack on Venezuela and the kidnapping of its President; the maximum pressure policy against Cuba; destabilizing and criminal actions against the Islamic Republic of Iran, which have resulted in the support in arms for terrorist groups, cognitive warfare efforts, and public declarations calling for the overthrow of the Iranian government.\n\nThis criminal call has justified the assassination of hundreds of civilians and police in Iranian society, the destruction of government buildings, attacks on hospitals and residential areas, and fires set to mosques. A terrorist operation heavily repudiated by the Iranian people, who took to the streets in their millions to defend their country, their system, and their right to sovereignty.\n\nAdding to this is support for a genocidal policy carried out by heavily armed militias in Darfur and El Fasher in Sudan, backed by the United Arab Emirates with American approval and Israeli support. The threats against Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali aim at curtailing their processes for reaffirming political and economic self-determination and sovereignty. There are also threatening declarations directed at neighboring Canada and the government of Mexico under Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as threats against Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro.\n\nThe threats and commercial pressures against the People’s Republic of China and even direct threats against a European ally like Denmark, which is told it must deliver Greenland because Washington deems it “vital for its national security,” showcase the U.S. as a nation responsible for unprecedented aggressions, destabilizations, coups, and invasions throughout its relatively short history.\n\nThe United States is led by a dangerous malignant narcissist (5), a mendacious and pretentious figure who finds his kindred spirits in other dangerously influential characters like Benzion Mileikowsky (better known as Benjamin Netanyahu), Argentina’s Javier Milei, suspected drug trafficker, Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa, and aspiring dictator Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, as well as monarchies that carry out Washington’s orders, including those of Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nGovernments like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan are eager to ramp up pressure against China. These allies also support the notion that the world needs a new governance model, one to be led by Trump.\n\nDavos and the Annual Theater of the Powerful\n\nThe discussions among the global elite concerning Trump’s aspirations for dominance unfold in Davos. Nothing positive will emerge from there for the world’s people. It is an event where attendees arrive via private jets to a luxury venue, engaging in lavish dinners and celebrations to pat each other on the back while determining the fates of billions.\n\nIn Davos, “the rich” and those of middling status – one thousand attendees from 130 countries – gather to listen and even applaud vehement speeches against the master who dominates them and the perils that lie ahead.\n\n“A Spirit of Dialogue” is the theme for 2026, aiming to address global cooperation, particularly focusing on technology and AI, economic policies, sustainability, and investment in people for building prosperity in a fragmented world. Discussions revolve around how to foster growth and better confront economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The prosperity of people is not on the menu, only that of multinational corporations, billion-dollar fortunes, and energy companies.\n\nThe UN is not a central part of these discussions as it remains nothing more than a zombie: a living dead, even if its flag serves as a backdrop against the snowy mountains of this luxurious center in the Grisons Canton of German-speaking Switzerland.\n\nThe annual Davos Forum (held since 1971) is a celebration for the wealthy and those who serve them, holding significant political positions. But, I insist, nothing beneficial will come from this for the Global South. These gatherings are merely PR campaigns, a showcase of image laundering, reaffirming what we already know. As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated, the global order based on U.S. norms has reached its end (6).\n\n“Today, I will speak about the breakdown of the world order, the end of the pleasant fiction, and the dawn of a brutal reality,” Carney asserted. “Let me be direct: we are in the midst of a breakdown, not a transition… Mid-level powers must act together because if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”\n\nThis apparent straightforwardness, however, recycles the same narratives: How to foster good relations between major powers and those like Canada that consider themselves mid-tier powers. The appeal is not for the world, but for those who have enjoyed the privileges of power and feel their status threatened.\n\nWhat about the rest of the planet? The other 90% of the world’s countries? For them, there isn’t even a pleasant fiction; instead, in the 21st century, they will continue to fight for their right to sovereignty and self-determination. After Davos concludes, the UN will still be absent, Trump will keep issuing threats, and the specter of the blonde billionaire will hang over our heads like the sword of Damocles.\n\nParaphrasing a famous song by Joan Manuel Serrat, after Davos, “it’s over, the sun tells us that the end has come. For one night, it was forgotten that each one is their own. And with the hangover comes the poor back to their poverty. The rich returns to their wealth. And the priest returns to his masses. Good and evil awaken, the poor fox to the portal, the rich fox to the rosebush, and the miser to his riches.”\n\nPablo Jofré LealJournalist and International AnalystArticle for Hispantv.\n\nGlobal Governance in the 21st Century, as outlined in official UN documents and related organizations, such as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), aims to oversee the provision of global public goods, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and to uphold the social and environmental goals set by the United Nations over recent decades.\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/es/latest/news/2026/01/usa-international-withdrawals-tear-apart-global-cooperation/\nhttps://www.hispantv.com/noticias/opinion/636656/eeuu-estrategia-seguridad-nacional-2025\nhttps://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-trump-plantea-eeuu-quizas-convertido-nueva-onu-gracias-esfuerzos-paz-20251228174301.html#google_vignette\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1398949335298957\nhttps://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/es/noticia/2222016/carney-en-davos-estamos-ante-el-despertar-de-una-realidad-brutal","summary":"El Ciudadano\n\n\nOriginal article: Donald Trump y Davos aceleran la agonía de la ONU By Pablo Jofré Leal, Journalist and International Analyst The actions taken by U.S. President Donald Trump in international politics highlight not only his hegemonic and arrogant approach but also his determination to deliver a fatal blow to what is often referred to as [&#8230;]\n\n\nLa entrada Donald Trump&#8217;s Influence at Davos Signals Decline of the United Nations se publicó primero en El Ciudadano.","url":"https://www.elciudadano.com/en/donald-trumps-influence-at-davos-signals-decline-of-the-united-nations/01/21/","image":"https://www.elciudadano.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/el-ciudadano-img-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-22 00:23:14","author":"The Citizen","authors":["The Citizen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cl","sentiment":0.126}]}
