With recently implemented tariffs by advanced and emerging economies, and Chinese responses and macro stimulus, how this issue may evolve over the next few years is becoming clearer – with significant geopolitical implications.\n\nOn Oct. 29, a month after U.S. tariffs targeting China’s overcapacity went into effect, the European Commission imposed its own tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). While these actions attracted significant media attention, China’s recent World Trade Organization complaint against Turkey’s EV tariffs – a case underscoring China’s failure to discourage major emerging markets from following the lead of developed economies – passed largely under the radar.\n\nAt the same time, the surge in Chinese overseas manufacturing is reshaping the global economy and China’s role within it. China’s latest stimulus plan demonstrates that despite the government’s acknowledgment of weak domestic demand, macroeconomic rebalancing remains off the table. The policies driving China’s overcapacity – and the resulting trade tensions – are probably here to stay.\n\nWhile the U.S.-China trade war may return to the fore with Trump’s promise of 60% tariffs on imports from China, China’s overcapacity is ultimately likely to be felt more acutely in other major economies. Structural trends suggest that the European Union could bear the brunt of a new China shock and ensuing trade tensions. As Europe’s trade conflict with China escalates, the EU’s EV tariffs – which faced resistance from some member states – may prove to be just the opening salvo.\n\nIn response to these pressures, Chinese exporters have turned their attention to developing economies, which accounted for more than 50 percent of China’s exports in 2023. This trend is expected to persist, further widening China’s trade deficits with major emerging markets. But while these countries benefit from cheap Chinese goods and direct investment, they are also increasingly frustrated by limited access to China’s markets, which jeopardizes their own industrial aspirations.\n\nNew U.S. tariffs on China under Trump, who has also promised a 10-20 percent across-the-board tariff on all imports from other countries, will accelerate the shift of Chinese exports to emerging markets and the EU. This, in turn, would exacerbate these economies’ concerns about Chinese “non-market overcapacity” and trade imbalances.\n\nNon-market overcapacity, though an imperfect term, captures three interconnected economic forces. For starters, China’s industrial policies promote strategic sectors and push for import substitution, systematically reducing foreign imports across multiple industries. At the same time, persistent macroeconomic imbalances weaken domestic demand and drive China’s massive trade surplus. Lastly, the global economy is highly dependent on Chinese supply chains, which heightens the risk of disruption and economic coercion.\n\nChina’s tightened export controls, particularly on critical raw materials whose supply it effectively controls, highlight the risks posed by this dependence. Some may argue that, given the urgency of addressing climate change, overcapacity in key green industries is not necessarily a bad thing. Yet this argument would be far more compelling if China allowed fair competition in other sectors and did not threaten foreign access to vital clean-energy inputs like graphite.\n\nThrough public messaging, multilateral engagement, and targeted tariffs, the US and EU have prompted a necessary reckoning with China’s industrial overcapacity, starting to address the problem before it wreaks havoc on industries and communities. Encouragingly, there are signs that Chinese firms have scaled back their expansion plans, owing to weak domestic demand and the growing difficulty of exporting excess capacity to international markets. While Chinese authorities have, as expected, largely denied the issue publicly, the external pressure has forced policymakers to take notice.\n\nThat said, addressing the complex global challenges posed by China’s overcapacity will require additional trade restrictions and innovative policy tools. The speed with which G7 countries were able to reach a consensus on this issue signals more coordinated action ahead. As the EU, the US, Japan, and India tighten restrictions on Chinese goods routed through third countries, imports from China are likely to face increased scrutiny on national security, environmental, and labor grounds. Meanwhile, supply-chain diversification – though still in its early stages – could create significant opportunities for developing economies elsewhere.\n\nChina’s primary response to these challenges has been increased foreign direct investment, largely welcomed by its trading partners. Some emerging-market governments have even lowered duties on Chinese EV companies that establish manufacturing facilities within their borders. But there are growing doubts about the scalability and effectiveness of this approach. Chinese authorities are reportedly pressing for planned EV and battery investments in Europe to be curtailed. In Thailand, Chinese EV companies have faced criticism for not sourcing from local suppliers.\n\nMore broadly, expecting Chinese firms to build large-scale manufacturing facilities in every major trading partner is unrealistic. And China’s weak labor market might make the authorities more reluctant to allow manufacturing jobs to move overseas. In fact, Bloomberg reported in September that China had advised automakers to keep certain EV technologies and production capabilities at home.\n\nChina’s recent policy shift toward stabilization measures to support the domestic economy and markets reflects a belated response to weak domestic demand and confidence. So far, however, government efforts to stimulate consumption – essential for sustainable long-term growth – have been limited to increased funding for an appliance trade-in program and a reduction in mortgage interest rates. Stabilizing the property sector could boost household confidence, but the government has shown little willingness to allocate the necessary resources.\n\nTackling China’s overcapacity problem will require rebalancing the economy and overhauling industrial policies. Despite government-affiliated economists’ growing discussion of innovative approaches, Chinese leaders remain opposed to essential reforms. As tariffs pile up and geopolitical tensions escalate, exacerbating China’s economic slowdown, they may eventually be forced to confront these structural issues.\n\nBrendan Kelly, a former director for China economics issues on the U.S. National Security Council staff, is a non-resident fellow on Chinese Economy and Technology at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.

In addition, the incoming Trump administration's proposed tariff hike appears to be driven by the belief that China is using Mexico as a manufacturing detour to bypass trade barriers.\n\nIndustry officials said Korean companies doing business there have no choice but to find other regions for exports to the U.S., as they will end up losing price competitiveness if the tariffs are imposed.\n\n“Korean companies, which run manufacturing facilities in Mexico, are reviewing ways to diversify their production bases into other countries,” an official in the tech industry said on condition of anonymity. “The two electronics firms are the two most vulnerable companies, as they rely heavily on their Mexican factories for exports to the U.S.”\n\nBut the official also expressed concerns that customers will end up falling victim to such excessive tariffs on end products.\n\n“Tariffs on device components and finished products lead to a hike in their prices, so U.S. retail players and customers will have to purchase them at a higher price in the aftermath of Trump’s trade pressure,” the official said.\n\nLG Electronics operates diverse production lines in Mexico to manufacture television, refrigerator and automobile components. The company said an internal review is in progress to minimize damage.\n\n“We are leaving open all scenarios to deal with the rapidly-changing trade policies in the U.S., and will come up with countermeasures,” an official at LG Electronics said.\n\nSamsung Electronics runs a television manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico for export to the U.S.\n\nAlong with the electronics firms, LS Cable & System is also on track to expand investments in production facilities in Mexico. In August, the company started construction of two factories there to manufacture bus ducts and parts for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Bus ducts are a type of electrical distribution system used to efficiently carry electricity from one point to another.\n\nAt that time, the company identified Mexico as one of the most strategic production bases for its exports to the U.S., citing low labor costs and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is a free trade pact signed by the three countries.\n\nBut Trump is widely expected to initiate a procedure to renegotiate the agreement upon taking office in January 2025.\n\nThis has presented the Korean cable and industrial product manufacturer with a growing dilemma on how to readjust its export strategies in North America.\n\nA spokesperson for LS Cable & System stated that the company has increased its vigilance regarding changes in the trade landscape.\n\n“We are trying our best to prepare the most optimal countermeasure against the looming trade risk there,” the official said.\n\nKorean carmakers and steelmakers, such as Kia and POSCO, are also feared to fall victim, as they run production lines in Mexico.","summary":"Major Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, are now exploring the possibility of reshaping their global supply chains in response to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-s-mexico-tariff-plan-raises-concerns-for-korean-firms-285626.html","image":"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/659bd558b6d3464e9cb42054331d307a.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 01:00:11","author":"Lee Min","authors":["Lee Min"],"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.023},{"id":268746440,"title":"Israel PM again warns Iran after top diplomat talks of revising nuclear doctrine","text":"JERUSALEM: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday (Nov 28) that Israel would do \"everything\" to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon after Iran's top diplomat warned it could end its ban on developing one if Western sanctions are reimposed.\n\nThe renewed war of words between the Middle East foes came as Iran prepares to hold key nuclear talks with European governments on Friday which have been overshadowed by their joining with Washington to have Tehran censured by the United Nations atomic watchdog.\n\n\"I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear (power), I will use all the resources that can be used,\" Netanyahu told Israeli broadcaster Channel 14 in an interview.\n\nIsrael is the region's sole, if undeclared, nuclear-armed state.

These could be military facilities, defence and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centres in Kyiv,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced Mr Putin's \"promotion\" of the Oreshnik as a tactic to disrupt attempts to end the war, particularly by US President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\"He can go on wielding his Oreshnik only to thwart the efforts of President Trump which are sure to follow his inauguration. Putin wants to escalate the situation to such an extent so that President Trump's attempts will fail. So that he cannot end the war.\"\n\nMr Putin said a massive Russian overnight attack on Ukraine was also a response to Kyiv's use of US ATACMS ballistic missiles.\n\nThat attack on Ukraine's energy sector left at least 1 million people across three western regions without power.\n\nMr Zelenskyy said Russia used cruise missiles with cluster munitions in the attack, something he called a \"despicable escalation\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden condemned them as \"outrageous\".\n\nMr Zelenskyy also said he was speaking to Western leaders, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, to devise a response to \"Russia's attempt to make the situation more unbearable and drag out the war\".\n\nDrone attacks continue\n\nIn the hours following Russia's massive attack, fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said.\n\nEmergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a paediatric clinic in the city's Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nFire broke out at the medical facility, the head of the city's military administration Serhiy Popko wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nMr Popko warned residents to remain in shelters with an air raid alert still in effect.\n\nA security guard at the facility was taken to hospital. Adjacent buildings also suffered damage.\n\nMayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments had struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the west bank of the river.\n\nAn air raid alert remained in effect in the capital more than an hour after it was declared.\n\nMeanwhile Russian air defences destroyed or downed 30 Ukrainian drones in southern Rostov region early on Friday, Regional Governor Yuri Slyusar said.\n\nMr Slyusar, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said some private homes in two villages had sustained some damage, but there were no casualties.\n\n'Direct involvement' of West\n\nRussia says Ukraine fired ATACMS into western Russia for the first time on November 19, prompting it to respond two days later by firing the Oreshnik, a new intermediate-range missile, at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.\n\nSince then, Russia says Ukraine fired more ATACMS at its Kursk region on November 23 and 25 and struck Russia with British Storm Shadow cruise missiles too, after the United States and Britain agreed for the first time to allow Kyiv to strike deep inside Russian territory with these weapons.\n\nMr Putin reiterated in his summit remarks that this, from Moscow's viewpoint, meant the \"direct involvement\" of the West in an armed conflict with Russia.\n\nMr Putin said Russia's production of advanced missile systems exceeds that of the NATO military alliance by 10 times, and that Moscow planned to ramp up production.\n\nHe said Russia had \"several\" Oreshniks ready to use — consistent with comments from US military officials last week that the new missile was experimental and Russia likely possessed only a handful of them.\n\nMr Putin, for the second time in less than a week, boasted that the Oreshnik was comparable to a nuclear weapon in terms of its destructive power and would atomise everything at the point of impact — but he said it would not carry a nuclear warhead or spread radioactive contamination.\n\nWestern security experts say the missile, like many others in Russia's arsenal, could be fitted with a nuclear warhead.\n\nUkraine said the Oreshnik fired on November 21 reached a top speed of 13,600 kilometres per hour but sources said it carried dummy warheads, not live explosives.\n\nTensions between the warring sides have risen sharply with the missile exchanges and Mr Putin last week updated Russia's nuclear doctrine to extend the list of scenarios that might prompt it to launch a nuclear weapon.\n\nBut five sources familiar with US intelligence told Reuters that the US decision to allow Ukraine to fire American weapons deeper into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack — something they said was still unlikely.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use

1","text":"If Canada seeks to retaliate over U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's tariff threat, the government should hit the U.S. where it would hurt economically and politically, some trade experts suggest.\n\nThe challenge would be to \"find some iconic U.S. item … that would resonate with Trump's supporters, or the constituencies he cares about, which if Canada put tariffs on them, it will get a lot of notice in the U.S,\" said Gary Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods unless both governments tighten their borders to prevent the flow of drugs like fentanyl and illegal migrants into the U.S. But his threat has raised questions as to whether Canada has any kind of leverage to squeeze the U.S. and prevent such tariff action.\n\n\"It's unclear what Canada can do going forward,\" wrote Derek Holt, vice-president of Scotiabank Economics, in a note to clients.\n\nUltimately, he said, Canada may feel it doesn't have any choice left other than to retaliate, and \"we need to be prepared for such a risk.\"\n\nWendy Wagner, an Ottawa-based international trade lawyer, says she hopes that instead of retaliating, officials and stakeholders from both countries can make it clear that with such highly complex supply chains, U.S. industries will significantly suffer from Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The auto part that you were sourcing from Ontario, you can't just turn around and all of a sudden source it from Ohio,\" she said. \n\n\"Hopefully, there will be a lot of industries working together to kind of clearly communicate what the impact is and what that will mean on sort of an individual business and contractual relationship level.\"\n\nBut if such concerns fail to have any effect on Trump's tariff threat, Canada's leverage with the U.S. may again lie with retaliatory tariffs.\n\nIn his first term in 2018, Trump placed tariffs of 25 per cent on Canadian steel and 10 per cent on Canadian aluminum. Canada responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a series of U.S. products.\n\nOn Tuesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland wouldn't say whether Canada was considering the same course of retaliatory actions that it took in 2018, but she noted that Canada had a \"smart response\" last time and that its retaliation was successful as the tariffs on Canadian products were eventually lifted.\n\nFreeland also acknowledged that the round of tariffs under Trump was a challenging time for Canadians.\n\nA senior government source told CBC News that the main focus right now is maintaining lines of communication with Trump's inner circle and stakeholders that may have influence. But the source said that at the moment, it doesn't seem like there's a silver bullet to end the tariff threat and that it will be a long grind.\n\nHufbauer, who has written extensively on international trade, echoed that any kind of tit-for-tat tariff war would be more damaging for Canada than the U.S. Still, he says there are areas the government could focus on that might cause Trump to rethink his threat.\n\nCanada could threaten to slap tariffs on U.S. agriculture, such as dairy products and field crops, which is \"very sensitive from a political standpoint for the U.S,\" he said.\n\nHufbauer also said there might be mileage in threatening to impose tariffs on some products connected to those CEOs who have a relationship with Trump.\n\nPlacing a tariff on iPhones, for example, might prompt Apple CEO Tim Cook to get in Trump's ear, he said. Or, Hufbauer suggested, target electric vehicle company Tesla, owned by billionaire Elon Musk who has become a significant Trump ally.\n\nAnything that may be an irritant to those in Trump's circle could help, Hufbauer said.\n\nCanada has 'hit lists,' should focus on 'counter leverage'\n\nIn a social media post on X, trade expert Peter Clark said Canada needs to stay focused \"on counter leverage\" and those who have export interests in selling to Canada.\n\n\"We know who their Senators are and who represents them in the House. We have our own hit lists and our professionals are always ready to respond,\" he wrote.\n\nThose \"hit lists\" refer to the U.S. products Canada may target for tariffs if Trump does implement tariffs on Canadian exports, Clark said in an interview with CBC News.\n\n\"We know what the products are. We know who might be concerned enough about being put on a consultation list, that they would raise a fuss with their senator or with their Congress member to help put on some pressure.\"\n\nPutting such products on official notice as potential targets for tariffs will prompt U.S. suppliers and their lobbyists and lawyers in Washington to \"go bananas,\" Clark said.\n\n\"They basically lobby everybody in order to avoid it. There's a counter pressure. It may not be enough for Trump to have those pressures, but it's worked in the past.\"\n\nTyler Meredith, former lead economic advisor for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Freeland, said that in 2018, the items the government used to respond to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs were highly targeted in very visible categories, things like bourbon and playing cards made in Kentucky and Heinz ketchup.\n\n\"They happened to come from certain parts of the U.S. that Trump knew and understood,\" said Meredith. \"And so, to an extent, we need to do the same thing.\"\n\nSince that first term, Meredith says some of the players have since changed and that Trump's attention has gravitated to other states, meaning Canada's focus would have to shift a bit. \n\n\"It will be important to map where there are potentially areas that Canada can exact some potential revenge if we do actually have to get into a tariff discussion.\"\n\nCarrots, not sticks\n\nBut Meredith also says that instead of using tariffs as sticks, Canada should be focusing more on carrots. \n\nFor example, the federal government owns the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and although the supply contracts for those shippers on the pipeline are destined for Asia, that's not to say that Canada couldn't look at striking deals with U.S. refineries, Meredith said.\n\n\"That would be something that I think Trump would be very interested in,\" he said. \"He has opened the door to say he wants more of our energy.\n\n\"This is all about a deal. You can see how you start to put these things together and it looks attractive from Trump's perspective of being able to say, 'Well, look at look at what we're getting.' \"","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tariff-canada-retaliate-trump-1.7394432","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7395149.1732755216!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/us-canada-tariffs-20241125.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:52:29","author":"Mark Gollom","authors":["Mark Gollom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":268743940,"title":"From Vice To The Proud Boys How Canadian Gavin Mcinnes Birthed Two Polarizing Legacies 1","text":"How did the \"coolest dude in New York media\" — according to Thomas Morton, a former contributing editor for Vice magazine — go from leftist counterculture icon to far-right provocateur? \n\nGavin McInnes co-founded the progressive, left-leaning Vice in 1994. Based out of Montreal, it started out as an alternative print publication focusing on arts, culture, lifestyle, news and politics. Along with co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi, McInnes elevated the magazine to Vice Media — which branched out into digital media, film and broadcasting — and moved the operation to New York in 1999.\n\nThen, 22 years after the launch of the magazine, McInnes founded the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist organization known for its involvement in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. \n\nIt's a trajectory that has proved jarring and confusing for many of his former friends and colleagues at Vice.\n\nIn the documentary It's Not Funny Anymore: Vice to Proud Boys, Morton traces how this drastic shift in ideologies may have occurred. Through conversations with McInnes's family, friends, former coworkers and McInnes himself, Morton aims to understand how his one-time mentor became what he calls \"a sort of right-wing guru.\"\n\nThe provocative, envelope-pushing early days of Vice magazine\n\nVice was born out of another publication, Voice of Montreal, where Smith, Alvi and McInnes worked in the early '90s.\n\n\"'Vice' is everything naughty and irresponsible one can do in life. That [name is] going to get people's attention,\" says Rupert Bottenberg, a comic artist and former Vice contributor, in the documentary.\n\nIn an archival interview, McInnes is shown declaring himself the \"resident goof\" and \"madman in a cage\" at the magazine.\n\nMorton and fellow Vice alumni also remember McInnes as a funny person who enjoyed pushing the envelope with shock humour and nudity in the office.\n\nIn the early days, McInnes directed much of his rebellious energy toward challenging political correctness, which informed the overall voice of the publication.\n\nFormer editor-in-chief Jesse Pearson describes McInnes in the documentary as, \"the heart and soul of Vice magazine.\"\n\nMcInnes was also the creative force behind each issue, according to Morton. One of the most popular series in the magazine was McInnes's Dos and Don'ts, which made light of people photographed on the street.\n\nFormer head of publishing at Vice Media Thobey Campion says that McInnes wanted people to laugh \"in the most painful way they possibly could.\" \n\n\"At that point in time, Gavin was just a comedian who wanted to push it too far,\" he remarks in the film. \"Every time he caught a hold of something that caused a reaction, he felt unable to restrain himself from continuing to get that reaction … [he was] almost pathologically drawn.\"\n\n'It got old and it got more extreme'\n\nWhen Morton first met McInnes, he recalls, McInnes \"sieg heiled\" a mailman.\n\n\"I laughed because it was f--king funny,\" Morton says while reminiscing with writer and editor Dave Carnie in the documentary. \"But it was funny because he wasn't a Nazi.\"\n\nFormer Vice editor Amy Kellner tells Morton that she also found McInnes humorous and smart in the beginning. But she says he had several \"rules\" for how women should look, such as avoiding certain hairstyles and clothing, that made her feel insecure. \n\nWhen McInnes eventually told her about the importance of \"perfectly symmetrical\" genitalia, she had had it. \n\n\"It got old and it got more extreme,\" she says. \"And it didn't seem like a joke anymore.\"\n\nMorton says he began to see a different side of his mentor after McInnes was introduced to the work of Jim Goad, co-creator of the zine Answer Me! and author of The Redneck Manifesto — a book that argues that lower-class white people are the last undefended minority. \n\nMcInnes brought Goad on as a Vice contributor in 2005, where he wrote a lengthy article — edited by McInnes — that claimed slavery in America wasn't as bad as history classes would have you believe.\n\nAfter its publication, Vice staff who were familiar with McInnes's envelope-pushing tendencies were left wondering: was this just a radical statement about the importance of free speech? Or was he actually racist?\n\nThe rise and fall out of the Proud Boys\n\nMcInnes went on to leave Vice around 2007 and soon became known for his far-right political views, which he shared on programs like Fox News's Red Eye and The Sean Hannity Show. \n\nBut it was on his own talk radio show, The Gavin McInnes Show, that he first described his growing group of like-minded drinking buddies.\n\n\"When you're doing the same thing every week, or in this case it was every night … you start developing a sort of a culture. And a culture needs a name,\" McInnes says in archival footage shown in the documentary. \"I think it was May of 2015, I said, 'OK, we got a name.'\" And thus, the Proud Boys were born. \n\nOver the following years, Proud Boys chapters began forming in various cities, including Toronto, where McInnes's words — like the credo, \"I am a proud western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world\" — were resonating with men. \n\nAnd as the organization grew, its members became increasingly involved in violent confrontations. \n\nOne clash with anti-fascists in 2018 resulted in the arrest of 10 Proud Boys members, and McInnes releasing a statement saying that he was \"disassociating\" himself from the group in order to help \"alleviate their sentencing.\" Still, McInnes continued to share his political views and support for the Proud Boys on his platform.\n\nProud Boys membership then increased \"exponentially,\" according to one former member featured in the documentary, after then-U.S. president Donald Trump acknowledged the group during a debate in 2020. \n\n\"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,\" he said, giving the organization a new motto that was eventually adapted into its logo. \n\nThings would only escalate from there, with Proud Boys members taking part in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — an attack that resulted in the deaths of at least seven people, according to a bipartisan report from the U.S. Senate. \n\nThe next month, Canada officially labelled the Proud Boys a terrorist entity, and the Canadian arm of the group officially disbanded later that year. The film notes, however, that there is no list of domestic terrorist groups in the United States, and reports suggest the Proud Boys remain active there. \n\nIn It's Not Funny Anymore, Morton works up to sitting down with McInnes himself to discuss the many theories he's come across that might explain how a once left-leaning, progressive media figure became a symbol of far-right militancy — including the theory that McInnes is a racist.\n\nMcInnes explains what he believes Proud Boys really mean when they say \"Make America great again,\" and asserts that straight, white, male conservatives are the \"least racist people in this country, in the world.\"\n\nAfter the interview, Morton reflects on the criticism he believes he'll receive for not pushing harder against his former mentor, who continues to platform Proud Boys convicted on conspiracy to commit treason online. \n\nStill, he concludes, \"[Gavin's] whole deal is going too far, and now he's facing the consequences for that.\"\n\nHow to watch It's Not Funny Anymore: Vice to Proud Boys\n\nWatch now on CBC Gem and the CBC Docs YouTube

Kellogg also advocated limited sanctions relief to Russia for compliance and establishing long-term security guarantees for Ukraine through bilateral defense agreements.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin said at Thursday’s security summit in Kazakhstan that Russia is “ready for dialogue with the United States, including with the future administration,” while emphasizing that the conditions for peace talks remain unchanged from demands he announced earlier this year.\n\nIn a June meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry leaders, Putin outlined conditions for talks with Ukraine, including Ukrainian troop withdrawals from contested regions, Ukraine’s adoption of a neutral status, “denazification and demilitarization” of the country, and the lifting of Western sanctions.\n\nAt Thursday’s security summit, Putin threatened to use the hypersonic missile system against decision-making centers in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin believes President-elect Donald Trump will be able to handle the escalating conflict in Ukraine and mend strained relations.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/putin-says-hes-confident-trump-can-navigate-ukraine-crisis-repair-us-russia-ties-5768076","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/28/id5768078-GettyImages-2186623258-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:36:19","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.108},{"id":268743762,"title":"Letters: Toll hikes | Don’t flee | Reflecting poorly | Wrong elites | Youth’s voice","text":"Toll hikes restrict\nresidents’ mobility\n\nRe: “Toll hikes could rise to more than $11” (Page A1, Oct. 26).\n\nAs a lifelong Bay Area resident I have seen the bridge tolls increase since the 1980s from 40 cents per crossing to $7, soon to be $8.

left in power, Biden has some big, controversial names to consider for pardons","text":"With only weeks left for Joe Biden to exercise his presidential powers, supporters of Julian Assange, both in Australia and the United States, are ratcheting up appeals for a pardon for the WikiLeaks founder.\n\nThe US president can issue pardons at any time during their term.\n\nIt's an extraordinary power that accompanies the highest office in the land, and allows them to pardon anyone for any federal crime.\n\nPresidents can be lobbied directly, and they also receive recommendations from a pardon attorney that operates out of the US Justice Department, which receives and reviews applications for clemency.\n\n\"Sometimes we see clemency decisions come out around Thanksgiving or Christmas, for example, but they could be, and are, issued at any time,\" said Jeffrey Crouch, an expert on the process and a professor at American University in Washington DC.\n\n\"Clemency has traditionally been granted either as an act of mercy or to serve the public welfare.\n\n\"Occasionally a president will stray from these acceptable reasons and instead grant clemency for his own personal reasons.\"\n\nSo far in his term, Mr Biden has used pardons to facilitate prisoner exchanges with other countries, and to address marijuana offences.\n\nBut as his time in public life draws to a close, speculation is mounting about who he might pardon in the coming weeks.\n\nAs well as Assange, his son Hunter Biden, and even his successor, president-elect Donald Trump, have been mentioned as possible recipients of his clemency.\n\nPrevious presidents have made notable pardons of their own\n\nIn his first term, Trump made plenty of headlines for pardoning political allies, like his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, his former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and his political advisors Roger Stone and Steve Bannon.\n\nHe commuted the two-year sentence served by Charles Kushner — the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — for preparing false tax returns, witness retaliation and making false statements.\n\nHe also pardoned Alice Johnson, a woman given a life sentence over a first-time drug offence, after being personally lobbied by celebrity Kim Kardashian.\n\nBarack Obama keenly embraced the power as well, issuing more than 1,700 commutations and more than 200 pardons in his eight years in office — many granted to people who had received mandatory sentences for drugs charges.\n\nPerhaps the most divisive pardon in US history was in 1974, when the Republican president Gerald Ford granted a full and unconditional pardon to his predecessor, Richard Nixon.\n\nMr Nixon had not been convicted of a crime or even criminally charged, but had resigned in disgrace after the Watergate scandal, and the possibility of charges hung over him.\n\nMr Ford pardoned him for any crimes he might have committed against the United States, saying he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country — effectively telling the nation it was time to move on.\n\nMr Ford's approval rating dropped dramatically and he was defeated by Democrat Jimmy Carter at the presidential election two years later.\n\n\"The Nixon pardon by president Gerald Ford on September 8, 1974 was highly controversial,\" said Professor Crouch.\n\n\"It's impossible to say how much the Nixon pardon cost Ford, but it certainly is viewed now as having had a negative impact.\"\n\nExercising the power can come with political cost, which is why some presidents have waited until their final weeks in office to grant more controversial pardons.\n\nBill Clinton came under fire for pardoning members of a Puerto Rican paramilitary organisation, as well as Marc Rich, a fugitive who made substantial donations to his wife Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign.\n\nOn his final day in office, he also pardoned his brother Roger, who was arrested in 1985 for cocaine possession and a drug-trafficking conviction.\n\nGeorge W Bush controversially commuted the sentence of \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to his Vice-President Dick Cheney, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\nBut Professor Crouch pointed out that both did so with a bit of political cover.\n\n\"[They] did so while they were 'lame duck' presidents and free from punishment at the ballot box,\" he said.\n\nCould Julian Assange be in the mix for Biden?\n\nAssange's supporters say a pardon would be an opportunity for the US government to prove it does not pursue journalists or media outlets with criminal prosecution.\n\nIn 2010, WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of leaked documents and diplomatic cables about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nA 2019 indictment asserted that Assange's actions risked serious harm to the national security of the United States, to the benefit of its adversaries, and put named human sources at grave risk.\n\nHe spent years in confinement — seven holed up in London's Ecuadorian embassy claiming asylum, and then nearly five in a UK prison awaiting extradition.\n\nBut in a bid to gain his freedom, Assange agreed to plead guilty earlier this year to a single charge, admitting to conspiring with then-US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to publish military documents on the website he founded, WikiLeaks.\n\nHe is now living in Australia and cannot enter the US without permission.\n\nOn a recent trip to Washington DC, his brother Gabriel Shipton said President Biden could send a strong message as he winds up his term.\n\n\"It's a way that President Biden can send a signal to the press freedom community that it isn't right to charge journalists and indict journalists and convict journalists of espionage for publishing material in the public interest,\" he told the ABC.\n\nTwo US congressmen from both sides of the aisle — Democrat Jim McGovern and Republican Thomas Massie — have also written a letter to the president urging him to consider a pardon.\n\n\"As you know, the decision to prosecute Mr Assange under the Espionage Act set off alarms among Members of Congress and advocates for freedom of expression and freedom of the press,\" they wrote.\n\nIn their letter, Congressman McGovern and Congressman Massie said the terms of the plea agreement set a precedent that \"greatly deepens\" concern.\n\n\"We therefore urge you to consider issuing a pardon for Mr Assange,\" they wrote in the letter, sent at the start of the month but only made public this week.\n\n\"A pardon would remove the precedent set by the plea and send a clear message that the US government under your leadership will not target or investigate journalists and media outlets simply for doing their jobs.\"\n\nMr Shipton said the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese should leverage his own close relationship with Joe Biden and mention the pardon application directly.\n\n\"I think there's still a feeling in the electorate that this is a wrong committed against an Australian, and this could be a way for the prime minister to use his influence [with] the Biden administration and President Biden to right that wrong,\" he said.\n\nAssange's supporters visited Canberra this week to meet with federal parliamentarians and highlight their campaign to secure a full pardon.\n\nThe prime minister's office did not respond to questions about whether Mr Albanese either supports or would advocate for a pardon.\n\nCould Biden pardon Hunter? Or Trump?\n\nAs President Biden works to solidify his legacy during his final weeks in the Oval Office, another major question looms about the future of his only surviving son, Hunter.\n\nThe 54-year-old has two convictions on the books and sentencings for both crimes are scheduled for mid-December.\n\nIn the first case, a jury in his home state of Delaware found Hunter guilty of lying on a gun purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nIn the second case, he pleaded guilty in California to nine charges in a federal tax case, including tax evasion and filing fraudulent returns.\n\nHunter Biden has been open about his descent into drug addiction and alcoholism at the time of both offences.\n\nIn mid-June, when he was still seeking a second presidential term, his father said he would not pardon his son.\n\n\"I am not going to do anything,\" he said when asked on the sidelines of a G7 summit.\n\nOf course, at the time, the president had more at stake: it was before he had withdrawn from the race and left his Vice President Kamala Harris to run, ultimately unsuccessfully.\n\nThe White House has indicated that even though President Biden is weeks away from retirement, he still has no plans to pardon his son.\n\nNow set to succeed him in office, Donald Trump was previously asked by a conservative podcast host, Hugh Hewitt, if he'd pardon Hunter.\n\n\"I wouldn't take it off the books,\" Trump enigmatically responded.\n\n\"See, unlike Joe Biden, despite what they've done to me, where they've gone after me so viciously … Hunter's a bad boy. There's no question about it. He's been a bad boy.\"\n\nMarc Thiessen, from the conservative-aligned think tank American Enterprise Institute, recently used his column in the Washington Post newspaper to argue the president should issue a blanket pardon for Trump as a final act of statesmanship, to attempt to bring a divided nation together.\n\n\"Biden is in a strong position to do this,\" Mr Thiessen wrote in his column.\n\n\"He is 82 years old, entering the sunset of his presidency and public life. Because he is never running for office again, he can endure the blowback from the left wing of his party, rise to the moment and clean up this mess for both our parties and for the country.\"\n\nWith barely over seven weeks left in the White House, Mr Biden doesn't have long to make a decision about which pardons he will issue.\n\nOn January 20, he'll hand over pardoning power, along with the keys to the Oval Office, to Trump.\n\nThe incoming president has already flagged a desire to pardon people charged over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump made much of criminal charges he himself faced, calling them political weaponisation and election interference.\n\nThe question of whether he could even pardon himself now seems less likely to be tested.\n\nProsecutors sought to wind up two federal cases against him this week, due to a longstanding precedent against criminally pursuing a sitting president.","summary":"With just a few weeks left of his political career, speculation is mounting about who President Joe Biden might pardon before he leaves office and hands over power to Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-29/joe-biden-pardon-season-julian-assange/104442734","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a6d1406d5f97e2c01e19c8eea61ec536?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2811&cropW=4997&xPos=3&yPos=172&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:29:38","author":"Emilie Gramenz","authors":["Emilie Gramenz"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":268739708,"title":"Trumpism Set To Upset The World By Owei Lakemfa","text":"Unto us, a man-child is again born by the United States, US, electorate. Donald Trump is actually a reincarnation sent to upset the world.\n\nFriends like the European Union and neigbouring Canada are jittery for he is unpredictable and, foes like China are girding their loins. Trump is the weird one the incompetent and visionless Biden administration has given a smooth ride back to the White House.\n\nThe re-emergence of Trump once again raises the question: is it true that the Western democracy that produced Adolf Hitler is the best humanity can offer? This democracy, rather than concentrate on the qualitative development of society based on the greatest good for the greater majority, emphasises a lot on the ballot, and letting the votes count. This is equated with the will of the people and is sacrosanct.\n\nMy earliest reading of the power of the ballot was in the Holy Book when the state had to grant pardon, and there was a ballot between Jesus who was preaching salvation, honesty, good neighbourliness and righteousness, and Barabbas, said to be a robber and notorious prisoner. Barabbas won that election by a moon-slide (Matthew 27: 15-26).\n\nThis November 4, 2024, Americans were, like the Biblical Jews, asked to vote for two contrasting candidates. Where Kamala Harris was an attorney and minister in the temple of justice upholding the law, Donald Trump was a crooked businessman already convicted for falsifying his business records and had even carried out treasonable felony. Where the former has a record of bringing criminals to justice, the latter already had 34 felony convictions. Where Kamala was for human rights, justice, equality and respect for women, Trump has no affinity with human rights, justice or equality, nor respect for women.\n\nA total 76,962,889 Americans voted for Trump, giving him 312 electoral votes to Kamala’s 226 electoral votes.\n\nPreviously, in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton with 65,845,063 votes or 48.2 per cent of the total vote, lost to Donald Trump with 62,980,160 votes or 46.1 per cent of the votes. These are the unique qualities of the American democratic system and the preferences of its electorate.\n\nTrump had threatened his European allies that if he won the election they would have to “pay a big price” for not buying enough American exports. A panicky British government sent party strategists to openly work for Harris.\n\nSo, when Trump won, French President, Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, warned that he might be a danger to Europe. The latter said: “The European Union must stand close together and act in a united manner.”\n\nTrump, even as President-elect has gone to work, doing what he is best known for: unsettling an unsettled world.\n\nThis Monday, November 25, 2024 when Trump threatened China, Canada and Mexico with trade sanctions, the latter, Australia, Turkey, Indonesia and South Korea under a coalition called MIKTA, were engaging Nigerians in Abuja. So, while the US is playing the usual politics of the big powers, those countries are jointly trying to build a global structure of middle powers that can balance out the world.\n\nA boastful Trump had bellowed that when he returns to office on January 20, 2025: “I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 per cent tariff on all products coming into the United States. This tariff will remain in effect until such time as drugs, in particular Fentanyl and all illegal aliens, stop this invasion of our country!” He added: “Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. It is time for them to pay a very big price!”\n\n Trump also declared: “We will be charging China an additional 10 per cent tariff, above any additional tariffs”, until it cracks down on fentanyl smuggling.\n\nChina responded by warning the man-child that a trade war would harm all. Its embassy in Washington declared: “The idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality. China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war.”\n\nCanada took a different path, pleading with Trump. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a phone call tried to shift the blame on Mexico. He said compared to Canada, most of the illegal immigrants Trump is complaining about, cross through US-Mexico border.\n\nBut Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was defiant. She warned Trump: “For every tariff, there will be a response in kind.”\n\nShe told the bully: “It is not with threats or tariffs that the migration phenomenon will be stopped, nor the consumption of drugs in the United States. Seventy per cent of the illegal weapons seized from criminals in Mexico come from your country. Tragically, it is in our country that lives are lost to the violence resulting from meeting the drug demand in yours.”\n\nThe Leader of the Mexican Senate, Gerardo Fernández, in supporting President Sheinbaum, asked: “What tariffs should we impose on their [America’s] goods until they stop consuming drugs and illegally exporting weapons to our homeland?”\n\nThis promises to be a bruising war as the three countries being threatened account for about 40 per cent of the $3.2tn of goods US annually imports.\n\nThe five-country MIKTA alliance founded on September 25, 2013 said in Abuja that they are working for a different trajectory for the world.\n\nTheir ambassadors met a cross section of Nigerian industrialists, technocrats, politicians, diplomats and mass media influencers to talk about their mission, explain how they developed, present opportunities being offered by each of them, and inviting Nigerians to do all-inclusive businesses with them.\n\nAustralian High Commissioner, Leilani Bin-Juda, said her country’s commitment to sustainability and green energy is an example for other countries. She informed that Australia’s contribution under the Paris Agreement is 43 per cent reduction from 2005 levels to net zero by 2050. The plan, she said, includes an 82 per cent target for renewable energy by 2030. Australia, she said, is offering Nigeria technology that allows remote and rural households to be electrified.\n\nSouth Korean Ambassador, Kim Pankyu, talked about his country’s journey from a war-torn, impoverished and authoritarian state into a developed one. Ambassador Hidayet Bayraktar of Turkey said his country had emerged as a vital trade and investment hub, and bridge between Europe and Asia.\n\nAmbassador Alfredo Miranda of Mexico informed that his country has become a manufacturing powerhouse and global leader in electronics, automotive and aerospace production.\n\nIndonesian Ambassador, Usra Hendra Harahap, said his country’s success in balancing security efforts with economic priorities would be beneficial to Nigeria.\n\nIt remains to be seen how such alliances would operate in a world under the shadow of Trump.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/11/trumpism-set-to-upset-the-world-by-owei-lakemfa/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Owei-e1685083829970.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:29:31","author":"Emmanuel Okogba","authors":["Emmanuel Okogba"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.121},{"id":268739788,"title":"Loyal and feisty, Donald Trump Jr emerges as enforcer for his father","text":"Washington: Ivanka and Jared left the White House behind for a life in Miami.

Earlier in the NewsNation interview, the Morgan & Morgan founder on Monday suggested Harris would face ongoing scrutiny about financial management, predicting donors would question the allocation of funds, New York Post reported.According to Morgan, the financial support was primarily anti-Trump rather than pro-Harris. He noted that supporters were more motivated by opposition to Trump than enthusiasm for Harris.A notable expenditure included $900,000 for Harris' image on the Las Vegas Sphere, despite ultimately losing Nevada. The campaign's total advertising costs reached $494 million.Morgan highlighted the substantial commissions and payments involved, suggesting numerous individuals profited significantly from anti-Trump donors.Despite acknowledging Harris' debate performance, Morgan criticised the overall campaign. He revealed his early opposition to her nomination and highlighted her significant defeat.The donor discussed Harris' absence from a White House event, noting she had travelled to Hawaii whilst Biden farewelled supporters.there were several Democrats also didn’t immediately support Harris as the party’s nominee, including former President Barack Obama, and former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi — who’s viewed as the one behind Biden’s ouster from the ticket.“Obama did not want her. Obama did not endorse her for five days. Pelosi did not want her. Pelosi told her California delegation ‘there would be a conference, a caucus, there’d be a convention,'” New York quoted Morgan saying.Morgan ridiculed the Democrats’ game plan that ran on “democracy, democracy, democracy,” before the party ditched democracy and chose Harris despite no primary votes being cast for her.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-should-go-away-and-never-come-back-democratic-megadonor-john-morgan-after-2-billion-campaign-loss/articleshow/115786157.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115786342/115786342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:25:30","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":268742266,"title":"Putin is playing ‘nuclear blackmail’ with Oreshnik missiles and threats to blitz west are BLUFF, ex-Russia PM says","text":"VLADIMIR Putin is playing \"nuclear blackmail\" with his new hypersonic missiles and his threats are a bluff, his ex-Prime Minister says.\n\nPutin has threatened to turn Kyiv “to dust” with his new Oreshnik bombs - saying multiple strikes would be akin to a nuclear bomb.\n\nBut Mikhail Kasyanov, who was PM during Putin's first presidency, said Putin is \"undertaking nuclear blackmailing\".\n\nKasyanov said the tyrant is bluffing as he seeks to draw concessions from the West.\n\nHe told Times Radio: \"Any concession, diplomatic concession, he (Putin) takes as a weak link.

To achieve fiscal growth, he advocates a dual approach of optimising tax revenues and transforming governance practices.\n\nCentral to his recommendations is the establishment of a Department of Efficiency, Innovation, and Transformation — a model he noted was inspired by global leaders like Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher, who prioritised cutting government waste and improving operational efficiency.\n\n“There is far too much waste of government resources in Nigeria,” he said, emphasising that efficiency measures could significantly reduce unnecessary expenditures. By redirecting these savings, he believes the government could invest in productive sectors like manufacturing, education, and healthcare.\n\nAgbakoba also underscored the need for imaginative solutions to cushion the impact of ongoing economic hardship.\n\nHe proposed waiving fees for primary and secondary education and introducing free healthcare modelled after the United Kingdom’s National Health Service system. These initiatives, he argued, would alleviate the burden on Nigerians while fostering long-term human capital development. \n\nAdditionally, he called for quantitative easing measures and substantial borrowing to revitalise the manufacturing sector, ensuring that production replaces excessive government consumption.\n\nTo build a lean and effective government, Dr. Agbakoba recommended decentralising federal power by empowering states and local governments. He also stressed the need for autonomy in key sectors like education, which he believes has been stifled by decades of underfunding and tight federal control.\n\n“Government must let go of its unnecessary hold on education,” he noted, suggesting that an independent and well-funded education system could resolve long-standing disputes, such as those with the Academic Staff Union of Universities while improving the quality of learning.\n\nAs the nation braces for the implications of what he describes as the country’s largest budget yet, Agbakoba’s insights serve as a clarion call for leaders to adopt bold reforms that prioritise efficiency, innovation, and the well-being of all Nigerians.\n\nOn Tuesday, the National Assembly refuted social media claims that President Bola Tinubu would present the 2025 budget to a joint session on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Secretary of Research and Information at the National Assembly, Dr. Ali Umoru, the assembly described the reports as false.\n\nHe urged the public to disregard the information, emphasising that the legislative body had yet to approve the 2024-2026 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper, which must precede the national budget presentation.","summary":"As Nigeria is set to unveil its national budget for 2025, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Dr. Olisa Agbakoba, has sought an end to the wastage of the country’s resources through governance.

An opportunity — if not for lasting peace, then at least for an end to the ongoing conflicts and the prevention of new ones — is, in fact, knocking. The question is whether political leaders will open the door.Israel has decimated the military capability of both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But continuing military action on its part is running up against the law of diminishing returns as fewer high-value targets are left.Moreover, continued military efforts threaten the country’s regional and global standing. The International Criminal Court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is the latest indication of the political isolation and economic sanctions that could become Israel’s fate unless it changes course.The case for a ceasefire on both fronts is strong. The recent agreement between Israel and Hezbollah requires Hezbollah (which is so weakened that it dropped its insistence that a ceasefire in southern Lebanon be linked to one in Gaza) to move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani river, away from the border with Israel. Lebanese troops will patrol southern Lebanon, and the Israel defence forces will withdraw from the area and agree not to maintain a presence. Israel has obtained assurances that under certain conditions, it would still be able to take military action against Hezbollah to frustrate the group’s attempts to reconstitute itself along the border or if it were preparing to attack.This accord, if it holds, permits some 60,000 Israelis to return to their homes after more than a year of displacement. In addition, the ceasefire will allow Israel’s exhausted and overextended military to recover and focus on other challenges, including Iran, which is inching ever closer to developing a nuclear-weapons capability that would pose an existential threat to Israel. And the ceasefire should also spare Lebanon and its people further devastation.Yes, the ceasefire will also allow Hezbollah a degree of time and space to regroup, which is why some in Israel oppose it. That said, open-ended military operations will accomplish little, as Hezbollah can be weakened but not eliminated. Israel’s past failed occupation of southern Lebanon demonstrates as much. Israel’s goal, which this agreement puts within reach, should be to restore deterrence.Gaza poses a more difficult challenge. It is not clear that Hamas would agree to a ceasefire, although it is much weakened militarily and might have difficulty resisting one if Israel agrees to terms that are widely deemed reasonable.But will Israel agree? It should, because a ceasefire would allow the return of the more than one hundred remaining hostages in Gaza, half of whom Israeli intelligence services believe are still alive. Moreover, as with Lebanon, it is far from clear that Israel stands to gain from continuing military operations in Gaza.Hamas is certainly unable to launch another attack like the one it carried out on October 7, 2023. But Israel’s refusal to start a diplomatic process that would give Palestinians a chance to secure elements of their nationalist aspirations has made it possible for Hamas — with its insistence on endless struggle — to remain relevant.The big question, then, is whether Israel would agree to a political process that holds out the possibility (however distant, conditional and vague in terms of territorial reach) of creating a Palestinian state. In the near term, such a process would pave the way for the entry into Gaza of a regional stabilisation force and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Over time, a Palestinian state, properly constituted, would enable Israel to remain both Jewish and democratic as well as prosperous and secure.Some in Israel much prefer a future that allows for Israeli settlement of parts of Gaza and annexation of large swaths of the West Bank. And if they do not get their way, they have vocally threatened to bring down Netanyahu’s government. That is a risk Netanyahu has been loath to take, given that, once out of office, he faces pending legal action and official investigations into Israel’s failure to anticipate and respond to Hamas’s October 7 attack.Donald Trump, whose return to the Oval Office on January 20 is already looming over these dynamics, could prove to be the critical variable. While the Israeli right sees his return as an opportunity to achieve maximalist aims, even calling 2025 the year of Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank and an opportunity to begin reducing Gaza’s Palestinian population through “voluntary emigration”, Trump has expressed a desire to calm the region.Trump is in a position to achieve this goal. Owing to events in Lebanon, Netanyahu may be sufficiently strong to stare down his right-wing coalition partners, form a new government without them, or even get a fresh mandate from the voters. And even if not, Trump, whom the Israeli right sees as a friend, could lean on Netanyahu and his government in a way that President Joe Biden never could. It would be more difficult for Netanyahu to resist Trump’s pressure and much easier for Trump to apply and sustain such pressure, given his support among American evangelicals and certain American-Jewish communities.Richard Nixon comes to mind. Nixon, it is said, was able to reach out to Mao’s China because he alone didn’t have to worry about Nixon.Much the same now applies to Trump. He could build on the ceasefire in Lebanon and press for one in Gaza, launching what would be a promising diplomatic process. Pulling this off would constitute quite a coup for the 47th President.

The clip shows McMahon, co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), in a dramatic encounter with wrestler Glenn Jacobs, better known as \"Kane,\" on an episode of Monday Night Raw. In the clip, Jacobs executes a tombstone piledriver, a move that flips McMahon upside down and slams her onto the floor as part of a choreographed skit. McMahon appears unconscious as the sequence ends.\n\nThe clip, originally filmed in the early 2000s, has garnered millions of views across platforms, with social media users expressing disbelief at McMahon’s WWE history. One X (formerly Twitter) user commented, “This is exactly what the entire world imagines US politics to be like,” while another wrote, “So the government is just for entertainment they don't actually do anything 90% of the time?” One more chimed in, \"Trump became president twice, nothing can be a surprise anymore.\"\n\nOthers were more tongue-in-cheek, with one saying, Still more realistic than 99% of most politicians.\" \"I respect her for that… people can’t have a little fun in [their] life because [they're] into politics. we are all humans.\" another opined. However, McMahon’s ties to WWE go beyond her role as co-founder. She has appeared in numerous wrestling skits alongside her family, including her children, Stephanie and Shane McMahon. In these segments, Linda engaged in scripted physical confrontations with her children, who also hit back in some instances.\n\nTrump announced McMahon’s appointment as education secretary on Tuesday, praising her commitment to education reform. “As Secretary of Education, Linda will fight tirelessly to expand 'Choice' to every State in America, and empower parents to make the best Education decisions for families,” Trump said in a statement. He emphasized that McMahon would lead efforts to shift educational control back to the states.\n\nHowever, this is not Linda's first foray into politics. She served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) during Trump’s first term, a role she described as 'immensely rewarding.' Her appointment to the SBA earned bipartisan recognition, especially from Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, who had defeated her in two Senate races. Blumenthal referred to her as a 'person of serious accomplishment and ability,' while Murphy called her a 'talented and experienced businessperson.'\n\nBefore her role in Trump’s administration, McMahon ran twice for the U.S. Senate as a Connecticut Republican, losing in 2010 and 2012, as per Fox News. Despite these defeats, she remained politically active, chairing the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and later co-founding the America First Policy Institute. Her political activities have consistently aligned with Trump’s vision, including her $6 million contribution to his 2016 campaign after he secured the Republican nomination.\n\nHowever, Linda has also faced controversies during her career.

The NPS notes that in 1827 — as editor of “Boston’s Ladies Magazine” — Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday. \n\nLincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 — during the height of the Civil War — he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day. \n\nBut it wasn’t until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November. \n\nThanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table. \n\nPresidential turkey pardons\n\nThe first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association. \n\nLincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family’s Christmas dinner in 1863. \n\nBut the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon. \n\nThe WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush — as documented by the association — speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: “He’s granted a presidential pardon as of right now.”\n\nOn Monday, President Biden issued the final two turkey pardons of his term, to Peach and Blossom, sending them to live out the rest of their lives at Minnesota’s Farmamerica as poultry ambassadors for agricultural students.\n\nGathering with family and friends\n\nAside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country. \n\nThe first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room. \n\nThe tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson’s first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one — and one without cranberries. \n\nIn recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called “go-to” vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump spent all but one Thanksgiving of his first term at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Biden has spent every Thanksgiving during his term with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts as the Biden family has for over 40 years.","summary":"The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.  During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.  The official &#8230;\n\n\nThe post The White House&#8217;s history with Thanksgiving, and how the turkey pardon came to be appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/the-white-houses-history-with-thanksgiving-and-how-the-turkey-pardon-came-to-be/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/28/f0d8ea72-d1a6-4bb6-9337-de9320c5700a/thumbnail/1200x630/06d641e61a1ee5aede7836bf01e43d09/gettyimages-2186821232.jpg?v=e3aa8b4a58817620ee227c79202c9709","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:05:08","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.356},{"id":268735930,"title":"PRITI PATEL: Why one of the worst deals in history is quickly unravelling","text":"PRITI PATEL: Why one of the worst deals in history is quickly unravelling\n\nFollow DailyMail.com's politics live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy PRITI PATEL\n\nPublished: 00:00 GMT, 29 November 2024 | Updated: 00:00 GMT, 29 November 2024\n\nLabour's botched plans to hand over the sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius is unravelling.\n\nThe new Mauritian prime minister has reportedly questioned the proposed treaty, including the way it was agreed before the country's general election took place.\n\nIndividuals in the incoming US administration have raised concerns. And the Chagossian community have been angered over how they have been sidelined, with some protesting outside the British Embassy in Mauritius.\n\nJonathan Powell, the Prime Minister's Special Envoy conducting the negotiations and a former senior aide to Tony Blair, has been racking up the air miles travelling the globe to try to salvage the plans.\n\nBut all we know about this are comments from government sources and commentary from Mauritius and the US, because Labour ministers are unwilling to answer questions about what is happening.\n\nWhile there is a growing caucus criticising the plans, we saw Foreign Secretary David Lammy bragging in a parliamentary committee this week that he was 'really pleased with the deal struck' while refusing to give any details of the costs and impact on our defence and security interests.\n\nWhat we do know is Mr Lammy and Keir Starmer are prepared to give away the Chagos Islands, then use taxpayers' money to pay for the privilege, which would be one of the worst deals in history, and they are desperate to rush this through before US President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. \n\nThere's a strong suspicion that a cosy cabal of Left-wing international law obsessives in the Labour Party are casting aside our national interests in favour of appeasing the view of some fellow lawyers.\n\nKeir Starmer and David Lammy are prepared to give away the Chagos Islands, then use taxpayers' money to pay for the privilege, which would be one of the worst deals in history\n\nChagossians living in the UK protest at College Green against the Government's decision to hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius \n\nSo if they are prepared to give away our overseas territories on the whim of campaigners and capitulate this quickly to an advisory opinion, what will they do next?\n\nJames Cleverly blasts 'weak' handover of Chagos despite starting talks two years ago\n\nLet's be clear. The Chagos Islands are in a prized strategic location supporting our defence interests and our American partners to project power in the Indian Ocean.\n\nWith the growing challenges posed by China and the significant global threats and uncertainties we face, it is unacceptable for the Labour Government to weaken our defences.\n\nWe need the Chagos Islands to stay under British sovereignty, not be bargained away by secretive dodgy dealings.\n\nChagos handover still on, Starmer insists\n\nby Harriet Line \n\nBritain is 'engaging' with the new government of Mauritius to take forward the deal to hand over the Chagos Islands, Keir Starmer insisted yesterday.\n\nAmid criticism from the new leader of Mauritius and the incoming Trump administration, the Prime Minister defended the 'good deal'.\n\nThe UK agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands, also known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, to Mauritius in October.\n\nMinisters said the agreement had secured the long-term future of a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia, the largest of the islands.\n\nBut critics have warned it risks allowing China to gain a military foothold in the region. New Mauritian prime minister Navin Ramgoolam, a critic of the deal before he took office, reportedly repeated his reservations after a meeting with the UK's national security adviser Jonathan Powell on Monday.\n\nThe UK agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands, also known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, to Mauritius in October\n\nA map of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean.

It secures the base that's in the vital interests of the US and the UK. And we are already engaging with the new administration in Mauritius as to how we take that forward.'\n\nDowning Street earlier denied that there was an effort to get the deal done and dusted before Mr Trump's inauguration in mid-January.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We haven't set a timeline to ratify the deal and we don't intend to put a timeline on it.'\n\nLabourPriti PatelKeir StarmerChina\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPRITI PATEL: Why one of the worst deals in history is quickly unravelling\n\nAdd comment","summary":"PRITI PATEL: Labour's botched plans to hand over the sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius is unravelling.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14138701/PRITI-PATEL-one-worst-deals-history-quickly-unravelling.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/28/23/92606851-0-image-m-127_1732838346735.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29 00:03:03","author":"Editor,Priti Patel","authors":["Editor","Priti Patel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.082},{"id":268735624,"title":"We Are Thankful For A Collapse Of Liberal Networks This Year N2648377","text":"There is so much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving—President-elect Donald Trump's sweeping win, a massive red wave hitting the United States, and most notably, the downfall of liberal mainstream media. \n\nMSNBC and CNN’s ratings have plummeted to unimaginative numbers post-election— with the Hallmark channel surging past the liberal networks. \n\nThe Hallmark channel, known for its romantic, feel-good holiday programming, outperformed MSNBC and CNN, averaging 526,00 viewers at any given time from November 18 to 24. On the other hand, MSNBC garnered only 458,000 viewers during the same period, while CNN had a mere 314,000. \n\nBefore it launched its Christmas movie lineup on October 18, the network had an average of only 387,000 viewers daily. \n\nThis comes as viewership for mainstream news outlets has plummeted by nearly half in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election. MSNBC’s viewership has dropped by 47 percent, while CNN’s has also seen a double-digit drop, decreasing from 754,000 to 398,000 viewers or 47 percent. \n\nDespite one network executive describing the 51-year-old anchor as “ratings Viagra,” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow might have lost the most viewers in such a short period. Since Election Day, the left-wing host’s show has seen a 41 percent decrease in total viewers and a 50 percent drop in the key 25-54 demographic. This week, Maddow’s show experienced its lowest viewership of the year and its worst performance in this critical demographic since 2015.\n\nMaddow wasn’t the only liberal host to see a drop in ratings. Her colleague, Joe Scarborough, host of “Morning Joe,” lost 37 percent of its audience since November 5. \n\nAs ratings continue to drop after Trump’s sweeping victory, mainstream media outlets are looking to draft a complete overhaul of their networks, including program changes, shakeups among household names, and pay cuts. \n\nMaddow’s contract was quietly renewed but under very different conditions from previous years.\n\nMost notably, Maddow made a fool of herself after crying on-air that she had to take a $5 million pay cut and will now make only $25 million yearly for the next five years. So, while you say your thanks for your family, memories, and friends, make sure to throw a Hail Mary to Maddow so that she can still afford her multi-million dollar mansion. \n\n“This is a difficult time, and they needed to keep her,” an executive told The Ankler. “No one else can do what she does. You can’t build a brand like it overnight.”\n\nRace-baiting MSNBC host Joy Reid’s show, “The ReidOut,” and the “11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle \" also saw historic ratings drops. This has reportedly caused “anxiety” among liberal network staffers who face an uncertain future. \n\nThis came at a time when Comcast announced it would spin off several NBC channels, including MSNBC and CNBC, into its own company. The effort, SpinCo, is expected to be done by the end of 2025, with executives hopeful the company will make a comeback to ratings it saw after Trump won his first term in office. \n\nTo compare, Fox News has seen a massive surge in ratings, with viewership increasing 32 percent or 19 million viewers, since Trump won the election. The network’s primetime programs saw their ratings rise to 3.2 million, an 86 percent jump in total viewers.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/11/28/we-are-thankful-for-a-collapse-of-liberal-networks-this-year-n2648377","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/222/8ca5eb84-3f81-48f9-bb34-ad02511164b6.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-29

efforts to deepen security ties","text":"Seoul’s efforts to improve ties with Tokyo have hit a snag over a commemoration of Korean victims of Japan’s colonial past.\nObservers warn that the bilateral tensions come at a critical time when South Korea and Japan need closer cooperation to address global challenges, including the coming return of the Donald Trump administration and its impact on regional security.\nIn a rare public display of discord with Tokyo, South Korea’s conservative government of President Yoon Suk-yeol on Sunday boycotted the first memorial service for Korean wartime labourers at the Sado gold mine in Japan, recently registered as a Unesco World Heritage site.\n“This is a blow to the Yoon administration, which has worked hard to mend ties with Tokyo despite facing political backlash,” said Cho Byung-jae, a veteran diplomat and former head of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.\n“At a time when Yoon’s approval ratings are low, this diplomatic misstep could further hinder progress in relations with Tokyo and trilateral security cooperation with the United States,” Cho told This Week in Asia.\n\nCritics argue that Japan mishandled the memorial, failing to acknowledge Korean labourers were forced to work at the Sado mine during its colonial rule of the Korean peninsula (1910–1945).\n“Tokyo should have at least made a symbolic effort to cooperate with Seoul in this issue as both countries face shared challenges, especially with the potential return of Trump, who is likely to push for reduced US global involvement and greater security responsibilities on allies”, Cho Byung-jae said.\nSouth Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul acknowledged the diplomatic fallout on Wednesday.\n“I take full responsibility for how things have turned out,” he said upon returning from the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy.\nHe criticised Japan for failing to honour its commitments to South Korea and the international community.\n“We regret that Japan did not fulfil the promises made during the World Heritage registration process,” he added, vowing to raise the issue with the World Heritage Committee.\n\nThe memorial service dispute highlighted long-standing tensions.\nJapan’s speech at the event, shared with Seoul only hours before, avoided terms like “forced labour” and instead expressed “gratitude” for the workers.\nSimilarly, a nearby museum exhibit on Korean labourers conspicuously omitted references to forced labour despite prior agreements.\nSeoul also took issue with Japan’s choice of representative at the event – Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice-minister who had allegedly visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honours Japanese war criminals, among others.\nSouth Korea reportedly asked Japan to change the representative only to be turned down.\nDuring her remarks, Ikuina acknowledged that “many people from the Korean peninsula endured dangerous and harsh conditions at the mines” but avoided mentioning forced labour or Japan’s colonial past.\nFrustrated, South Korean officials and a group of bereaved families held a separate ceremony near the Sado mine – located on the island of Sado in Niigata prefecture – to honour the victims.\n\n“This incident reflects Seoul’s growing frustration with Tokyo’s unwillingness to cooperate on historical issues,” said Cho Jin-goo, head of the Japan Research Center at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Eastern Studies.\nThe controversy over historical sites built during Japan’s wartime era is not new.\nIn 2015, South Korea consented to the registration of Hashima Island (Battleship Island) as a Unesco World Heritage site, despite its history of forced Korean labour.\nCritics say Japan failed to deliver on promises to accurately depict the site’s history.\nThe Yoon administration, already facing criticism for compensating forced labour victims with domestic funds and approving the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant, is facing increased pressure from South Koreans.\n“This highlights the importance of properly managing historical disputes,” said Cho.\n“Failing to do so risks undermining the fragile South Korea-US-Japan security cooperation,” he told This Week in Asia.","summary":"President Yoon Suk-yeol has boycotted the mine’s commemoration in Japan, purportedly over Tokyo’s failure to recognise

Kellogg’s role could make him a critical figure in Trump’s plans.\n\nBut who is Kellogg – and what is known about the general’s own views on the war, and on how to end it?\n\nWho is Keith Kellogg?\n\nKellogg, 80, is a retired lieutenant general. He was the chief of staff for the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term from 2017 to 2021. He was also the national security adviser to Mike Pence, who was Trump’s vice president at the time.\n\nKellogg is a Vietnam War veteran and he was also sent to Iraq to work in the transitional government after the US-led invasion of the country in 2003.\n\n“He was with me right from the beginning!” Trump wrote, announcing Kellogg’s nomination on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe special envoy position is new and points to Trump’s emphasis on diplomacy to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nWhat is Kellogg’s plan to end the war in Ukraine?\n\nIn April this year, Kellogg co-authored a strategy paper, with former US government official Fred Fleitz, saying that the US should negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nThe paper blames President Joe Biden’s administration for the continuing Ukraine war. Specifically, it faults the US decision to arm Ukraine and the failure of diplomacy with Russia. It additionally accuses Biden of promoting a proxy war with Russia, through Ukraine.\n\nThe plan was published by the nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute (AFPI), established by former Trump officials in 2021. Kellogg’s plan calls for an “America First” approach to the war.\n\nKellogg’s article argues – echoing Trump in many ways – that “a strong and decisive president who stood up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, “would have prevented Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There is no evidence to suggest that Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was based on his assessment of Biden as weak, as Kellogg and Fleitz suggest.\n\nKellogg’s plan argues for a formal US policy to end the war, seeking a “ceasefire and negotiated settlement”.\n\nUnder this plan:\n\nThe US would continue to arm Ukraine to allow it to defend itself against Russia. However, future US military aid would be contingent on Ukraine participating in peace talks with Russia.\nIn order to convince Putin to join peace talks, NATO leaders should offer to hold off on Ukraine’s NATO membership application.\nAdditionally, Russia could be offered some sanctions relief, contingent on it signing a peace agreement with Ukraine.\nIt also calls for charging levies on Russian energy sales to use for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\nCould Kellogg’s Ukraine plan work?\n\nKellogg has to deal with the fact that there are two parties involved who hold different positions on how the war should end, Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Russia will negotiate until it feels like it is in a comfortable position,” Giles said. “For Ukraine, a pause in fighting can be disastrous,” he added.\n\nGiles, who is also the author of an upcoming book, Who Will Defend Europe? explained that Western backers of Ukraine will inevitably see a ceasefire as the crisis ending. “Meanwhile, Russia will be preparing for its next move”.\n\nHe added that Kellogg will also have to ensure he has the cooperation of other officials in the upcoming Trump administration. Plans that people lay out when they are not in government do not necessarily translate into plans they enact when they are in government, he said.\n\nKellogg’s suggestions generally contradict Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s “victory plan” for the war. Ukraine’s admission into NATO is at the heart of his plan.\n\nThe idea of holding off NATO membership for Ukraine is “one of the ways the US can exert leverage on Ukraine, but it is a misguided attempt,” Giles said, adding that Ukraine’s admission into NATO is the only long-term solution to the region’s conundrum.\n\nWhile NATO members have assured Ukraine that it is on an “irreversible” path to membership, members of the alliance are sceptical of admitting Ukraine while it is at war with Russia. This is because Ukraine being part of NATO would immediately mean that the alliance as a whole would be at war with Moscow.\n\nZelenskyy’s plan also calls for a sustained supply of economic and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Meanwhile, in Kellogg’s plan, the supply of arms to Ukraine is conditional.\n\nWhere does Trump stand on the Ukraine war?\n\nWhile Trump has pledged to promptly end the war in Ukraine, he has not spelled out details for the exact course of action he would take to accomplish this.\n\n“I have a very exacting plan on how to stop Ukraine and Russia,” he said in a podcast interview in September. “I can’t give you those plans because if I give you those plans, I’m not going to be able to use them. They’ll be unsuccessful. Part of it’s surprise.”\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call on November 7, asking him not to escalate the war and expressing interest in having further conversations to resolve the conflict. Russia denied that the call took place. On November 11, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described reports of the call as “pure fiction” and told reporters that Putin had no concrete plans of speaking to Trump.\n\nThe Republican president-elect has argued that the Biden administration is funding and arming an open-ended war in Ukraine that does not benefit the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s Vice President JD Vance fleshed out some of the details of what Trump’s plan would potentially be, in an interview for the Shawn Ryan Show.

The film had been in the works for well over a decade, and it was finally released on August 30. \n\nQuaid was all over TV promoting the movie and even showed up at the Republican National Convention. He talked at length on numerous shows about his patriotism and how Reagan had been his favorite president, and he even ended up speaking at rallies on behalf of President Donald Trump just before the election. It's been kind of refreshing to see a Hollywood A-lister who seems to love his country, especially when some actors like to go overseas and bash the United States. \n\nBut something about this movie doesn't quite add up. More specifically, reviews from movie critics and reviews from everyday people who have seen the movie don't quite add up. I'm guessing the reason is that liberals can't seem to ever look at anything without seeing it as some sort of attack on their political beliefs, even if it's simply meant to be entertainment. \n\nThe movie review website Rotten Tomatoes is probably the best example of this. Of course, we already know that Rotten Tomatoes leans to the left. But the site offers a \"Tomatometer\" for movies, which is an aggregate score of professional film critics' reviews, and a \"Popcornmeter\" score, which represents reviews left by actual movie audiences. In September, the Washington Times reported that \"Reagan\" had the widest gap between audience and critic reviews in the history of Rotten Tomatoes. As I write this, Rotten Tomatoes shows \"Reagan\" as having a 98% favorable rating from audiences, and just an 18% perfect favorable rating from critics.\n\nJames Carrick, the founder of the movie review site Worth It Or Woke?, told Fox News that he's noticed that the higher the discrepancy between critics and audiences on these types of movie reviews, the more likely the critics' reviews are biased towards 'leftists messages and elements' in films. \n\nThe general consensus from critics, according to Rotten Tomatoes, is that \"While 'Reagan' the movie undoubtedly admires Reagan the man, its cloying and glossy rendering of history flattens the 40th U.S. President into caricature.\" Many tossed around the term \"hagiography.\" Here are a few samples from some of those reviews: \n\nBilge Ebiri, the critic for New York Magazine and Vulture said, \"Without any lifelike characters, it’s hard to find oneself caring, and thus, Reagan’s dedication to such narrow themes proves limiting.\" \n\nSean Burns of North Shore Movies called it a \"children’s film for the adult diaper set.\" \n\nAdam Nayman of The Ringer said, \"It’s a thin line between satire and self-parody, and more sophisticated directors than McNamara have tripped all over it. Reagan looks a bit like a berserk Saturday Night Live sketch, or maybe a biopic parody à la Walk Hard.\" \n\nDespite these types of reviews, the movie did really well at the box office, grossing $30.1 million, spending time in the top five, and surpassing numerous other presidential biopics. And it's doing even better with home audiences. The film was made available on DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital platforms on November 19, and it's still breaking records. \n\nUpon its release, it \"topped Amazon's Best Sellers in Movies & TV and Best Sellers in Blu-ray charts over the weekend, leapfrogging past 'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse,' 'Despicable Me 4' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy' set,\" according to a press release. Currently, on Thanksgiving Day, it's holding steady at the number four spot on Amazon's Best Sellers in Movies & TV list, beating out movies from several popular franchises.\n\nFor what it's worth, not everyone in Hollywood hated the film. Nathaniel Bell, who reviews movies for LA Weekly and the Village Voice, said, \"The result is a political biopic with the heartbeat of a faith-based drama — earnest and aiming to inspire rather than provoke.\" He added, \"it may make liberal and conservative alike long for the days when the leader of the free world could make a quip that would cause even his political opponents to crack a smile.\" \n\nBut Bell is definitely in the minority. I can't imagine a lot of people are flocking to see or buy a movie that the majority of critics say is terrible unless those critics are letting their political bias show and not actually providing an accurate review. Personally, I haven't seen \"Reagan\" yet myself, but I've heard good things from friends, and it's on my list for viewing this holiday season. I'd love to hear what you thought of it. Let me know in the comment section.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/sarah-anderson/2024/11/28/something-about-the-reagan-movie-doesnt-quite-add-up-n4934696","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/242/9f7b5935-cb53-4a6a-9d1d-62daa4f13057.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 23:48:31","author":"Sarah Anderson","authors":["Sarah Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.152},{"id":268733742,"title":"How Does Trump Envoy Keith Kellogg Want To End The Russia Ukraine War","text":"United States President-elect Donald Trump has picked a retired general, Keith Kellogg, to be his special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nTrump has made ending the war – now on for nearly three years – a centrepiece of his foreign policy promises. Kellogg’s role could make him a critical figure in Trump’s plans.\n\nBut who is Kellogg – and what is known about the general’s own views on the war, and on how to end it?\n\nWho is Keith Kellogg?\n\nKellogg, 80, is a retired lieutenant general. He was the chief of staff for the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term from 2017 to 2021. He was also the national security adviser to Mike Pence, who was Trump’s vice president at the time.\n\nKellogg is a Vietnam War veteran and he was also sent to Iraq to work in the transitional government after the US-led invasion of the country in 2003.\n\n“He was with me right from the beginning!” Trump wrote, announcing Kellogg’s nomination on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe special envoy position is new and points to Trump’s emphasis on diplomacy to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nWhat is Kellogg’s plan to end the war in Ukraine?\n\nIn April this year, Kellogg co-authored a strategy paper, with former US government official Fred Fleitz, saying that the US should negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nThe paper blames President Joe Biden’s administration for the continuing Ukraine war. Specifically, it faults the US decision to arm Ukraine and the failure of diplomacy with Russia. It additionally accuses Biden of promoting a proxy war with Russia, through Ukraine.\n\nThe plan was published by the nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute (AFPI), established by former Trump officials in 2021. Kellogg’s plan calls for an “America First” approach to the war.\n\nKellogg’s article argues – echoing Trump in many ways – that “a strong and decisive president who stood up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, “would have prevented Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There is no evidence to suggest that Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was based on his assessment of Biden as weak, as Kellogg and Fleitz suggest.\n\nKellogg’s plan argues for a formal US policy to end the war, seeking a “ceasefire and negotiated settlement”.\n\nUnder this plan:\n\nThe US would continue to arm Ukraine to allow it to defend itself against Russia. However, future US military aid would be contingent on Ukraine participating in peace talks with Russia.\nIn order to convince Putin to join peace talks, NATO leaders should offer to hold off on Ukraine’s NATO membership application.\nAdditionally, Russia could be offered some sanctions relief, contingent on it signing a peace agreement with Ukraine.\nIt also calls for charging levies on Russian energy sales to use for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\nCould Kellogg’s Ukraine plan work?\n\nKellogg has to deal with the fact that there are two parties involved who hold different positions on how the war should end, Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Russia will negotiate until it feels like it is in a comfortable position,” Giles said. “For Ukraine, a pause in fighting can be disastrous,” he added.\n\nGiles, who is also the author of an upcoming book, Who Will Defend Europe? explained that Western backers of Ukraine will inevitably see a ceasefire as the crisis ending. “Meanwhile, Russia will be preparing for its next move”.\n\nHe added that Kellogg will also have to ensure he has the cooperation of other officials in the upcoming Trump administration. Plans that people lay out when they are not in government do not necessarily translate into plans they enact when they are in government, he said.\n\nKellogg’s suggestions generally contradict Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s “victory plan” for the war. Ukraine’s admission into NATO is at the heart of his plan.\n\nThe idea of holding off NATO membership for Ukraine is “one of the ways the US can exert leverage on Ukraine, but it is a misguided attempt,” Giles said, adding that Ukraine’s admission into NATO is the only long-term solution to the region’s conundrum.\n\nWhile NATO members have assured Ukraine that it is on an “irreversible” path to membership, members of the alliance are sceptical of admitting Ukraine while it is at war with Russia. This is because Ukraine being part of NATO would immediately mean that the alliance as a whole would be at war with Moscow.\n\nZelenskyy’s plan also calls for a sustained supply of economic and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Meanwhile, in Kellogg’s plan, the supply of arms to Ukraine is conditional.\n\nWhere does Trump stand on the Ukraine war?\n\nWhile Trump has pledged to promptly end the war in Ukraine, he has not spelled out details for the exact course of action he would take to accomplish this.\n\n“I have a very exacting plan on how to stop Ukraine and Russia,” he said in a podcast interview in September. “I can’t give you those plans because if I give you those plans, I’m not going to be able to use them. They’ll be unsuccessful. Part of it’s surprise.”\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call on November 7, asking him not to escalate the war and expressing interest in having further conversations to resolve the conflict. Russia denied that the call took place. On November 11, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described reports of the call as “pure fiction” and told reporters that Putin had no concrete plans of speaking to Trump.\n\nThe Republican president-elect has argued that the Biden administration is funding and arming an open-ended war in Ukraine that does not benefit the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s Vice President JD Vance fleshed out some of the details of what Trump’s plan would potentially be, in an interview for the Shawn Ryan Show. The episode was released in September.\n\nVance said that Trump would begin negotiations with leaders from Moscow, Kyiv and Europe for a “peaceful settlement”.\n\n“And what it probably looks like is the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine, that becomes like a demilitarised zone.”\n\nWithout specifying the exact location of the demilitarised zone, Vance said that it would be heavily fortified to ensure Russia does not invade again.

Plans that people lay out when they are not in government do not necessarily translate into plans they enact when they are in government, he said.\n\nKellogg’s suggestions generally contradict Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s “victory plan” for the war. Ukraine’s admission into NATO is at the heart of his plan.\n\nThe idea of holding off NATO membership for Ukraine is “one of the ways the US can exert leverage on Ukraine, but it is a misguided attempt,” Giles said, adding that Ukraine’s admission into NATO is the only long-term solution to the region’s conundrum.\n\nWhile NATO members have assured Ukraine that it is on an “irreversible” path to membership, members of the alliance are sceptical of admitting Ukraine while it is at war with Russia. This is because Ukraine being part of NATO would immediately mean that the alliance as a whole would be at war with Moscow.\n\nZelenskyy’s plan also calls for a sustained supply of economic and military aid to Ukraine from its allies. Meanwhile, in Kellogg’s plan, the supply of arms to Ukraine is conditional.\n\nWhere does Trump stand on the Ukraine war?\n\nWhile Trump has pledged to promptly end the war in Ukraine, he has not spelled out details for the exact course of action he would take to accomplish this.\n\n“I have a very exacting plan on how to stop Ukraine and Russia,” he said in a podcast interview in September. “I can’t give you those plans because if I give you those plans, I’m not going to be able to use them. They’ll be unsuccessful. Part of it’s surprise.”\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump spoke to Putin in a phone call on November 7, asking him not to escalate the war and expressing interest in having further conversations to resolve the conflict. Russia denied that the call took place. On November 11, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described reports of the call as “pure fiction” and told reporters that Putin had no concrete plans of speaking to Trump.\n\nThe Republican president-elect has argued that the Biden administration is funding and arming an open-ended war in Ukraine that does not benefit the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s Vice President JD Vance fleshed out some of the details of what Trump’s plan would potentially be, in an interview for the Shawn Ryan Show. The episode was released in September.\n\nVance said that Trump would begin negotiations with leaders from Moscow, Kyiv and Europe for a “peaceful settlement”.\n\n“And what it probably looks like is the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine, that becomes like a demilitarised zone.”\n\nWithout specifying the exact location of the demilitarised zone, Vance said that it would be heavily fortified to ensure Russia does not invade again. However, Vance’s plan suggests that Ukraine would have to cede some of its occupied territory to Russia. This includes parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia – areas Russia has taken control of since early in the war – in addition to Crimea.\n\nRussia has taken about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory since 2014.\n\nUkraine has stressed that any peace deal must involve nullifying Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories, including Crimea.\n\n“Ukraine retains its independent sovereignty, Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine – it doesn’t join NATO, it doesn’t join some of these allied institutions.

This includes parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia – areas Russia has taken control of since early in the war – in addition to Crimea.\n\nRussia has taken about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory since 2014.\n\nUkraine has stressed that any peace deal must involve nullifying Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories, including Crimea.\n\n“Ukraine retains its independent sovereignty, Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine – it doesn’t join NATO, it doesn’t join some of these allied institutions. That is what the deal is ultimately going to look something like,” Vance told the show.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/how-does-trump-envoy-keith-kellogg-want-to-end-the-russia-ukraine-war/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-01T173816Z_1857508029_RC2EWAAJUGSE_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-KHARKIV-1730488521_fbb431-1730491324-NRyUAC.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 23:39:30","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.064}]}
