It is your dear Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. You were told that you failed at the impossible task that was asked of you, and now you face execution. Seated next to the big man is your replacement. What must he be thinking? Is it disconcerting to him that he was fifth in line to take the job?\n\nTo a much less dramatic extent, many of Trump’s picks to fill his administration should be feeling a bit uneasy about their future roles. Trump had a remarkably high turn-over rate during his last term and made it a habit to very publicly lambast his departed staff. By some estimates, his administration’s turn-over rate reached as high as 92% by the end of his term. This means that incoming appointees should essentially believe that they will most likely be fired or forced to resign under pressure, perhaps within the first few months, unless they behave differently from their predecessors.\n\nJeff Sessions, the Trump-appointed Attorney General, chose to retain a semblance of his honor by recusing himself from the Russia probe. What did he get in return for his compliance with the law? Trump fired him and later called him “weak”, “ineffective”, and an “idiot”, among many other insults. \n\nIt was a clear trend that staffers would be replaced if they expressed just a bit too much opposition to Trump’s plans. After clashes with Trump about how to handle several international conflicts, and some name-calling, Rex Tillerson was also fired and was later called “dumb as a rock.”\n\nProspective aides are well aware of what happens when an underling departs from Trump’s orders, so they must not be planning to do so. Presumably, if they intend to take the job, the plan isn’t to get fired immediately. But from their perspective, what exactly is the motivation for accepting the nomination given what dozens of former Trump allies have said about him? \n\nThe people who have actually held those positions and worked closely with Trump are telling you that your future boss is an awful person, a danger to our country, and a “wannabe dictator”, who is wholly unfit for office. These aren’t far-left democrats either, they are staunch republicans who at one point or another expressed support and allegiance to Trump. \n\nIf you’re considering whether to accept a Trump nomination, it has to be with the understanding that there is a very good chance that Trump will ask you to do something immoral or illegal or both. Most notably, Pence was asked to violate the democratic process following the results of the 2020 election, a request that he thankfully declined.\n\nSo for prospective picks, the options are twofold. They can take the job in the hopes of being in a position to place guard rails around Trump, thereby risking his ire, or they can follow all of Trump’s directives, perhaps even illegal ones, to avoid his wrath while risking legal consequences.\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis chose the former – writing about his experience in the cabinet, he stated “I did as well as I could for as long as I could.” Clearly, Mattis was attempting to steer Trump away from some of his more moronic ideas but when it became clear that Trump would instead follow his own uninformed thoughts, Mattis resigned. \n\nAccording to the Mueller report, several Trump aides refused Trump’s orders to interfere with the investigation, including Jeff Sessions, White House counsel Don McGahn, and national security adviser K.T. McFarland. What do they all have in common? They all vacated their posts prematurely. \n\nFor individuals like Mike Walz and Pete Hegseth, it’s an opportunity to further their ambitions and yet, their knowledge of Trump’s treatment of past staff suggests that they do not plan to repeat their mistakes – not good news for us. \n\nThe only hope that we have is that Trump’s picks have a strong enough sense of self-preservation that they refuse to place themselves in legal peril on behalf of the president. We certainly can’t count on the likes of Matt Gaetz or Marco Rubio to prioritize our best interests when deciding whether to follow Trump’s orders, so perhaps the fear of being held accountable will suffice. What we know for certain is that we should expect another flood of memoirs by 2028.\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.","summary":"The only hope that we have is that Trump’s picks have a strong enough sense of self-preservation that they refuse to place themselves in legal peril on behalf of the president.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/11/17/rafael-perez-donald-trumps-nominees-must-tread-carefully/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24318362239297.jpg?w=1024&h=598","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 01:12:06","author":"Rafael Perez","authors":["Rafael Perez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.673},{"id":265428340,"title":"Economic prosperity stable despite declining consumer confidence","text":"The economic prosperity index in Macau is expected to remain stable between November 2024 and January 2025.\n\nAccording to a report published by the Macau Economic Association (MEA), for the upcoming three months, index will stabilize at approximately 6.5 points.\n\nThis forecast aligns with trends observed over the past 10 months, during which the index has fluctuated between 6.0 and 6.6 points.\n\nThe MEA calculates the index, which ranges from 0 to 10 points, by evaluating 13 criteria, including the unemployment rate, visitor arrivals, and gross gaming revenue.\n\nIn its findings, the MEA noted that eight of the assessed indicators performed strongly.

She knew exactly what she was doing,' Trump wrote. \n\n'Thank you to the GREAT PEOPLE OF IOWA for giving me such a record breaking vote, despite possible ELECTION FRAUD by Ann Selzer and the now discredited “newspaper” for which she works. An investigation is fully called for!' \n\nAt the time Trump charged that Selzer over-polled Democrats to make it look like Harris, the Democratic nominee, was in the lead. \n\nSelzer's poll for the Register and Mediacom days before the election predicted Harris would win by +3 percentage points. But Trump went on to trounce the vice president by over +13 points in the Hawkeye State. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is calling to 'fully investigate' Ann Selzer, the Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state just days before November's election \n\n'A totally Fake poll that caused great distrust and uncertainty at a very critical time.

So, I’m humbled, yet always willing to learn from unexpected findings.' \n\nFollowing Trump's landslide victory, Selzer admitted her research was completely wrong and might have even emboldened MAGA nation.\n\n'I told more than one news outlet that the findings from this last poll could actually energize and activate Republican voters who thought they would likely coast to victory,' she said. 'Maybe that's what happened.'\n\nShe continued an attempt to defend her methodology, which came as a complete shock to voters the weekend prior to the election.\n\n'The poll findings we produced for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom did not match what the Iowa electorate ultimately decided in the voting booth today,' she said.\n\nAlthough the results were within the margin of error, it gave Harris supporters hope that she could flip the state they had previously written off.\n\nThe Register survey sent shockwaves through the market – triggering a flood of wagers on Harris to win the election. \n\nDuring her CNN appearance she explained how her poll got it so wrong.\n\n'When former President Trump said we interviewed more Democrats, well that's what came out of our data. We did nothing to make that happen,' she said. \n\nIn order to discern likely voters, pollsters ask voters how likely they are to vote and try to create a model of the electorate. \n\nIn the data being collected by Selzer it found more Iowa Democrats were motivated. \n\nThe Selzer poll also showed that older women were breaking for Harris in a way that other surveys potentially hadn't picked up on. \n\n'I'm a big believer in keeping my fingers off, my dirty fingers off the data. So we did it the way, we did it when he won in our final poll twice, in two election cycles, very same method,' Selzer said. \n\nShe noted that the 'best news' she can deliver to any of her client is good data. \n\n'The best news that I can deliver is my best shot of what's true, because then you know what you're working with and you can make adjustments as you need to,' she said. \n\nDonald TrumpIowaDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump calls to 'fully' investigate Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state: 'She knew exactly what she was doing'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is planning to investigate an Iowa pollster after her survey predicted a narrow loss for him in the state, which he ultimately won by over 13 points.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14094199/Trump-calls-fully-investigate-Iowa-pollster-Ann-Selzer-predicted-losing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/18/00/92176259-0-image-m-14_1731889710315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 01:03:52","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":265428426,"title":"Biden approves Ukraine’s use of US-provided long-range missiles for extended attacks within Russia","text":"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine’s northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces.\n\nBiden’s move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States’ vital military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s reaction Sunday was notably restrained.\n\n“Strikes are not made with words,” he said during his nightly video address. “Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.”\n\nZelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.\n\nZelenskyy’s statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometres (24 miles) from the border with Russia.\n\nRussia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter.\n\n“And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years.\n\nSome supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies.\n\nBiden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nPutin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory.\n\nNews of Biden’s decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.\n\nBiden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit.\n\nAsked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is “to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.”\n\n“We want peace, we want fair peace,” Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn’t elaborate.\n\nThe longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development.\n\nThe overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few long-range strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources.\n\nNorth Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.\n\nAs many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.\n\nTrump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win.\n\nHe also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin.\n\nAmerica is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022.\n\nWorried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies.\n\nThat includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems.\n\nThe White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia.\n\nLong, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Will Weissert in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed to this report.","summary":"The decision comes as thousands of North Korean troops have been sent&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/biden-approves-ukraines-use-of-us-provided-long-range-missiles-for-extended-attacks-within-russia/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Biden-authorizes-Ukraines-use-of-US-supplied-long-range-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 01:03:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.203},{"id":265428342,"title":"The ‘super year’ of elections has been super bad for incumbents as voters punish them in droves","text":"Whether on the left or the right, regardless of how long they’ve been in power, sitting governments around the world have been drubbed this year by disgruntled voters in what has been called the “super year” for elections.\n\nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was just the latest in a long line of losses for incumbent parties in 2024, with people in some 70 countries accounting for about half the world’s population going to the polls.\n\nIssues driving voter discontent have varied widely, though there has been almost universal malaise since the COVID-19 pandemic as people and businesses struggle to get back on their feet while facing stubbornly high prices, cash-strapped governments and a surge in migration.\n\n“There’s an overall sense of frustration with political elites, viewing them as out of touch, that cuts across ideological lines,” said Richard Wike, director of global attitudes research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nHe noted that a Pew poll of 24 countries found that the appeal of democracy itself was slipping as voters reported increasing economic distress and a sense that no political faction truly represents them.\n\n“Lots of factors are driving this,” Wike said, “but certainly feelings about the economy and inflation are a big factor.”\n\nSince the pandemic hit in 2020, incumbents have been removed from office in 40 of 54 elections in Western democracies, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, revealing “a huge incumbent disadvantage.”\n\nIn Britain, the right-of-center Conservatives suffered their worst result since 1832 in July’s election, which returned the center-left Labour Party to power after 14 years.\n\nBut just across the English Channel, the far right rocked the governing parties of France and Germany, the European Union’s biggest and most powerful members, in June elections for the parliament of the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe results pushed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a parliamentary election in hope of stemming a far-right surge at home. The anti-immigration National Rally party won the first round, but alliances and tactical voting knocked it down to third place in the second round, producing a fragile government atop a divided legislature.\n\nIn Asia, a group of South Korean liberal opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, defeated the ruling conservative People Power Party in April’s parliamentary elections.\n\nIndia’s Narendra Modi, meanwhile, had been widely expected to easily sweep to a third straight term in June but instead voters turned away from his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in droves, costing it its majority in parliament, though it was able to remain in power with the help of allies.\n\nLikewise, Japanese voters in October punished the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed the country nearly without interruption since 1955.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will stay in power, but the greater-than-expected loss ended the LDP’s one-sided rule, giving the opposition a chance to achieve policy changes long opposed by the conservatives.\n\n“If you were to ask me to explain Japan in a vacuum, that’s not too difficult,” said Paul Nadeau, an adjunct assistant professor at Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo.\n\n“Voters were punishing an incumbent party for a corruption scandal, and this gave them a chance to express a lot more frustrations that they already had.”\n\nGlobally, however, it’s harder to draw conclusions.\n\n“This is pretty consistent across different situations, different countries, different elections — incumbents are getting a crack on the shins,” he said. “And I don’t have any good big picture explanations for why that is.”\n\nRob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said inflation has been a major driver of “the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen” — though the reasons behind the backlash may also be “broader and more diffuse.”\n\n“It could be something directly to do with the long-term effects of the COVID pandemic — a big wave of ill health, disrupted education, disrupted workplace experiences and so forth making people less happy everywhere, and they are taking it out on governments,” he said.\n\n“A kind of electoral long COVID.”\n\nIn South Africa, high unemployment and inequality helped drive a dramatic loss of support for the African National Congress, which had governed for three decades since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The party once led by Nelson Mandela lost its parliamentary majority in May’s election and was forced to go into coalition with opposition parties.\n\nOther elections in Africa presented a mixed picture, said Alex Vines, director of the African Program at the international affairs think tank Chatham House, partially clouded by countries with authoritarian leaders whose reelections were not in doubt, like Rwanda’s long-serving President Paul Kagame who got 99% of the vote.\n\nIn African countries with strong democratic institutions, however, the pattern of incumbents being punished holds, Vines said.\n\n“The countries with stronger institutions — South Africa, Senegal, Botswana — have witnessed either a government of national unity or change of party of government,” he said.\n\nIn Botswana, voters unexpectedly ejected a party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from Britain in an October election.\n\nVines said that across the continent, “you’ve got this electorate now who have no memory of decolonization or the end of apartheid and so have different priorities, who are also feeling the cost-of-living pressures.” DAVID RISING, JILL LAWLESS & NICHOLAS RICCARDI, BANGKOK, MDT/AP","summary":"Whether on the left or the right, regardless of how long they’ve been in power, sitting governments around the world have been drubbed this year by disgruntled voters in what has been called the “super year” for elections.

But what is still missing — and desperately needed — is the principled reaction of the world to this evil,” he said.\n\nBiden’s decision, attributed by the Associated Press to “a U.S. official and three people familiar with the matter,” would represent a stark change in the U.S. stance on Ukrainian use of American arms in Russian territory, which before had been restricted to short range use and mostly aimed at retaking occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nIt also comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin has engaged the aid of North Korea in his unlawful war of territorial expansion, and reportedly deployed tens of thousands those troops against Ukraine’s northern defenses.\n\n“The entire world needs them not to turn a blind eye to Russia’s continued terror. Only when the world reacts decisively can the situation change. Russia has involved North Korea in its war—and the reaction has been weak. Russia has continued its terror for nearly 1,000 days—and the world’s decisions are still delayed,” Zelenskyy said Sunday.\n\nAccording to reporting, Ukraine will be allowed to fire the U.S. made MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), a vehicle mounted weapons system capable of firing missiles close to 200 miles, at targets inside of Russia. That’s not enough to threaten Putin in Moscow, but more than enough range for Ukraine to defend their northern border now that North Korean troops are apparently amassing near Kursk.\n\nRussia has been attacking its fellow former Soviet state for a decade, since 2014 when Putin illegally annexed Crimea. The conflict, which continued in a pair of separatist regions during the following eight years, exploded into full-scale war in February of 2022, when the Russian military further invaded the country on three fronts.\n\nMoscow apparently had planned for just days of military actions, but Russian forces have mostly been stalled in their advances by Ukrainian troops and civilian volunteers armed and trained by a global coalition of nations. According to the U.N., the war has displaced more than 10 million Ukrainian civilians and left half again as many in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nAccording to a “confidential” Ukrainian estimate of war dead reported by the Wall Street Journal in mid-September, more than 1 million people have died as a result of the war.\n\nIn the years that have followed Russia’s invasion of their democratic neighbor, according to the Department of Defense the U.S. has “committed approximately $56.3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine through both presidential drawdown authority and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in September that use of U.S. long range precision weapons against Russia would be considered an escalation akin to an attack by all of NATO.\n\n“If this decision is made, it will mean nothing less than the direct participation of NATO countries, the United States, and European countries, in the war in Ukraine,” Putin said.\n\nThe U.S. policy shift comes as Biden closes out a trip to South America for a climate summit and bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the outgoing president apparently called for China to put more pressure on North Korea to stay out of the conflict in Europe.\n\nNational Security Advisory Jake Sullivan said that Biden used the meeting to reiterate “his grave concern over the fact that the (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) has deployed a significant number of troops to western Russia to participate in the battle against Ukraine, in the war against Ukraine.”\n\n“President Biden really underscored his view that this is a deeply dangerous development, both in the European view, the introduction of a foreign army, and on the Korean Peninsula, with deepening cooperation between Russia and the DPRK likely to enhance the possibility of provocative behavior by the DPRK,” Sullivan said.\n\nZelenskyy, during a radio interview on Friday, told his people that the war will “end faster with the policy of this team that will now lead the White House,” referring to the reelection of former President Donald Trump.","summary":"After a massive barrage of drone and rocket attacks struck their territory overnight into Sunday, and as missiles continued to fall the following evening, U.S. President Joe Biden apparently authorized Ukrainian armed forces to use American weaponry against targets deep into Russia.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/11/17/fire-away-biden-says-ukraine-can-launch-us-missiles-against-targets-in-russia/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24268749649207.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 01:01:11","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":265428280,"title":"Biden allows Ukraine to strike inside Russia with long-range missiles","text":"Last month, Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had used US-supplied long-range missiles for the first time to strike Russian targets in the country’s east.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has been battling to push back Russian troops who have been slowly advancing in the eastern Donetsk region towards the key city of Pokrovsk – a major supply hub for Ukrainian forces.\n\nMoscow has also massively increased its number of drone strikes on Ukraine.

Democrats in Congress and in the media have blasted Trump's cabinet nominees over their qualifications, including combat veteran Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as secretary of homeland security; Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as attorney general; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Welker pressed Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, if Kennedy's skepticism toward vaccines could be a \"deal breaker\" in confirming the Trump nominee to head the HHS. Mullin denied this would be a dealbreaker for him before launching into a rebuke of Democrats and liberal voices in the media for not showing the same outrage over some of President Biden's more controversial cabinet and staffing picks at the start of his term. DEMOCRATS' FUROR OVER ‘UNQUALIFIED' TRUMP NOMINEES PUTS BIDEN'S STAFFING DECISIONS BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT \"No. I absolutely — appreciate Bobby Kennedy taking hard look at the vaccine. There’s some questions that have to be made. And I appreciate some of the scrutiny that’s going on there. I think Bobby can answer all those and I have sat down and had long conversations with him and I actually find the guy extremely intelligent when it comes to this stuff,\" he said. \"And some of the stuff does raise a lot of questions. But I do got a question for you. The Democrats are spending so much time talking about the scrutiny of President Trump’s picks and yet, did we spend this amount of time scrutinizing Biden’s picks?\" \"I mean, we can talk about Rachel [Levine], the assistant secretary of HHS. I think that’s a pretty controversial pick, from whatever pronoun he or she decides to use,\" Mullin continued. Mullin also raised concerns about Sam Brinton, the \"nonbinary\" former top Department of Energy official under Biden, who escaped jail time after being accused of stealing luggage from airports on three separate occasions. EMBATTLED FORMER BIDEN OFFICIAL ACCUSED IN MULTIPLE AIRPORT THEFTS ENDS 2023 FREE \"I didn’t see this same type of scrutiny that the Democrats used on these individual picks. There’s been a lot of picks. I mean we can talk about Pete Buttigieg. Is he really qualified to head the Department of Transportation?\" Mullin added. As Mullin scolded the Democratic Party and media's messaging around Trump's picks, Welker attempted to cut in. \"Senator — hold on, let's stay —\" Welker began. \"I don’t see the same level of scrutiny,\" Mullin continued. \"We've scrutinized all of those picks, robustly,\" Welker shot back, before returning to her question on Kennedy. Biden's pick for assistant HHS secretary, Rachel Levine, was the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate. Levine faced criticism from Republicans on various issues such as sex change surgeries for minors and was labeled by a New York Post op-ed as \"America’s No.1 gender extremist.\" Biden's Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, was appointed to the top cabinet position after serving as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for eight years, with some questioning at the time whether he had enough related experience for the job. Since taking office, Republicans have amplified those concerns after a series of perceived missteps from Buttigieg, including the fallout from the supply chain crisis and the devastating train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

Tyson, the Fight America Deserves","text":"Mario Costa, a 70-year-old Jersey City bar owner, was standing in the lobby of the Toyota Music Factory, an event center on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas, chewing on the stub of an unlit cigar and pondering the latest turn in the operatic and notorious life of one his oldest friends, Mike Tyson.\n\n “I had one of the kids from the hood call me up and ask, ‘Why’s Mike doing this? Does he need the money?’ I think it’s just the challenge. You always have that in you. It’s the nature of the sport.”\n\n Costa had first met Tyson in 1984, when the boxer was just an 18-year-old amateur on the brink of one of the most ferocious and dominating runs in history of American sports (37 straight wins, 33 of them by knockout, the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world). Now, Tyson was 58 years old and nearly two decades removed from his last professional fight, but he was on the brink of a strange comeback that was both a verifiable BFD and an awkward event that had puzzled more than just the neighborhood kid who had called up Mario Costa. \n\n As Costa chewed on his stogie in the lobby, Tyson was getting ready to step onto the Music Factory stage for a public weigh-in. In 24 hours, he would face off against YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a decidedly non-championship bout that would be broadcast live on Netflix. The streaming giant was heavily promoting the fight to its 283 million global subscribers, and, it seemed, every other media outlet in the world had followed suit. For the week leading up to the fight, the internet — RFK Jr. and Matt Gaetz nominations aside — was basically turned over to Tyson and Paul. And it worked. According to the streaming service, even with buffering issues, 60 million households ended up tuning in. \n\n The match-up was an oddity. Paul is 27 years old and has been boxing seriously for just half a decade, but during that time, he has leveraged his social media celebrity and a string of knockout wins against non-boxers into becoming — for better or worse — the sport’s biggest draw. Tyson is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest heavyweight fighters of all-time, but during his last real bout, in 2005, he quit after the sixth round of a scheduled 10, saying “I don’t got the fight and guts anymore.” It was unclear what exactly had changed in the intervening 19 years.\n\n Costa told me his friend was more balanced now — after a life marked by a rape conviction, a prison stint, bankruptcy, and addiction — Tyson had settled into life as an entrepreneur, family man, and subject of endless fascinations. (Tyson has starred in a one-man show about his life, directed by Spike Lee, and an Animal Planet docuseries about his longtime hobby of pigeon racing.) Costa is now the custodian of the boxer’s “300 to 400” pigeons, keeping the birds in coops near his Jersey City bar, the Ringside Lounge. Costa told me he could see Tyson’s newfound equanimity in the way he interacted with his birds. Tyson, who lives in the Las Vegas suburbs, would stop by sometimes to take out his favorite roller pigeons, admiring their freedom as the birds flapped high into the sky then tumbled in curlicues through the air. “He said, ‘This is rich,’” Costa told me. Tyson had realized material wealth was less important. But what Tyson’s serenity meant for his ability to punch Jake Paul remained to be seen.\n\n “If Mike can knock him out early it’ll be done.” Costa said. “Punchers never lose the punch, and Mike’s a puncher.” But even though Costa regards Paul as “just a joke,” an unskilled fighter who is, at best, a pretender in the sport, he worried if Tyson didn’t win the fight in the first few rounds, the edge would shift toward the natural physical advantages of youth.\n\n Standing near Costa, other members of Tyson’s entourage projected more confidence. Tyson’s sparring partner, Mike Russell, a blocky cruiserweight, predicted the revitalized Tyson was “going to come in and win spectacularly by knockout. I truly believe he’s going to win in the second round.” One of Tyson’s business partners, Adam Wilks, an affable Canadian with a graying goatee, felt the same way. “Jake’s going to get knocked out in the first two rounds, but for him, it’ll be a win. He got in the ring with Mike Tyson. He comes out a winner.”\n\n As the pre-fight weigh-in began, the vibe seemed to fit this win-win analysis — it was perfunctory, predictable, and businesslike. Tyson and Paul walked onto the Music Factory stage, they took their turns on the scale, and Paul chugged a can of Celsius energy drink, a sponsor of the fight and a brand he endorses. Then they both lined up for the stare down, where boxers stand chin to chin and, according to habit, grimace at one another. Paul, apparently, stepped on Tyson’s toe. Tyson hand shot up and slapped him. \n\n “Talking’s over,” Tyson said, before turning to walk offstage. Paul, who had sat down in a lotus position after the slap, stood up and bellowed into Helwani’s mic: “He hits like a bitch. It’s personal now… He must die.” \n\n The whole thing felt like pro wrestling — off-kilter and oversold. But it was also probably real, at least real in the bizarro real world in which Jake Paul v. Mike Tyson was set to exist. In retrospect, no other moment between the two men would feel as spontaneous or dangerous.\n\n THERE ARE A FEW different ways to conceptualize the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. As a contest of human bodies, it was the young versus the old. As a sporting matter, it was a matchup of Paul, now ranked as the 126th best heavyweight in the world, against Tyson, a long inactive athlete. As an actual boxing match, it would be briefer and less demanding than a standard men’s fight — contested over eight two-minute rounds, instead of 10 or 12 three-minute rounds, with the fighters using cushier 14-ounce gloves (10 ounces is standard). Far more relevantly, as a business proposition, it was a marriage of Paul’s 7.7 billion YouTube views and 27 million Instagram followers with Tyson’s four decades of international celebrity and notoriety. Tyson would take home a reported $20 million (Paul’s fee was said to be twice that) while getting a publicity boost for his vegan hamburger chain, Mr. Charlie’s, and Tyson 2.0, the cannabis brand he runs with Wilks. (Among the products, Mike Bites, edibles in the shape of Evander Holyfield’s right ear with the missing chunk Tyson bit off in their infamous 1997 fight.) For Paul, the upside was even clearer: a content creator who had long been paid by the click was about to get the biggest platform of his life.\n\n The crowd at AT&T Stadium that had come to see the spectacle was an eclectic mix — hardcore fight fans; couples on a very expensive date night; a smattering of proudly MAGA-hatted bros; closer to the ring, men and women with hard bodies, diamond bling, and conspicuous lip filler. But as varied as the crowd was, no one really believed that Paul v. Tyson would be anything close to the best-fought matchup that could be staged. That will take place next month, when heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk takes on former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. But it’s highly unlikely 60 million households worldwide will tune in to that fight. Expertise and traditional credentials are not winning the day — not in a world in which a former reality TV star has won back the presidency and set about filling out his cabinet with cable news hosts and conspiracy theorists. And now here was Jake Paul — Vine and YouTube star — taking over the sport of boxing. If you had already suspected saying outrageous shit into a camera was the most prized skill of our moment, then the Paul-Tyson fight seemed designed to provide further proof.\n\n Paul, who endorsed Trump in a YouTube video he said God had pushed him to make, at least had a sense of humor about his boxing charlatanism. He knew people thought he didn’t deserve it, and he was happy to play into their revulsion. At the weigh-in, Paul’s promotion company offered fans an opportunity to punch a life-sized model of Paul’s billy goat-bearded and eminently punchable face. When fans lustily booed him at every turn, Paul grinned and gave fans his best imitation of a WWE heel.\n\n BY THE TIME MIKE TYSON and Jake Paul made their entrances into the middle of AT&T Stadium, the crowd of 70,000 had just finished watching an almost unbearably intense 20 minutes of boxing, a women’s lightweight title fight between the Irish champion Katie Taylor and her Puerto Rican challenger Amanda Serrano. Taylor and Serrano had previously met two years ago at Madison Square Garden, a match that had been billed as “the biggest women’s fight of all-time,” and had 100 percent delivered on the hype. The rematch had been absolutely thrilling, a display of just how balletic and brutal boxing can be. The women were fast, dazzling, and inexhaustible, with Taylor and Serrano both throwing over 500 punches and landing over 40 percent of them. Serrano fought the later rounds with a gaping gash above her right eye, blood pouring down her face as her corner struggled to stanch the bleeding. Taylor, by the end, looked like she was gasping for air. \n\n For nearly everyone in the stadium, even those on the floor near the ring, it was easier to watch the fight on the 160-foot-wide jumbotron than to look at the ring itself. The longer the fight went on, the more people would briefly avert their eyes, then turn their heads to look again. You wanted to look away, but couldn’t. Taylor was declared the winner, the crowd didn’t like it, but it almost didn’t matter — the entire fight was shocking and thrilling and almost superhuman.\n\n Throughout the night, as the undercard fights came and went, the stands had been gradually filling up. By the end of Taylor-Serrano, every seat was full, the stands looked endless. On the floor, Shaquille O’Neal and Rob Gronkowski were in their seats. Charlize Theron, ignoring the jumbotron camera, looked on as well. So were a host of slightly less starry celebrities starring in upcoming Netflix series like Ralph Macchio and Josh Duhamel. A 23-year-old woman sitting on the floor at the back of the most expensive seats told me she had wondered whether Donald Trump himself would walk into the stadium. He didn’t, but Texas governor Greg Abbott, a considerably less colorful Republican, took a ringside seat, arriving through the fighters’ entrance. No one seemed to notice.\n\n And then, finally, it was time. Hundreds of fans stood at the barricades blocking off the path where the fighters would enter. Nearly everyone in the crowd stood up. Then Paul, the gleeful villain, drove onto the floor, perched on the seatback of a lowrider convertible next to his brother, Logan. Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight”, likely a troll of Tyson (he sings it in his cameo in The Hangover), boomed over the speakers. Paul smiled when he heard the inevitable boos. Then it was Tyson’s turn. The aged hero walked out onto the runway alone, wearing a black terry cloth poncho, stone-faced and implacable as the stadium erupted in applause. The stage was set. The anticipation was overwhelming. The fight began.\n\n In the first round, Tyson looked sharp, Paul was on the defensive. Nothing happened, but it seemed like it could. If you closed your eyes, you could imagine the moment of communal ecstasy that would erupt when Tyson knocked out Paul with a catastrophic uppercut. It felt like an approaching thunderstorm. The anticipation was barometric. But the thunderstorm did not arrive. By the third round, it was clear Mario Costa’s prediction had turned into prophecy. The longer the fight went, the more Tyson showed his age. Paul was throwing and landing many more punches. Tyson, increasingly, was just standing there, taking it, barely mustering a few short bursts of counterattack.\n\n In the fifth round, as the fighters plodded around one another, the crowd broke into a loud cheer, as if hoping, somehow, they could shock Tyson into form. It didn’t work. By the sixth round, boos were raining down from all sides. Tyson was compulsively biting his gloves, as if warding off a sharp pain. Paul seemed to be taking it easy. What Netflix called the “most highly anticipated live boxing match of all-time” had revealed itself to be a dud. By now the crowd was mostly quiet, the hopeful cheering had stopped. Not many people even bothered to keep booing. As the eighth and final round finished, many in the crowd started moving for the exits, not bothering to wait for the judge’s decision. It was obvious Paul had won, but even more obvious no one really cared. One man near me, more than a little drunk, raised his right hand into the air, his middle finger extended. He kept it there for minutes. Another man next to him muttered “terrible.”\n\n Tyson had looked listless, but the crowd never turned on him. He was still the GOAT, the guy everyone had come to tell people they had gotten to see live. If his skills were diminished and his stamina unimpressive, well, he was seven years short of Medicare, after all. It wouldn’t hurt his legacy. Plenty of great athletes have had weird and inglorious codas.\n\n Paul had looked good, but 60 million households had tuned in for a show. And once the low-riders and walk-ons were over and an empty ring with two big guys was all that was left, they didn’t get it.\n\n In the post-fight interview, Paul and Tyson talked about how proud they were of their efforts, hugging and sharing in a sense of accomplishment.\n\n “It’s the era of truth, it’s the era of good,” Paul said, seemingly stoked about both the election and the fight. “There’s a shift in the world and good is rising, the truth is rising.”\n\n But the crowd at AT&T Stadium wasn’t going to be hoodwinked into good vibes. They knew what truth they’d seen. As everyone walked to their cars and the crushing traffic in front of them, fans who paid hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars shared a similar look. Just an hour earlier, the place had been intoxicated. Now, a collective hangover set in. It was nauseating, with face-scrunching levels of regret, filled with an ironclad resolve to never ever fall for this kind of hype again. Like most hungover resolutions, it would be forgotten.","summary":"The former heavyweight champion went head-to-head with a megastar content creator for one of the saddest match-ups in boxing history","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jake-paul-mike-tyson-fight-scene-1235169894/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-scene-LEAD.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:52:08","author":"Elisabeth Garber-Paul,Eric Benson","authors":["Elisabeth Garber-Paul","Eric Benson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":265427218,"title":"Trump calls to 'fully' investigate Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state: 'She knew exactly what she was doing'","text":"Trump calls to 'fully' investigate Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state: 'She knew exactly what she was doing'\n\nREAD MORE: Ann Selzer to retire after failing to predict Trump's 2024 victory \n\nFollow DailyMail.com's presidential election live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:46 GMT, 18 November 2024 | Updated: 00:50 GMT, 18 November 2024\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is calling to 'fully investigate' the Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state just days before November's election. \n\nThe Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey conducted by Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company showed Harris at 47 percent support to Trump's 44 percent. \n\nIowa had gone red for Trump in the last two election cycles after twice voting for Democratic President Barack Obama - and had not been considered to be a battleground state in 2024. \n\nDespite easily winning the Hawkeye State, Trump posted on his Truth Social that he still plans to investigate Selzer, 68, over possible election fraud.\n\n'A totally Fake poll that caused great distrust and uncertainty at a very critical time. She knew exactly what she was doing,' Trump wrote. \n\n'Thank you to the GREAT PEOPLE OF IOWA for giving me such a record breaking vote, despite possible ELECTION FRAUD by Ann Selzer and the now discredited “newspaper” for which she works. An investigation is fully called for!' \n\nAt the time Trump charged that Selzer over-polled Democrats to make it look like Harris, the Democratic nominee, was in the lead. \n\nSelzer's poll for the Register and Mediacom days before the election predicted Harris would win by +3 percentage points. But Trump went on to trounce the vice president by over +13 points in the Hawkeye State. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is calling to 'fully investigate' Ann Selzer, the Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state just days before November's election \n\n'A totally Fake poll that caused great distrust and uncertainty at a very critical time.

So, I’m humbled, yet always willing to learn from unexpected findings.' \n\nFollowing Trump's landslide victory, Selzer admitted her research was completely wrong and might have even emboldened MAGA nation.\n\n'I told more than one news outlet that the findings from this last poll could actually energize and activate Republican voters who thought they would likely coast to victory,' she said.

We did nothing to make that happen,' she said. \n\nIn order to discern likely voters, pollsters ask voters how likely they are to vote and try to create a model of the electorate. \n\nIn the data being collected by Selzer it found more Iowa Democrats were motivated. \n\nThe Selzer poll also showed that older women were breaking for Harris in a way that other surveys potentially hadn't picked up on. \n\n'I'm a big believer in keeping my fingers off, my dirty fingers off the data. So we did it the way, we did it when he won in our final poll twice, in two election cycles, very same method,' Selzer said. \n\nShe noted that the 'best news' she can deliver to any of her client is good data. \n\n'The best news that I can deliver is my best shot of what's true, because then you know what you're working with and you can make adjustments as you need to,' she said. \n\nDonald TrumpDemocratsIowa\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump calls to 'fully' investigate Iowa pollster who predicted him losing in heavily red state: 'She knew exactly what she was doing'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is planning to investigate an Iowa pollster after her survey predicted a narrow loss for him in the state, which he ultimately won by over 13 points.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14094199/Trump-calls-fully-investigate-Iowa-pollster-predicted-losing-heavily-red-state-knew-exactly-doing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/18/00/92176259-0-image-m-14_1731889710315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:50:26","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":265427196,"title":"Trump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says","text":"Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk praised President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees so far as the \"Avengers Squad\" that he's \"thrilled\" to see take on Washington, D.C.Trump announced over a dozen of the top posts for his second administration's Cabinet, such as former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, former Representative and Representative-elect Matt Gaetz of Florida for attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services, and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, among others.Some of the nominees have been met with backlash due to a perceived lack of qualification or controversies that have come to light since Trump's announcements. However, Kirk, who played a critical role in securing the youth vote for the MAGA campaign, can barely contain his enthusiasm for their potential impact.Newsweek contacted Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA and the Trump transition team via email on Sunday for comment.\"He was up on stage with all these people three weeks ago,\" Kirk said during an appearance on Saturday's episode of Fox News' Life, Liberty & Levin. \"These people were next to him. It's not as if there was some sort of secret agenda, and he ran on one thing and did another. These people were pals with him. He brought them up and spoke at his major rallies.\"\"The American people saw it, they weighed their options, and now we are going to see the Avengers squad, the greatest team of change makers and actors that we've ever seen,\" Kirk said. \"Elon Musk, Ramaswamy - I could go through the entire roster.\"\"I'm thrilled how President Trump is delivering on these promises, and a next generation is going to infuse this energy in that ossified town of Washington, DC, and praise God that we're here to witness it,\" he added.Kirk played a key role in getting Trump elected, helping drive out the most conservative youth vote in decades. He told host Mark Levin that Trump gave young voters \"hope\" and \"optimism\" after the Biden administration.Kirk called the 2024 election an \"existential\" crisis that motivated him to set up an unprecedented ground campaign on college campuses to convert an unlikely voter bloc for Trump.\"I dedicated my entire life, over the last year and a half, to getting Donald Trump back in the White House, and we did it by building an unprecedented ground game in Arizona and Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, especially with younger voters,\" Kirk said.\"I'm happy to report, thanks to the relentless work that we did on the ground of registering voters, of our viral videos, of our on-campus events, we won the youth vote in Michigan. We nearly won it in Wisconsin. We won it in Pennsylvania. We almost won center County, the home of Penn State University,\" Kirk continued.He added: \"We chased their ballot all the way through the process, embracing early voting where it was legal, ballot harvesting where it was legal, and we said, 'Why are we going to give Democrats 12 hours of voting when we have 30 days to be able to compete?' So, changing that approach, and the President deserves a ton of credit for embracing that approach was one of the reasons that we were successful.\"Kirk reiterated his view that Trump has assembled a Right-Wing \"Avengers\" in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he shared video taken at UFC 309 in Madison Square Garden, where Trump and some of his picks gathered and led the crowd in a chant of \"U-S-A.\"In addition to Kennedy Jr. and Gabbard, the video showed Elon Musk, the new co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accompanying the president-elect.Trump also had his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, in attendance, and rounded out the entourage with friend and supporter Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White.Kirk's characterization, however, indicates that Trump may have made up his mind prior to even winning the election, which would run counter to what Trump Jr. said Sunday during an appearance on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, during which he insisted that Trump chose the candidates from \"lists of 10 to 12 people\" after much consideration.The scrutiny on Trump's nominees has grown more intense as the moral character of his nominees has come into question following allegations of criminal conduct came to light.Hegseth, who served for 20 years in the Army National Guard, admitted to being the subject of a police investigation in 2017 while attending a convention in California after one of the staffers accused him of sexual assault. He has vigorously denied the allegations even as his lawyer admitted that the former TV host had paid the woman over fears the allegation could get him fired.Reports indicate that the Trump team was caught off-guard by the allegations but remain firm in their commitment to seeing Hegseth confirmed as defense secretary.","summary":"Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk helped secure an unprecedent youth vote conversion for Donald Trump's campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-picking-avenger-squad-cabinet-charlie-kirk-1987225","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2523042/charlie-kirk-turning-point-usa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:50:21","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":265427106,"title":"Monument on Route 66 where Rihanna left a message for Trump marks 50th anniversary with an unexpected mystery","text":"One of the country’s most famous roadside attractions lies just off the iconic Route 66 in Texas – but many visitors may not realize that it holds a dark secret. \n\nKnown as Cadillac Ranch, around two million tourists flock to this incredible art installation every year.

His histrionics reach people from all walks of life at a visceral level. By comparison, Kamala Harris’ “opportunity economy” sounded vague and elitist.

The US has previously contributed 50 million dollars.During the address, Biden stated that fighting climate change has been a “defining cause” of his administration and made four key announcements to tackle it. He announced that the US development finance corporation will mobilize hundreds of dollars in partnership with a Brazilian company to reforest the Amazon. He also promised restoration and a bioeconomy finance coalition to mobilize at least 10 billion dollars by 2030 to restore and protect 20, 000 square miles of land in Brazil. Moreover, he stated that the US will provide funding to help launch Brazillian President Lula’s important new initiative ‘The Tropical Forest Forever Fund’.“It is in the interest of all of us. US benefits from it as much as any other country does including here in Brazil,” President Biden said. President Biden outlined that the fight to protect the planet is “literally” a fight for humanity for generations to come. “I will leave my successor and my country with a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so. It’s true some may seek to deny and delay the green energy revolution that is underway in America but nobody can reverse it,” he added. President Biden’s announcement comes with only days left before President-elect Trump takes over the position in January 2025 following his win in the recent US Presidential Polls. During his first administration as President of the US, Trump has not been vocal nor very supportive towards climate causes.Donald Trump won a second term as President of the United States after securing 295 electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election, defeating Democratic rival Kamala Harris, who garnered 226 votes.

It is not. Even Trump cannot rid the US system of this oddity, among quite a few others, when the winner of a hotly-contested poll on November 4th has to wait till January 20th to be sworn in. Consider that in the UK, the mother of democracies, the newly-elected prime minister leaves 10 Downing Street by the backdoor while his successor walks in from the front within hours of the results being declared. In fact, Trump’s election can only be officially ratified by the electoral college on January 6th. The electoral calendar was devised by the founding fathers long before the advent of modern means of transportation. They had to make provision of time for a president-elect, say, from Texas to reach Washington DC, a distance of some 1500-odd miles. It made sense then because the fastest means of travel was the horse-back. Indeed, another peculiarity of the US system is the charade about indirect election of president. Founding fathers believed that members of the electoral college elected by popular vote from each State would not be swayed by partisan and/or populist considerations, keeping the larger national interest foremost while choosing president after due deliberation away from the hurly-burly of partisan politics. The electoral college did not serve its purpose with the presidential election virtually becoming a direct contest between candidates. Never once has the electoral college defied candidate/party loyalty to elect someone only on a priori considerations. Yet, the electoral college often distorts popular will, allowing candidates with fewer votes to pip their rivals who polled a much larger number of votes. In 2016, though Hillary Clinton had more votes than Trump, he still won thanks to the obsolete electoral college system. Unfortunately, such is the divisiveness in the American polity that one cannot foresee any administration taking the initiative to update the obscure and obsolete electoral system in one of the most vibrant democracies in the world. It matters to the rest of the democratic world due to its status as the most powerful nation, both economically and militarily. Willy-nilly what happens in America impacts the world. Not for nothing does the world at large keenly watches the US presidential poll. Consider this. All through the Trump-Harris face-off, more than anyone else the immediate combatants in the on-going wars in Gaza-Lebanon versus Israel and Russia-versus Ukraine were fixated on the outcome of the US poll. Why? Because it is in the nature of the US presidency that it can virtually direct the direction of the wars. In Trump’s election Benjamin Netanyahu, the hard-line Israel Prime Minister, finds a willing ally who is keen for him to achieve his war objectives. On the other hand, Volodymyr Zelensky, the beleaguered Ukrainian President, fears choking off of US arms and other strategic help to repulse the aggression of its much bigger neighbour. It is notable that Zelensky set aside his sense of pride and dignity while grovelling before Trump in a telephonic talk during the course of which the president-elect allowed Elon Musk, his newly-found billionaire buddy, to insert himself. This was not normal. But then for Trump abnormal is normal since he is above all accountability.","summary":"","url":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/analysis/editorial-no-escaping-the-trumpian-chaos","image":"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-10/8a15c279-d304-40d2-9fff-f299d093f161/trump_pic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:30:00","author":"Fpj Editorial","authors":["Fpj Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.016},{"id":265425664,"title":"Profile of Matt Gaetz, Trump’s contentious new appointee and America’s current top lawyer, investigated for inappropriate behavior with a minor at a party and drug use.","text":"It’s not hard to see why the Washington Establishment – Democrats and Republicans alike – are horrified that Donald Trump has nominated Matt Gaetz as his next Attorney General.\n\nThe 42-year-old, has proclaimed on his X/Twitter profile that he is a ‘Florida man. Built for the Battle’ – is seen by his enemies as a danger to democracy, having called the January 6 rioters who mounted an assault on the Capitol ‘peaceful patriots’ and ‘tourists’, and suggested that Joe Biden’s presidential victory in 2020 was ‘fraudulent’.\n\nHe has called women protesting for abortion rights ‘disgusting’, ‘overweight’ and ‘ugly’, and claimed that ‘illegal immigrants’ are ‘replacing American culture’.\n\nHowever, the main reason Trump has chosen this firebrand MAGA supporter for this key role is because they share a contempt for a US justice system that has investigated both of them and which – so they claim – is politically motivated and corrupt.\n\nThe Department of Justice – which Gaetz may soon run – has investigated him for child sex trafficking, statutory rape and illegal drug use.\n\nLast year, it finally decided not to charge him, but the House ethics committee continued to investigate him over claims that he paid for sexual misconduct with an underage girl at a 2017 ‘sex party’ and used illicit drugs, among other claims.\n\nGaetz has denied the accusations but the committee was expected to release a ‘highly critical’ report about him today which will now remain under wraps after Gaetz resigned as a Congressman on Wednesday. Federal investigators had reportedly been looking into allegations that he made trips to the Bahamas with women who were paid to travel for sex – an offence under federal law. \n\nIn 2021, Gaetz married Ginger Luckey, 13 years his junior, having met her at a fundraiser at Trump’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn what he calls a ‘modern family’, he has also raised a young Cuban immigrant, Nestor Galban, now in his early 20s, as his own son. Gaetz met the boy when he was 12 years old, after he began dating Nestor’s older sister, and has said: ‘I can’t imagine loving him more even if he was my own flesh and blood.’ (The children’s mother had died of breast cancer.)\n\nGaetz, a former commercial litigation lawyer whose father was also a Republican politician and property tycoon in Florida, is easily the most controversial of Trump’s cabinet appointees to date – no mean feat.\n\nHis nomination, say critics, illustrates the extent to which the President-elect is prepared to flout convention in his determination to surround himself in power with cronies who are both ferociously loyal and share his more extreme views.\n\nOpponents fear that Trump and Gaetz are determined to destroy the Justice Department’s independence and make it more subservient to the White House.\n\nThe nomination was reportedly so contentious that Trump hatched the deal on his jet while his level-headed new chief-of-staff, Susie Wiles, was in another cabin.\n\nGaetz certainly has bold plans should he win, promising a crackdown on ‘government that has been turned against our people … And if that means abolishing every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], I’m ready to get going!’ \n\nIf Gaetz is confirmed in the role, Trump will have a powerful ally in prosecuting his many political enemies, as he has promised to do. Gaetz could also prove useful in helping the next president escape the various criminal cases in which he’s embroiled.\n\nThe US Senate needs to confirm his appointment but Trump has threatened to try and bypass it. Whether Gaetz takes the job or not, the president-elect has put down a marker over the sort of people he wants by his side in his next White House term.","summary":"It’s not hard to see why the Washington Establishment – Democrats and&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/profile-of-matt-gaetz-trumps-contentious-new-appointee-and-americas-current-top-lawyer-investigated-for-inappropriate-behavior-with-a-minor-at-a-party-and-drug-use/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-America039s-new-top-attorney-who039s-been-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:24:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.233},{"id":265425588,"title":"It’s a stunning shift in US policy – but Biden’s announcement will trigger fury and fresh threats from Moscow | UK News","text":"Joe Biden’s belated decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied, long-range missiles inside Russia will be cheered by Kyiv and will almost certainly prompt the UK to follow suit.\n\nBut the stunning shift in US policy – just weeks before Donald Trump takes over as US president – will also trigger fury and fresh threats from Moscow at a time of increasing uncertainty about the future course of its war.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has warned the West they would be playing with fire if they allowed Ukrainian forces to launch Western-supplied cruise and ballistic missiles at Russia, saying it could even trigger a global conflict.\n\nBritish and US officials, though, have repeatedly advised their respective capitals not to be intimidated by Moscow’s sabre rattling.\n\nYet there has been hesitancy, particularly in Washington, over the unleashing of US Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) ballistic missiles beyond the borders of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, it seems that a move by North Korea to send thousands of its troops to fight with Russia has changed US calculations.\n\nThe New York Times, which was among the US media organisations to break news of the Biden administration’s decision on long-range missiles, reported that the first time the American weapons will be used inside Russia will likely be against Russian and North Korean troops battling a Ukrainian incursion in the Russian region of Kursk.\n\nWhile a significant step up in support for Ukraine, the ability to use American long-range missiles inside Russia is not a war-winning development.\n\nBut it does expand Kyiv’s capacity to hit important military targets deliberately positioned by Russian commanders far back from the frontline. This includes stockpiles of missiles, drones and other ammunition used to strike Ukraine.\n\nJust as important as the military impact, though, is the political signal that the US decision sends to the Kremlin about Washington’s willingness to defy Russian warnings about dire consequences should Mr Biden dare to grant Ukraine the permission it’s so long been seeking.\n\nThe dramatic move by the United States comes after months of lobbying by Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nA key thing to watch now will be how Mr Putin reacts the first time an American missile kills Russian soldiers on Russian soil.\n\nRead more:Trump unlikely to take Biden’s advice – it could change the worldCould Barron Trump run for president in 2044?The city where schools go underground\n\nMoscow does not want a direct war with the United States and NATO – nuclear-armed forces with far greater combined firepower – but the Kremlin could well ramp up an already heightened campaign of sabotage and other forms of hybrid warfare across Europe.\n\nAnother important reaction to track will be how Mr Trump responds to Mr Biden’s move and whether he continues to allow Ukraine this permission once he takes over as the US commander-in-chief.\n\nThe president-elect has vowed to end Russia’s war in Ukraine quickly but he has not said how.

In 2023, they made up 90 percent.\n\nHe also supports nutraceuticals, which are products derived from food sources that claim to provide benefits beyond basic nutrition.\n\nThese include dietary supplements like vitamins and fish oil, which many experts say don’t have any health benefits.\n\nMr Kennedy has also suggested devoting half the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget to researching alternative healthcare, and devoting more federal funding to determining why people are getting sick.\n\nVaccine shake-up\n\nMr Kennedy has previously claimed ‘no vaccine is effective’ and suggested childhood vaccines could be driving rising autism rates. \n\nHe has also previously floated the idea that schools with vaccine requirements should be defunded. \n\nHe appeared to back away from that stance earlier this week, however, but left the door open to making some vaccines non-compulsory.\n\nHe told NBC News: ‘If vaccines are working for somebody, I am not going to take them away.\n\n‘People ought to have a choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information, so I’m going to make sure that safety studies and efficacy studies are out there and people can make individual assumptions whether that product is going to be good for them.’\n\nIn 2019, Mr Kennedy flew to Samoa during the nation’s measles outbreak to campaign for people not to get the vaccine — saying it would cause autism, a theory widely debunked.\n\nDr Paul Offit, a pediatrician in Philadelphia who previously slammed Mr Kennedy as ‘remarkably dishonest,’ told DailyMail.com it was likely the administration would not be able to ban vaccines.\n\n‘I am confident that the guardrails in place at the FDA and CDC are long-standing and have served us well,’ he said. ‘I am not sure how much RFK Jnr can do to destroy that.’\n\nMany states mandate vaccines for children to allow them to attend school, including shots against measles, diphtheria, polio, hepatitis and chickenpox.\n\nThis is similar to European nations like Germany and France, which also mandate vaccinations for attending school, but differs from the UK — where all childhood vaccines are voluntary but widely recommended.\n\nVaccination uptake in the US is now falling to dangerously low levels, with experts blaming the explosion in conspiracy theories.\n\nCDC surveillance shows uptake of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, was below the optimum level for the third year in a row in the US — raising the risk of an outbreak because too few children have immunity.\n\nSurveillance suggests that the uptake of other major childhood vaccines like polio has also slipped. \n\nAll the vaccines have been through large and rigorous clinical trials, which have shown the shots are safe and highly effective at preventing the diseases.\n\nBefore the measles vaccine became available in 1963, about four million Americans were sickened and 450 died from the virus every year. And before the polio vaccine became available in the 1950s, about 15,000 people were paralyzed by the virus every year.\n\nCrack down on food \n\nMr Kennedy repeatedly hammers the food industry, saying they are ‘mass poisoning’ the American public.\n\nHe has promised to ban ultraprocessed food from schools and provide families ‘with safe food and end the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children.’\n\nHe also wants to ban harmful ingredients that are illegal in food abroad.\n\nHe has only explicitly mentioned Yellow 5, but similar ingredients that could be under the microscope are Red 40, Blue 1, titanium dioxide, propylparaben and potassium bromate, which are often added to sweets and baked goods.\n\nThe ingredients, which are either banned or heavily regulated in Europe, have been the focus of new laws trying to make food safer.\n\nMr Kennedy has also targeted McDonald’s french fries and criticized Trump’s diet.\n\nHe has argued against consuming seed oils, although others have pushed back on this. \n\nOverhauling food policy generally takes years, but in 2025 the Trump administration will be charged with writing the next iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a publication that provides recommendations every five years for what adults should do. \n\nEliminate fluoride in drinking water \n\nMr Kennedy has vowed to remove fluoride from the public water supply if elected within his first day in office.\n\nAdded to the water supply for three-quarters of Americans, it has been heralded as the greatest public health achievement of the 20th century for its ability to prevent cavities and tooth decay and save families thousands in dental bills.\n\nBut earlier this year, a federal study linked very high levels of the substance — more than are normally in tap water — to a drop in IQs of up to five points among children.\n\nThe team said they had ‘moderate confidence’ in their findings, and added that it just showed an association but did not prove that fluoride was causing lower IQ.\n\nDespite this, however, several cities have already withdrawn fluoride in response to the research, and an expert told DailyMail.com that expectant and new mothers should avoid it.\n\nWriting on X, Mr Kennedy said: ‘On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\n\n‘Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease.’\n\nSome studies have suggested exposure to high levels of fluoride can affect the thyroid, a gland in the front of the neck that manufactures hormones.\n\nBut there is no conclusive proof that fluoride is linked to Alzheimer’s and weakened bones. Over-exposure to fluoride has been linked to a condition called skeletal fluorosis, however, which leaves children with painful bones and joints. \n\nThe Fluoride Action Network, which spearheads efforts to remove fluoride, said online: ‘No matter who wins, one thing is crystal clear: Fluoridation is a house of cards.\n\n‘The science shows it. The public has caught on. Fluoride’s days are numbered.’\n\nThree cities held votes over adding fluoride to their drinking water yesterday — Hillsboro and Lebanon, in Oregon, and Sarcoxie, in Missouri — which all voted to have it removed from their drinking water.\n\nResponding to the allegations, Dr Offit said: ‘Fluoride has been well tested. It clearly and definitively decreases cavities, and is not associated with any clear evidence of the chronic diseases mentioned.’\n\nThe American Dental Association is a strong advocate of adding fluoride to water, with the CDC estimating it has saved more than $6.5billion in dental bills.\n\nA spokesperson said: ‘The key takeaway for the public and public health community… is that [studies and rulings] do not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.’\n\nThe quote was given in response to a bombshell ruling in California, which suggested that fluoride may pose a ‘hazard’ in drinking water. \n\nHealthcare savings accounts\n\nMr Kennedy has also said he wants to expand healthcare savings accounts.\n\nUnder the current scheme, these accounts — called HSAs — which allow people to deposit pre-tax income which can then be used tax-free to pay off medical bills.\n\nThey are currently typically only available to those enrolled on high-deductible health plans, such as employer-sponsored plans or bronze plans.\n\nBut Mr Kennedy wants to make them more accessible for Americans and provide greater flexibility for how the money is used — which may include also using it to access functional medicine doctors.\n\nAbout 37million Americans already have a HSA, estimates suggest — with the accounts having a combined value in excess of $123billion.\n\nEnd ‘corrupt’ healthcare agencies\n\nShould he be approved by the Senate to take on the role, Mr Kennedy has promised to ‘clean up corruption’ in the health agencies.\n\nAccepting the nomination, he said: ‘I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth.’\n\nHe added: ‘Together we will clean up corruption, stop the revolving door between industry and government, and return our health agencies to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.’\n\nMr Kennedy points out that more than 75 percent of the FDA’s drug review budget is provided by the pharmaceutical industry, which he says is a clear conflict of interest. Estimates also suggest that around 60 percent of FDA staff have previously worked for big pharma.\n\nMr Kennedy previously told the Washington Post: ‘The fact that Democratic sachems are debating whether their party should support public health as a political strategy rather than embracing it as a core value is testimony to how out of touch and morally bankrupt the party has become.\n\n‘Healthy food and clean, uncorrupted Government agencies ought not to be partisan issues.’\n\nHe is expected to curb the influence of industry-funded research groups in the area and to lean on Trump to ban thousands of chemicals that studies suggest are harmful to health.","summary":"Donald Trump&#8217;s appointment of Robert F Kennedy Junior as his most senior health&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/stock-market-plunges-as-trumps-rfk-appointment-and-healthcare-plan-are-unveiled/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Trumps-RFK-appointment-sends-stock-market-into-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:19:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":265425222,"title":"Criticism against Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey for stating the need to improve ties with Brussels after Brexit","text":"THE Bank of England’s boss says the UK must “rebuild relations” with Brussels following Brexit.\n\nSpeaking to City bosses, Andrew Bailey said the vote led to weaker trade.\n\nHe suggested the UK should move closer to the EU to prevent potential “geopolitical shocks” from Donald Trump’s term.\n\nBut ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night said: “That the Bank thinks it can work out Brexit is ludicrous.”\n\nConservative Member of Parliament Mark Francois expressed his desire for positive relationships with the European Union countries.

But development is rapidly depleting the world’s largest tropical rainforest, and rivers are drying up.\n\nFlying over a stretch of the Amazon in a helicopter, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in the Negro River tributary, and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge and the expansive waters where the Negro River joins the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.\n\nBiden met indigenous leaders — introducing his daughter and granddaughter to them — and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. Three indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony.\n\n“I’m proud to become the first sitting president to visit the Amazon,” Biden said before he signing a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day.\n\nHis administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway.\n\nSo far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution to the fund.\n\n“It’s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. … This shows a personal commitment from the president,” said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. “That said, we can’t expect concrete results from this visit.”\n\nShe doubts that a “single penny” will go to the Amazon Fund once Donald Trump is back in the White House.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he would again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the accord.\n\nTrump has cast climate change as a “hoax” and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration.\n\nStill, the Biden White House on Sunday announced a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change.\n\nAmong the actions is the launch of a finance coalition that looks to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030, and a $37.5 million loan to an organization to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil.\n\nBiden also plans to highlight that the U.S. is on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a sixfold increase from when he started his term.\n\nThe Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth’s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.\n\nThe forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers’ ability to fish. It’s also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke.\n\nWhen Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor, far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year high.\n\nLula has pledged “zero deforestation” by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week.\n\nIn that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 2,428 square miles, roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year’s reading.\n\nDespite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula’s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports.\n\nWhile Biden is the first sitting president in the Amazon, former President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to the region with the help of the American Museum of Natural History following his 1912 loss to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, joined by his son and naturalists, traversed roughly 15,000 miles, when the former president fell ill with malaria and suffered a serious leg infection after a boat accident.\n\nBiden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAfter his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year’s Group of 20 leaders summit.\n\nSa Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo, and Long from Washington.","summary":"Joe Biden toured the shrinking waters of the Rio Negro as the first sitting American president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/11/17/biden-becomes-the-first-sitting-us-president-to-visit-the-amazon-rainforest/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/11/Biden_44345_761761.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:16:09","author":"AAMER MADHANI,Aamer Madhani, Gabriela Sá Pessoa And Colleen Long,GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA and COLLEEN LONG - Associated Press","authors":["AAMER MADHANI","Aamer Madhani, Gabriela Sá Pessoa And Colleen Long","GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA and COLLEEN LONG - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.231},{"id":265424846,"title":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Selected as Health Secretary by Trump, Doug Collins to Oversee Veterans Affairs","text":"NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n“For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would “end the Chronic Disease epidemic” and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!”\n\nKennedy is one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world and has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism and other health issues.\n\nTrump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.\n\nHailing from one of the nation’s most storied political families, Kennedy is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent before abandoning his bid after striking a deal to give Trump his endorsement with a promise to have a role overseeing health policy in a second Trump administration.\n\nHe and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race’s final stretch, and Trump had made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major role overseeing public health as part of a campaign to “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\n“I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally last month.\n\nDuring his victory speech in Palm Beach, Florida, last week, Trump exclaimed, “Go have a good time, Bobby!”\n\nStill, it was unclear precisely what job he would be offered. In an October interview on CNN, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick assured there was no way Kennedy would receive the job he got.\n\nThe appointment drew alarms from public health experts.\n\n“Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nDr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, “I don’t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.”\n\n“Any misinformation coming from places of influence, of power, are concerning,” she said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nKennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.\n\nAgain and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.\n\nIn a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.\n\n“I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get them vaccinated,’” Kennedy said.\n\nRepeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year\n\nTrump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving many lives.\n\nTrump, in his announcement, said that, under Kennedy, HHS would “play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country.” But HHS does not have jurisdiction over many of those issues, which fall under the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture.\n\nKennedy is an attorney who has built a loyal following over several decades of people who admire his lawsuits against major pesticide and pharmaceutical companies. He has pushed for tighter regulations around the ingredients in foods.\n\nWith the Trump campaign, he worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, with his message of making food more healthful in the U.S., promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. In a nod to Trump’s original campaign slogan, he named the effort “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nIt remains unclear how that will square with Trump’s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.\n\nKennedy’s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nHe also has said he would recommend removing fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the material has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.\n\nHe has said he would seek to ban certain food additives, cracking down on substances such as food dyes and preservatives, which are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. He has also targeted pesticides, which are jointly regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA.\n\nKennedy has also drawn headlines for his history with wild animals. He admitted to dumping a dead bear in New York’s Central Park — placing it as though it had been hit by a bike — and found himself the subject of a federal probe after his daughter revealed that he had cut off a beached whale’s head and strapped it to the roof of his car to take home.\n\nHHS has more than 80,000 employees across the country. Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the CDC.\n\nHe has said he is especially focused on putting an end to the “revolving door” of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.\n\nKennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research.\n\nThe expected appointment was first reported by Politico Thursday.\n\nKennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nSeitz reported from Washington.

And I think that’s why the establishment in Washington is so shaken up about this pick,’ Johnson said.\n\nGaetz, 42, resigned his seat in the Republican-controlled House on Wednesday, hours after Trump selected him and two days before the Ethics Committee was expected to release its report, which also looked into allegations of illegal drug use. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Shannon Bream asked Johnson whether the full report should be publican, emphasizing that not only Democrats, but Republicans like Texas Senator John Cornyn wants the report released as well. \n\nJohnson believes letting the report come out would set a dangerous precedent going forward. \n\n‘I’m afraid that would open a Pandora’s box because the jurisdiction of the ethics committee is limited to those serving in the institution.’ \n\nHe said the tradition holding things together being broken could see the House of Representatives go after anyone they deem undesirable. \n\n‘With regard to the report there’s a very important reason for the tradition and the rule that we have almost always followed and that is we don’t issue investigations and ethics reports on people who are not members of Congress,’ he said. \n\nHis comments came as Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin became the latest GOP Senate member to ask that it be at least given to the Senate as evidence in confirmation hearings.\n\n‘I hope that the Ethics Committee will stick by our tradition and protocol for the reasons I just articulated. I think this would take us down a path there where I don’t know how we’d return,’ Johnson continued . \n\n‘If the House Ethics Committee and its resources, which are significant, substantial, could be used to investigate people who are not in the House, then where would that end?’\n\nUltimately, Johnson had nothing but praise for his longterm House colleague Gaetz and fully endorsed him for the job.\n\n‘The reason that Matt Gaetz is such an exciting pick to so many people is because he will go in and reform the Department of Justice. It desperately needs it.’ \n\nMullin told NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ that the Senate, which holds the authority to confirm or deny Trump’s nominations to high-level positions, needs to see the report.\n\n‘The senate should have access to that,’ Mullin said, declining to say whether he believed the report should be made public.\n\nJohn Cornyn said that he simply wants to have all the available information before voting. \n\n‘The President’s role is to make the nomination, but we need to have complete vetting of the nominees, not only so we know that the nominee is qualified, but also to protect the president,’ Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday. \n\nHe ‘absolutely’ wants to review the House Ethics Committee’s report on Gaetz’s conduct.\n\nCornyn even floated the idea of taking legal action to review the report’s contents. \n\n‘There’s various ways we can glean access to it, we can subpoena it,’ he told reporters. ‘I don’t I don’t think any of us want to fly blind.’\n\nFollowing Donald Trump’s nomination of Gaetz to serve as attorney general on Wednesday there have been increasing bipartisan calls for the report on his alleged sexual misconduct and drug use to be released. \n\nThat would break with Ethics Committee norms as Gaetz resigned his spot in Congress immediately after being nominated, meaning the committee no longer has jurisdiction over the former Florida Republican. \n\nBut advocates for the report’s release say that its contents are pertinent to whether or not Gaetz gets confirmed by the Senate, and therefore it should be released. \n\nSpeaker Johnson pushed back on that Friday, saying he wants the Ethics Committee to refrain from publishing the potentially damaging file. \n\n‘I’m going to strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report because that is not the way we do things in the House, and I think that would be a terrible precedent to set,’ Johnson said coming out of his office.\n\nThe Ethics panel was set to meet Friday to decide whether to release the report.\n\nHowever that meeting was scuttled after Gaetz’s sudden resignation. \n\nHis exit comes as allegations resurfaced Thursday about a woman who reportedly testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17. \n\nThe woman – now in her 20s – talked about Gaetz and her having sex when she was a minor in high school while ‘representing that she was an adult,’ sources told ABC News.\n\nThe FBI had investigated similar claims against Gaetz, but the DOJ opted not to indict him over claims he sex trafficked a minor.\n\nTrump’s pick of the embattled former congressman to oversee the Justice Department, FBI, DEA, ATF and related agencies has shocked Republicans and Democrats. \n\nAnd the bombshell claims could derail his hopes of taking the helm as attorney general. \n\nAlready reports indicate that Republicans in the Senate are not on board with Gaetz becoming AG. \n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, sources say that Gaetz already has at least 30 Republicans planning on voting against his nomination. \n\nGaetz is one of a series of Cabinet nominees tapped by Trump last week who lack the resumes normally seen in candidates for high-level administration jobs. \n\nHe would need to be confirmed by the Senate — where Trump’s Republicans will have a majority of at least 52 of the 100 seats — to get the post. A handful have expressed skepticism at the choice.","summary":"Mike Johnson called Matt Gaetz &#8216;one of the brightest minds in Washington&#8217; while insisting a&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/mike-johnsons-surprising-reaction-to-the-question-of-whether-the-ethics-report-on-matt-gaetzs-allegations-of-underage-sex-should-be-made-public/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Speaker-Mike-Johnsons-shock-response-to-whether-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:14:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":265425170,"title":"In a meeting with Biden, Xi cautions US to ‘make the wise choice’ to keep relations stable","text":"China’s leader Xi Jinping met for the last time with U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday but was already looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump and his “America first” policies, saying Beijing “is ready to work with a new U.S. administration.”\n\nDuring their talks on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru, Xi cautioned that a stable China-U.S. relationship was critical not only to the two nations but to the “future and destiny of humanity.”\n\n“Make the wise choice,” he cautioned. “Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.”\n\nWithout mentioning Trump’s name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president’s protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the U.S.-China relationship into another valley.\n\n“China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said through an interpreter.\n\nXi, who is firmly entrenched atop China’s political hierarchy, spoke in his brief remarks before reporters. \n\nBiden, who is winding down more than 50 years of public service, talked in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship between the two countries has gone.\n\nHe reflected not just on the past four years but on the decades the two have known each other.\n\n“We haven’t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We’ve never kidded one another,” Biden said. “These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict.”\n\nBiden urged Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia’s war on Ukraine. The leaders, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at a Lima hotel.\n\nThey had much to discuss, including China’s indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. On artificial intelligence, the two agreed on the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons and more broadly improve safety and international cooperation of the rapidly expanding technology.\n\nThere’s much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60% tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nAlready, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.\n\nIn a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era. In front of cameras Saturday, Xi spoke to Biden — but it was unmistakable that his message was directed at Trump.\n\n“In a major flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution,” Xi said. “Only mutual, beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. ‘Small yard, high fence’ is not what a major country should pursue.”\n\nBiden administration officials have said they would advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face.\n\nOn Saturday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden had reinforced to Xi “that these next two months are a time of transition” and that the president would like to pass off the U.S.-China relationship “in stable terms” to the new administration.\n\nBiden has viewed his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating it. The two first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression. They last met a year ago on the APEC sidelines in Northern California.\n\n“For over a decade, you and I have spent many hours together, both here and in China and in between,” Biden said. “We’ve spent a long time dealing with these issues.”\n\nBut the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments.\n\nThe FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into U.S. telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a “broad and significant” cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics.\n\nSullivan said Biden raised the matter with Xi during their talks and that the U.S. will have more to say about the investigation in the weeks ahead.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine.\n\nAnd tensions flared last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed the United States.\n\nBiden wants Xi to step up Chinese engagement to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further escalating.\n\nBiden, along with South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, on Friday condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s decision to send thousands of troops to help Moscow repel Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia’s Kursk border region.\n\nWhite House officials have expressed frustration with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea’s trade, for not doing more to rein in Pyongyang.\n\nThe North Koreans also have provided Russia with artillery and other munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. And the U.S., Japan and South Korea have expressed alarm over Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests.\n\nKim ordered testing exercises in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nXi and Biden started their day at the leaders’ retreat at the APEC summit, taking part in a photo where they all wore scarves made from vicuña wool, a symbolic animal for Peru. It’s common practice that leaders at these gatherings are given a gift — usually traditional clothing of the host country — that they don for the photo.

Social media buzzed with reactions, with many poking fun at the incident.\n\nOne user joked, “Hey @AlecBaldwin, learn how to zip your pants! #AlecBaldwin #SNL #zippergate.”\n\nAnother added, “Alec Baldwin’s fly being open during the send-off was the funniest part of @nbcsnl tonight.” One comment took a more critical tone, saying, “Alec Baldwin standing on stage at the end of Saturday Night Live with his fly down. Anyone else catch that? He looked completely dishevelled. Those charges must have taken a toll on the old man,” referencing Baldwin’s ongoing legal challenges related to Rust.\n\nA different viewer wrote, “Alec Baldwin just showing up in the outro for SNL while clearly f**ked up and had his fly down, and he didn’t even do anything this whole show LMFAO what is going on #SNL.”\n\nDespite the mishap, Baldwin made his mark earlier in the episode, debuting a new impression of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nStream Saturday Night Live on BINGE, available on Hubbl.\n\nHe joined a high-profile cold open alongside James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump, Dana Carvey as Joe Biden, and Sarah Sherman as Matt Gaetz.\n\nBaldwin mocked Kennedy’s controversial persona in the sketch while parodying his appointment as the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n“Americans need someone to teach them how to be healthy, someone like me, a 70-year-old man with movie star looks and a worm in his brain,” Baldwin quipped, referencing Kennedy’s infamous claim about doctors finding a parasitic worm in his head.\n\nWhile the impression drew laughs, it also sparked backlash, with critics arguing Baldwin’s appearance was poorly timed given his legal issues following the tragic shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the Rust set.\n\n“They actually brought that deadbeat Alec Baldwin back?? SNL just needs to call it quits already,” tweeted one viewer. Another remarked, “I don’t know who keeps wanting more Alec Baldwin on SNL, but it’s not me.” \n\nBaldwin also mocked Kennedy’s vaccine scepticism, imitating his unique voice, which is affected by spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nBaldwin’s return to SNL comes months after the dismissal of manslaughter charges connected to the 2021 on-set death.\n\nThe incident occurred during a rehearsal for Rust when Baldwin was handling a prop gun that unexpectedly discharged, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza.

We could strike preventively, if we had the ability to strike long enough,\" Zelensky said in an evening address.On Sunday, he noted that the reports about Biden's policy change had not been openly confirmed by the White House but said the \"missiles will speak for themselves.\" Putin has warned that the use of ATACMS inside Russia would mean the NATO alliance being \"at war\" with his country -- a threat he has made previously when Ukraine's Western backers have escalated their military assistance.Western intelligence reports suggest that around 10,000 North Korean troops are being deployed in Russia. The American shift is likely to lead European allies to review their stances on long-range missiles, even though experts say the weapons alone will not decisively tilt current battlefield dynamics.France and Britain have provided Ukraine with their long-range Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles, but have held back from authorizing their use inside Russia without American approval for ATACMS.During a meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain discussed how to put Ukraine in \"the strongest possible position going into the winter,\" his office said afterward.Speaking in Argentina on Sunday, Macron said Putin \"does not want peace\" and that \"it's clear that President Putin intends to intensify the fighting.\"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to supply Ukraine with his country's Taurus missiles with a range of over 310 miles (500 kilometers) over fears that they could hit Russian territory.In the final two months of the Biden administration, US officials have promised to spend the remaining $6 billion of approved Ukraine funding at their disposal.It is unclear how many ATACMS remain in Ukraine's arsenal.The missile is made by US defense group Lockheed Martin and has a top range of 190 miles (300 kilometers).Trump has provided no specifics on how he plans to end the conflict in Ukraine, and is expected to pressure Kyiv to give up its claim to some or all of its territory conquered by Russia.Trump's pick for his National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, said recently that \"pouring more billions in (to Ukraine) is the definition of insanity at this point,\" adding that the conflict was a \"stalemate.\"Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has even mocked Zelensky online, sharing a clip on Instagram last weekend that said the Ukrainian leader was just weeks away \"from losing your allowance.\"Writing Sunday about Biden's missile decision, he said \"the military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives.\"Russia pounded Ukraine on Sunday with a massive attack that killed 11 civilians across several regions and damaged the country's already fragile energy grid.","summary":"US President Joe Biden's decision to authorize Ukraine to use long-range American missiles against targets inside Russia is a bold shift in position in the final months before he hands over power to Republican Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/biden-answers-missile-pleas-ukraine-clock-ticks-down-3751472","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4562492/russias-vladimir-putin-has-argued-that-ukraines-us-made-atacms-missile-against-targets-inside.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:06:12","author":"Adam Plowright And Shaun Tandon","authors":["Adam Plowright And Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":265425154,"title":"Kamala Harris raised $1 billion-plus in defeat.

Jennifer Rubin locked up her account, and The Guardian declared it will no longer infect our timelines with its daft editorials; Don Lemon surprised many that he is still on the site that fired him, while Joy Reid has now become the latest to generate apathy with her departure.\n\nBut we know the actual reason, and it is that these journalists and outlets have been rendered useless due to the election result. They are facing obsolescence, and they cannot tolerate having their inability to sway the general public thrown in their faces, on the platform they lost control over when Elon Musk strode in. The last thing they want is to have to face reality on a daily basis, so they will take off to Threads, or BlueSky, or Mastodon – digital bubbles where they will be safe from criticism and coddled by like-minded, soft-souled journos.\n\nThis is done at their own demise. Threads – the META attempt to duplicate Xitter – made the declaration it was downplaying news cycles on its platform. Well now, that’s a swell landing spot for a journalist. BlueSky has been a mostly left wing echo chamber, where the primary discourse is about Trump and how bad Xitter has become. Mastodon is where the hyper-sensitives went to get away from Elon Musk – so they camp out and talk about how intolerable Elon Musk is among themselves.\n\nBut there is another reason why this petulant egress from Xitter is a misguided conniption fit. The site dwarfs their alternatives mightily. BlueSky has about 4 percent of the user traffic, and despite its connections to Meta’s Facebook, Threads is doing even worse:\n\nJust to add to the amusement of the peacocking journalists who are quitting this site — their boasts of setting up at BlueSky or Threads means they are moving to a platform with a fraction of the traffic.Soooo…good move, we guess? pic.twitter.com/bzj5xsRLtP— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) November 14, 2024\n\nTo see this kind of reaction to an election result from the allegedly unbiased news services reveals it all. For just over a week, we have seen journalists’ and outlets’ mewling that the public did not listen to their warnings on the dangers of Donald Trump, an admission they had chosen a side and were pimping for the Democrats and Kamala Harris. Now facing the results of their being ignored, they are handling this about as well as Tim Walz handling a video game controller.\n\nElon Musk has become the target on their 8×10 glossy dartboard since the election, as he is blamed for Trump’s landslide victory. Many are complaining about the level of influence this billionaire will now have, and how it is dangerous for him to give Trump a voice on his social platform. Of course, these were not concerns when the previous billionaire gave access to the Biden administration (as shown in the Twitter Files), nor were there outraged rants about another billionaire – Mark Zuckerberg – influencing the 2020 results with his funding of local officials, as well as smothering any discussion of the Hunter Biden laptop. Not all billionaires are demonized equally.\n\nWhat none of these brave retreaters are willing to admit is that they are overwhelmed by Xitter. The platform has given more opportunity for free expression, and they hate that. It is a formidable competition. It derails their preferred narratives. And it exposes their lying and graft in the news environment. No longer are those cranks pointing out their tactics silenced, and this is not tolerable. Of course, it is all classified as misinformation, as well as dangerous; their own misinformation is perfectly acceptable.\n\nWhat is most amusing is they feel as if this is going to somehow become injurious to those remaining. For years conservatives tried populating their own social media platforms, with middling success. Just as Parler was looking like it would serve that purpose, Amazon yanked the plug on that venture, stifling it and rendering it negligible to this day. Musk has done the magnanimous thing–flushed out that oppressive corporate hectoring and allowed more free rein on his site.\n\nThe people who promote limiting discourse and barricading free expression want to leave? I’d like to know what the downside to this can be. Basically, users wanted to be left alone and permitted to express themselves. If the nattering Karens opposed to the First Amendment want to truncate their voice on other sites, do not let me get in their way as they leave.\n\nBut I will need earplugs during their dramatic exit.","summary":"It has been a case of high drama on Xitter this past&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/exploring-the-reporters-who-left-elon-musks-x-platform-following-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Let039s-Consider-the-Self-Deleting-Journalists-Who-Quit.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:04:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.621},{"id":265426486,"title":"Donald Trump Jr. says pushback against Cabinet picks proves they’re the disrupters voters wanted","text":"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Donald Trump Jr. said Sunday that the team now around the president-elect knows how to choose a Cabinet and build out an administration, unlike the time before his father first took office.\n\nAny pushback that Donald Trump’s unconventional choices face from the Washington establishment proves that they are just the kind of disruptors the new administration and voters are demanding, the younger Trump said.\n\n“The reality this time is, we actually know what we’re doing. We actually know who the good guys and the bad guys are,” he told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures. “And it’s about surrounding my father with people who are both competent and loyal. They will deliver on his promises. They will deliver on his message. They are not people who think they know better, as unelected bureaucrats.”\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected in 2016, he stocked his early administration with choices from traditional Republican and business circles, tapping figures such as former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who was his first as secretary of state.\n\nToday, Trump is valuing personal allegiance above political experience.\n\nThat has translated into selections such as former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who faced a House ethics investigation, as attorney general, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic lawmaker who has in the past publicly expressed sympathy to Russian causes, as director of U.S. intelligence services.\n\nSome of his picks might face difficulties getting confirmed by the Senate, even with Republicans holding a majority in January.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. suggested that was precisely the idea.\n\n“A lot of them are going to face pushback” but ”they are going to be actual disrupters,” he said. “That’s what the American people want.”\n\nHe said there are “backup plans” if Senate confirmation is problematic in some cases, but “we’re obviously going with the strongest candidates first.”\n\nTrump Jr. also looked back to eight years ago, when his businessman father was new to Washington and its ways. “A big part of that process is just something that we didn’t understand in 2016, where he came to Washington, D.C., he had no experience,” he said.\n\nNow, his son said, Trump knows what to expect.\n\nSen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., said the president-elect has “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver that change, to take on permanent Washington, return the power back to the people.”\n\n“You have to have people you trust to go into these agencies and have a real reform agenda. And that’s why I think there’s real momentum, real momentum to get these nominations confirmed to actually deliver what President Trump promised on the campaign trail,” Schmitt told “Sunday Morning Futures.”\n\nOn the same show, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said, “We don’t need any Democrats to help us. We have got the numbers.” But, he added, Trump needs “a team around him that’s going to help him. He can’t do it by himself.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate tapped by Trump along with businessman Elon Musk to lead a new effort on government efficiency, also predicted pushback from traditional Washington to promised steep federal cuts that he said showed the needed to “in the early months, score quick wins through executive action.”","summary":"The president-elect's eldest son says there's 'backup plans' for some nominees if Senate confirmation becomes problematic.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/11/17/donald-trump-jr-says-pushback-against-cabinet-picks-proves-theyre-the-disrupters-voters-wanted/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Election_2024_Trump_53033_4d7899-1731889906.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:02:05","author":"Will Weissert,WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press","authors":["Will Weissert","WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":265425918,"title":"McDonald's feast with Trump undercuts RFK Jr's health pledge","text":"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has been pictured sharing a McDonald's meal with his future boss, days after they promised to \"make America healthy again.\"\n\nKennedy flew with Trump aboard his plane to an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout in New York on Saturday along with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Donald Jr, the Republican's eldest son.\n\nThe four men are shown seated in front of trays of McDonald's food in a photo posted online by Donald Jr on Sunday which he jokingly captioned: \"Make America Healthy Again starts TOMORROW.\"\n\nTrump and Kennedy, a scion of the famous Democratic political family, campaigned together ahead of the presidential election on November 5 promising to tackle processed food among other priorities.\n\nAnnouncing Kennedy's nomination on Thursday, Trump said that \"for too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies.\"\n\nSocial media commentators noted that Kennedy appeared the least enthusiastic of the diners as he gingerly held an opened burger box, with fries and a bottle of Coca-Cola in front of him.\n\nThe 70-year-old, a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine campaigner, has long argued that the United States needs to curb its obesity epidemic by reducing the high levels of sugar, fat and high-additive processed food in the national diet.\n\nIn a podcast posted last week, he was scathing about Trump's diet, saying \"the stuff that he eats is really bad.\"\n\n\"Campaign food is always bad, but the food that goes onto (Trump's) airplane is just poison,\" he told the Joe Polish podcast. \"You don't have a choice, you're either given KFC or Big Macs.\"\n\nTrump has never made a secret of his love of fast food and Diet Coke, even briefly stopping to work at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania during his campaign in October.\n\n\"I love salt!\" he told workers there.\n\nKennedy will need confirmation by the Senate to take up his job as health secretary, with some senior Republicans voicing concerns about his suitability for the position.","summary":"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has been pictured sharing a McDonald's meal with his future boss, days after they promised to…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/mcdonald%27s-feast-undercuts-trump-health-pledge","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/13/cf/77efd4ed6c73670ad135ed81d85f9fcd359c/13cf77efd4ed6c73670ad135ed81d85f9fcd359c/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-18 00:01:39","author":"Donald Jr,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Donald Jr","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":265427050,"title":"During Trump 2.0, India second only to US for investors: Viswas Raghavan, Executive Vice-Chair, Citigroup","text":"Mumbai: India is expected to be the second-biggest draw for global investments after the US during Donald Trump's second term as the president, a top Wall Street banker said.Investors, who are sitting on more than $3 trillion to deploy, would be choosy and there would be a divergence of flows between the public and private markets, driven by the returns outlook, said Viswas Raghavan, executive vice-chairman at Citigroup Inc. We have spent quite some time looking at and assessing these flows... The biggest market of inward investment is the US and the second biggest market is India, he said.As Trump pushes for the US to become a manufacturing hub again, multinational companies are redrawing their investment plans. While policy changes could unsettle the global business order, they are expected to boost jobs in the US.India-being a market by itself and on the right side of Trump-could be a beneficiary, said Raghavan, who grew up in Mumbai.Energy, infrastructure and consumer will be the dominant themes for international investors here even as there is a need to shift to environmental-friendly sources and address the needs of the huge population, he said. The beauty of something like India is whatever you can produce, you can also consume, Raghavan said. Whereas if you take a United Kingdom or other country, you need to ship it around. Rising incomes and unmet demand of the population make India the best market for goods and services, he said. 'Question Really Around Valuations' With the government's thrust on manufacturing, the rise of a new wealthy class, and the economy projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 7% - highest among major markets - the investment flows are set to increase, Raghavan said. The question really is around valuations, he said. In almost three to four years, we are seeing that earnings are not supporting.''Indian stock markets have provided the best returns among emerging markets over the past two decades in US dollar terms, as earnings grew. But that seems to have hit a wall, with portfolio investors selling a record $13 billion in the past two months, as valuations at more than 22 times forward year earnings appear expensive, with faltering profit growth.Booming wealth and banking reforms have also made Indian corporates deleverage, and they are at the forefront of the global stage, providing opportunities for Citigroup to rebuild its business, Raghavan said. His presence at the top could help accelerate it. Now we have companies who are absolutely best in class, who can do a phenomenal job in putting India on the world stage, Raghavan said. If somebody comes to me, gives me an Indian name, saying they want to do so-and-so, I don't need to go and find out what the company does. I've grown up with many of these names. There's no discovery process. Pushing Advisory BusinessCitigroup, as part of its global restructuring to improve its profitability, sold off its retail business in Asia, including in India. It remains a corporate bank in most parts of the world.Raghavan, who spent decades in JPMorgan, driving its European business, was hired by Citigroup chief executive Jane Frazer to rebuild its corporate banking.One of his main agendas is to drive the fee income and regain market share in its advisory business. Citi has been a laggard among Wall Street firms in this space. Raghavan is putting building blocks to regain the lost glory. I have three verticals (corporate, commercial, investment banking). The drive, very much, is to get ourselves organised, and effectively bring those three businesses and thread them very, very closely together, he said.After the global financial crisis, all full-fledged Wall Street banks were restricted by regulation from taking disproportionate risks. While peers JPMorgan and Bank of America came back, Citi remained risk averse in funding clients in risky bets such as takeovers, especially by buyout firms. As a result, Citi's share of leveraged loans has fallen to less than 4%, from more than 12% prior to the crisis.Raghavan has taken the first step to reverse the trend by partnering with Apollo Management for a $25-billion credit fund that would help it stitch takeovers with funding as well. The thing with leveraged finance is not the availability of liquidity. You can get infinite private credit funds all crying for paper. The problem is the supply side, which is why we tied up with Apollo, with Mubadala and Athene in it, he said.","summary":"India is poised to become the second-largest recipient of global investments after the US during President Trump's second term.
