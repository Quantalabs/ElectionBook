{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":10412,"news":[{"id":327837946,"title":"Elon Musk Slams Trump's Funding Bill, Calls It Disgusting Abomination","text":"WASHINGTON: Elon Musk blasted President Donald Trump’s“big, beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts as a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday, testing the limits of his political influence as he targeted the centerpiece of Republicans’ legislative agenda.The broadside, which Musk issued on his social media platform X, came just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office farewell that marked the end of his work for the administration, where he spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency.“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”The legislation, which has passed the House and is currently under debate in the Senate, would curtail subsidies that benefit Tesla, Musk’s electric automaker.The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans.“In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” he wrote in another X post.It’s a sharp shift for Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump’s campaign last year. He previously pledged to help defeat Republican lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump, but now he’s suggesting voting them out if they advance the president’s legislative priority.However, it’s unclear how Musk will follow through on his criticism. He recently said he would spend “a lot less” on political campaigns, though he left the door open to political involvement “if I see a reason.”The tech titan’s missives could cause headaches for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who face conflicting demands from Trump and their party’s wealthiest benefactor.Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said “it’s not helpful” to have Musk criticizing the legislation, but he doesn’t expect lawmakers to side with Musk over Trump.“Senate Republicans are not going to let the tax cuts expire,” Conant said. “It just makes leadership’s job that much harder to wrangle the holdouts.”Trump can change the outcome in Republican primaries with his endorsements, but Musk doesn’t wield that level of influence, Conant said.“No matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don’t want to diminish him because I don’t think that’s fair — it’s still going to be second fiddle to President Trump,” said Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.Musk’s business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump’s bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, the nation’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which has massive defense contracts.Last month, Musk said he was “disappointed” by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he leveled Tuesday.The budget package seeks to extend tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump’s first term at the White House, and add new ones he campaigned on. It also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.To defray some of the lost tax revenue to the government and limit piling onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want to reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services.Musk’s post threw another hurdle in front of Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s already complex task to pass a bill in time for Trump to achieve his goal of signing it by July 4. The South Dakota Republican has few votes to spare in the GOP’s slim 53-seat majority.Two of the Senate’s most fiscally hawkish Republicans quickly backed Musk.“We can and must do better,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on X. Utah Sen. Mike Lee said “federal spending has become excessive,” adding that it causes inflation and “weaponizes government.”Still, Trump enjoys fierce loyalty among the GOP base, and in the end, his opinion may be the only one that matters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt played down Musk’s criticism.“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” Leavitt said, and Musk’s post “doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”The tension in the GOP delighted Democrats, who found themselves in the unlikely position of siding with Musk. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts — with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.“We’re in complete agreement,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said of Musk. The New York Democratic lawmaker stood alongside a poster-sized printout of Musk’s post during a Capitol news conference.The last time Musk weighed in significantly on legislation, the scenario was far different. His power was ascendant after the election, with Trump joining him for a rocket test in...","summary":"The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/elon-musk-slams-trumps-funding-bill-calls-it-disgusting-abomination-1883212","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/06/04/1924299-screenshot2025-06-04at10221pm.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 01:06:27","author":"DC Correspondent","authors":["DC Correspondent"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":327836806,"title":"World News | Union Minister Piyush Goyal Highlights 'India Opportunity' at India-France Business Conference","text":"Paris [France], June 4 (ANI): Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal addressed the India-France Business Conference on Tuesday (local time), highlighting the 'India Opportunity', driven by a skilled and talented workforce and the government's commitment to ease of doing business, and how it offers promising avenue for French companies.

Votes were still being counted for the majority of the 2,600 federal, state and local judge positions up for grabs in Sunday's elections, but results neared completion for the nine Supreme Court positions.

The majority of the newly elected justices share strong ties and ideological alignments with the ruling party, shifting a once fairly balanced high court into the hands of the very party that overhauled the judicial system to elect judges for the first time. Experts warned the shift would undercut checks and balances in the Latin American nation and would offer President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party an easier path to push through their agenda. Also Read | Operation Sindoor: 6 Pakistan Fighter Jets, 1 C-130 Aircraft, Multiple Cruise Missiles, UAVs Destroyed During IAF Retaliation. \"We're watching as power is falling almost entirely into the hands of one party,\" said Georgina De la Fuente, election specialist with the Mexican consulting firm Strategia Electoral. \"There isn't any balance of power.\" Despite that, officials have continued to fiercely reject democratic concerns. A Morena-leaning court and an Indigenous justice With more than 98% of votes counted Tuesday night, most of those slated to head Mexico's highest court were members or former members of the Morena party. A number of them who were Supreme Court justices prior to the election were appointed by former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Sheinbaum's mentor who pushed through the judicial overhaul last year. Others were advisers to the former president or the party or campaigned with politically aligned visions for the judiciary. Mexico's top electoral authority listed the nine likely winners in a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Not all of the prospective winners were explicitly aligned with Morena. One standout was Hugo Aguilar Ortiz, an Indigenous lawyer from the southern state of Oaxaca. He has no clear party affiliation, though Sheinbaum said repeatedly she hoped to have an Indigenous judge on the court and said on Tuesday she was happy to see he would be. Political controversy Critics had feared that Morena would emerge from the election with control of the judiciary. The vote came after months of fierce debate, prompted when López Obrador and the party jammed through the reforms for judges to be elected instead of being appointed based on merits. The overhaul will notably limit the Supreme Court as a counterweight to the president. Judges, experts and the political opposition say the reform was an attempt to take advantage of high popularity levels to stack courts in favour of Morena. Sheinbaum and her mentor have insisted that electing judges will root out corruption in a system most Mexicans agree is broken. On Tuesday, Sheinbaum brushed off complaints by Mexico's opposition — which called for a boycott of the vote — that the Supreme Court was now unfairly stacked against them, saying \"they're the ones who decided not to participate in the election.\" The elections were marred by low participation — about 13% — and confusion by voters who struggled to understand the new system, something opponents quickly latched onto as a failure. De la Fuente said Morena is likely to use its new lack of a counterweight in the high court to push through rounds of reforms, including reforms to Mexico's electoral systems, a proposal that has stirred controversy and was previously blocked by courts. Guadalupe Taddei Zavala, chief counsellor of Mexico's electoral authority, on Tuesday rejected democratic concerns. “I don't see any (constitutional) crisis after the election,” she said. Likely Supreme Court justices — Hugo Aguilar Ortiz was the big surprise from the election. The Indigenous lawyer led all vote-getters, including several sitting Supreme Court justices. He's known as a legal activist fighting for the rights of Indigenous Mexicans and has criticized corruption in the judiciary. — Lenia Batres was already a Supreme Court justice and was appointed by López Obrador. Previously a congresswoman, she's a member of Morena and an ally of Mexico's president. — Yasmín Esquivel is a Supreme Court justice who was appointed by López Obrador. She focused her campaign on modernizing the justice system and has pushed for gender equality. She was at the centre of a 2022 controversy when she was accused of plagiarizing her thesis. She is considered an ally of the Morena party. — Loretta Ortiz is a justice on the Supreme Court who was appointed by López Obrador. She also served in Congress and resigned from Morena in 2018 in a show of independence as a judge. She's considered an ally of the party. — María Estela Ríos González is a lawyer who acted as legal adviser to López Obrador, first when he was mayor of Mexico City and later when he became president. She has a long history as a public servant and works in labour law and on a number of Indigenous issues. — Giovanni Figueroa Mejía is a lawyer from the Pacific coast state of Nayarit with a doctorate in constitutional law. He works as an academic at the Iberoamericana University in Mexico City. He's worked in human rights. While he holds no clear party affiliation, he supported the judicial overhaul, saying in an interview with his university that it “was urgent and necessary in order to rebuild” the judiciary. — Irving Espinosa Betanzo is a magistrate on Mexico City's Supreme Court and has previously worked as a congressional adviser to Morena. He campaigned for the country's highest court on a platform of eliminating nepotism and corruption and pushing for human rights. — Arístides Rodrigo Guerrero García is a law professor pushing for social welfare with no experience as a judge but who has worked as a public servant and has experience in both constitutional and parliamentary law. He gained traction in campaigns for a social media video of him claiming he's “more prepared than a pork rind.” — Sara Irene Herrerías Guerra is a prosecutor specializing in human rights for Mexico's Attorney General's Office. She's worked on issues like gender equality, sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. In 2023, she worked on the investigation of a fire in an immigration facility in the border city of Ciudad Juárez that killed 40 migrants.

However, Shashi Tharoor has expressed confidence in pushing India's message on terrorism across.\nSpeaking to ANI before departing for Washington, DC, he said that the US media is a difficult space, but those who are against terrorism and deeply care about South East Asia and are against terrorism will listen to India.\nAlso Read | Operation Sindoor: 6 Pakistan Fighter Jets, 1 C-130 Aircraft, Multiple Cruise Missiles, UAVs Destroyed During IAF Retaliation.\n\"In Washington, we'll have the interesting phenomenon of the Pakistani delegation in America, and almost exactly the same days... Tomorrow almost they will be in Washington, while we are in Washington on the same date. So there's going to be perhaps an increase in interest because there are two duelling delegations in the same city,\" Tharoor told ANI, as the delegation he is leading will be in the US for its last leg of the visit.\nTharoor said that though India's case might not be at the top of the agenda for the US media, India can get its message across easily.\n\"It's a challenging environment. America is a very crowded media space, the world's news generator. Therefore, our story may not be at the top of their minds. But if we can get the attention of those who care about South Asia, those who care about India, those who care about terrorism, we can get our message across very, very easily,\" he said.\nTharoor said that the delegation has meetings set up with influential government officials and committees which formulate public opinion.\nHe said, \"In Washington we have meetings set up with the entire range of public opinion in Washington, government officials, legislators, there are senators and congressmen, various committees in the House and the Senate, think tanks who are very influential in Washington, particularly those focusing on foreign policy, media and some public addresses, like, for example, the National Press Club... I've been asked to give six or seven interviews, seven or eight interviews to individual American channels and broadcasters, podcasters, and so on,\" he said.\nTharoor said that the US is important to India in terms of defence, intelligence sharing, QUAD, etc.\n\"The US is important to us at all levels because frankly the Security Council in a sense is a small part of our relationship with the US which is huge, whether it comes to trade, whether it comes to defence, whether it comes intelligence sharing, whether it comes to our participation in the QUAD in the G-20, there are just so many avenues in which we cooperate with the US,\" he said.\nTharoor added that it's no coincidence that Pakistan sent its own delegation, but they are not covering as many countries as India is. He said the Pakistani delegation is covering countries that they deem important.\n\"It's no accident that the Pakistanis have also sent a delegation abroad, but they're not going to as many countries as the Indian delegations are. They're focusing on what they consider a few key capitals, namely, Washington, Brussels. London. That seems to be the thrust of the Pakistani effort. We have gone to all those capitals and more,\" he said.\nTharoor said that he has enormous respect for the US, but denied claims that the US had mediated in reaching the cessation of hostilities. He added that India never wanted war.\n\"We have enormous respect for the American presidency, and we will speak with that respect in mind. But broadly speaking, our understanding is a bit different... No one needed to persuade us to stop. We had already said to stop. If there was any persuasion by the American president or his senior officials, it would have been persuasion of the Pakistanis. They would have had to be persuaded. We don't need to be persuaded because we don't want war. We want to focus on development. That's the basic message,\" he said.\n\"We had consistently said from the very beginning on May 7th that we are not interested in prolonging the conflict. This is not the opening salvo in some sort of war. All it is is retribution against the terrorists, period. If Pakistan had not reacted, we would not have reacted,\" he added.\nPakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on May 17 stated that Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had tasked him to lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case on the recent escalations of tensions between the two nations. India's all-party delegation's visit to the US is part of India's larger global outreach following the Pahalgam terror attack, aimed at conveying India's zero-tolerance policy on terrorism. The delegation had earlier visited Brazil, Panama, Guyana, and Colombia and will now travel to the United States to continue their diplomatic outreach.

The US Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year so she can continue to receive the treatment she has been getting since arriving at the US-Mexico border in 2023, according to a copy of a letter received by Rebecca Brown, an attorney for the family.

The Trump administration has been pushing to dismantle policies from President Joe Biden's administration that granted temporary legal status for certain migrants and allowed them to live legally in the US, generally for two years. The girl was taken to a hospital upon arriving at the US-Mexico border with her mother in 2023 and released once she was stable enough. She receives intravenous nutrition through a special backpack for short bowel syndrome, which prevents her from being able to take in and process nutrients on her own, and lawyers said the treatment she receives is necessary at this stage for her to survive and isn't available in Mexico. Humanitarian parole, which doesn't put migrants on a path to US citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to alleviate pressure on the US-Mexico southern border. It was previously used on a case-by-case basis to address individual emergencies and also for people fleeing humanitarian crises around the world, including Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the late 1970s. In Mexico, the girl was largely confined to a hospital because of her medical condition, according to her mother, Deysi Vargas. After joining a program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, she can now receive treatment at home in Bakersfield, California, and go to the park and store like other children, Vargas has said. Lawyers said the girl's medical treatment, which requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition, will not be necessary indefinitely but that she is not at the point where she could live without it.

In an interview with ANI, Doraiswami emphasised that India's ties with the UK have gained traction.

There is great sympathy and understanding in the UK for what India has gone through in terms of our long and painful journey with cross-border terrorism that has emanated from Pakistan-controlled territory and the state of Pakistan. There is a great sense of understanding of the anger and hurt in India that this scourge just doesn't go away.\"\n\"That said, of course, the UK has its own position. It's a sovereign government. It will take its own decisions, but in the last decade and more, we see a steady evolution as our relationship with the UK has gained weight, traction, and strategic dimensions. The UK's approach to challenges that have long persisted in South Asia has been much more understanding of our concerns, much more willing to respect the fact that these are problems that have to be solved by India and Pakistan and indeed all other problems in the region by the region. And that India's rise is, in broader terms, the greatest benefit of the Indo-Pacific region and the world as a whole. So, that sense comes through to all our parliamentarians,\" he added.

We have come here as far as I can understand from our parliamentary leaders, the people of India as representatives, that we are not here to seek favour from anybody. We are here to explain our position. We are here to point out what the people of India feel, and of course. We welcome the fact that our partners understand what we have to do, but we will do what we need to do to secure the people of India, any government of India, the current government in particular, are committed and will always remain committed to do whatever is necessary to secure our people, and that message has landed.\"\nThe all-party delegation, led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, was in the UK to garner widespread support for India's fight against terrorism and to expose Pakistan's role in fostering terrorism.\nThe delegation led by Ravi Shankar Prasad includes BJP MPs Daggubati Purandeswari and Samik Bhattacharya, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress MPs Ghulam Ali Khatana and Amar Singh, former Union Minister MJ Akbar, and former Ambassador Pankaj Saran.\nDuring the visit, they met with the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG)-India. They addressed the media there, during which the delegation delivered a strong message on the global threat of terrorism, highlighting Pakistan's misuse of international funds to support terrorism and arms proliferation.\nThe delegation also received widespread support from British parliamentarians, think tanks, and the Indian diaspora for India's democratic unity and firm stance against terrorism.\nThey were welcomed by APPG India President Sandy Verma, and the meeting was co-chaired by UK MPs Lord Karan Bilimoria and Jeevun Sandher. Many current and former MPs, including Lord Ed Vaizey, Bob Blackman, Barry Gardiner, Gurinder Singh Josan, Gagan Mohindra, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Kanishka Narayan, Shailesh Vara, Baggy Shanker, Mark Pritchard and others also joined the discussion.\nRavi Shankar Prasad stated that during their time in the UK, the delegation met with key UK figures, including the Speaker of the House of Commons and Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel, emphasising the need for international accountability on terrorism financing amidst appreciation for India's democratic approach.\nPrasad highlighted the global concern over terrorism as a \"cancer\" and called for scrutiny of Pakistan's use of international funds, noting the novelty of the all-party delegation initiative.\n\"This has been really good.

We met the Chairman of the Conservative Party yesterday; we also met Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel. We also met Indian Friends in the Labour Party... We also interacted with Think Tanks. All of them are concerned that terrorism is a cancer... We also said that they (Pakistan) get loans from the IMF and World Bank and they get other funding too. So, is the funding being used for terrorism and weapon purchases or for the poor? This should be asked of them... Everyone said one more thing: that the all-party Parliamentary delegation visit is a new initiative,\" Prasad said.\nThe delegation met UK Minister for Citizenship and Migration and Minister for Equalities Seema Malhotra at the UK Parliament. The delegation also held a meeting with the UK's Shadow Foreign Secretary, Priti Patel, and her team on Sunday to share India's firm resolve to counter cross-border terrorism.\nIn a post on X, the Indian High Commission in the UK stated, \"The All-Party Parliamentary Delegation met with Shadow Foreign Secretary @pritipatel and her team to share India's firm resolve in combating cross-border terrorism.

Long hours, unpredictable weather, social isolation and financial worry take their toll. But this is the first time that a coroner has blamed a farmer’s death on government policy.\n\nYet far from addressing this issue, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are only making matters worse. First, they went ahead with their decision to impose inheritance tax on family farms. Then, it emerged only last week that the Chancellor is considering massive cuts to the £5 billion worth of subsidies given to encourage ‘nature-friendly’ farming.\n\nWe have lost EU subsidies, but under the terms of this Environmental Land Management (ELM) fund, farmers are paid to grow wildflower meadows for insects and birds or fence off watercourses to stop manure polluting them. Everyone benefits from birdsong and better water quality in rivers.\n\nCrucially, as viewers of the fourth series of Amazon Prime’s Clarkson’s Farm will understand, this money is guaranteed. Much of a farmer’s income is at the mercy of the weather, but such income is not.\n\nSo by cutting off this money supply, life becomes a great deal less certain and the foreclosure of many more farms will surely follow. As the Conservative environment spokesman Victoria Atkins puts it: ‘Labour’s lack of understanding about our rural communities is putting our nation’s food security at risk.’\n\nThe Government can’t say it hasn’t been warned. Donald Trump’s agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins clearly grasped something that Reeves and her Cabinet colleagues do not when she was in the UK last month. She said: ‘You cannot have true national security without food security. My suggestion is putting your farmers first and ensuring they are the backbone of your country.’\n\nRollins added: ‘Anywhere you’re increasing the cost of taxes, increasing the cost of the land, you’re going to start closing your farms.’\n\nSpeaking after the White House had negotiated greater access to the UK market for its cattle farmers as part of the UK-US trade deal, Rollins recognised that British farmers are working within an extremely unfair system.\n\nSpiralling taxes, sky-high energy costs and the weight of red tape are crippling us. And the longer this goes on, the greater the risk of food shortages, which in turn will undermine national security to a desperate degree. We saw during the pandemic, and at the start of the Ukraine war, that Britain is vulnerable to shortages if imports of fruit, vegetables and other staples are cut off.\n\nToday, when the world is more unstable than at any time since the Second World War, it is crucial that we maintain our farms and the chain of domestic food production.\n\nIn recent days, the Labour Government has signalled that it is open to lifting the two-child benefit cap, and allowing more pensioners to receive the winter fuel allowance that the party scrapped last autumn for all but the poorest.\n\nMy point is that if U-turns are being countenanced in Downing Street, then a priority for Reeves must be to reconsider the inheritance tax burden on family farms, a burden that will have greater long-term implications for the country.\n\nBy restricting Agricultural Property Relief from April 2026, meaning most family farms will no longer be exempt from death duties, Reeves has left farmers like me scrambling to find a way to protect our businesses for our children – and finding it very difficult. My dairy farm in Dumfries and Galloway, on the Solway Firth, has been in our family since 1852.\n\nBut I’m 60 years old and, if my son inherits a tax bill equivalent to 20 per cent of the property’s total capital value when I die, he might have no choice other than to sell up. Almost two centuries of custodianship and knowledge will be obliterated at a stroke.\n\nIf he does manage to meet the cost, his own children will one day face the same crushing tax. Every generation will have this shadow looming over them. All we can do to fend off the worst is take out gargantuan life insurance policies to help pay the tax bill when we turn up our toes. That is a huge added expense, and it also comes at a time when electricity and other inputs are more oppressive than ever before.\n\nReeves evidently doesn’t care if our family farm dies with me. Perhaps she looks at figures that put the output of British farms at just 0.58 per cent of GDP and feels this isn’t worth protecting.\n\nBut farms like ours are the source of raw goods for Britain’s biggest manufacturing industry, the £148 billion food processing sector. I know that my dairy farm is as efficient as any in the world because it has economies of scale, using modern techniques and machinery. My business has about 1,000 head of cattle on our 1,200 acres, including 700 dairy cows.\n\nSeven people are employed here. But dozens more rely on my farm and neighbouring properties: tanker drivers who collect the milk, hauliers who bring feed and equipment, vets, motor mechanics, builders, hedge-layers and dry stone-wallers, drainage contractors, salesmen and many more.\n\nThey are losing work now because we are having to spend money instead on lawyers and life insurance and tax.\n\nAnd then there are the people I never see: the factory workers who process our milk into cheese, the abattoir workers and butchers. My business touches countless thousands of other people’s livelihoods. But taxes and bureaucracy are preventing us from investing in our farms. And without investment in them, we have no chance of competing with the rest of the world. The National Insurance hike for employees at the last Budget has also forced us to save on wages wherever possible by cutting workers’ hours, something no one wants.\n\nAnd this week it has emerged that the Chancellor’s inheritance tax raid on farms in the Budget will, in fact, cost the Treasury almost £2 billion. According to consultants CBI Economics, the changes to Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief will do more harm in stagnating growth than the £1.8 billion Whitehall claims the levy will raise.\n\nIt needn’t be this way.\n\nNew Zealand helps its farmers by not imposing too many regulations. For instance, there’s no inheritance tax on their farms, and this has helped them compete on the world stage without any subsidies at all.\n\nThe Irish government, too, has treated its agriculture as a strategic industry and invested in its dairy processing capabilities and helped farmers to develop globally competitive grass-fed dairy products. Kerrygold butter is the best-selling premium brand in the US as a result.\n\nBritish farmers want to flourish, we want to feed the nation – but we need the Government to recognise our importance to Britain’s food security. Because, right now, Labour has little idea of the chaos they are storing up for the future. \n\nJamie Blackett is the author of Red Rag To A Bull: Rural Life In An Urban Age (Quiller)\n\nFor confidential support, call Samaritans on 116 123 or visit www.samaritans.org","summary":"The day before Rachel Reeves delivered her Budget, 78-year-old farmer John Charlesworth killed himself.

rescinded regulations include those regarding prospecting for mineral resources, mining claims, oil shale placer claims, and geothermal leases and drilling, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday in a news release.\n\nOther rescinded regulations include those for public lands hearings, annual fees for oil placer mining claims, surface management plans for mining, and hardrock mineral processing and milling.\n\n\"This effort embodies our dedication to removing bureaucratic red tape that hinders American innovation and energy production,\" Burgum said.\n\n\"By rescinding these outdated regulations, we are not only reducing costs and streamlining processes but also reinforcing our commitment to energy independence and national prosperity.\"\n\nBurgum said that commitment won't stop the Interior Department from \"maintaining the highest standards of environmental stewardship.\"\n\nAt least one environmental group disagrees.\n\nRemoving the regulations also removes federal oversight of geothermal energy projects and mineral mining on public lands and in federally managed wilderness areas, officials with the Sierra Club said on Tuesday in a news release.\n\nThe changes were made without any public input, the Sierra Club said.\n\n\"Cutting the public out of a major policy change is a sign the policy isn't good for the public,\" said Athan Manuel, director of

will be software-defined, so of course, AI engineers, great software skills, data engineers will be super important to us,\" said the CEO, who was elected president of the Aerospace, Security and

platforms.\"We need excellent, skillful production people as well. Finding welders to do submarine work is not an easy thing, so it's a mix of jobs,\" he said.But he added that Saab and the larger industry are moving toward a live service business model that emphasizes software in weapons systems that can be incrementally updated and connected with other platforms.Part of that industry push comes from observing the war in Ukraine, where both sides are developing new techniques in drone jamming and countermeasures in a matter of weeks.\"The technology will grow so quickly, so you cannot buy a sort of, 50,000 drones and put them in stock. You want to have almost like drones as a service,\" Johansson said.Saab, the Nordics' biggest defense manufacturer, has enjoyed an industry-wide boom since the start of the Ukraine war. The Swedish firm reported 2024 annual sales of 63.75 billion Swedish krona, or about $6.6 billion. By comparison, annual revenue in 2021 was 39.15 billion krona.Amid the uncertainty of Washington's long-term role in NATO, the firm's share price has surged by more than 120% since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January to 484.30 krona, as of Monday afternoon.Johansson said Saab has been investing heavily to meet demand and has grown its workforce from 19,000 to 25,000 in the last two years.\"We've had more than 200,000 applicants last year for the company and 74,000 for this first quarter,\" he said.The CEO had said in February that he expected the Stockholm-based firm to hire 1,000 more people in Sweden this year.

And it comes during Pride Month — the same timing as the Pentagon’s campaign to force transgender troops out of the US military.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth is “committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief’s priorities, our nation’s history, and the warrior ethos.”\n\nPhelan’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the decision, which was first reported by Military.com.\n\nThe USNS Harvey Milk was named in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who said at the time that the John Lewis-class of oilers would be named after leaders who fought for civil and human rights.\n\nMilk, who was portrayed by Sean Penn in an Oscar-winning 2008 movie, served for four years in the Navy before he was forced out for being gay. \n\nHe later became one of the first openly gay candidates elected to public office.\n\nMilk served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and had sponsored a bill banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodations, housing and employment. It passed, and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone signed it into law.\n\nOn Nov. 27, 1978, Milk and Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, a disgruntled former city supervisor who cast the sole vote against Milk’s bill.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat representing San Francisco, said in a statement Tuesday that “this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior’ ethos. \n\n“Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom also slammed the move, saying Milk was a Korean War combat veteran whose commander called him “outstanding.”\n\n“Stripping his name from a Navy ship won’t erase his legacy as an American icon, but it does reveal Trump’s contempt for the very values our veterans fight to protect,” the Democrat wrote on X.\n\nThe ship was christened in 2021, and during the ceremony, then-Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said he wanted to be at the event “not just to amend the wrongs of the past, but to give inspiration to all of our LGBTQ community leaders who served in the Navy, in uniform today and in the civilian workforce as well, too, and to tell them that we’re committed to them in the future.”\n\nThe ship is operated by Military Sealift Command, with a crew of about 125 civilian mariners. \n\nThe Navy says it conducted its first resupply mission at sea in fall 2024, while operating in the Virginia Capes. \n\nIt continued to resupply Navy ships at sea off the East Coast until it began scheduled maintenance at Alabama Shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, earlier this year.\n\nWhile the renaming is rare, the Biden administration also changed the names of two Navy ships in 2023 as part of the effort to remove Confederate names from U.S. military installations.\n\nThe USS Chancellorsville — named for the Civil War battle — was renamed the USS Robert Smalls after a sailor and former enslaved person. \n\nAnd the USNS Maury, an oceanographic survey ship originally named after a Confederate sailor, was renamed the USNS Marie Tharp after a geologist and oceanographic cartographer who created the first scientific maps of the Atlantic Ocean floor.\n\nMaritime lore hints as to why renaming ships is so unusual, suggesting that changing a name is bad luck and tempts retribution from the sea gods.","summary":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a highly rare move that will strip the ship of the moniker of a slain gay rights activist who

50%","text":"US President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%.\n\nThe move hikes import taxes on the metals – key inputs in everything from cars to canned food – for the second time since March.\n\nTrump has said the measures, which come into effect on Wednesday, are intended to secure the future of the American steel industry.\n\nHowever, critics say the protections could wreak havoc on steel producers outside the US, spark retaliation from trade partners, and come at a punishing cost for American users of the metals.\n\nHours before he hiked the duties, many firms directly affected could scarcely believe the plan was moving forward, hoping it would turn out to be temporary or some kind of negotiating ploy.\n\nEven as Trump moved forward with the deal, the UK was granted a carve-out from the measures, leaving duties on its steel and aluminium at 25%, a move Trump said reflected its ongoing trade discussions with the US.\n\n“Always the question with Mr Trump is, is this a tactic or is this a long-term plan?” said Rick Huether, chief executive of Independent Can Co, a Maryland-based business which brings in steel from Europe and turns it into decorative cookie tins, popcorn boxes, and other products.\n\nHe said he had put investments on hold and feared the abrupt changes and price increases would lead his customers to turn to alternatives such as plastic or paper boxes.\n\n“There’s a lot of chaos,” he said.\n\nThe US is the biggest importer of steel in the world, after the European Union, getting most of the metal from Canada, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, according to the US government.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing a law that gives him the authority to protect industries considered vital to national security.\n\nBut many imports ultimately escaped the duties after the US struck trade deals with allies and granted exemptions to certain imports at the request of firms.\n\nTrump ended those carve-outs in March, saying he was unhappy with the way the protections had been weakened.\n\nAt Friday’s rally at the US Steel factory, he said he wanted to make tariffs so high that US businesses would have no alternative but to buy from American suppliers.\n\n“Nobody’s going to get around that,” he said of the 50% rate. “That means that nobody’s going to be able to steal your industry. It’s at 25% – they can get over that fence. At 50%, they can no longer get over the fence.”\n\nReaction in the UK and Europe\n\nAs of May, imports and the rate of raw steel production in the US had changed little since last year before Trump raised tariffs, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.\n\nBut steel imports fell 17% in April, compared to March. And businesses selling the metals into the US said they expected Trump’s latest announcement to lead to an even more dramatic drop.\n\nTrump’s moves in March had already prompted Canada and the European Union to prepare to hit back with tariffs on their own American products.\n\nOn Tuesday, Olof Gill, spokesperson for economic security and trade for the European Commission, told the BBC the two sides were engaged in intense talks to try to make progress toward an agreement.\n\n“We’re negotiating hard to try and make good deals,” he said.\n\n“We really hope that the Americans will roll back on this latest tariff threat, as they have done on others, but that remains to be seen.”\n\nIn the UK, Trump’s announcement put new pressure on the government to pin down the trade deal in the works with the US, which had been expected to provide some protection from the March metals tariffs.\n\nTrade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Paris on Wednesday.\n\nHis office said it was “pleased” that the trade talks had protected UK steel from the latest duties.\n\n“We will continue to work with the US to implement our agreement, which will see the 25% US tariffs on steel removed,” he said.\n\nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, which represents steelmakers, told the BBC that his members had already seen orders cancelled and delayed as a result of the 25% tariffs put in place in March.\n\nHe warned that a 50% tariff would be “catastrophic” for UK exports to the US, about 7% of overall exports.\n\n“The introduction of 50% tariffs immediately puts the shutters up,” he said. “Most of our orders, if not all of them, will now be cancelled.”\n\nEconomists said the US economy is also facing damage, as prices rise as a result of the new measures.\n\nA 2020 analysis estimated that Trump’s first term tariffs created roughly 1,000 jobs in the steel industry, but cost the economy 75,000 jobs in other sectors, such as manufacturing and construction.\n\nErica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said that she expected to see even more extreme job losses this time.\n\n“Some of the strongest evidence is against tariffs on intermediate inputs like steel and aluminium, finding they are much more harmful because they increase the cost of production in the United States,” she said. “It’s just very foolish to double down on this type of tariff in particular.”\n\nChad Bartusek is director of supply chain management at Drill Rod & Tool Steels, a small, family-owned manufacturing business in Illinois, which brings in about 800,000 pounds of Austrian-made steel each year, at specifications he says are not produced in the US.\n\nMr Bartusek said he was currently waiting on three containers worth of steel rod, which would have entered the US without duties at the start of the year.\n\nAs of last week, he had expected to pay tariff costs about $72,000. Instead, he is looking at a tariff bill of almost $145,000.\n\n“I woke up Saturday morning, looked at the news and my jaw dropped,” he said of Trump’s announcement.\n\nMr Bartusek said business had been steady until a few weeks ago.\n\nBut his firm raised prices earlier this year by 8% to 14% to help cover the new cost of the tariffs. Now customers have been ordering more cautiously and he has had to cut back hours for workers.\n\n“It’s one punch after the other,” he said. “Hopefully, this settles down quickly.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%.

Many Egyptian drilling companies have since adopted the technique.\nThe drilling project is part of China’s efforts in recent years to export agricultural technology to emerging markets, especially in the Middle East, as it seeks to expand cooperation through technical know-how.\nAnalysts said the partnership reflects a strategic alignment. As Chinese companies pursue more overseas opportunities in response to domestic economic pressures, Middle Eastern countries increasingly look to Chinese expertise to address their own development challenges.\nIn mid-May, when US President Donald Trump kicked off his investment-focused visit to the Middle East in Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom’s agricultural officials were signing deals with Chinese companies in Beijing – ultimately securing 57 agreements worth 26.9 billion yuan (US$ 3.7 billion).\nThe deals spanned a range of projects in the environmental, water, agricultural, fisheries and livestock sectors. Key initiatives include knowledge exchanges on water recycling, the development of human capacity-building programmes, the establishment of seaweed cultivation stations and the production of biofuels and biofertilisers, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\nIn May, Shouguang, an eastern Chinese city renowned for its vegetable production, signed a deal with the UAE agritech firm Silal to co-invest 120 million dirhams (US$32.6 million) in a 100,000-square-metre smart agriculture centre, featuring customised greenhouses for desert farming.\n\nIn Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, Chinese technology is driving a massive desalination project set to go live next year, converting 1.5 million tonnes of seawater a day into 600,000 tonnes of freshwater for farms and households.\nShandong Electric Power Construction Third Company, the plant’s builder, has drawn upon its desalination expertise to cut energy use to just 2.773 kWh per tonne – among the industry’s lowest, according to the state-run People’s Daily.\nChina’s push for more agricultural technology exports has also drawn international attention. In May, Brazil’s Fórum magazine reported on the irrigation system built in Egypt.\nAlfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to The China Centre at the US-based research group The Conference Board, said the Middle East has emerged as a focal point for Chinese overseas investments as the region seeks to reduce oil dependency and address challenges such as climate change and water scarcity.\n“Against this backdrop, China’s proven track record in industrial and infrastructure development, along with its innovative technological advancements and comprehensive development expertise, makes it an appealing partner for Middle Eastern nations seeking to mitigate their vulnerabilities,” Montufar-Helu said.\nAs China faces domestic economic challenges, the region also offers attractive growth opportunities for both construction firms and providers of green technologies.\n“These investments serve as a platform for China to extend its international influence by promoting its standards and practices,” Montufar-Helu said.\n“Geopolitically, this engagement strengthens China’s relationships within the Middle East and enhances its overall presence in this strategically important area of the world.”","summary":"Near the edge of the Sahara Desert, in Egypt’s West Minya, Chinese drillers bore deep into the earth, tapping groundwater to irrigate a once 500-hectare stretch of desert – now home to the world’s largest beet sugar factory.\nChina’s Zhongman Petroleum has drilled 193 wells over the past three years to irrigate the farm, which supplies Canal Sugar – a joint venture backed by investors from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt – with an annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes, according to the state-run...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3312892/chinas-agritech-brings-water-egypts-giant-beet-sugar-factory-sahara-desert","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/03/e6387c10-f92e-41c4-b647-a31ff0d0d8a8_7d8038fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 00:06:12","author":"Alice Li","authors":["Alice Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.076},{"id":327836778,"title":"World News | US President Remains Positive About Progress...: White House on Russia-Ukraine War","text":"Washington, DC [US], June 4 (ANI): US President Donald Trump remains optimistic about the progress being seen amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and urged his counterparts from Russia and Ukraine to talk directly with one another, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday (local time).\nWhile addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), Leavitt noted that Russia handed over a peace plan to the Ukrainian side and the two nations agreed on the exchange of prisoners from each other's nations.

The two nations agreed to swap dead and captured soldiers, The Washington Post reported. However, there was no significant progress towards ending the war or even agreeing to a ceasefire.\nUkrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian delegation, stated that Russia did not agree to an unconditional ceasefire or a bilateral meeting between the leaders of the two nations. However, both nations agreed to exchange gravely wounded prisoners of war, captives under the age of 25, and the bodies of 6,000 killed soldiers from each side.\nUmerov also said that Ukraine had proposed holding another round of talks at the end of June. On Monday, a Ukrainian presidential official said that \"a certain format\" on a presidential level is being discussed, including a meeting between leaders of the US, Russia, Ukraine and Turkiye. He said, \"This is crucial for making progress in the negotiation process. We've been telling Russia for a very long time this war must end, and the whole world supports us in that.\" He stated, \"If Russia is serious about ending the war, it will move forward on this. If not, international sanctions must follow.\"\nUmerov demanded the return of Ukrainian children taken by Russian forces from occupied territories in Ukraine's east, The Washington Post reported. That point seems to have added tension to the talks between Russia and Ukraine, as the head of the Russian delegation, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, accused Ukraine of \"putting on a show aimed at compassionate Europeans\" in post-meeting remarks.\nRussia has repeatedly denied that the country forcibly took children from occupied Ukrainian territories, The Washington Post reported. Following the first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine in May, the two nations agreed to exchange memorandums mentioning their respective conditions for ending the conflict. Ukraine presented its proposal before the meeting in Istanbul, while Russia presented its proposal during the talks. Furthermore, on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, about ending the Ukraine conflict, as both sides prepare for fresh negotiations in Istanbul.\nThe diplomatic contact between Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov came as Ukraine and Russia conducted some of the largest drone attacks since the war began nearly three years ago.\nUkraine carried out a significant drone attack on Sunday targeting deep inside Russian territory, destroying dozens of nuclear-capable bombers and other military aircraft.

The decision followed criticism from conservative voices in Florida and beyond concerning Ono's record on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and campus protests during his time in Ann Arbor.Initial support reversed by Board over DEI and protest responseOno had previously received unanimous backing from the University of Florida Board of Trustees, including an offer for a five-year contract worth up to $15 million. However, the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state’s 12 public universities, reversed course. Critics cited concerns about Ono’s past support of DEI initiatives and his handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the University of Michigan.Also read: Education secretary Linda McMahon urges universities to align with Trump administration for federal fundingThe criticism intensified as Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott publicly opposed the nomination. In a June 2 post on X, Scott said Ono allowed what he described as an illegal, pro-terrorist encampment to remain on the U-M campus for nearly a month. He added that Ono’s DEI-related policies were divisive and prioritized activism over student safety and educational quality.University of Michigan DEI cuts, federal scrutiny preceded rejectionIn March, Ono announced the closure of U-M's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The redirected funds were planned for the Go Blue Guarantee, a tuition support initiative for in-state students meeting income eligibility. The move was seen as an attempt to align with changing political pressures under President Donald Trump’s administration.Ono also faced scrutiny from the US Department of Education earlier this year. In February, the administration warned universities against using race as a factor in admissions. By March, 60 universities, including U-M, were under review for what federal officials called inadequate responses to antisemitism. U-M’s removal of a protest encampment in the Diag led to lawsuits and national debate over campus protest policies.Also read: US: Pause on student visa interviews faces criticism from LinkedIn co-founderOno resigned from the University of Michigan in May after being named the sole finalist for the Florida job.

With education policy becoming increasingly polarized, decisions over university leadership are increasingly shaped by issues such as DEI programs, campus free speech, and federal compliance related to civil rights and antisemitism.Ono’s rejection follows a broader trend in higher education, particularly in states where political leaders have taken strong stances against DEI frameworks.

The complaints are wide-ranging, but his fixation on Barrett has intensified, fueled by right-wing allies saying that she’s “weak” and has drifted from the hardline persona she projected during her confirmation.\n\nTrump has also groused about Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, who were also confirmed during his first term. But Barrett’s perceived disloyalty hits differently. In Trumpworld, deviation is betrayal.\n\nThe discontent follows a string of rulings where Barrett didn’t deliver for the far right. In March, she and Chief Justice John Roberts voted to reject Trump’s demand to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid. The blowback from MAGA loyalists was instant, with some calling her a “DEI hire” and “evil.”\n\nBarrett and Roberts also sided with the court’s liberals in January in a decision that allowed Trump to be sentenced in his New York hush money case. Trump initially downplayed the outcome as a “fair decision,” but it added to the perception that his appointees are no longer reliable.\n\nThe fury grew louder when Barrett recused herself from a high-stakes case regarding whether a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma could receive public funding because she had ties to the school’s legal team. Without her vote, the court was split 4-4, leaving in place a state ruling that found the school unconstitutional.\n\nTrump and his allies are now reportedly claiming that Barrett might be acting out of fear. Her sister was targeted with a bomb threat in South Carolina earlier this year, and the broader climate for judges who defy Trump has grown increasingly hostile. \n\nAccording to CNN, Trump has even asked advisers whether increased security would make Barrett feel “more comfortable”—not out of concern for her safety, but in the hopes that she’ll return to form.\n\nPublicly, Trump is pretending that everything’s fine. \n\n“President Trump will always stand with the U.S. Supreme Court,” deputy press secretary Harrison Fields told CNN, claiming that Trump “may disagree with the Court and some of its rulings” but still “respects its foundational role.” \n\nBut that statement does not reflect reality.\n\nBarrett was Trump’s final Supreme Court nominee in 2020, but her rise began years earlier when she became a favorite of religious conservatives during her confirmation to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. She’s certainly not perfect, but the fact that voting against Trump has gotten her in his bad graces is saying something.\n\nThis isn’t just about Barrett, though. Trump has been escalating his broader war on judges and the legal system, blasting rulings that don’t serve him and turning on the very conservatives who helped build his judicial empire. \n\nAfter a federal appeals court ruled against one of his tariff schemes, Trump lashed out at Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, calling him a “sleazebag” and “a bad person, who in his own way, probably hates America.”\n\nFor now, at least, Trump has avoided going after Barrett directly. \n\n“He does truly respect the Supreme Court, so he doesn’t want to torch any of his appointees,” a senior White House official said. “He’s called on them as a group to rein in the lower courts and do the right thing, but has intentionally not attacked any of the justices by name.”\n\nEven with a few defections, Barrett is still a reliable vote for the right. She didn’t dissent in cases backing Trump’s transgender military ban, ending protections for Venezuelan immigrants, or slashing education and oversight funding. And she voted with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in more than 80% of last term’s cases.\n\nOf course, in Trumpland, loyalty is absolute—anything less will make you a target.","summary":"President Donald Trump is reportedly livid that some of his hand-picked Supreme Court justices aren’t falling in line—especially Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has emerged as a recurring target of his behind-the-scenes rage.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump’s private grumbling about Barrett has dragged on for nearly a year.

The Department of the Interior announced a proposal Monday to rescind President Joe Biden's restrictions on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said a Biden-era 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule that restricted energy development for more than half of the 23 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope ignored the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. \"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR), created by Congress over a century ago to secure America’s energy supply, supports responsible oil development on 13 million acres,\" Frank Lasee, president of Truth in Energy and Climate, said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN 13 MILLION ALASKA ACRES TO MINING, DRILLING \"President Biden’s drilling ban in Alaska undermined energy security, increasing reliance on foreign oil, raising gasoline prices and fueling inflation through higher transportation costs,\" Lasee added. \"Resuming drilling puts economic growth and energy independence ahead of climate ideology in a place almost no regular American will ever visit.\" TRUMP ENERGY DEPARTMENT CANCELS $3.7 BILLION IN BIDEN-ERA GREEN ENERGY GRANTS Consistent with Trump's executive orders, the proposed revision reverts to regulations that were in place prior to May 7, 2024, which Lasee called a \"commendable\" prioritization of \"American energy needs and economic well-being while adhering to the law.\" \"President Biden never should have halted congressionally sanctioned oil drilling in Alaska,\" said Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute. \"Trump is to be applauded, both for putting Americans' energy needs and our economic well-being first and for following the law by opening these areas back up for production.\" According to the Department of Interior, the 2024 rule provisions lacked \"a basis in the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act\" and undermined the BLM's congressional obligation to oversee timely leasing in the region. \"President Trump’s move to restore drilling in Alaska’s Arctic region is a bold and necessary step toward reclaiming American energy independence,\" Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said. Trump vowed to unleash American energy on the campaign trail in 2024 and signed executive orders on the first day of his second term to rescind Biden-era climate policies. \"By reversing Biden’s disastrous restrictions on 13 million acres, Trump is unleashing the abundant resources that power our economy, lower energy costs and strengthen national security. This is a victory for American workers, consumers and allies who rely on stable, affordable energy,\" Isaac added. Steve Milloy, senior policy fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, called the announcement \"more good news from the Trump administration in rolling back more of Biden’s war on fossil fuels.\" \"Promises made. Promises kept. But the Trump administration will need to go further to give investors confidence that the Alaska leases will actually be viable. Radical climate activists will resort to the courts and scare off investors. There likely needs to be a legislative solution to that,\" Milloy added. Trump and his Republican allies are seeking to roll back some of Biden's green energy initiatives through budget reconciliation on Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"The National Petroleum Reserve (NPR) was created more than 100 years ago specifically to provide a supply of oil for America’s energy security. That energy security can be achieved by responsibly developing our oil reserves, including in the Gulf of America, our vast shale oil deposits in America’s heartland and, now, thankfully, the 13 million acres of the NPR that are going to be developed,\" said Gregory Whitestone, CO2 Coalition executive director.

Attorneys for the family say any interruption in her medical care, even for a brief period of time, will be fatal.\n\n“The doctors at (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) have said that if the child’s treatment is interrupted, she will die within days,” attorney Gina Amato Lough said last week as the family pleaded for assistance to remain in the country. “It’s not speculative. Their language is not that she could die within days. It’s that she will die within days.”\n\nThe girl’s family was given temporary permission to enter the United States in 2023 — during the Biden Administration — on humanitarian grounds so Sofia could receive critical medical care.\n\nAccording to attorneys at Public Counsel, the Trump Administration in April revoked the family’s humanitarian admission to the country and ordered them to self-deport. Following through on policies Donald Trump expressed during his campaign, his administration has been engaged in a nationwide crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally, demanding they register online and leave the country voluntarily — potentially allowing them to return through legal channels — or face deportation with no hope of returning.\n\nOn Tuesday, the family received a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services advising them that they had been granted humanitarian parole “for a period of one year.”\n\nAccording to attorneys, Sofia was born one month premature and underwent multiple surgeries as an infant, but she was left with short bowels and plagued by repeated infections.

It was the third such incident in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians who were moving towards them.\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.\n\n“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces.\n\n“The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.\n\nA spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.\n\nThe incident ocurred as the same site where on Sunday more than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while they were heading to the distribution hub.\n\nThe United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime.\n\n“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”\n\nWitnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub.\n\nFadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site.\n\n‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’\n\n‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi.\n\nIsrael imposed a blockade on all supplies in March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza have said there was no evidence of any widespread diversion of aid at any stage of the conflict. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.\n\nThe GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.\n\nOn Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed the new head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, was appointed the new head of the GHF after Jake Wood, a former marine, resigned, saying that he could not guarantee the GHF’s independence from Israeli interests.\n\nMoore has been a vocal defender of the GHF who has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN chief, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza was “a lie … spread by terrorists”.\n\nWith Reuters","summary":"An IDF spokesperson said roads to the distribution centres set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were ‘prohibited’ for Palestinians\n\nIsrael’s military has warned residents of Gaza against travel in areas leading to aid distribution centres, after at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for food at the points set up by the US-backed foundation.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson on Tuesday said roads leading to the distribution centres set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were considered “combat zones”.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/israel-warns-palestinians-against-travel-on-roads-to-gaza-aid-hubs-labelling-them-combat-zones","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24096041fdd714158f01d7e2888aab975714fc37/683_0_4285_3428/master/4285.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 23:53:03","author":"Guardian staff and agencies","authors":["Guardian staff and agencies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":327826424,"title":"China’s Aussie move in US trade war","text":"The US President triggered a trade war with Beijing by slapping meaty tariffs on Chinese goods. \n\nAn ensuing tit-for-tat escalation peaked with the US imposing 145 per cent levies on Chinese products and China imposing 125 per cent duties on American products.\n\nBoth sides have since backed down, with Washington agreeing to 30 per cent imposts on goods from China and Beijing agreeing to 10 per cent on US imports.\n\nBut the tariffs have still hiked American beef supply costs for restaurants in the Chinese capital, prompting them to look to tariff-free Australian beef.\n\nChinese state media reported on Tuesday that an American-themed restaurant in Beijing had made the switch because of “cost pressures and declining supply stability of US imports”.\n\nThe Global Times reported it spoke with a staff member at a “branch of a restaurant famous for its American-style barbecue in Beijing”.\n\nThe staff member said the restaurant “stopped serving imported beef from the US starting from about one month ago due to the impact of tariffs”, the Chinese government mouthpiece reported.\n\nThe Global Times did not name the chain, but US business news channel CNBC has also reported that restaurants in Beijing are changing to Australian beef, including one eatery’s “The Great American” burger.\n\nA beef supplier told the network that American “beef is fattier and tastier” but the “high price is just too much to bear”.\n\nAustralian beef is exported to China without any duties under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThe Albanese government last year also cleared trade barriers for $20bn in Australian goods headed for Chinese ports, including lobsters.\n\nChinese supermarket shelves say it all\n\nAustralian beef has been replacing US products on the shelves in Chinese supermarkets as the two economic superpowers continue their trade war.\n\nBeijing and Washington in recent days accused each other of violating a truce in the tit-for-tat tariff regime sparked by Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement in April.\n\nNow a video posted to X has shown how trade tensions have changed things on the ground in China, where American beef stocks have virtually disappeared.\n\nIn the video, a local speaking in English shows a shelf stocked full of Australian beef where US products used to be found.\n\n“I guess I’m having Australian beef for dinner tonight,” she said. “Instead of American beef.\n\n“And honestly because of the food quality, I probably trust Australian beef better.\n\n“And this box of beef right here is 50 RMB which is about $7 USD (AU$10.82).\n\n“So to answer the question, China ain’t hurting.

Coomer, who filed the suit in April 2022, is seeking damages from Lindell for the physical and emotional distress that attorneys say resulted from Lindell’s false claims.\n\nDominion has filed its own string of lawsuits to combat unproven allegations that it was involved in rigging the 2020 election against President Donald Trump. The company settled one lawsuit with Fox News for nearly $800 million.\n\nIn addition to Dominion, election deniers targeted Coomer after Colorado-based podcaster Joe Oltmann publicly identified “Eric, the Dominion guy.” Lindell, Coomer contends, regurgitated and elevated Oltmann’s claims to a wider audience.\n\n“This is more than a mere insult to (Coomer),” Charlie Cain, one of Coomer’s attorneys, said in court Tuesday. “This was about severe distress and fearing for his life for the last four years.”\n\nCain said Lindell’s claims were “extreme and outrageous.” He displayed a threatening text message Coomer received, and he said Coomer needed therapy and medication to deal with the stress.\n\nCain argued that Lindell was upset at Coomer in part because Newsmax, a conservative TV channel, had stopped allowing Lindell on air after the channel settled a separate lawsuit with Coomer in April 2021.\n\nShortly after, Lindell accused Coomer of treason and said he should turn himself in to authorities.\n\nLindell’s attorneys, meanwhile, argued to the jury Tuesday that Lindell made the claims against Coomer because he believed them — and because Lindell had been intentionally baited by Coomer.\n\nAttorney Chris Kachouroff said Lindell, “rightly or wrongly,” was upset about not being allowed on Newsmax anymore. After Lindell publicly attacked Coomer in the wake of the Newsmax settlement, Kachouroff said, Coomer attempted to “bait” Lindell into defaming him by serving him with a lawsuit shortly before Lindell spoke at a rally at the Colorado state Capitol. That prompted Lindell to take the mic and say that Coomer would soon be behind bars.\n\nLindell made several other comments about Coomer in the subsequent days, Kachouroff acknowledged, but only because Coomer “triggered” Lindell by having him served with a lawsuit so publicly. He said that was Coomer’s goal, and Kachouroff quoted an email and text from Coomer about wanting to sue Lindell.\n\nMore fundamentally, Kachouroff said, Lindell believed the debunked claims he made about the 2020 election.\n\n“Evidence will show that Mike believed he was telling the truth, that he believed they were truthful at the time he made them, and the First Amendment protects him,” Kachouroff said.\n\nHe argued that Coomer’s professional reputation had suffered because Coomer’s own anti-Trump Facebook posts came to light, not because of claims made by Lindell.\n\nThe trial is set to last through the end of next week. Coomer began testifying Tuesday morning, and he denied that his lawsuit was a “shakedown of Mike Lindell.”\n\nLindell, who sat with his team of attorneys a few feet from Coomer, is expected to testify in his own defense. MyPillow, the company he founded in 2009, is also a defendant, as is FrankSpeech, Lindell’s media company.\n\nOltmann, whom Cain accused of fabricating his own research on Coomer, is not a defendant.

The boy's beating in 2023 at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall was captured on surveillance video that also showed several officials standing idly by and some of them shaking hands with the participants in the beating.

A state grand jury in March charged 30 correctional officers for their role in allowing and sometimes encouraging nearly 70 fights to take place between July and December 2023. The officers face charges including child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery. More than 140 victims between the ages of 12 and 18 were involved, according to authorities.

Attorney General Rob Bonta said after the charges were announced that it seemed the attacks were planned. \"They often wanted them to happen at the beginning of the day, in a certain time, in a certain place. A space and a time was created for the fights, and the plan was for the fights to happen,\" he said. The investigation began after the Los Angeles Times first obtained and published video footage that shows a then-16-year-old being attacked by at least six other young people, who came at him one by one as officers stand by watching. The video was first made public during a court hearing during which a public defender for the boy, now 17, argued to a judge that he was not safe at Los Padrinos and should be released ahead of his trial. His attorney, Jamal Tooson, said the settlement was a \"first step\" in recognising the \"egregious\" conduct of the LA County Probation Department. \"Our priority needs to be not just protecting my client but all children in similar circumstances under the care and watch of the probation department,\" Tooson said. \"There were lawsuits prior to this. I personally represent several individuals who've been harmed at the same facility after this.\" According to a correction action plan written by the department, staff failed to review CCTV footage of the facility, delayed taking the teen to the hospital, and waited too long to notify his parents. To address these issues, the department will ensure CCTV monitors are \"staffed routinely\" and conduct random footage audits, and develop a protocol for making sure young people in custody are given medical care and their parents are informed appropriately. A judge ruled in April that the LA County Probation Department could not continue housing juveniles at Los Padrinos and approved a plan in May to move more than 100 youths out of the facility. California's state board overseeing local correctional facilities has previously ordered Los Padrinos to be shut down. Tooson believes there is a pervasive \"culture problem\" extending throughout the probation department's facilities that cannot be addressed by the correction action plan. He has filed at least 19 lawsuits in federal court alleging issues from physical violence allowed by officials to sexual assault by staff members in LA County's youth detention centres, he said. \"Until we actively start changing the mindset and behavior of those who are put into a caretaking responsibility of these youth, I think we're going to find ourselves in the same situation,\" he said.

The broadside, which Musk issued on his social media platform X, came just days after the president gave him a celebratory Oval Office farewell that marked the end of his work for the administration, where he spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency.

Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" The legislation, which has passed the House and is currently under debate in the Senate, would curtail subsidies that benefit Tesla, Musk's electric automaker.

The tech billionaire followed his criticism with a threat aimed at Republicans. \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\" he wrote in another X post. It's a sharp shift for Musk, the world's richest person, who spent at least $250 million supporting Trump's campaign last year. He previously pledged to help defeat Republican lawmakers deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump, but now he's suggesting voting them out if they advance the president's legislative priority. However, it's unclear how Musk will follow through on his criticism. He recently said he would spend \"a lot less\" on political campaigns, though he left the door open to political involvement \"if I see a reason.\" The tech titan's missives could cause headaches for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who face conflicting demands from Trump and their party's wealthiest benefactor. Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said \"it's not helpful\" to have Musk criticising the legislation, but he doesn't expect lawmakers to side with Musk over Trump. \"Senate Republicans are not going to let the tax cuts expire,\" Conant said. \"It just makes leadership's job that much harder to wrangle the holdouts.\" Trump can change the outcome in Republican primaries with his endorsements, but Musk doesn't wield that level of influence, Conant said. \"No matter what Elon Musk or anybody else says — and I don't want to diminish him because I don't think that's fair — it's still going to be second fiddle to President Trump,\" said Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Musk's business interests stand to take a hit if lawmakers approve Trump's bill, which would slash funding for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, the nation's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which has massive defence contracts. Last month, Musk said he was \"disappointed\" by the spending bill, a much milder criticism than the broadside he levelled Tuesday. The budget package seeks to extend tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones he campaigned on. It also includes a massive buildup of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security. To defray some of the lost tax revenue to the government and limit piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want to reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Musk's post threw another hurdle in front of Senate Majority Leader John Thune's already complex task to pass a bill in time for Trump to achieve his goal of signing it by July 4. The South Dakota Republican has few votes to spare in the GOP's slim 53-seat majority. Two of the Senate's most fiscally hawkish Republicans quickly backed Musk. \"We can and must do better,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on X. Utah Sen. Mike Lee said \"federal spending has become excessive,\" adding that it causes inflation and \"weaponises government.\" Still, Trump enjoys fierce loyalty among the GOP base, and in the end, his opinion may be the only one that matters. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt played down Musk's criticism. \"The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,\" Leavitt said, and Musk's post \"doesn't change the president's opinion.\" The tension in the GOP delighted Democrats, who found themselves in the unlikely position of siding with Musk. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts — with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home. \"We're in complete agreement,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said of Musk. The New York Democratic lawmaker stood alongside a poster-sized printout of Musk's post during a Capitol news conference. The last time Musk weighed in significantly on legislation, the scenario was far different. His power was ascendant after the election, with Trump joining him for a rocket test in Texas and appointing him to spearhead DOGE. During the transition period, Musk started whipping up opposition to legislation that would prevent a government shutdown, posting about it repeatedly on X. Trump soon weighed in, encouraging Republicans to back out of a bipartisan deal. Lawmakers eventually patched together a new agreement.

Her access to feminine undergarments hasn't been restored, according to the judge's ruling.\n\n'In Ms. Kingdom's case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,' Lamberth said.\n\nTrump's order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that 'males are not detained in women's prisons,' but Lamberth blocked prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men's facilities in February.\n\nThe judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new policies could do to transgender inmates.\n\n'The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs' access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,' Lamberth said.\n\nTrump signed several orders rolling back protections for transgender people, ruling that the two 'immutable sexes' are 'not changeable.'\n\nThe orders directed federal prisons along with shelters for migrants and rape victims to be segregated by sex. He also directed federal money to be no longer be used to fund 'transition services.'\n\nTransgender inmates were federally protected under the Barack Obama Administration, before Trump appealed the policy during his first term. \n\nObama's policy was later reenacted under the Joe Biden Administration and Trump once again appealing it.\n\nThe president also demanded officials use the term 'sex' rather than 'gender.' Federal agencies were urged to end funding to promote 'gender ideology' and protect against 'gender extremism.'\n\nDailyMail.com contacted the Justice Department for comment. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.\n\nTransgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, who represent the transgender inmates, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.","summary":"A judge ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to resume treatments for transgender inmates following Donald Trump's executive order banning funds from being spent on gender-affirming care.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14777619/judge-trump-trans-inmates-gender-affirming-medication.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/03/23/99014213-0-image-m-9_1748988842305.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/21/449894667859770881/1024x576_MP4_449894667859770881.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-03 23:35:50","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":327825708,"title":"Shashi Tharoor-led delegation arrives in US to convey India’s strong stance against terrorism","text":"Washington, June 4 (IANS) After concluding a successful visit to Brazil, an all-party Indian Parliamentary delegation led by Congress Member of Parliament, Shashi Tharoor, arrived in Washington, the US capital, for a two-day visit as part of its outreach through Operation Sindoor post Pahalgam attack, to put forth India’s strong and united stand against Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism.\n\nIndian Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, received the delegation at the airport on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Indian delegation, which arrived here late on Tuesday evening, would hold meetings till June 5 with several members of the US Congress and the Donald Trump administration, think-tanks, media and policymakers to brief them on Operation Sindoor and India’s zero tolerance policy against terrorism.\n\nTaking to social media platform X on Tuesday evening, the Indian Embassy in US said: “An all party delegation led by Shashi Tharoor arrives in Washington D.C. Over the next two days the delegation will be meeting members of the US Congress and administration, think tanks, media and policymakers to brief them on Operation Sindoor and India’s strong stand against terrorism.”\n\nApart from Tharoor, the nine-member delegation includes Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) MP Shambhavi Choudhary, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MP Sarfaraz Ahmad, Telugu Desam Party MP GM Harish Balayogi, Bharatiya Janata Party MPs — Shashank Mani Tripathi, Bhubaneswar Kalita, Tejasvi Surya, Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora and Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu.\n\nAfter successful visit to Guyana, Panama, Colombia and Brazil, the delegation’s visit to the US marks its final stop in India’s global diplomatic outreach campaign to highlight Operation Sindoor and reinforce its position against Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism.\n\n“Touchdown in Washington, DC. #OperationSindoor,” said Shiv Sena MP and one of the delegation members, Milind Deora, on X.\n\nInterestingly, the Indian delegation will see a face-off with a Pakistani delegation led by their former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, which will also be in the US at the same time. However, Shashi Tharoor has expressed confidence in pushing India’s message on terrorism across.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the delegation led by Congress MP Tharoor in Brazil had said that the upcoming visit to the US will be a crucial opportunity to counter misinformation and competing narratives surrounding Operation Sindoor.\n\nHis remarks came amid ongoing assertions by US President Donald Trump that his administration helped broker the ceasefire understanding between India and Pakistan — claims New Delhi firmly denies.\n\nAccording to Indian officials, it was Pakistan that reached out to India with a request to halt military action following the Pahalgam terror attack, not the other way around.\n\nTharoor underlined the importance of setting the record straight during the delegation’s final leg of international outreach in Washington.\n\nSpeaking to IANS on the sidelines of engagements in Brazil, Tharoor had said, “Washington is a particularly interesting case because it is a large country, a superpower with enormous influence in the world, and there are many crosscurrents of information, misinformation, and other narratives circulating. So, we have quite a lot of work to do there.”\n\nThe Congress MP had also said that several countries need to understand that dialogue is not possible with the nations that facilitate cross-border terrorism.\n\nEmphasising the importance of international solidarity against terrorism, Tharoor noted, “We’re looking for solidarity in our struggle against terrorism. What is very clear in these countries is that some of these issues they understand, some they don’t fully understand. And the natural instinct in many countries is to say — why not have a dialogue? But it’s very difficult to have a dialogue with people who are pointing a gun at your head, who are sending terrorists across your border. That becomes a problem.”\n\nHe stressed that dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism must precede any meaningful engagement.\n\n“The first thing should be for them to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism. And then we can see what kind of talking we can do. Stop giving safe haven to killers and murderers, and instead, arrest and prosecute them. We need a different story, but they have not been doing that in Pakistan,” Tharoor said.\n\n“For us, in these countries, understanding our position and leaving with a sense of solidarity was important — and that we have done,” he added.","summary":"Washington, June 4 (IANS) After concluding a successful visit to Brazil, an all-party Indian Parliamentary delegation led by Congress Member of Parliament, Shashi Tharoor, arrived in Washington, the US capital,&#8230; Continue reading Shashi Tharoor-led delegation arrives in US to convey India&#8217;s strong stance against terrorism\n\n\nThe post Shashi Tharoor-led delegation arrives in US to convey India’s strong stance against terrorism first appeared on Australia India News.","url":"https://indianews.com.au/shashi-tharoor-led-delegation-arrives-in-us-to-convey-indias-strong-stance-against-terrorism/","image":"https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202506043420506.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 23:34:17","author":"India News Newsdesk","authors":["India News Newsdesk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.2},{"id":327832880,"title":"Seriously ill girl ordered to leave US gets reprieve after warning she could die within days","text":"A seriously ill girl ordered to leave the US has been given a year's reprieve after warnings she could die within days if her treatment was stopped.\n\nFour-year-old Sofia, whose real name we are not using, is being treated at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nShe uses a backpack that feeds her nutrients she can't absorb naturally - and the cutting-edge treatment is only available in the US.\n\nSofia was born with short bowel syndrome, a debilitating life-threatening condition.\n\nShe and her mother, Deysi, entered the US legally in July 2023 and were granted humanitarian parole to access medical care for two years.\n\nIn April - three months into the Trump presidency - the family got a letter saying their humanitarian parole was being revoked and they had to return immediately to Mexico.\n\nLawyers for the family said doctors had warned she could die \"within days\" if her treatment was interrupted.\n\n\"We're sending them to die,\" lawyer Gina Amato Lough told Sky News last week.\n\n\"That's not justice and it doesn't make us any safer.

Trump’s aides say the funding cuts target programs that promote liberal ideologies.\n\nThe request, if it passes the House and Senate, would formally enshrine many of the spending cuts and freezes sought by DOGE. It comes at a time when Musk is extremely unhappy with the tax cut and spending plan making its way through Congress, calling it on Tuesday a “disgusting abomination” for increasing the federal deficit.\n\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought said more rescission packages and other efforts to cut spending could follow if the current effort succeeds.\n\n“We are certainly willing and able to send up additional packages if the congressional will is there,” Vought told reporters.\n\nHere’s what to know about the rescissions request:\n\nWill the rescissions make a dent in the national debt?\n\nThe request to Congress is unlikely to meaningfully change the troublesome increase in the U.S. national debt. Tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the government is on track to spend roughly $7 trillion this year, with the rescission request equaling just 0.1% of that total.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at Tuesday’s briefing that Vought — a “well-respected fiscal hawk,” she called him — would continue to cut spending, hinting that there could be additional efforts to return funds.\n\n“He has tools at his disposal to produce even more savings,” Leavitt said.\n\nVought said he can send up additional rescissions at the end of the fiscal year in September “and if Congress does not act on it, that funding expires.”\n\n“It’s one of the reasons why we are not putting all of our expectations in a typical rescissions process,” he added.\n\nWhat programs are targeted by the rescissions?\n\nA spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview some of the items that would lose funding, said that $8.3 billion was being cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. NPR and PBS would also lose federal funding, as would the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR.\n\nThe spokesperson listed specific programs that the Trump administration considered wasteful, including $750,000 to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela, $67,000 for feeding insect powder to children in Madagascar and $3 million for circumcision, vasectomies and condoms in Zambia.\n\nIs the rescissions package likely to get passed?\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., complimented the planned cuts and pledged to pass them.\n\n“This rescissions package reflects many of DOGE’s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,” Johnson said. “Congress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.”\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus, among the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers, said they would like to see additional rescission packages from the administration.\n\n“We will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,” the group said in a press release. “Passing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress’s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda.”\n\nSen. Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, gave the package a less optimistic greeting.\n\n“Despite this fast track, the Senate Appropriations Committee will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations,” the Maine lawmaker said in a statement.\n\nWhy does the administration need Congress’ approval?\n\nThe White House’s request to return appropriated funds is meant to comply with the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. That law created the process by which the president can formally disclose to Congress the appropriated money it intends to not spend. Congress generally has 45 days to review and approve the request, but Vought is arguing that the end of the fiscal year would enable the administration to bypass a vote.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said in a 2018 backgrounder that the Senate can pass rescission packages with a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a possible filibuster. Between 1974 and 2000, presidents requested $76 billion worth of rescissions and Congress approved $25 billion.\n\nBobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said in an emailed statement that the Trump administration was already “illegally impounding additional funds,” as withholding money has “always been illegal without explicit Congressional approval.”\n\nOn CNN on Sunday, Vought insisted that the Trump administration was complying with the law, but it simply had a different view of the law relative to some Democrats.\n\n“We’re not breaking the law,” Vought said. “Every part of the federal government, each branch, has to look at the Constitution themselves and uphold it, and there’s tension between the branches.”","summary":"Trump’s aides say the funding cuts target programs that promote liberal ideologies.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/03/trump-rescission/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_47712-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 23:32:39","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":327829734,"title":"Letters: Donald Trump’s cuts to research will set the U.S. back","text":"Trump’s research cuts\nwill set the U.S. back\n\nRe: “Silicon Valley’s future at stake in Trump attack” (Page A12, May 4).\n\nThe National Science Foundation finances much of the scientific research that takes place in the United States, and it is being hit hard with a more than 50% budget cut without an alternative plan. NSF sponsors much of the nation’s most basic research from which many applied scientific discoveries spring. Valuable research programs are being halted as the NSF pulls the plug per federal government instructions.\n\nThe damage done by these cuts will be irreversible. The U.S. will take a back seat and let countries like China take the global lead in newer areas like artificial intelligence, chip design and memory storage. China’s investment was close to matching the United States in 2023. With the cost being much less in China, the net impact is much greater.\n\nOur leaders in the House and Senate represent the people and must act and restore most of the cuts.\n\nJudge, sheriff overreach\nwith court protesters\n\nRe: “12 Stanford pro-Palestinian protesters are arraigned” (Page B3, June 2).\n\nThanks for the article. Repression is apparently not the sole province of Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nWhile judges can control behavior in their courts, no judge has the authority or the right to outlaw peaceful expression outside the building. And no sheriff has the authority to declare any peaceful rally or demonstration that isn’t blocking normal passage or commerce to be illegal. This behavior by the sheriff hints at what might happen if Trump abrogates public rights in the Bill of Rights, nationalizes police and tells them to imprison, deport or even disappear anyone whose words he doesn’t like.\n\nI am glad there were no new arrests, but declaring this protest illegal is itself illegal and scandalous.\n\nRepublicans can’t\nbreak spending habit\n\nIt was just a matter of time before the two big egos of Donald Trump and Elon Musk would part company.\n\nTrump gave Musk an Oval Office send-off, praising him for downsizing the federal government. Musk’s original estimate that his Department of Government Efficiency would save taxpayers $2 trillion has morphed into $150 billion by his own estimate. In a CBS interview, Musk was critical of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” saying it would add more to the deficit than what was saved by his DOGE spending cuts. If the tax bill that just passed the House and is now being debated in the Senate passes in its current form, it will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt, mostly to cut taxes on billionaires who donated to Trump.\n\nRepublicans only become fiscal conservatives when a Democrat is in the White House. When a Republican is president, they spend like drunken sailors.\n\nArthur Straus\nWalnut Creek\n\nTrump hatred is not\ngood for the country\n\nRe: “Trump has earned animosity aimed at him” (Page A6, May 27).\n\nWell, at least one letter writer finally admits to hating Donald Trump. While most Democrats hate Trump, most won’t admit their animosity. I disliked what Joe Biden did, allowing millions upon millions of immigrants to just walk into our country, the highest rate of inflation in decades, a deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, and the list goes on, but I don’t hate Biden.\n\nIn our home, we don’t use the word “hate.” Yes, many Democrats will continue to hate Trump, who has closed the border, is bringing inflation down, and is seeking to end wars and bring manufacturing back to the United States. But it is not a healthy attitude and certainly not good for our country.

A similar effort began in March to freeze the president’s latest plans of attack.\n\nStill, if the White House were to continue ramping up its aggressive crackdown efforts on local governments’ immigration policies, it is unclear how some of the Bay Area’s less populous cities would be able to handle the pressure.\n\n“Court challenges take time and money and resources,” said Amada Armenta, a UCLA sociologist who researches immigration and criminal justice. “Some localities may comply because they are afraid.”\n\nThe Bay Area cities called out included Alameda, Belmont, Berkeley, Concord, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Fremont, Martinez, Menlo Park, Newark, Oakland, Pacifica, Pleasanton, Richmond, San Francisco, San Jose, San Leandro, San Pablo and Union City.\n\nAlameda, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties also made the now-deleted list, which in total accused over 500 cities and counties across the country of being “sanctuary jurisdictions.” Locally, at least, the list’s accuracy is in question.\n\nBelmont, a city of roughly 28,000 people with an estimated 87% citizenship rate, per the 2020 U.S. Census, does not appear to have any policies that mention immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in multiple Bay Area cities responded to the “sanctuary” accusation by insisting no such laws exist there. But the actual policies held by those governments tell a different story.\n\nIn Concord, which has a very large migrant community, Mayor Carlyn Obringer told this news organization, “we are not a sanctuary city.”\n\nBut the working-class suburb has a policy of “inclusion” that is nearly identical to existing sanctuary law, which broadly prohibits local law enforcement from communicating with federal immigration authorities unless compelled to do so.\n\nThe only difference in Concord’s laws is a caveat that allows some information to be shared if it is “in the best interest of public safety.”\n\nPleasanton has a slightly wider list of exceptions that OKs notifying immigration authorities only if an arrested person is not a citizen and would not be booked in an Alameda County jail.\n\nEven with the narrow carve-out, Pleasanton still upholds most sanctuary-like policies, though officials there would only say they had “taken no formal action” to become one and directed any further media requests to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“I can see them having the instinct to disavow having a sanctuary policy out of fear of retaliation,” said Catherine Seitz, a legal director at the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area, who described the word “sanctuary” as “often a loaded term.”\n\nGenerally, immigration issues in smaller cities are handled at the county level, through government coalitions such as Cal Cities or by the California Attorney General’s Office.\n\nBut the Trump administration’s newfound interest in cities that aren’t major metro centers may reflect the president’s broader escalation of his longstanding promise to go after immigrant-friendly governments.\n\n“I would expect to see more actions like this, with how aggressive the Trump administration has been this time around,” said John Gioia, a supervisor in Contra Costa County, which does not have sanctuary policies and did not appear on the since-removed list.\n\nSanta Clara County, which has a robust sanctuary policy, joined San Francisco and other U.S. cities in March to petition a federal court to halt Trump’s latest plan to freeze funding for immigration “sanctuaries” — the latest face-off in a familiar legal fight.\n\nLast week, multiple smaller Bay Area cities, such as Hayward and Mountain View, quickly put out statements affirming their commitment to sanctuary policies upon the release of the Department of Homeland Security’s list.\n\n“Federal courts have ruled in favor of sanctuary cities — prohibiting the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions — and the city of Hayward’s policies will not change,” Mayor Mark Salinas said in a statement.\n\nBut a president historically undeterred by court decisions may prove challenging to overcome for smaller targets that find themselves staring down a determined federal government.\n\n“You think of the parallels of other institutions — like universities, or law firms — cooperating out of fear or pressure,” Armenta, the sociologist, said in an interview. “There’s no questions that the political tides are different.”","summary":"The Bay Area cities called out included Alameda, Belmont, Berkeley, Concord, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Fremont, Martinez, Menlo Park, Newark, Oakland, Pacifica, Pleasanton, Richmond, San Francisco, San Jose, San Leandro, San Pablo and Union City.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/03/bay-area-immigration-sanctuary-cities-legal-defense/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ice.webp?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 23:27:07","author":"Jason Green,Kyle Martin,Ryan Macasero,Shomik Mukherjee","authors":["Jason Green","Kyle Martin","Ryan Macasero","Shomik Mukherjee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.648},{"id":327830730,"title":"Dem who wanted Elon Musk 'taken down' launches bid for House Oversight leadership position","text":"Rising Democratic Party star Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who sparked controversy earlier this year with remarks about Elon Musk and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, formally launched her bid for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee Tuesday. \"These are not normal times — and this cannot be a business-as-usual moment,\" Crockett said in a post on X. The House Oversight Committee is responsible for holding the executive branch of the federal government and President Donald Trump accountable in Congress. The committee's last ranking member, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., died May 21 after battling cancer. He was elected to the position in 2023. \"Since the start of the 119th Congress, the late ranking member, Gerry Connolly, led Oversight Democrats in the fight to hold the Trump Administration accountable and it was my distinct privilege and absolute honor to serve alongside him as the Vice Ranking Member,\" Crockett said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues. JASMINE CROCKETT AGREES DURING TOWN HALL THAT 'REPUBLICANS WANT POOR PEOPLE TO DIE' Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Tuesday a special election to replace Connolly in the House. His death May 21 also left a leadership gap on the House Oversight Committee, and House Democrats are now tasked with electing a new leader to challenge Trump. Connolly designated Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., as interim ranking member, and the race is on among House Democrats for the open leadership position. Democratic representatives Robert Garcia of California and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland have announced their own bids to lead the committee. Crockett had signaled her intention to run for ranking member, and the Texas congresswoman's letter to Democrats Tuesday made her bid official. JASMINE CROCKETT SHARES BIZARRE SONG CLIP CALLING HERSELF 'LEADER OF THE FUTURE' \"In this moment, Americans are demanding a more strategic, aggressive, and energetic fight,\" Crockett said. \"Understanding that fierce urgency, I formally announce my candidacy for Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — with a focus on standing up for American families, defending the Constitution and the rule of law, and ensuring the government serves the people, not the privileged few.\" Crockett has risen to the national stage for her viral moments in the House, building name recognition among Democrats and a reputation among Republicans. Earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi accused Crockett of \"threatening lives\" and said she should apologize for her rhetoric against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for saying, \"All I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down.\" Crockett said she was referring to \"nonviolent\" resistance. Crockett was also criticized this year for calling Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, who is in a wheelchair, \"Governor Hot Wheels.\" She walked back the comments after her remarks went viral, calling the outrage a \"distraction.\" And the Texas congresswoman dominated headlines last year when her campaign trademarked the phrase \"bleach blonde, bad built, butch body\" after a verbal dispute with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Her viral moments have even caught the attention of Trump, who called Crockett a \"low I.Q. person.\" \"Our country is in an existential crisis driven by an out-of-control Executive with a flagrant disregard for our Constitution, our way of governance, and our very way of life as citizens of a democratic republic,\" Crockett said in her letter to House Democrats. \"The Administration has refused to respect congressional authority, abide by lawful judicial orders, or respond to public outrage.\" \"The magnitude of these unprecedented times warrants a resistance and tactics never before seen. We must pull back the curtain on the unmitigated chaos under Trump 2.0 and translate our findings to the American people in a way they can digest,\" Crockett added. In the letter, Crockett praised President Joe Biden, touted her own achievements during her first two terms in the House and asked for her colleagues' support. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another rising Democratic Party star, said earlier this year she would not seek the top Democratic position on the House Oversight Committee.

Ocasio-Cortez lost her House Oversight bid to Connolly late last year. Connolly had announced his plan to step back as ranking member of the Oversight Committee after just four months on the job due to the resurgence of his esophageal cancer.","summary":"U.S. Rep.

Police have said Soliman planned the attack for more than a year. He is facing federal hate crime charges.\n\n“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again,” J Bishop Grewell, Colorado’s acting US attorney, said during a news conference Monday.\n\nSoliman said that he acted alone and that nobody else knew of his plans. But officials with the administration of US President Donald Trump said they will investigate whether his wife and five children were aware of the suspect’s intentions.\n\nAdministration officials have also highlighted the fact that Soliman, an Egyptian national, was in the US on an expired tourist visa, tying his arrest — and that of his family — to a larger push against undocumented immigration.\n\n“The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorism,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n“Under the Trump administration, aliens will only be admitted into the United States through the legal process and only if they do not bear hostile attitudes towards our citizens, our culture, our government, our institutions or, most importantly, our founding principles.”\n\nSoliman’s family includes a wife and five children. The official White House account on the social media platform X indicated that they “could be deported by tonight”.\n\n“Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon,” Tuesday’s post read.\n\nThe attack comes amid rising tensions in the US over Israel’s continued war in Gaza, which United Nations experts and human rights groups have compared to a genocide. It also comes less than two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC.\n\nJewish as well as Muslim and Arab communities have reported sharp upticks in harassment and violence since the war began.\n\nTrump and his allies have used concerns about anti-Semitism as a pretext to push hardline policies on immigration and a crackdown on pro-Palestine activists.\n\n“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” Trump said in a social media post on Monday.\n\nBut the president and his supporters have themselves faced allegations of leaning into anti-Semitic rhetoric. And his administration’s push to expel foreign nationals has caused alarm among civil liberties groups.\n\nThe administration is currently attempting to deport several international students involved in pro-Palestine activity, including a Turkish graduate student named Rumeysa Ozturk.\n\nHer legal team argues that Ozturk appears to have been arrested for co-signing an op-ed calling for an end to the war in Gaza.
