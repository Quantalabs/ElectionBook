TRF, a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) front and proxy, claimed responsibility for the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack which killed 26 civilians. This was the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks conducted by LeT. TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024, the statement read.The statement said that this action demonstrated the US President Donald Trump administrations commitment of countering terrorism.These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrates the Trump Administrations commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trumps call for justice for the Pahalgam attack, the statement said.TRF and other associated aliases have been added to LeTs designation as a FTO and SDGT pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224, respectively. The Department of State has also reviewed and maintained the FTO designation of LeT. Amendments to FTO designations go into effect upon publication in the Federal Register, the statement added.Earlier on Tuesday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stressed the importance of taking an uncompromising stance against terrorism, citing the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack in India, which was condemned by the UN Security Council.The Minister was speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting in Tianjin.He highlighted three evils - terrorism, separatism and extremism, which often occur together in his X post.Jaishankar said, Recently, we in India witnessed a graphic example in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. It was deliberately conducted to undermine the tourism economy of Jammu and Kashmir, while sowing a religious divide. The UN Security Council, of which some of us are currently members, issued a statement that condemned it in the strongest terms and underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. We have since done exactly that and will continue doing so. It is imperative that the SCO, to remain true to its founding objectives, take an uncompromising position on this challenge.On April 22, Pakistan-backed terrorists attacked tourists at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, killing 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen while leaving several others injured.On May 7, the Indian Army struck nine terrorist infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir under Operation Sindoor, killing over 100 dreaded terrorists and avenging the loss of lives in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

Additional Israeli ground troops have also been sent to the occupation zone.And with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rhetoric hardening despite Sharaa's calls for de-escalation, the new Syrian leader may himself become a target as have many top foes of Israel over the past 21 months of the country's conflict with the Iran-aligned Axis of Resistance, of which Sharaa was also an ardent opponent.\"Israel has showed lately that if Israel feels that a certain leader—like [Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan] Nasrallah, or the leaders of the military of Iran, or the leader of Hamas—is an evident threat to its national security, it will operate,\" Reda Mansour, a former Israeli ambassador and currently CEO of Jethro Jews for Druze, told Newsweek.\"It's a fact, it happened in the last two years,\" Mansour added. \"It wouldn't be Israel's first choice. Israel is probably aware that it might start an anarchy in Syria, but it depends if he started an anarchy anyway, then you have to give to other leaders.\"The Druze on the Front LinesMansour is among several prominent members of Israel's Druze community who have advocated for Israeli military action in the face of reports of up to hundreds of Syrian Druze, including women and children, being slain in recent days by Bedouin tribes allegedly backed by Syrian security forces, which include a number of foreign and domestic militias.The Druze are a religious minority composed of ethnic Arabs with a presence across Israel, Lebanon and Syria, which is home to their largest population. They have remained largely neutral throughout Syria's 14-year civil war, with some militias allying with Assad at times, who hails from another religious minority, the Alawites, in majority-Sunni Muslim Syria.A sizable population of Druze also live in the Golan Heights, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Druze living within internationally recognized Israeli territory are by and large full Israeli citizens, while the majority of those living in the Golan Heights continue to consider themselves Syrian citizens.Sharaa, whose family has roots in the Golan Heights, initially said little of the growing Israeli incursion and air raids in his country upon coming to power in December. Rather, he directed much of his efforts inward, vowing to respect minority rights and build a more inclusive future for the country.Yet his commitments were quickly undermined by reports of the loosely organized security forces targeting various communities, including Alawites, Druze and Kurds.In February, deadly clashes between Syrian forces and local militias in the largely Druze southern suburbs of Damascus prompted the first major threats from Netanyahu regarding the fate of the minority group. Violence resurfaced in April, drawing sharper warnings from Israel, and appeared to abate for a time in May, only to once again resurface in recent days.Israeli officials have taken the opportunity to portray their country as a guardian of minority rights in the region.\"We are determined to deter the regime from harming the Druze, by ensuring the full demilitarization of the border with Syria, acting to defend our common values, and for the protection of minority groups,\" Sawsan Natour-Hasoun, minister of public diplomacy at the Israeli Embassy to the United States wrote in an op-ed published by Newsweek on Thursday.\"Everyone should know that the Druze of Syria stand as the last symbol of pluralism and minority diversity in the Arab-majority region,\" she added.Sharaa meanwhile has since declared protecting the Druze a \"priority\" for his administration and accused Israel of \"trying to drag us into war and division.\"From Fighting US to Meeting TrumpThe violence in southern Syria follows the Trump administration's decision last week to revoke the foreign terrorist organization of Sharaa's former Hayat Tahrir al-Sham faction, the latest in a series of moves that have indicated a warming in ties between Washington and Damascus.In a brief but high-profile engagement at the Saudi Royal Palace in May, Sharaa met with Trump, whose administration had previously censured the new government for reports of targeting minorities. The U.S. leader went on to announce a lifting of sanctions against Syria that ultimately came into effect in late June.\"I think he's very good,\" Trump said of Sharaa following their meeting in May, \"a young, attractive guy. Strong past. Very strong past. A fighter. But he's got a real shot at holding it together.\"While Sharaa has publicly denounced extremist ideology in recent years, the man long better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has spent much of his life in the ranks of jihadi groups.Born in Damascus, Sharaa traveled to Iraq in his early 20s to join Al-Qaeda as it launched an insurgency against U.S. troops in the wake of the 2003 invasion that toppled President Saddam Hussein. He was detained for a time by U.S. forces and rejoined Al-Qaeda in Iraq upon his release, later traveling to Syria to establish the Nusra Front, effectively operating as Al-Qaeda's branch in the neighboring country amid the outbreak of civil war between Assad and an array of rebel factions in 2011.Sharaa was initially allied at this time with future Islamic State militant group (ISIS) founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but in 2013 ultimately refused to align with his new group, remaining loyal to Al-Qaeda. Sharaa broke with Al-Qaeda as well in 2016 and rebranded his group several times until leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to victory last December.As Sharaa began to quickly forge regional and international ties, meeting with Arab and Western leaders, some in Israel continued to express skepticism.\"I believe the world, especially the West, especially the U.S. administration, hurried up to embrace him, to give him the credit, the legitimacy without even proving anything,\" Gadeer Kamal-Mreeh, a former Israeli Knesset member and currently director of Eastern Mediterranean Affairs at the Middle East Forum, told Newsweek.\"I don't see here a reliable, liberal, educated, brave leader. I see the opposite,\" Kamal-Mreeh, who is also a member of Israel's Druze community, added. \"I see a fundamentalist radical Islamist leader. I see an element of ISIS. We warned, we signaled, we said that, we predicted that since day one.\"She called on the Trump administration to apply the brakes on its embrace of Syria and reexamine its policy toward the country.\"I believe that the foreign policy in the Middle East of the new administration must hold their horses, must calculate and recalculate their steps, double check and calculate every step again and again,\" Kamal-Mreeh said.\"We cannot simply call Al-Golani handsome, shake the leadership's hands, and give them the green light to proceed and without even checking what are their plans, what they think about in the rebuilding process.\"She also predicted that Israel would likely remain active in Syria for some time, putting Sharaa himself on notice.\"Israeli drones are above Al-Sweida and above every city, including Damascus, as you saw yesterday,\" Kamal-Mreeh said. \"Israel is not hesitating even to attack political and leadership symbols in the palace of Golani or his offices or ministries in a warning signal that you are here crossing the red line.\"While the U.S. has continued to call on Sharaa's administration to respect Druze rights and withdraw forces from Al-Sweida, it has also engaged in talks with both Israel and Syria in order to put an end to the fighting.Speaking to reporters Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that \"the United States did not support recent Israeli strikes\" in Syria.Syria on the BrinkMany in Syria, however, have drawn the opposite lesson from recent events, which follow efforts by Sharaa to enter into talks with Israeli officials toward de-escalation and, reportedly, even the prospect of normalizing ties.\"Israel is not a country where you can expect diplomacy to play a role,\" Mahmoud Toron, a Syrian politician close to the interim government, told Newsweek. \"They have become completely unpredictable, and the last events have proven that.\"\"So now, in the event where Syria has to find itself cornered in between resisting this lunatic behavior of Israel or keep on giving concessions they won't give concessions for too long,\" he added.As some top Israeli officials, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, part of a far-right faction within Netanyahu's ruling coalition, now openly calling for the Sharaa's assassination, Toron referred to calls emanating from Israel for yet another regime change in Syria as being \"against any form of common sense, logic and law.\"\"What if tomorrow Israel decides that the government of Jordan is not friendly anymore? Does that give them the right to launch military activity and overthrow the regime in Jordan? Absolutely not,\" Toron said. \"It is our problem to deal with our leadership, our right, not with the interference of other states by force.\"Toron also warned that, even short of direct action against Sharaa, Israel's behavior was already \"undermining Syria's stability\" and that of its government, especially through targeting government institutions.Toron said he was just meters away from the strike that targeted the Syrian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, and warned such actions were giving rise to calls for a more substantive response that ran the risk of devolving into greater insecurity in Syria.\"At the end of the day, the army is not yet a fully disciplined army,\" Toron said. \"It's a newly formed army. It's not easy to control the factions within this army, and these factions at the time when they believe that the president is really underperforming when it comes to certain principles, there is a very high risk that they might go offline and start eating on their own.\"\"And this is going to be a problem for Israel,\" he added.A New War Between WarsWhile the latest operations mark a new chapter in Israel's intervention in Syria, the IDF has been operating openly in the country for more than a decade. Israeli officials long referred to semi-regular raids against suspected Iran-tied targets in Syria as the \"war between wars.\"This changed on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian Hamas movement launched a massive surprise attack on Israel from another front, the Gaza Strip, sparking a full-scale war that has since engulfed much of the region, including Syria.In addition to the pretext of protecting the Druze, Israeli officials now also justify operations in Syria by arguing that the country could not allow the buildup of hostile forces near Israel's borders.\"Israel cannot let south Syria drift into becoming Lebanon or Gaza,\" Mansour said. \"We just had a very painful lesson from those places where we were very reluctant to act. We waited for too long and we paid very dear price. So, the Israeli public mood right now is do everything you need to do to prevent another seventh of October.\"This strategy includes the enforcement of a \"buffer zone\" across southern Syria, from Damascus to the Golan Heights, and including Al-Sweida, as Netanyahu reiterated during video remarks on Thursday.Mansour argued that, if Sharaa failed to make good on upholding Druze rights in the south, he could face the establishment of a de facto autonomous region, not unlike U.S.-backed Kurdish forces established in the northeast in the early years of the civil war.\"The Druze will help Israel stabilize southern Syria by having an autonomy there, and it would be, I think, good for everybody,\" Mansour said. \"For Israel it's good, for the Druze it's good, and if the government in Damascus doesn't understand the importance of unifying the country, then it will be the price they pay for their policy.\"But the position of the Trump administration may prove crucial. In addition to withholding support for the latest Israeli strikes, the U.S. has also advocated Syrian unity and territorial integrity, a message that enforced by the White House's role in negotiation a now-stalled deal through which its Kurdish ally, the Syrian Democratic Force, would integrate into the central government.And while Trump remains close to Netanyahu, the U.S. leader has also established close ties with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, whom Trump credited with helping convince him to lift sanctions on Syria in May.Erdogan railed against alleged efforts to divide Syria during a cabinet meeting on Thursday.\"We did not consent to the partition of Syria yesterday, and we absolutely will not consent to it today or tomorrow,\" Erdogan said. \"Those dreaming of creating a corridor between the south and the north of Syria at the cost of the country's territorial integrity will never be able to achieve their targets.\"\"We will hinder them in solidarity with our Syrian brothers and sisters,\" he added. Those who go down the well with Israel's rope will sooner or later realize they have made a grave miscalculation.\"Tonor, for his part, argued that the repercussions over growing Israeli incursion into the country was an issue not just for Syria and the region, but for the West as well.\"Are we concerned of further Israeli infiltration into Syria? Yes, we surely are, because they have not stopped,\" Tonor said, \"and they are literally tens of kilometers from the capital, Damascus, and that is surely a major source of concern, not just to Syria, but also to the Western world.\"\"We speak with diplomats in Damascus. We speak with diplomats outside Damascus,\" he added. \"It is a major concern to them as well.\"","summary":"\"If Israel feels that a certain leader...is an evident threat to its national security, it will operate,\" a former Israeli envoy told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/syrias-new-leader-won-trumps-approvalhe-may-soon-israels-hit-list-2100498","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2685453/syria-president-sharaa-speech.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4aa2a2317975e67c98f90bcaf261c9d4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 01:30:23","author":"Tom O'connor","authors":["Tom O'connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.314},{"id":342708252,"title":"‘Never did this’: Trump denies writing adoring note to Epstein","text":"Today The Wall Street Journal reported on a gift Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s chief co-conspirator in his underage sex trafficking crimes, who is now serving a 20-year jail sentence – prepared for him in 2003.\n\nMaxwell collected messages from Epstein’s associates and compiled them into a leather-bound birthday album, according to documents reviewed by the newspaper. One of the messages was in Mr Trump’s name.\n\nEpstein was not arrested until 2006. That case led to his infamous “sweetheart” plea deal, negotiated with federal prosecutors, which saw him admit to soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution and serve a 13-month sentence, but escape prosecution for more serious trafficking crimes.\n\nHe was then rearrested in July of 2019 on sex trafficking charges, accused of exploiting girls as young as 14. He died in prison a month later. It was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe note to Epstein bearing Mr Trump’s name has several lines of typed text – describing an imagined conversation between the pair – inside the outline of a naked woman, drawn with a marker pen.\n\nAccording to The Journal, the name “Donald” is signed just below the woman’s waist, in a mimicry of pubic hair.\n\n“This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” Mr Trump told the paper before it published the story.\n\n“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women. It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\nAnd he threatened to sue.\n\n“I’m going to sue The Wall Street Journal, just like I sued everyone else,” said the President.\n\n“Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bulls***,” Vice President J.D. Vance tweeted after publication.\n\n“The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?\n\n“Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?”\n\nThe Justice Department and FBI, which have been responsible for investigating the Epstein case, declined to comment.\n\nThe text of the note conveys a mocked-up conversation between Epstein and Mr Trump.\n\nVoice Over: There must be more to life than having everything.\n\nDonald: Yes, there is, but I won’t tell you what it is.\n\nJeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it is. \n\nDonald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey. \n\nJeffrey: Yes, we do, come to think of it. \n\nDonald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that? \n\nJeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you. \n\nTrump: A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.\n\nWe already knew that Mr Trump and Epstein were friends for over a decade. They were photographed together on multiple occasions, often alongside Melania Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, and flight logs show Mr Trump travelled on Epstein’s private plane, the “Lolita Express”, seven times in the 1990s.\n\nThose flights were all between Florida and New York, where both men owned property. None went to Epstein’s notorious private island, located in the US Virgin Islands.\n\n“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Mr Trump told New York Magazine in 2002.\n\n“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\n\n“No doubt about it: Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”\n\nThere was a subsequent falling out. According to Mr Trump, his friendship with Epstein ended before his aforementioned guilty plea in 2008. When Epstein was arrested the second time, Mr Trump said he hadn’t spoken to him for 15 years.\n\nThere has never been any evidence to suggest Mr Trump was involved in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes.\n\nThis all comes less than two weeks after the Justice Department released a memo, on July 7, which essentially said it was closing the Epstein case.\n\nThe department said a “systematic review” had “revealed no incriminating ‘client list’”.\n\n“There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” it said.\n\n“We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\n\nThe memo also concluded that Epstein did, indeed, kill himself in prison.\n\nIt set off a shockwave within Mr Trump’s MAGA movement, which felt the Trump administration had betrayed its own promises to release the Epstein files.\n\nSoon after taking office, Mr Trump’s handpicked Attorney-General Pam Bondi told Fox News the so-called “client list” was “sitting on my desk” for review.\n\nAnd in February the administration distributed binders full of Epstein-related documents – most of them already public – to selected right-wing influencers, describing those documents as merely “phase one” of a broader release.\n\nNow, it seems, there will be no further releases.\n\nMr Trump, for his part, has expressed confusion at Americans’ continuing interest in the Epstein case, and has gone so far as to say he no longer wants the support of those within MAGA who keep talking about it.\n\nHe has taken to calling the unreleased Epstein files a “hoax”, and now claims they were written by his political enemies, such as former president Barack Obama, former FBI director James Comey and his predecessor Joe Biden.\n\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,” he wrote on social media yesterday, referring to the Democrats.\n\n“And my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bulls***,’ hook, line, and sinker. They haven’t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for eight long years.\n\n“Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!”\n\nMore to come.","summary":"A furious Donald Trump has threatened to sue after a newspaper published a strange note he allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/donald-trump-threatens-to-sue-as-wall-street-journal-publishes-contents-of-note-he-allegedly-wrote-to-jeffrey-epstein/news-story/97871c4e5683672b0b89c2ac1efb2d0a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/79d9fd86bd66efe0a25ea1ca4c78be36","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 01:26:26","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":342707250,"title":"US Says It Opposed Israeli Strikes In Syria","text":"Washington: The United States said Thursday that it opposed its ally Israel's strikes in Syria, a day after Washington helped broker a deal to end violence. \"The United States did not support recent Israeli strikes,\" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters. \"We are engaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between the two sovereign states,\" she said.

According to the WSJ, the letter—part of a birthday album assembled for Epstein's 50th birthday by Ghislaine Maxwell—featured a drawing of a naked woman, with Trump’s signature allegedly replacing the woman’s pubic hair. The typewritten note reportedly ended with: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” The Journal claimed to have reviewed the note but did not publish the image. Trump, in a Tuesday interview with the outlet, denied any involvement and warned the newspaper against publishing the claims. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” Trump said, adding, “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”The report arrives at a tense moment for Trump, whose supporters are increasingly disillusioned over the Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein case. A DOJ memo last week reaffirmed that Epstein died by suicide and confirmed there is no “client list,” frustrating Trump’s MAGA base, which had hoped the former president would release all Epstein-related files.Live Events In response, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, calling the outrage a distraction: “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker.” The WSJ noted that the letter was part of a larger trove of documents collected during past Justice Department probes into Epstein. Maxwell, a longtime Epstein associate, was later convicted of child sex trafficking in connection with his crimes. The latest revelations are likely to intensify scrutiny of Trump’s relationship with Epstein and raise further questions about how his administration handled the notorious case.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onwsjTrump Epstein letterWall Street Journal lawsuitEpstein birthday noteDonald TrumpEpstein case investigationGhislaine MaxwellTrump drawing controversyEpstein client list\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

But in the process, something has disappeared: the agents' faces, covered by caps, sunglasses, pulled-up neck gaiters or balaclavas, effectively rendering them unidentifiable.\n\nWith the year only half over, the covered face — as deployed by law enforcement in a wave of immigration crackdowns directed by President Donald Trump's White House — has become one of the most potent and contentious visuals of 2025.\n\nThe increase in high-profile immigration enforcement was already contentious between those opposed to the actions of Trump's administration and those in support of them. The sight of masked agents carrying it out is creating a whole new level of conflict, in a way that has no real comparison in the U.S. history of policing.\n\nTrump administration officials have consistently defended the practice, saying that immigration agents have faced strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they have gone about their enforcement in service of Trump's drive toward mass deportation, and hiding their identities is for their and their families' safety to avoid things like death threats and doxing, where someone's personal information is released without their permission on the internet.\n\n“I’m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons said last month.\n\nThere's pushback, as expected\n\nDemocrats and others, including the several state attorneys general, have pushed back, saying the use of face masks generates public fear and should be halted.\n\nIn a letter to Lyons last week, a group of Democratic senators said the stepped-up immigration enforcement in workplaces, restaurants and other sites was already causing dismay and the increasingly common sight of masked agents “represents a clear attempt to compound that fear and chaos – and to avoid accountability for agents’ actions.”\n\nIn American culture, covering one's face has often gone hand in hand with assumptions of negative behavior. Think bandits donning bandanas in cowboy movies, or robbers putting on ski masks before pulling a heist on a bank. Even comic-book superheroes who cover their faces have been swept up in storylines in recent years that derisively refer to them as “masks” and say their decision to hide their identities while enforcing justice is transgressive.\n\nAnd the presence of masked police or paramilitary forces in other countries has been seen by Americans as antithetical to promised democracy and justice for all — and to the common-law principle of being able to face your accusers.\n\nMask-wearing overall in American life took another hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many Trump supporters scoffed at notions that protective masks would insulate people from the deadly virus and scorned people who wore them. More recently, Trump has come out against masks, at least when they're being worn by protestors. He posted on social media last month that demonstrators wearing masks should be arrested.\n\nGiven all that cultural context, it's even more problematic that those enforcing laws be the ones with their faces covered, said Tobias Winright, professor of moral theology at St. Patrick's Pontifical University in Maynooth, Ireland. He has worked in law enforcement in the U.S. and writes frequently about policing ethics.\n\nIf “what you’re doing is above board and right,\" he said, “then why conceal your identity?”\n\nPower gives different symbols different meanings\n\nFor those who question why it's different for law enforcement to wear masks if protestors and non-law enforcement personnel are doing it, it's because symbols have different meanings based on the power and position of the people using them, said Alison Kinney, author of “Hood,” a book about that clothing item and the various ways people have used it.\n\n“ICE agents are agents of the state. and they’re invested with not only power but also with protections in carrying out their job,” she said. “But that job is also supposed to be public service. It’s also supposed to be accountable and responsible to the public.\"\n\n“And so they have a greater responsibility for transparency and accountability and making themselves known so that we can hold them accountable for the justice or injustice of their actions,” she said.\n\nConcerns over how law enforcement is held accountable to the public have come up before. Advocates pushed for officers to wear body cameras and demanded that police officers have visible names and badge numbers. But there hasn't previously been much discussion around police masking because there isn't a history of it being done in any kind of official widespread way in the United States, outside of SWAT- or undercover-type operations, Winright said.\n\nThe most high-profile example of mask-wearing in American history for the purpose of hiding identity is also its most negative one — racist attacks carried out by the members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe masks served a purpose, of course, of keeping the wearers' identities secret, said Elaine Frantz, a history professor at Kent State University and author of “Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan during Reconstruction.” But they also made it easier for those wearing them to commit violent acts against others, she said.\n\n“One thing about a mask is it kind of works like being behind a riot shield,” Frantz said. “When you have more of separation from the person you’re attacking, it’s easier to dehumanize that person.”\n\nWinright said he hoped law enforcement mask-wearing wouldn't be normalized. There has been at least one expansion into local policing. In Nassau County, on Long Island just outside New York City, County Executive Bruce Blakeman last week signed an executive order allowing police officers to wear masks during certain types of work, including working with immigration agents.\n\nWinright is concerned, though, that the move could strain police-community relations even more, thus putting officers at even more risk.\n\n“Wearing a mask seems to increase fear and decrease trust, and policing from federal to local in America needs trust and transparency and community relations that are positive,” he said.\n\nHe added: “The harms, the risks, are greater by wearing masks, not only to the individual officers, but to the profession itself, as well as to the United States society. It’s just going to further exacerbate the us-versus-them polarization, the lack of trust, and that’s the probably the last thing we need right now.”","summary":"In a matter of months, it has become a regular sight around the country - immigration enforcement agents detaining people and taking them into custody, often as public anger and outcry unfold around them.

Sekadar mengimbau kenyataan Pertubuhan Bangsa-bangsa Bersatu bahawa GHF is a death trap untuk rakyat Palestin. Indeed there is nothing humanitarian in Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\nSekarang Israel (baca: Benjamin Netanyahu & Co) mahu pula mendirikan di Gaza apa yang mereka namakan 'humanitarian city' di atas runtuhan bandar Rafah. Rancangan Netanyahu itu diumumkan minggu lalu oleh menteri pertahanannya, Israel Katz.\nMenurut rancangan itu, rejim Israel mahu memindahkan tidak kurang daripada 600,000 rakyat Palestin yang tidak ada tempat tinggal ke 'bandar kemanusiaan'. Mengapa rakyat Palestin tidak ada tempat tinggal? Kerana rumah mereka dimusnahkan oleh Israel kan! Ini dunia dah tahu.\nAngka itu permulaan. Israel mahu menempatkan semua dua juta rakyat Palestin di Gaza di 'humanitarian city' itu. Setelah masuk tidak akan dibenarkan keluar. Menurut CNN, \"Katz then vowed that Israel would implement a plan, first floated by US President Donald Trump, to allow Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza to other countries\".\nErtinya 'humanitarian city' itu pusat transit sebelum penghuninya berhijrah ke negara lain. Namun kita tahu rakyat Palestin di Gaza mahupun di Tebing Barat dan kawasan lain tidak mahu berganjak dari bumi Palestin. Mereka rela mati di tanah air sendiri. Lalu apa yang akan dilakukan Israel? Paksa mereka pindah? Usir mereka atau buat apa yang Israel amat cekap yakni membunuh?\nKata Katz, tentera Israel sudah diarah menyediakan 'bandar kemanusiaan'. Jurucakap angkatan bersenjata Israel dilapor berkata tentera bersedia menurut perintah tetapi mengingatkan Tel Aviv akan reaksi negatif masyarakat antarabangsa.\nPihak dalaman juga membantah termasuk bekas perdana menteri Ehud Olmert. Turut membantah ialah parti pembangkang terbesar dan ketuanya Yair Lapid, yang pernah menjadi perdana menteri selama enam bulan pada 2022. Semua melihat 'humanitarian city' tidak lebih daripada concentration camp Israel. Terjemahan 'concentration camp' ialah 'kem tahanan' manakala istilah 'kem penghapusan' digunakan khusus untuk 'extermination camp' yang dikaitkan dengan Nazi.\nAkhbar Times of Israel melaporkan \"senior Israeli academics have warned forcing Palestinians into a closed off area would be legally unjustified and constitute crimes against humanity\". Sekali lagi saya nyatakan tidak ada 'humanitarian' di 'humanitarian city'. Belum ada perkembangan lanjut semasa artikel ini ditulis tetapi Netanyahu seperti dijangka mempertahankan rancangannya itu.\nSaya percaya ini antara langkah ethnic cleansing atau penghapusan bangsa Palestin. Pada hemat saya itulah yang Israel mahu untuk sekian lama dan sedang dilakukan. Insiden 7 Oktober 2023 sekadar memberi alasan.\nSebenarnya selama ini pun Gaza bagai satu kem tahanan besar. Israel sering melakukan sekatan bekalan makanan dan perubatan. Dikatakan ramai pengintip Israel beroperasi di Gaza. Dipercayai ada juga pengawasan kamera. Sekarang drone digunakan.\nDi Tebing Barat cengkaman Israel tetap dirasai, apa lagi di kawasan yang diduduki atau occupied territories. Kekejaman dan penindasan ke atas rakyat Palestin berlaku setiap hari. Beberapa bulan lalu penempatan pelarian di Jenin yang sepatutnya 'kawasan aman' menjadi sasaran operasi ketenteraan Israel.\nIsrael sentiasa meluaskan kawasan mereka. Kumpulan peneroka atau settlers digalakkan membuat penempatan baru dengan merampas tanah milik rakyat Palestin. Mereka semenangnya golongan ekstremis serta militan yang disokong dan diberi perlindungan oleh tentera. Jentolak tentera digunakan untuk meroboh rumah rakyat Palestin.\nSasaran tentera Israel mahu pun settlers ialah rakyat Palestin. Tanpa ambil kira agama. Islam atau Kristian akan jadi sasaran asalkan mereka Palestin. Kita pernah ikuti laporan berita Al Jazeera dan CNN gereja dimusnah akibat serangan tentera rejim. Beberapa hari lalu kumpulan settlers memukul hingga mati seorang rakyat Amerika Syarikat keturunan Palestin. Washington sekarang mahu ini disiasat rapi.\nKita tahu jutaan kanak-kanak sudah terkorban. Yang hidup tidak ada peluang untuk belajar. Ini bagi saya satu lagi cara ethnic cleansing yakni memastikan golongan masa depan tidak ada masa depan.\nTidak ada berita gembira yang boleh digunakan bagi menutup penulisan ini.\n\nArtikel ini adalah pandangan penulis dan tidak semestinya mewakili FMT.","summary":"Israel mahu pindahkan 600,000 rakyat Palestin yang tidak ada tempat tinggal ke 'bandar kemanusiaan'.

It’s struggling to get them jobs","text":"Medan, Indonesia – After graduating from university with a law degree two years ago, Andreas Hutapea assumed he would not have much difficulty finding a stable career.\n\nIn reality, Hutapea found himself facing one rejection after another.\n\nHutapea first failed to make it through Indonesia’s notoriously difficult civil service exams, which lead to a job for only about 3 percent of applicants, and was similarly unsuccessful in his bid to become a trainee prosecutor.\n\nBefore law school, Hutapea had dreamed of joining the army, but he could not meet the height requirement.\n\nEventually, with his money running out, Hutapea left the student accommodation he was renting to move back in with his parents, who run a simple shop selling oil, eggs, rice and other groceries.\n\nHutapea has been working at his parents’ shop, in a town on the outskirts of Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, ever since.\n\n“I open the shop for them in the morning, sit there throughout the day serving customers and then help close at night,” Hutapea, who graduated from high school in 2020, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“My parents don’t pay me a wage for my work, but I can’t blame them for that. They are giving me free food and lodging.”\n\nHutapea is far from alone in his struggles to find stable, well-paying work.\n\nIndonesia has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in Asia.\n\nAbout 16 percent of the more than 44 million Indonesians aged 15-24 are out of work, according to government statistics – more than double the youth unemployment rate of neighbouring Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nIn a survey published by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore in January, young Indonesians expressed far more pessimistic attitudes about the economy and the government than their peers in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\nOnly about 58 percent of Indonesian youth said they were optimistic about the government’s economic plans, according to the survey, compared with an average of 75 percent across the six countries.\n\nIn February, some of this angst spilled onto the streets when university students formed the Indonesia Gelap, or Dark Indonesia, movement to protest government plans to trim spending on public services.\n\nEconomists point to a range of factors for the high rate of jobless youth in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, from rigid labour laws that make hiring difficult to poor wages that fail to attract capable workers.\n\n“Many people choose to be outside the labour market rather than having to work for a salary below expectations,” Adinova Fauri, an economist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Indonesia, in Jakarta, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Good jobs are also not widely available, so people turn to the informal sector, which has lower productivity and protection.”\n\nIndonesia, which is home to more than 280 million people, has long struggled with chronic youth unemployment.\n\nWhile still high compared with the rest of the region, governments have, through the years, made some progress in getting more young people into work – as recently as a decade ago, one-quarter of young Indonesians were estimated to be without a job.\n\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto, a retired army general who oversaw crackdowns on the 1998 student protests that precipitated the fall of former President Soeharto, has acknowledged the need to create more jobs, establishing task forces to tackle unemployment and negotiate on trade with United States President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prabowo hailed the beginning of “a new era of mutual benefit” for Indonesia and the US, after Trump announced a deal to lower tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32 to 19 percent.\n\nThough older adults are less at risk of being unemployed – Indonesia’s overall jobless rate is about 5 percent – much of the work that is available is unstable and poorly compensated.\n\nAbout 56 percent of the Indonesian workforce is employed in the informal sector, according to 2024 figures from the Bureau of Statistics, leaving millions in vulnerable conditions and without social security protections.\n\n“The decline in the open unemployment rate does not necessarily reflect good performance in the labour market,” Deniey Adi Purwanto, a lecturer at the Department of Economics at IPB University in Bogor, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The quality of jobs and informal employment are still major problems.”\n\nBut for young people, the mismatch between the number of job seekers and jobs is particularly severe.\n\n“Firstly, graduates of secondary and tertiary education do not always match the needs of the labour market, and there is also a high proportion of informality,” Purwanto said.\n\n“Indonesia has a very large number of young people, so the pressure on the labour market is much higher.\n\n“We also have rapidly increasing levels of secondary and higher education,” he added.\n\n“Many young college graduates avoid informal or low-paid jobs, so they choose to wait for suitable jobs, which leads to unemployment.”\n\nPurwanto said there was also a lack of effective vocational training and apprenticeship programmes in Indonesia, compared with neighbours such as Vietnam or Malaysia.\n\n“In Malaysia, for example, there are more industry-university linkage schemes and graduate employability programmes,” he said.\n\nStark regional disparities in Indonesia, which is made up of some 17,000 islands, compound the problem, with young people in remote and rural areas finding it especially difficult to access good jobs.\n\nThis is particularly true in areas outside the island of Java, which is home to the capital Jakarta and more than half of Indonesia’s population.\n\nHutapea experienced this firsthand when he moved back with his parents, who live about two hours out of Medan.\n\nDespite having a law degree, Hutapea, who is desperate to no longer work in his parents’ shop, has found job opportunities thin on the ground.\n\nHutapea, who also has a side gig setting up sound systems for weddings and parties, recently attended an interview for a job replenishing banknotes in ATMs.\n\nBut even though he thought the interview went well, he never heard back from the recruiter.\n\nFor Hutapea, who completed some of his law school modules during the summer holidays so he could graduate a year early, it is hard not to feel like his efforts have not been in vain.\n\n“I didn’t want to be a burden to my parents, who were paying all my university fees,” Hutapea said.\n\n“But look at me now.”","summary":"Young Indonesians are more pessimistic about their economic futures than their regional peers, according to

Gillis’ monologue at the ESPY Awards on Wednesday night has left plenty of people divided over the contents of the jokes, but the Disney-owned sports network isn’t concerned about the reaction that Gillis’ routine received, The Post has confirmed.\n\nDuring his roughly 10-minute opening, Gillis poked fun at just about everyone from popular sports figures to President Donald Trump in a biting opening sequence to kick off the annual sports award show. \n\nThe Worldwide Leader always knew Gillis’ comedic stylings weren’t going to be for everyone, as TMZ first reported, but there were no worries about the “Tires” star who has worked with the network on its “College GameDay” show.\n\nESPN declined comment when reached by The Post. \n\nAmong the topics that Gillis touched upon were Trump, Caitlin Clark, Aaron Rodgers and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe well-known comedian received mixed reactions during his eyebrow-raising opening remarks.\n\nGillis asserted that women’s soccer legend Megan Rapinoe was not a “good time” in one of his first quips of the night and later joked that he and Clark, the WNBA superstar, had a lot in common because they were both “whites from the Midwest who have nailed a bunch of 3s.”\n\n“When Caitlin Clark retires from the WNBA, she’s going to work at a Waffle House so she can continue doing what she loves most, fist fighting black women,” he continued.\n\nIn one of his most well-received jokes of the night, he aimed Bill Belichick and girlfriend Jordon Hudson after making a Shohei Ohtani joke related to his disgraced interpreter Ippei Mizuhara. \n\n“A bookie is what Bill Belichick reads to his girlfriend before bedtime,” Gillis said on stage before launching into a list of crude titles for classic books.\n\nAt least one former ESPNer didn’t enjoy the show.\n\n“In a year of crazy growth for women’s sports choosing an ESPYs host who doesn’t even try to make clever jokes about women athletes (he at least *attempted* for the men),” Sarah Spain wrote on X on Thursday, “he goes with hacky ‘no one knows the WNBA’ bits, ‘Pinoe is a bad time’ & repeatedly insults Black women.

That means someone is lying,” he said, accusing some parties of having a vested interest in prolonging the bloodshed. “They want the war to continue, no matter what they say.”\n\nA deal won’t come from Kiev. It must come from Washington and Moscow. Until then, there will be no peace.\n\n“The conflict will not stop until the Russian and American presidents sit down at the negotiating table,” Orban added. He expressed hope that such a meeting could lay the foundation for a broad agreement addressing not only Ukraine, but also global trade and arms control.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump said he was “very, very unhappy” with Putin and threatened Moscow’s trade partners with “severe” secondary tariffs if no diplomatic progress is made within 50 days.\n\nBudapest has consistently criticized efforts to arm Kiev and opposed its EU and NATO ambitions, warning it prolongs the conflict at growing cost to European economies and taxpayers. Trump has indicated that Washington will no longer fund Kiev’s war effort, but allowed other NATO members to continue purchasing US-made weapons for Ukraine.\n\nSince returning to office in January, Trump has held several phone calls with Putin and has alternated between assigning blame to Moscow and Kiev for the lack of progress. In May, Ukraine agreed to resume direct negotiations with Russia under pressure from Washington. However, talks stalled after two rounds, with Kiev declaring the process “exhausted” and indicating it had only participated to avoid appearing dismissive of Trump’s diplomatic initiative.\n\nMoscow has said it remains committed to achieving its core objectives in Ukraine but prefers a diplomatic solution. The Kremlin has expressed hope that, despite his public statements, Trump is also applying private pressure on Kiev.","summary":"Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has called a meeting between the US and Russian leaders the only realistic path to ending the Ukraine conflict \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621634-trump-putin-meet-orban/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/68799a9485f540040e7c276d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 00:55:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":342705030,"title":"Trump Threatens Lawsuit Against WSJ Over Epstein Letter","text":"President Donald Trump has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal after the outlet released a piece alleging that the president sent deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein a suggestive letter.\n\nThe WSJ reportedly obtained birthday letters to Epstein prior to his first arrest in 2018, alleging the president had sent a letter containing the “outline of a naked woman.” In response to the outlet’s allegations, Trump denied the letter, calling it a “fake thing.”\n\n“I never wrote a picture in my life.

It’s perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net, and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” he said on Wednesday.\n\nBut he has been dogged by his past association with Epstein, having known him for 15 years until their relationship soured in the early 2000s over a real estate deal.\n\nIn a 2002 New York magazine profile, he is quoted as saying: “I’ve known Jeff [Epstein] for 15 years.

Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security. Also Read | Pakistan Horror: 15-Year-Old Hindu Girl Abducted at Gunpoint From Her Home in Sindh Province, Another Forcibly Converted to Islam. The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilisers. The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said. Also Read | Air India Ahmedabad Plane Crash Investigation: AAIB Slams International Media Speculation on AI171 Crash, Urges Patience for Final Report. Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that \"critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs\", the White House said in a fact sheet. Trump's EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act from a host of Biden-era rules. Environmental groups denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a \"polluters' portal\" that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother's womb. Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements. The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security. In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency's website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.\" An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save USD 275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency's own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

The visit was part of an official review to determine whether the site could be brought back into use as a high-security federal detention center. \"This was an idea of the president,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt explained during a White House briefing Thursday in Washington, D.C. \"He spoke about it in May and directed his administration to review a reopening plan for Alcatraz if it is possible.\" TRUMP PUSHES TO REOPEN ALCATRAZ, BUT PELOSI AND NEWSOM DISMISS IT AS A 'DISTRACTION' After Trump’s May 5 announcement about reopening Alcatraz as a working prison, Bondi and Burgum joined Fox News correspondent David Spunt to visit \"the Rock\" to receive a briefing on the site and assess the 91-year-old former federal prison's infrastructure. The visit, which included walk-throughs of the main cell blocks and off-limits areas normally closed to the public, was a fact-finding mission and not an official announcement of reopening. Bondi and Burgum spent several hours inspecting the crumbling infrastructure while discussing the island’s potential for future federal use. They toured the prison and surrounding island, met with National Park Service (NPS) officials and directed staff to collaborate on a preliminary plan to rehabilitate the complex. The island is managed by the NPS under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. If reactivated, it would be operated by the Bureau of Prisons, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). \"So many people remember Al Capone, but this isn’t about the past. It’s about what Alcatraz could be again,\" Spunt reported from the island. \"They believe, along with their boss, the president, that this may be the symbol of law and order this administration is looking for.\" Alcatraz operated as a federal prison from 1934 to 1963, originally operating as a military prison in the 1850s. The name derives from \"Alcatraces\" after Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala's 1775 exploration mission of San Francisco Bay. While its etymology has inspired debate, the Bureau of Prisons contends it most likely means \"pelican\" or \"strange bird.\"LEGAL EXPERTS SAY TRUMP CAN DEFINITELY REOPEN ALCATRAZ, BUT COULD FACE 'AVALANCHE OF LAWSUITS' Alcatraz as a federal prison had a maximum capacity of 336 inmates, plus over 150 staff members and their families. At its peak in the early 1960s, the prison’s operating cost per inmate was over $10 per day, nearly double the national average, according to Bureau of Prisons data. \"This is a terrific facility,\" Bondi said. \"It needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\" Bondi told Fox News the prison could theoretically hold a range of offenders, including \"violent criminals, federal predators and illegal aliens.\" She emphasized the symbolic value of its isolation and reputation for strict control. Burgum said the goal is to evaluate the feasibility of restoring Alcatraz to its original use. \"It’s a federal property. Its original use was a prison. We’re here to take a look at whether it can serve that purpose again,\" he said. The island in San Franciso Bay poses serious logistical challenges. Alcatraz has no direct power or water lines from the California mainland more than a mile away, and over 1 million gallons of water per month were once ferried in. Restoration would also require major upgrades to meet modern codes, including ADA compliance, environmental regulations and approval from the Bureau of Prisons and federal courts. The DOJ this week sent letters to California sheriffs seeking information on undocumented migrants being released from state prisons. An administration official noted to Fox News Digital that while these letters reflect the DOJ’s ongoing public safety mission, they are not directly related to the Alcatraz review. Not everyone is on board. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in Congress, called the initiative \"the stupidest yet\" from Trump. The administration has not announced a timeline for a decision. Bondi and Burgum will report their findings to the president before any formal steps are taken. After its closure in 1963 due to high costs and decaying infrastructure, Alcatraz reopened to the public in 1973 under the Department of the Interior. It is now one of the most visited national parks in the country, drawing more than 1.5 million tourists annually. That popularity could become a factor in any decision to return it to a secured corrections site. Alcatraz has long captured the American imagination. Between 1934 and 1963, 14 escape attempts involving 36 men were recorded, but the Bureau of Prisons maintains that no escapee ever made it to freedom. Officials believe that frigid, high currents may have claimed the lives of those who vanished.

If convicted, those charged face up to three years in jail and fines up to $50,000.\n\nRenee Hessling, who represents defendant Taylor McCann, said legal teams needed more time to review materials.\n\nDozens of supporters of the group of protesters — dubbed the “Stanford 12” by activists — gathered outside the courthouse but were met with a heavy law enforcement presence. Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies arrived hours before the hearing and appeared to outnumber the crowd. A white detention bus was parked out front.\n\nDeputies enforced court restrictions strictly on Thursday, handing out copies of a standing order to supporters and members of the media that bans protests, broadcasting or photography on courthouse property.\n\nUnlike a previous hearing in May, where deputies threatened arrests, the crowd Thursday dispersed quietly, without chants or rallies.\n\nA photojournalist from this news organization was warned not to take photos on courthouse property, including the parking lot.\n\nSanta Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen announced in May that the 12 individuals would face charges in connection with the June 5 incident, which prosecutors allege caused between $360,000 and $1 million in property damage.\n\nAuthorities said the group barricaded themselves inside university offices as part of a broader campus demonstration demanding that Stanford divest from companies tied to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.\n\nA spokesperson for Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine said prosecution of the activists sends a dangerous signal.\n\n“We call on the District Attorney to immediately drop these charges. This is a blatant misuse of judicial resources and a disturbing attempt to criminalize dissent,” the group said in a statement. “Prosecuting peaceful protestors sends a chilling message and echoes the kind of anti-democratic, (Donald) Trump-style attacks on free speech that have no place in our community.”\n\nAttorneys for several defendants also pushed back in a joint statement.\n\nHessling, Dana Fite, Brendan Barrett and Leah Gillis — who respectively represent defendants McCann, Cameron Pennington, Isabel Terrazas and Maya Burke — said the protest was consistent with a long history of peaceful civil disobedience on campus.\n\n“This is a unique time in our society where young people recognize a call to action for moral conscience is required,” the attorneys said. “Just like many Stanford sit-ins in the past, the students’ actions in this case were part of a peaceful protest intended to express deeply held humanitarian beliefs.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed US diplomats worldwide not to comment on the fairness or integrity of elections conducted by foreign countries, according to an internal note seen by Reuters on Thursday, in a significant departure from Washington's traditional approach of promoting free and fair elections overseas.\nThe order, sent to all US diplomatic posts in a July 17 internal state department cable, says the department will no longer issue election-related statements or social media posts from Washington unless there is a \"clear and compelling\" foreign policy interest.\n\"When it is appropriate to comment on a foreign election, our message should be brief, focused on congratulating the winning candidate and, when appropriate, noting shared foreign policy interests,\" said the cable, which was marked as \"sensitive\" but not classified.\n\"Messages should avoid opining on the fairness or integrity of an electoral process, its legitimacy, or the democratic values of the country in question,\" it said.\nIt added that election-related messages should come from either the secretary himself or the department spokesperson and it barred US diplomats from issuing such statements without explicit approval from the agency's senior leadership.\nThe cable referenced president Donald Trump's May 13 speech in Riyadh when he criticised what he called \"Western interventionists\" telling Middle Eastern countries how to govern their own affairs, saying that was no longer Washington's business and it was looking to forge partnerships.\n\"While the US will hold firm to its own democratic values and celebrate those values when other countries choose a similar path, the president made clear that the US will pursue partnerships with countries wherever our strategic interests align,\" the directive said.\nWhen asked about the cable, a state department spokesperson in emailed comments repeated some of the points in the directive and said that this approach was consistent with the administration’s emphasis on “national sovereignty”.\nThe US has traditionally viewed the promotion of human rights and democracy as well as press freedom as a core foreign policy objective, although critics have repeatedly pointed out the double standard Washington has had towards its allies.\nUnder Trump, the administration has increasingly moved away from the promotion of democracy and human rights, largely seeing it as interference in another country's affairs.\nFor example, it has moved to reshape the state department's human rights bureau, which it said had become a platform for \"left-wing activists to wage vendettas against 'anti-woke' leaders.\"\nTrump officials have repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they see as suppression of right-wing leaders, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.","summary":"This marks a major shift from Washington’s usual push for free and fair elections abroad.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/07/18/trump-administration-tells-us-diplomats-abroad-not-to-opine-on-foreign-elections","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a1c2cbf5-marco-rubio-ap-110725.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 00:36:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":342701152,"title":"BBC News quiz of the week: Why is Kew Garden’s Palm House closing?","text":"This week saw the UK government announce plans to let 16 and 17-year-olds vote, the men who cut down the famous Sycamore Gap tree sent to prison, and Donald Trump wake a BBC reporter up for a surprise interview.\n\nBut how much attention did you pay to what else happened in the world over the past seven days?\n\nQuiz collated by Ben Fell.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk650kg4m1o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2fe3/live/177b1e10-6330-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 00:35:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":342707840,"title":"Opinion: Why California farmers don’t want to lose land to solar farms","text":"This column was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nThe Imperial Irrigation District, which provides water to farmers in the southeastern corner of California, drew a figurative line in the sand earlier this month, calling for a halt to the conversion of agricultural fields into solar panel farms.\n\nNoting that more than 13,000 acres of fertile land had already been converted, the water district asked the Imperial County Board of Supervisors to protect productive farmland.\n\n“Our identity and economy in the Imperial Valley are rooted in agriculture,” Gina Dockstader, who chairs the district board, said in a statement. “Solar energy has a role in our region’s future, but it cannot come at the cost of our farmland, food supply, or the families who depend on agriculture. This resolution is about protecting our way of life.”\n\nThe Imperial Valley conflict is one manifestation of an increasingly sharp debate within California’s $60 billion agricultural sector — the largest of any state — over what should happen as the acreage devoted to crops and livestock shrinks.\n\nThe state Department of Conservation says that agricultural lands declined by more than 1.6 million acres between 1984 and 2018, averaging 47,000 acres a year. The most productive land experienced the largest decline. Urbanization — the conversion of fields into homes and businesses — accounted for most of the decline, but residential development has slowed in recent years, contributing to a chronic housing shortage.\n\nOther factors, such as labor shortages, production costs and uncertain water supplies, have created what industry leaders say is a crisis. The Public Policy Institute of California has estimated that the recently imposed limits on tapping underground aquifers to irrigate crops will result in 500,000 acres of farmland being taken out of production.\n\nMore recently, President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants have put more pressure on the agricultural industry.\n\nAs farmers, particularly the larger corporate growers, take land out of production, many believe that their economic salvation lies in solar panel arrays that generate the emission-free electricity that the state wants, as it phases out power fueled by hydrocarbons.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t sit well with farmers who want to continue production, as the Imperial Irrigation District’s call for a solar moratorium implies.\n\nLike many conflicts, this one has landed in the Capitol in the form of legislation. Assembly Bill 1156 would make it easier for farmers whose lands are contractually obligated to remain open space under the Williamson Act to avoid paying the heavy penalties required by law.\n\nThe Williamson Act, enacted six decades ago to slow the sprawl of urban development into farmlands, gives farmers hefty breaks on property taxes on land they maintain as open space. AB 1156 would specifically declare that farmers can replace crops with solar farms without incurring penalties if the owner is experiencing water shortages. The bill is backed by the solar power industry, environmentalists, labor unions and many large farmers.\n\nThe California Farm Bureau and family farm groups oppose it, arguing that it will undermine the Williamson Act because almost any farmer can declare a water shortage, given the chronic uncertainty of California water supplies. Emulating the Imperial Irrigation District’s stance, opponents say wholesale conversion of farmland into solar farms will devastate rural communities that depend on agriculture for jobs.\n\nPolitically, it’s a David vs. Goliath conflict. AB 1156, carried by Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, has been moving briskly through the legislative process. It’s already cleared the Assembly and is likely to hit the Senate floor soon.\n\nThe solar farm displacement issue is only one of many factors that will determine the future of agriculture in California. The larger existential issue deserves more political attention than it’s getting.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

He made the remarks during an event with leftist student activists in the state of Goias, wearing a red shirt and defending Brazil’s sovereignty.His comments followed a letter from Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, in which the US leader blamed the tariffs on Brazil’s treatment of right-wing ex-president Jair Bolsonaro and accused the country of unfair trade practices against American companies. The tariffs are due to take effect from August 1.Speaking to anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview, Lula called Trump’s comments a break from diplomatic protocol and argued that the judicial process involving Bolsonaro had nothing to do with trade policy, CNN reported. “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said.Lula also said that Trump was elected as the leader of the United States and “not to be the emperor of the world,\" reports CNN.Bolsonaro is currently on trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to stage a coup following Lula’s 2022 electoral win. He could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted. Lula even compared the situation to Trump’s own legal troubles, saying, “If Trump was Brazilian and if he did what happened at Capitol Hill, he’d also be on trial in Brazil. And possibly he would have violated the Constitution. According to justice, he would also be arrested if he had done that here in Brazil.”Initially, Lula said he believed Trump’s post was fake. “It was very unpleasant,” he told CNN. “I thought it was fake news.”The Brazilian government has vowed to respond with reciprocal tariffs if Trump follows through. “Brazil is to take care of Brazil and take care of the Brazilian people, and not to take care of the interests of the others,” Lula said. “Brazil will not accept anything imposed on it. We accept negotiation and not imposition.”The situation marks one of the first strong pushbacks to Trump’s recent wave of tariff threats. Over 20 other countries have received similar letters this month, but Brazil stands out due to its significant trade relationship with the US. Lula, who is in his third non-consecutive term as president, also reiterated his government’s intention to regulate and tax foreign tech companies. “We are going to regulate and tax US tech firms,” he said, blaming them for promoting violence and misinformation “under the argument of freedom of expression.”Brazil’s foreign relations minister Mauro Vieira said there had been no direct communication between Lula and Trump so far, but confirmed Lula was open to talks. “If the circumstances are given, they will speak,” Vieira said, as reported by CNN Brasil.Furthermore, Lula indicated a willingness to find common ground. “The best thing in the world is for us to sit around a table and talk,” he told CNN. “If President Trump is willing to take seriously the negotiations underway between Brazil and the US, then I’ll be open-minded to negotiate whatever may be necessary.”Meanwhile, tensions escalated further as the US announced an investigation into what it called “unfair” trade practices by Brazil. According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the probe will focus on issues including digital trade, electronic payments, tariffs, corruption, and intellectual property rights.Lula is expected to deliver a televised address to the nation later on Thursday, in which he is likely to elaborate on Brazil’s stance and outline possible next steps in the growing trade dispute.At home, the political tension seems to be working in Lula’s favour. His approval ratings have recently seen an uptick as many Brazilians support his firm stand in defending national interests.","summary":"Brazilian President Lula da Silva has strongly criticized US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, asserting Brazil's sovereignty and rejecting foreign interference. Lula accused US tech firms of spreading misinformation and announced plans to regulate and tax them.

The decision allowed Conner to retain her crown, although she had to undergo rehab following the controversy.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, O'Donnell called him the \"snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie.\" She also referenced his successful father, noting Trump was \"not a self-made man.\"\n\nIn an interview with People, Trump fired back at O'Donnell and described her as \"a real loser\" and \"a woman out of control.\"Trump Mentioned O'Donnell Multiple Times on XTrump and O'Donnell became increasingly entrenched in conflict in the years that followed by taking their feud online.\n\nIn 2011, Trump dropped an insult when the comedian announced her engagement to her then-girlfriend, Michelle Rounds.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love, whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie–a true loser,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe tweet prompted O'Donnell to call him an \"a--.\"\n\nAlthough Trump wished her well when she suffered a heart attack in 2012, he fueled their feud again when he commented on O'Donnell's 50-pound weight loss the following year.\n\n\"I did what many women do, and I did not take care of myself,\" she said during an American Heart Association luncheon in Detroit, Michigan. \"And that's why I'm here, to try to get women to know you're worth it, take care of yourself, and know the symptoms.\"\n\nTrump reacted to her speech the following month, stating: \"Rosie O'Donnell just said she felt 'shame' at being fat-not politically correct! She killed Star Jones for weight loss surgery, just had it!\"Trump Commented on O'Donnell and Her Stint on 'The View'A few years after O'Donnell left The View following a heated argument with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, ABC announced she would return to the show in September 2014.\n\nTrump initially said it was a \"good move\" on the network's part, but he later tweeted, \"Rosie is back on The View, which tells you how desperate they must be. It is the standard short-term fix and long-term disaster.\"\n\nHe added: \"Rosie is crude, rude, obnoxious, and dumb – other than that, I like her very much!\"\n\nFollowing her reappearance on the show, O'Donnell spoke candidly about the worst bullying she had ever experienced following her weight loss.\n\n\"Probably the Trump stuff was the most bullying I ever experienced in my life, including as a child,\" the TV star said. \"It was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation.\"\n\nIn response, Trump congratulated her on her show before reminding O'Donnell, \"(she) started it.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Gimme a Break! alum left The View again to prioritize her health. When asked about the development, Trump said he liked the show but O'Donnell was \"a loser.\"\n\n\"Well, it's very sad what's happened to The View, and I predicted that with Rosie O'Donnell it would fail,\" Trump revealed. \"I guess the prediction is correct, but I mean she's a total trainwreck, so let's see what happens, and I hope it works out well.\"Trump Body-Shamed O'Donnell on Multiple OccasionsOver the years, Trump has made headlines for sharing body-shaming comments about celebrities, including O'Donnell.\n\nDuring the first Republican presidential primary debate in 2015, Megyn Kelly asked Trump about his use of language, including \"fat pigs,\" \"slobs,\" \"disgusting animals,\" and \"dogs\" to describe women.\n\n\"Only Rosie O'Donnell,\" he said, generating a response from his audience.\n\nFollowing the debate, Trump said Kelly hit him \"with a very, very hard question,\" adding: \"That was when I came up with the Rosie O'Donnell statement, which really got a tremendous applause. That was the biggest applause in the evening, actually, so it was sort of interesting.\"O'Donnell Also Criticized TrumpWhen Trump was elected president in 2016, O'Donnell told W Magazine: \"I seriously worry whether I personally will be able to live through (his presidency) and whether the nation will be able to live through it and survive. It's a terrifying concept, on the brink of nuclear war with a madman in charge.\"\n\nIn 2018, she joined an anti-Trump protest outside the White House.\n\nAfter Trump's second inauguration in January, O'Donnell shared she had left the U.S. for Ireland and that she would only return when \"it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America.\"Trump Threatened to Revoke O'Donnell's Citizenship — and the Comedian ReactedIn a Truth Social post, Trump reignited his feud with O'Donnell when he revealed he was considering revoking her citizenship.\n\n\"Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\" he posted on the platform. \"She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\"\n\nO'Donnell later hit back during an appearance on RTÉ Radio's Sunday with Miriam show, saying: \"So, I didn't take it personally, but I will tell you the way that he is has emboldened people like him.\"","summary":"Rosie O'Donnell responded to Donald Trump after he threatened to revoke her U.S. citizenship, further fueling their long-standing feud.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-rosie-odonnell-feud-citizenship-threat/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/s_92DkW_J/0x0/donald-trump-rosie-odonnells-feud-1752707180538.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 00:30:00","author":"Angilene Gacute","authors":["Angilene Gacute"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":342707254,"title":"Stephen Colbert says CBS is ending his 'Late Show' in May 2026","text":"CBS is axing “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” in May 2026, the host told an audience at a taping Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came two days after Colbert spoke out against CBS Global settling with President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” story.\n\n“I am offended,” Colbert said in his monologue Monday night. “I don’t know if anything — anything — will repair my trust in this company.

Javits Federal Building.Brad Lander, a city official who was briefly detained last month by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents as he attempted to accompany a migrant targeted for removal, called the hearings \"a trap.\"\"It has the trappings of a judicial hearing, but it's just a trap to have made them come in the first place,\" he said Wednesday outside the building.Lander recounted several asylum seekers being arrested by immigration officers including Carlos, a Paraguayan man who Lander said had an application pending for asylum under the Convention Against Torture -- as well as a future court date.\"The judge carefully instructed him on how to prepare to bring his case to provide additional information about his interactions with the Paraguayan police and make his case under the global convention against torture for why he is entitled to asylum,\" Lander said.After his hearing, agents \"without any identifying information or badges or warrants grabbed Carlos, and then quickly moved him toward the back stairwell,\" he said.Lander, a Democrat, claimed the agents were threatening and that they pushed to the ground Carlos's sister who had accompanied him to the hearing.The White House said recently that \"the brave men and women of ICE are under siege by deranged Democrats -- but undeterred in their mission.\" \"Every day, these heroes put their own lives on the line to get the worst of the worst... off our streets and out of our neighborhoods.\"Back at the building in lower Manhattan, Lander said that \"anyone who comes down here to observe could see... the rule of law is being eroded.\"","summary":"In gloomy corridors outside a Manhattan courtroom, masked agents target and arrest migrants attending mandatory hearings -- part of US

several days later and denied involvement.\n\nThe nationalist government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly seized on the attack, blaming neighbouring Pakistan for the massacre and accusing it of supporting militant groups that carry out attacks on Indian security forces and civilians.\n\nSeveral members of LeT carried out a multiday attack in Mumbai in 2008 that killed more

The Journal’s report, published earlier this week, claimed Trump’s typewritten note was included in a leather-bound compilation gifted to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003. The story detailed how the card contained crude humour framed within the outline of a naked woman, hand-drawn in heavy black marker. According to WSJ’s description, the image bore two arcs depicting breasts, with Trump's first name signed beneath the waist, in a way that simulated pubic hair. The line that ended the message—“Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret”—was highlighted by the publication as an alleged window into Epstein's network of high-profile enablers. The Journal cited anonymous sources who had access to Department of Justice archives on the album as part of years-old federal investigations. Vice President JD Vance Reacts The story also drew sharp rebuke from Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, who publicly defended Trump and criticised the Wall Street Journal in unambiguous terms. “Forgive my language, but this story is complete and utter bullshit,” Vance posted on social media platform X, accusing the publication of unethical conduct. He questioned why the alleged birthday card was never shown to Trump or his legal team prior to publication, and called on the public to reject yet another “bizarre hoax” engineered to discredit the former president. Trump Claims The Letter Is A Forgery, Calls Story ‘Democrat Hoax To Distract Supporters’' In a furious response issued during a televised town hall in Des Moines on Tuesday, President Trump categorically denied penning the letter or having any knowledge of such an album. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” Trump declared. He insisted he had “never drawn a picture of a woman” and claimed the writing style was alien to his own. The president also accused the newspaper of conspiring with Democratic operatives to keep the Epstein narrative alive in an election year. He lashed out at “weak Republicans” for “falling for Democrat tricks” and suggested that the resurfacing of Epstein’s archives was part of a broader plot to damage his 2026 campaign. “It’s the same hoax they ran before. Just dirtier and lazier this time,” he told the crowd. ‘I’m Gonna Sue Them Like I Sued Everyone Else,’ Trump Tells Supporters During a brief media exchange after the event, Trump said he would file a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal if it continued to publish “fake art and fiction under my name.” “I’m gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else,” he said, echoing previous rhetoric used against CNN, the New York Times, and former federal prosecutors. The president also downplayed previous associations with Epstein, calling their interactions “nothing more than dinner party hellos.” Sources inside the White House legal team told this publication that no formal complaint had yet been filed, but that staff were “reviewing legal options” on grounds of reputational harm. The Journal has so far stood by its reporting and issued a brief statement reaffirming its sources and journalistic integrity. “This is a matter of public interest. Our report is based on primary documents reviewed by multiple federal investigators over a decade,” a spokesperson for WSJ said. The document in question is believed to be part of a sealed archive once reviewed during the Maxwell case and now surfacing again due to FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) advocacy from independent watchdog groups. As for whether the letter was ever authenticated by handwriting or forensic experts, the Journal’s report remains vague. However, legal experts suggest that the publication of such material—if verified—would qualify for protection under First Amendment precedents.

My recommendation as a physician is to limit fast food consumption because the sodium content in fast food can worsen the swelling in the legs,' she added.\n\nBut she said Trump's disease is manageable. 'This not a big deal at all. This has nothing to do with life expectancy. As you get older, unfortunately, this stuff happens,' she said, while sharing other recommendations that goes along with the diagnosis.\n\nTrump, a frequent flyer on Air Force One, should also consider using compression stockings and elevating his legs.\n\n'He needs to wear compression socks that help push this fluid back up again towards the heart,' she said. \n\nThe stockings could also help when Trump is standing for long periods of time – as he does regularly during press statements, rallies and speeches, which routinely run an hour or longer.\n\n'If he's going to be standing for a long period of time – because remember, as you're standing, remember those [vein] valves aren't allowing, they're lazy, they're sluggish, so they don't allow the fluid to come back up to the heart again – Trump should use compression stockings.\n\nTrump is a regular weekend golfer at his private clubs in Florida and New Jersey, but he is not known to have a daily exercise routine. There is no reason why he shouldn't be able to keep hitting the links. Trump rides in a golf cart when playing the links. \n\nAccording to one National Institutes of Health publication, there are several strategies to manage the condition. These include 'conservative therapies' like 'compression, elevation, and exercise,' along with drug treatments. There are also more invasive treatments including 'sclerotherapy, endovenous laser or radiofrequency ablation, or surgical ligation.' \n\nWithout proper management, there can be uncomfortable outcomes. 'Delayed treatment can result in a more rapid disease progression, leading to complications including venous ulcers, infection, and deep vein thrombosis.'\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic advises people with the condition to avoid smoking – Trump doesn't smoke – and avoid 'restrictive clothing like tight girdles or belts'.\n\n'Don’t sit or stand for too long at a time. Get up and move around as often as you can,' it advises.\n\n'Eat a heart-healthy diet. This includes reducing your sodium (salt) intake. Exercise regularly. Keep a healthy weight.'\n\nBy cutting down on salt – which provides some of the pep for Big Macs and McDonald's fries, along with other Trump favorites like pizza – people are able to reduce water retention, which can limit blood flow from the veins to the heart.\n\nTehrani also told Fox News that hydration, walking, 30 minutes of daily exercise, and a heart-healthy diet could help. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump was not experiencing discomfort after breaking the news to reporters about the diagnosis. \n\n'And you probably all see that on a day-to-day basis, he's working around the clock. As for the treatment, I can defer to the President's physician,' was all she would reveal.\n\nThe letter released by White House Physician Sean Barbarella, DO, references 'mild swelling' in Trump's lower legs, and states the diagnosis emerged after a series of vascular studies.\n\nThe White House disclosed Thursday that Donald Trump has a chronic condition that leads to swelling in his ankles and finally addressed mysterious bruising and makeup that has appeared on the president's hand.\n\nIn a surprise statement from the podium during a press briefing, Leavitt told reporters the president was checked out by his doctor after noticeable 'swelling' and revealed that Trump has been diagnosed with 'chronic venous insufficiency.' \n\nEarlier this week, Trump, 79, appeared at a White House press gaggle with what looked like makeup covering a patch on the back of his hand sparking concerns. The splotch has been visible on other occasions throughout the week, sparking a new round of questions about the cause.\n\nThe makeup appeared to be concealing a raised circular area of skin.\n\nLeavitt said during her rare medical update the president recently 'noticed mild swelling in the lower legs' and 'in keeping with routine medical care and out of the abundance of caution' he was evaluated by the White House medical unit. \n\nHe underwent a 'comprehensive examination' which included 'diagnostic vascular studies.'\n\n'Bilateral, lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency,' Leavitt stated. \n\nShe said it's a 'common condition' in individuals over the age of 70 and there was 'no evidence' of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. \n\nShe also addressed the 'minor bruising' on the back of Trump's hand. \n\n'This is consistent with minor soft-tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. This is a well-known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.'\n\n'The president remains in excellent health,' Leavitt continued. \n\n'Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease,' she added. \n\nLeavitt said in response to a question that there was 'no discomfort from the President at all.'\n\nShe then pointed to his daily activities. 'And you probably all see that on a day-to-day basis, he's working around the clock. As for the treatment, I can defer to the president's physician,' she said.\n\nNeither Leavitt nor the letter addressed whether Trump would have to modify any of his routines – which include frequent golfing at his private courses on weekends, and his trademark dance moves to 'Y.M.C.A.' when he addresses rally crowds. \n\nOfficials have previously mentioned Trump's frequent handshaking – Trump regularly interacts with a large number of people at White House events and when he travels – as the cause of the bruising, but have not previously identified the aspirin issue. \n\nThe Daily Mail reported on Trump's mysterious hand bruising back in February, revealing for the first time that Trump's glad-handing had brought on the result.\n\nThat account tracked the bruising from the presidential campaign through his return to the White House. It had even been spotted during Trump's Manhattan court fight in the Stormy Daniels case.\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins are damaged, making it more difficult for blood to return to the heart. It ‘causes blood to pool in your leg veins, leading to high pressure in those veins.’ \n\nThe condition is fairly common, affecting one in 20 adults, and the risk increases with age. It can lead to achy legs, a feeling of ‘pins and needles,’ cramping, swelling and itching, as well as ‘Leathery-looking skin on your legs.’ \n\nUp to half the people who have had deep vein thrombosis later develop post-thrombotic syndrome within a year or two. That relates to scar tissue that can develop after a blood clot.\n\nTrump was the oldest person to take the Oath of Office when he was sworn in in January at age 78. He has said repeatedly that his predecessor Joe Biden, 82, had no idea what he was doing and this week opened a probe into an alleged 'cover-up' through his use of an autopen for a series of commutations.\n\nTrump reposted an item in May calling Biden a 'decrepit corpse,' days after Biden got a prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nTrump has made a point of demonstrating his own physical and mental vigor – taking question after question from reporters inside the Oval Office, sometimes speaking for up to an hour.\n\nHe has taken trips to the Middle East and Canada this term, with plans to visit his Scottish golf courses.","summary":"Medical experts have spoken to the Daily Mail about the lifestyle changes they would recommend to Trump after he was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14916551/trump-chronic-venous-insufficiency-swelling-fast-food.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/17/18/100397253-0-image-a-10_1752775049708.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 00:16:37","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":342698850,"title":"World News | Trump to Meet UK PM from July 25-29 to Discuss Trade Deal","text":"Washington DC [US], July 18 (ANI): US White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday (local time) said that US President Donald Trump will visit Scotland from July 25-July 29.\nLeavitt said that Trump is set to hold trade-related talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the visit.\nAlso Read | Pakistan Horror: 15-Year-Old Hindu Girl Abducted at Gunpoint From Her Home in Sindh Province, Another Forcibly Converted to Islam.\n\"US President Donald Trump will travel to Scotland, where he will visit both Turnberry and Aberdine from July 25-July 29.

None of the Democratic amendments were adopted.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans were using the president’s rescissions request to target wasteful spending. He said it is a “small but important step for fiscal sanity that we all should be able to agree is long overdue.”\n\nBut Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the bill “has a big problem — nobody really knows what program reductions are in it.”\n\nCollins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Democrats in voting against the legislation. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader, had voted against moving forward with the bill in a Tuesday procedural vote, saying he was concerned the Trump White House wanted a “blank check,” but he ultimately voted for final passage.\n\nThe effort to claw back a sliver of federal spending comes after Republicans also muscled Trump’s big tax and spending cut bill to approval without any Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that measure will increase future federal deficits by about $3.3 trillion over the coming decade.\n\nClash over cuts to public broadcasters\n\nAlong with Democrats, Collins and Murkowski both expressed concerns about the cuts to public broadcasting, saying they could affect important rural stations in their states.\n\nMurkowski said in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday that the stations are “not just your news — it is your tsunami alert, it is your landslide alert, it is your volcano alert.”\n\nLess than a day later, as the Senate debated the bill, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the remote Alaska Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings on local public broadcasting stations that advised people to get to higher ground.\n\nThe situation is “a reminder that when we hear people rant about how public broadcasting is nothing more than this radical, liberal effort to pollute people’s minds, I think they need to look at what some of the basic services are to communities,” Murkowski said.\n\nThe legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it’s due to receive during the next two budget years.\n\nThe corporation distributes more than 70% of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he secured a deal from the White House that some funding administered by the Interior Department would be repurposed to subsidize Native American public radio stations in about a dozen states.\n\nBut Kate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, a network of locally owned and operated stations, said that deal was “at best a short-term, half-measure that will still result in cuts and reduced service at the stations it purports to save, while leaving behind all other stations, including many that serve Native populations.”\n\nSlashing billions of dollars from foreign aid\n\nThe legislation would also claw back about $8 billion in foreign aid spending.\n\nAmong the cuts are $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those who flee their own countries and $496 million to provide food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. There also is a $4.15 billion cut for programs that aim to boost economies and democratic institutions in developing nations.\n\nDemocrats argued the Trump administration’s animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America’s standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the amount of money it takes to save a starving child or prevent the transmission of disease is miniscule, even as the investments secure cooperation with the U.S. on other issues. The cuts being made to foreign aid programs through Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency were having life-and-death consequences around the world, he said.\n\n“People are dying right now, not in spite of us but because of us,” Schatz said. “We are causing death.”\n\nAfter objections from several Republicans, GOP leaders took out a $400 million cut to PEPFAR, a politically popular program to combat HIV/AIDS that is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush.
