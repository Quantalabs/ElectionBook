We are the only country in the world that does this with the birthright, as you know, and it’s just absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nTrump frequently adds “as you know” or “as you know very well” to his reality-bending comments to rope the hearers (usually members of the press) into a kind of involuntary consent. They have no opportunity to object or protest, and so he seems to rope them into his various fantasies, such as the lie that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election or that Ukraine hosted Hillary Clinton’s CrowdStrike email server.\n\nBut, no, we don’t know very well that the United States is the only country in the world that grants unconditional birthright citizenship. Not even close. According to a 2018 report by the Library of Congress, practically the entire Western Hemisphere does the same, including Canada and Mexico. Pakistan too gives citizenship to every child born within its borders, and Germany and the UK have something close — extending it to babies with one citizen or permanent resident parent.\n\nNor is it the case, as Trump contended in his first term, that “birth tourism” is an urgent national problem. The anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies published a claim that 33,000 babies were born per year to women traveling to the United States just to give birth. The Niskanen Center examined their statistics and found that, while it’s true that some women do scheme to have their babies here, the center’s numbers were wildly exaggerated. The true number, they reckon, was closer to 2,000.\n\nTrump is trying to behave like an emperor. He sits at the Resolute Desk and scrawls his Sharpie across documents as if that’s all there is to it. He has the effrontery to do so with the preamble “By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered ... “\n\nPresidential power has limits\n\nThe president has vast powers, but he does not have unlimited power. He cannot, with the stroke of a pen, repeal a constitutional amendment. And the Constitution of the United States is entirely clear about birthright citizenship. \n\nThe 14th Amendment prescribes that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” This was a constitutional corrective to the infamous Dred Scott decision that had denied all rights to African Americans. \n\nThe phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was understood at the time to exclude the children of diplomats and some Native American tribes — not immigrants. This isn’t some throwaway line that no one has ever challenged. In 1898, the Supreme Court ruled that a man who had been born to Chinese immigrant parents on U.S. soil could not be denied his citizenship even though in the years after his birth, Congress had passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nAs Judge John C. Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, noted last week in a ruling temporarily blocking Trump’s order, “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” He even directed some ire at Trump administration lawyers, saying, “Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”\n\nThe assault on birthright citizenship is more than an overzealous assault on immigration; it is part of Trump’s ongoing attempt to limit membership in the American family. He rose to political prominence by calling the first Black president’s citizenship into question, bullied Black lawmakers with the taunt that they should go back to where they came from and lamented that we are not attracting more immigrants from places like Norway. Not subtle.\n\nThose who approve of Trump’s approach (even if they acknowledge that he should do this via a proposed constitutional amendment instead of an absurd edict) should reflect on what it would mean to repeal birthright citizenship. The rule that your citizenship cannot be questioned if you are born on American soil is integral to American identity.\n\nThis country is not comprised of people sharing the same ethnicity and heritage. It is not the ancestral homeland of anyone except the Native Americans. It is composed of immigrants (most voluntary, some enslaved) who made this their home. No American should feel that his Americanness is dependent upon long ancestry in the land. Trump’s own mother was born abroad. Most of his children are also the children of immigrants. No, if you’re born here or become a naturalized citizen, you are as American as any Mayflower descendant.\n\nIf we were to dispense with birthright citizenship, we would erode the sense of equality that Americans enjoy and replace it with tiers — legitimate citizens who can trace their ancestry back a generation or two, and interlopers.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this country has been our ability to assimilate immigrants and transform them from whatever they were into Americans. Birthright citizenship is a vital aspect of this process. The parents who welcome an American citizen child are tied to their child’s nationality and all the more willing to contribute and participate.\n\nAs a Jewish American, I’ve looked countless times at my passport in gratitude that I was born in New York City and no one could contest my legitimacy. If birthright citizenship is overturned, what will the criteria for unassailable Americanness be?\n\nMona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the “Beg to Differ” podcast.

He faces a maximum possible sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted of the espionage charge.\n\nRogers appeared Friday in court, where a magistrate judge at the request of prosecutors ordered him temporarily detained without bond pending an arraignment and detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nA Federal Reserve declined to comment to CNBC when asked about Rogers' arrest.\n\nThe case was announced on the same day that the White House said that President Donald Trump would impose tariffs on China, as well as on Canada and Mexico, on Saturday.\n\nRogers worked as a senior advisor in the international finance division of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2010 until 2021, U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nAs part of that job, he \"was entrusted with confidential FRB information,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nRogers since 2018 allegedly exploited his employment \"by soliciting trade-secret information regarding proprietary economic data sets, deliberations about tariffs targeting China, briefing books for designated governors, and sensitive information about Federal Open Market Committee ... deliberations and forthcoming announcements,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nThe FOMC is responsible for setting the federal funds rate — the interest rate banks charge one another for short-term loans. FOMC decisions on that rate can significantly affect U.S. financial markets.\n\nThe indictment accuses him of passing that information electronically from his personal email, in violation of Fed policy, or printing it out prior to traveling to China to meet with co-conspirators.\n\n\"Under the guise of teaching 'classes,' Rogers met with his co-conspirators in hotel rooms in China where he conveyed sensitive, trade-secret information that belonged to the FRB and the FOMC,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nRogers in 2023 was paid about $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university, the indictment notes.\n\nThe indictment alleges that in February 2020, in response to questioning by the Fed's inspector general's office — the central bank's internal watchdog — \"Rogers lied about his accessing and passage of sensitive information and his associations with his co-conspirators.\"\n\nFBI Assistant Director in Charge of the Washington office David Sundberg in a statement said, \"The Chinese Communist Party has expanded its economic espionage campaign to target U.S. government financial policies and trade secrets in an effort to undermine the U.S. and become the sole superpower.\"\n\nSundberg was told Thursday that he was being forced out the FBI, NBC News reported Friday, citing two senior law enforcement sources.\n\nHis departure is part of a purge of top FBI executives and bureau field office leadership by the new Trump administration.","summary":"The DOJ unveiled espionage claims against former Fed employee John Harold Rogers as President Donald Trump threatened China with tariffs.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/31/ex-senior-federal-reserve-advisor-charged-with-economic-espionage-to-benefit-china.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108095906-17383624342025-01-31t060158z_278382174_rc207s942fiz_rtrmadp_0_global-cenbanks-trump.jpeg?v=1738362483","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:53:08","author":"Dan Mangan","authors":["Dan Mangan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":285898938,"title":"Trump puts Europe in crosshairs as he stands firm on tariffs for Mexico, Canada","text":"US President Donald Trump has confirmed he will impose hefty new tariffs of 25 per cent on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10 per cent on imports from China, from Saturday (US time).\n\nThe president also said he was considering imposing import taxes on European goods, as well as on steel, aluminum and copper, and on drugs and semiconductors.\n\n“Am I going to impose tariffs on the European Union?

The FAA and Justice Department later came back online.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order this week that stated only the genders male and female are to be recognized by the federal government. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) distributed a memo, obtained by NBC News, ordering that all federal government references to “gender ideology” be removed by 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the duration of any website changes.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it removed its data portal to satisfy Trump administration orders. The data page will eventually return, the CDC said.\n\nA notice on the data homepage said: “Data.CDC.gov is temporarily offline in order to comply with Executive Order 14168 Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government and the OPM notice dated January 29, 2025, ‘Initial Guidance Regarding President Trump’s Executive Order Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (Defending Women).”\n\n“The website will resume operations once in compliance,” the notice said.\n\nThe Trump administration has already removed dozens of webpages across federal health agencies, including many at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe main HIV page, a hub for HIV data, resources for health care providers, pages on racial disparities, another on transgender people, gay and bisexual men, and information about ongoing youth risk behaviors and details about the federal “Ending the HIV Epidemic” plan were scrubbed by Friday.\n\nAlso down on Friday were several webpages for the U.S. Agency for International Development, tasked with administering foreign, distributing medicine abroad and helping to thwart disease outbreaks.\n\nAt the same time, federal employees were working to comply with orders prohibiting the support of DEI efforts within the military and across civilian agencies, including the elimination of resource groups and any celebration of cultural awareness, according to memos and emails.\n\nThe Health and Human Services web destination reproductiverights.gov, which contained information on reproductive care, including abortion, is among the destination pages that were removed.\n\nThe CDC began removing content related to gender identity on Friday, according to one government staffer. HIV-related pages were apparently caught up in that action.\n\nA Wednesday email from Charles Ezell, the acting director of the U.S. office of personnel management, titled “Defending Women,” told subordinates not to promote “gender ideology” — a term often used by conservative groups to describe what they consider “woke” views on sex and gender.\n\nThe email said the employees are to recognize only two sexes, male and female, according to a memo, obtained by NBC News.\n\nAmong the CDC pages missing on Friday was one with information on contraception and emergency contraception. Information on contraception and the abortion pill, or mifepristone tablets, can still be found on CDC webpages through more detailed searches, but those main landing pages have been made to appear blank and might halt users seeking more background on the topics.\n\nIn a December interview, Trump said he “probably” would not restrict the availability of medication abortions during his second term in the White House.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSome government webpages briefly went dark Friday after federal agencies were told&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Federal Websites Temporarily Shut Down to Comply with Trump&#8217;s DEI Directive first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/federal-websites-temporarily-shut-down-to-comply-with-trumps-dei-directive/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-01/250124-CDC-Atlanta-aa-1246-fad017.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:29:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":285894626,"title":"EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Ellen DeGeneres's cold Cotswolds welcome from heiress over planning clash when building extension to her farmhouse","text":"Back in California she had surf, sunshine and wineries – not to mention Harry and Meghan as neighbours – only to sell her home for £25.6million and start a new life in the UK after Donald Trump's election victory last year.\n\nBut might Ellen DeGeneres now regret her decision? I can disclose that, just a couple of weeks after she made a trip back to Montecito, the retired chat show host is in peril of getting on the wrong side of heiress Rosie Pearson, the youngest of the late Viscount Cowdray's six offspring.\n\nIt transpires that Ellen, 67, committed a 'technical breach' when building a single-storey extension to the Cotswolds farmhouse she and her wife, Ally McBeal star Portia de Rossi, who yesterday celebrated her 52nd birthday, now call home.\n\nEllen snapped up the property in June for £15million – some £2.5million over the asking price.\n\nThe proposed work might sound unexceptional. But three parish councillors – including Rosie, 65 – feared that it could disturb Roman remains, which prompted them to contact local planning enforcement officers.\n\n'The onus is on the owner to report any historic remains uncovered,' records a note from the parish council minutes.\n\nIt adds: 'Concern was expressed by residents that the hedge and wire fence could increase flood risk in the village' if rubbish was swept down and 'caught on the fence', thereby 'limiting flow across the field'. \n\nEllen, who retired last year after a challenging period in which she was accused of creating a 'toxic' on-set atmosphere, might have hoped for a gentler embrace in the Cotswolds, where residents include Kate Moss, Jeremy Clarkson and, from time to time, the Beckhams.\n\nThe comedienne, who reportedly sold another of her many properties in California for a staggering £77million, should be consoled by the verdict of the district council, whose spokesman tells me the Roman remains are, in fact, more than 200 yards from their property, and that Ellen's work was 'completed to a high standard'.\n\nPerhaps, in time, she and Portia will bond with Rosie, who has her own experiences of trying to create a new life far from home.\n\nShe moved to Jamaica, marrying Palma Taylor, a Rastafarian known as Dr Dread, in 1988.\n\nThe couple had two daughters before parting – after which Rosie fell in love again, this time with the Cotswolds.\n\nWill Pippa's nursery be fit for royalty?\n\nThe royals are often in a conundrum of where to send their children to school, and I hear the Princess of Wales's sister Pippa Middleton, 41, and her husband James Matthews are planning a way to get such tots off to a flying start.\n\nThe couple have opened discussions with locals in Berkshire about creating a childcare centre on their 77-acre farm, which hedgefund boss Matthews, 49, bought for £1.5million in 2020.\n\n'Bucklebury Farm is considering opening a nursery for children aged nine months to five years,' they wrote online, adding: 'We'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions – let us know what you think.'\n\nAny takers?\n\nThe smart set's talking about... Thatchers at war as Mark sells Maggie mementoes\n\nThese days Sir Mark Thatcher leads a discreet life, far from the attention that accompanied his every move during the eleven years his mother was prime minister.\n\nBut next Thursday he'll edge back towards the spotlight when some of his parents' most cherished possessions go under the hammer.\n\nThe glare of publicity may, though, be the least of his worries – judging by the yelp of horror from his twin sister, the redoubtable Carol. 'This is the first I have heard of this auction,' she assures me. 'May I say emphatically that it is absolutely nothing to do with me.'\n\nDan Hunt, of Sloane Street Auctions, declines to comment, beyond saying that the 29 lots include a 'very beautiful opal brooch', bearing an estimate of between £5,000 and £8,000, and a portrait of the Iron Lady – which graced the sitting room in Chester Square when she and Sir Denis retired to Belgravia – is expected to go for £15,000.\n\nPerhaps Carol, who munched kangaroo testicles on her way to I'm A Celebrity victory in 2005, will bid for another lot – a cartoon by my esteemed Mail On Sunday colleague Mac. It was inspired by the dramatic time in early 1982 when Mark competed in the Paris-Dakar rally and went missing for six days – not quite long enough, Carol might playfully reflect...\n\nPaint it brown! Georgia May Jagger reveals her special seaweed facial\n\nRolling Stones fans can't get any satisfaction now the band have reportedly scrapped their 2025 European tour, but the show goes on for Sir Mick Jagger's enterprising daughter Georgia May.\n\nThe Burberry model, who welcomed her first child Dean Jagger Sedlick in September, hosted a celebration of her skincare line May Botanicals' collaboration with Treehouse Hotel London at the Madera restaurant in Fitzrovia this week.\n\nDuring her stay at the hotel, Georgia, 33, had a moment of relaxation in a seaweed sheet from her range, which contains natural anti-inflammatory ingredients.\n\nThe fashion star set up May Botanicals after experiencing her own challenges with sensitive skin and eczema. 'I spent four years perfecting the range,' she has previously revealed. 'The ethos is to have something that looks glamorous but is made from very simple ingredients and it's made in England.'\n\nPrince Harry has always credited his red hair to Princess Diana's side of the family.\n\nBut will the duke, 40, suffer the same fate as his uncle Earl Spencer in losing his signature look?\n\n'My hair started to transition in about 2007 from red to what I like to call 'ash blond',' the earl, 60, reveals.\n\nAnd the transition didn't go unnoticed. 'I was at a literary lunch and a gossip columnist said, 'He's so vain, he's dying his hair blond!' That was the first I knew it was changing colour.'\n\nWhile the earl's redhead days are long behind him, he is currently enjoying a flush of youth from his archaeologist girlfriend and podcast co-star Dr Cat Jarman, 18 years his junior.\n\nVeggie Anais and a party meat feast\n\nHas Anais Gallagher had a change of heart when it comes to her vegetarianism?\n\nThe model daughter of Oasis star Noel Gallagher and his ex-wife Meg Matthews turned 25 this week, celebrating at Lemonia restaurant in Primrose Hill with friends and, of course, her boyfriend Callum Scott Howells.\n\nBut was her former love, Channel 5's A Taste Of The Country farmer and chef Julius Roberts, there in spirit? The menu offered chicken, calf's liver and lamb – unthinkable a few years ago when Anais was the face of Peta's 'meat-free revolution' campaign.\n\nAt the time she was photographed penning posters urging people to 'Go veg'. And she declared: 'My dog Ziggy is like my best friend. If you wouldn't eat your pets, why would you eat another animal?'.\n\nBut clearly Anais changes her tune on special occasions.\n\nDuke's Goodwood mission for Tom\n\nThe Duke of Richmond hopes that the next time his pal Tom Cruise jets into his 12,000-acre estate in Chichester, West Sussex, it'll be longer than a flying visit.\n\nThe actor, 62, almost brought the last day of the duke's Goodwood Festival of Speed to a grinding halt as he was helicoptered on to the grounds before dashing off to watch the Wimbledon men's final in 2022.\n\n'He's so super busy,' the duke tells me. 'It's 75 years of Formula One, so we're going to do a huge Festival of Speed this year.\n\n'I would love for him [Cruise] to do some filming at Goodwood, but I don't think it's on his agenda.'\n\nHopefully, for the Duke, this won't remain a mission: impossible.\n\nHer father was the late 2nd Baron Erskine of Rerrick, but chef Gizzi Erskine wants to keep a lid on her aristocratic roots. 'The more I learnt, the more I dissociated from my family background,' she says. \n\n'I couldn't grasp the idea that some people were born into wealth and lived within a totally different system. But also 'high society' held no interest to me. I found it boring.'\n\nTime to Let It Be with Yoko Ono?\n\nThe Beatles are up for two Grammys tomorrow for Now And Then, the ballad largely written by John Lennon but completed by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.\n\nIt's a bittersweet moment which prompts Lennon's youngest son Sean to reflect that his mother Yoko Ono, now 91, may finally be forgiven for allegedly causing the Fab Four's break up in 1970.\n\n'I do think that the world is reinvestigating her career for what it is, and she's getting a lot of the appreciation that should have happened a long time ago,' says Sean, mentioning that Yoko recently had an 'incredible show at Tate Modern'.\n\n'I think her time has come, for sure.' Time, after 55 years, to say: Let It Be?\n\n(Very) modern manners \n\nAs a man of faith, Boyzone's Shane Lynch does not fear those who take umbrage with his anti-LGBT views.\n\n'There are a lot of cancellations coming for me as life spreads deeper into unbiblical territory,' he tells me.\n\nThe singer once shared an online post calling the pride flag an 'insult to God'.\n\nHe adds: 'I love my Lord Jesus. He won't cancel me.","summary":"EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: It transpires that Ellen, 67, committed a 'technical breach' when building a single-storey extension to the Cotswolds farmhouse she and her wife now call home.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14348637/EDEN-CONFIDENTIAL-Ellen-DeGeneres-Cotswolds-welcome.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/00/94743653-0-image-m-19_1738369187555.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:28:31","author":"Editor,Stephanie Takyi","authors":["Editor","Stephanie Takyi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.273},{"id":285894896,"title":"Voters want Labour to create Trump-style department for slashing waste and wokery, poll finds ","text":"Voters want Labour to create Trump-style department for slashing waste and wokery, poll finds \n\nPODCAST: On Welcome to MAGAland - Trump’s response to the tragic D.C plane crash, plus is project 2025 really a myth?\n\nBy DAVID CHURCHILL CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT\n\nPublished: 00:19 GMT, 1 February 2025 | Updated: 00:25 GMT, 1 February 2025\n\nVoters want Labour to create a Donald Trump-style department for slashing waste and wokery, a poll has found.\n\nNearly two-thirds say they back the idea of a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ (DOGE) to cut billions of pounds of spending on bureaucracy and ‘non-jobs’ such as diversity and inclusion officers.\n\nSome 66 per cent said improving efficiency should be Sir Keir Starmer’s main priority, rather than cutting spending on public services (18 per cent) or hiking taxes (7 per cent). \n\nNearly two-thirds back a Donald Trump-style 'Department of Government Efficiency' to cut waste and wokery, a poll has found\n\nSome 66 per cent said Sir Keir Starmer's main priority should be improving efficiency, rather than increasing taxes or slashing spending on public services\n\nAnd 44 per cent believe spending could be cut by more than a fifth without affecting frontline services, the More In Common poll showed.\n\nFormer Tory Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood said: ‘Once again, the public is right and the Government is wrong.’\n\nDonald TrumpLabour\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nVoters want Labour to create Trump-style department for slashing waste and wokery, poll finds \n\nAdd comment","summary":"Nearly two-thirds say they back the idea of a Trump-style 'Department of Government Efficiency' to cut billions of pounds of spending on bureaucracy and 'non-jobs' such as diversity officers.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14348617/Voters-want-Labour-create-Trump-style-department-slashing-waste-wokery-poll-finds.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/00/94744117-0-image-a-101_1738369142637.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:25:46","author":"David Churchill,Editor","authors":["David Churchill","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":285898926,"title":"Trump at odds with US military veterans over snarled Afghan relocations","text":"Washington, DC – When Ruqia Balkhi arrived in the United States in September 2023, she was greeted by a federally funded resettlement agency that helped her launch a new life.\n\nBalkhi, a 55-year-old engineer, was one of the thousands of Afghans who worked alongside the US military during its two-decade-long intervention in her home country.\n\nBut after the fall of the US-backed government in 2021, it became unsafe for her to stay in Afghanistan under Taliban leadership.\n\nSo she left for the US. During her first 90 days in the country, Balkhi received temporary housing, language lessons, basic goods, mental health support and guidance on enrolling her 15-year-old son in a local school in Virginia.\n\nHowever, when her husband, Mohammed Aref Mangal, arrived under the same visa programme in January, those services had been abruptly halted. President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated, and the US had tightened restrictions on federal funding and immigration.\n\n“It was completely opposite for my husband,” Balkhi said of the circumstances he faced.\n\nAdvocates say her family’s story illustrates how Trump’s broad executive orders might have repercussions even for areas of bipartisan support.\n\nVeteran organisations have largely supported efforts to bring Afghan citizens to safety in the US, particularly if they worked with US forces or the US-backed government.\n\nBut in the first days of Trump’s second term, the government paused the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), leaving some already approved Afghan applicants stranded abroad.\n\nAnother executive order halted foreign aid. That, in turn, has caused interruptions to the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programme for Afghans who worked with the US military, like Balkhi and her husband.\n\nBalkhi explained that her husband was luckier than most, given that he had a family already established in the US. But she expressed anguish for those entering the country without the same support system she received.\n\n“Without help from the resettlement agency, I don’t think we would have been able to survive,” she told Al Jazeera in Dari, speaking through a translator provided by the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area.\n\nSome critics see the issue as a test of just how durable Trump’s hardline policies will be when their full impact becomes clear.\n\n“My request from the new government is that they not forget their commitments to Afghan allies and Afghan immigrants,” Balkhi said.\n\nAn early-term ‘mistake’?\n\nTrump’s campaign promises made no secret of his desire to overhaul the US immigration system, to fend off what he decried as a migrant “invasion”.\n\nBut his criticism of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 had sparked hope among those advocating for services for Afghans involved with the US military.\n\n“President Trump campaigned on a bunch of stuff related to Afghanistan, particularly how bad the withdrawal was,” Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, an organisation that supports Afghan resettlement.\n\n“So I just don’t believe that he would do that and then not try to help our allies. I’m just hoping this is a mistake.”\n\nIn his latest bid for re-election, Trump repeatedly expressed sympathy for those caught up in the August 2021 troop withdrawal, during which a suicide bombing claimed the lives of 13 US service members and 170 Afghans.\n\nTrump also blasted former US President Joe Biden for overseeing the incident, which he called the “Afghanistan calamity”. The day before his inauguration, on January 19, Trump pointedly visited the grave of three soldiers who died during the withdrawal effort.\n\nVanDiver said Trump’s actions from here forward will be critical. If his administration changes course on Afghan resettlement, VanDiver sees that as a hopeful sign.\n\n“But if they don’t change anything, well, then you can be left to conclude that maybe they did mean to do it.”\n\nWhile Trump’s orders have not directly stopped processing under SIV, they have snarled a pipeline for those seeking relief under the programme, which requires federal funding to operate.\n\nEarlier this month, 10 national organisations that rely on federal support to provide “reception and placement services” received an order to stop work immediately — and incur no further costs.\n\nThe State Department’s freeze on foreign aid has also gutted services for those waiting abroad in places like Qatar and Albania, including medical care, food and legal support, VanDiver explained.\n\nMost significantly, Trump’s orders have cut funding for relocation flights run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Most SIV recipients relied on that transportation reach the US.\n\n“The shutdown of these services isn’t just an inconvenience,” VanDiver said, pointing to the delicate living situations of many Afghans seeking safety. “It could be a death sentence for some of the most vulnerable evacuees.”\n\nRefugee suspension\n\nThe SIV programme is not the only one hampered by Trump’s new orders, though.\n\nRefugee resettlement has likewise ground to a halt. Under the previous US administration, Afghans facing persecution from the Taliban could apply for relocation under special refugee categories.\n\nThe P1 category was reserved for Afghans referred by the US embassy, while P2 was available for those who worked with the US military, US government-affiliated programmes or nonprofits based in the US. A third category also allowed for family unification, for those with relatives already in the US.\n\nThose pathways have all been closed amid the wider suspension of the US refugee programme.\n\nKim Staffieri, the executive director of the Association of Wartime Allies, said individuals seeking refuge through those programmes should receive the same urgent attention as SIV recipients.\n\n“There are a lot of people that helped us, who worked for the same goals over there that are very much in danger, but they just don’t qualify for the SIV because it’s got such tight requirements on,” Staffieri said.\n\nShe added that she expected Trump’s administration to have given more consideration to Afghan refugees, given the bipartisan support for them.\n\n“We expected some challenges. What we didn’t expect were these broad, sweeping strokes of pausing and suspending necessary programmes,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It feels like either they didn’t have knowledge or they didn’t take time to really think what the downstream effects would be in their entirety.”\n\nVeteran support\n\nPolls have repeatedly shown wide support for resettling Afghans who supported US forces during the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn September 2021, for instance, a poll from NPR and the research firm Ipsos suggested that two-thirds of US respondents backed the relocations, far outpacing support for other groups seeking refuge.\n\nThat high level of approval has continued in the years since. An October 2023 poll from the With Honor advocacy group found that 80 percent of respondents signalled continuing support for Afghan resettlement.\n\nUS military veterans have been at the forefront of the relocation effort. That demographic, while diverse, typically skews conservative. About 61 percent supported Trump in the 2024 election, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAndrew Sullivan, the chief of advocacy and government affairs of No One Left Behind, an SIV advocacy group, described the support as “a matter of national honour and of national security”.\n\n“It is certainly a veterans issue. And so it’s been a bipartisan issue,” said Sullivan.\n\nA veteran of the Afghanistan war himself, Sullivan worked closely alongside an Afghan interpreter when he was an army infantry officer. That interpreter — whom Sullivan identified only by a first name, Ahmadi — has since relocated to the US through the SIV programme.\n\nSullivan said he was optimistic Trump would eventually create “carve-outs” for Afghans, pointing to the large number of veterans from the Afghanistan conflict in the Republican’s administration.\n\nOne of those veterans, former Congressman Mike Waltz, has since become Trump’s White House national security adviser. Waltz previously put pressure on former President Biden to “bring home our Afghan allies”.\n\nSullivan explained he has repeatedly engaged with Waltz on the issue, and he left feeling hopeful.\n\n“He understands on that personal, visceral level, how much these folks mean to [veterans],” Sullivan said. “So I know he gets it.”\n\n‘A screeching halt’\n\nOther advocates, however, are less hopeful. James Powers, a grassroots organiser from Ohio who focuses on veterans issues, pointed to immigration hardliner Stephen Miller’s role in the new administration.\n\nMiller had served in Trump’s first administration when SIV processing had slowed to a trickle.\n\n“It only makes sense that [the programme] would come to a screeching halt as soon as he got back into power to influence the current president,” Powers said.\n\nAdvocates also worried that the years of work to grow the current system were at risk.\n\nJust last year, Congress passed a law with bipartisan support that created a special office to coordinate and streamline SIV relocations.\n\nOver the last four years, the Biden administration also expanded the processing of both SIVs and other Afghan refugee categories. Biden’s government issued 33,341 SIVs in fiscal year 2024, about triple the number issued in 2022, the first full fiscal year following the withdrawal.\n\nAfghan refugee admissions also increased from 1,618 in fiscal year 2022 to 14,708 in 2024.\n\nAll told, over 200,000 Afghans have been relocated to the US since the withdrawal, including tens of thousands flown on evacuation flights in the immediate aftermath.\n\n“They’ve got to do a better job,” Powers said of the Trump administration. “There are fair experts on both sides of the aisle, on all ideological spectrums, that will tell them there are better ways.”","summary":"Advocates say broad executive orders have hurt Afghans seeking to flee to the US after aiding its military and groups.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/1/trump-at-odds-with-us-military-veterans-over-snarled-afghan-relocations?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP22253547081477-1738352089.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:25:39","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":285894320,"title":"Air traffic controllers were initially offered buyouts and told to consider leaving government","text":"By THOMAS BEAUMONT, ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON and NICHOLAS RICCARDI\n\nJust a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., employees at the Federal Aviation Administration were sent an offer to resign with eight months’ pay.\n\nThe crash Wednesday that killed all 67 people on board an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter has renewed focus on the real-world implications of President Donald Trump’s push to slash the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThere’s no evidence that the White House effort to downsize government played any role in the collision, with shortages of air traffic controllers long predating Trump taking office.

The integrity of a structure depends upon a sound foundation. The same goes for humans. If ever there was a classic example of a man who screams the opposite of integrity — think of duplicity, improbity, disrespect, immorality — it’s Trump.\n\nI find Trump fascinating — in the same disturbing way that I found the story of the life of mathematical genius John Nash fascinating. Nash was the subject of a book called A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar, which starred Russell Crowe in its big screen version. \n\nIt told the story of Nash’s devastating breakdown and his descent into schizophrenia. Every mind is as dangerous as it is beautiful; and that’s where the similarity ends.\n\nPerhaps the reason I see a similarity is because of the highly questionable state of Trump’s own mental health. Could his ongoing demonisation of people who are mentally ill be a clever decoy? Could it possibly be connected with how he rebuffs comments about his own mental stability?\n\nWhile his intention to round up “dangerously deranged” criminal immigrants and lunatics is commendable, he has yet to acknowledge the bigger picture; but will he? Considering that 23% of adults experienced a mental illness in 2024 — nearly 60 million Americans — the dangerously deranged account for only a minuscule percentage of the population.\n\nWhether he is aware of it or not, Trump has just given his blessing to the weaponisation of mental health on a scale never imagined. He has opened wide a dangerous door that has always been sneakily ajar, namely the subliminal abuse that people with mental health issues are often subjected to in the workplace.\n\n Mental health has now become a weapon for those who want to use it against anyone they have a reason to dislike.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that many employees have fallen victim to mental health slurs and false accusations that fall far short of legitimate diagnoses in an effort by employers to get rid of them. Whistleblowers come to mind; also women who become targets for misogynistic bosses, of whom there is no shortage.\n\nAccording to US research, over three-quarters of bullies in the workplace are men, with 60% of that portion targeting women; while women bullies — often called “mean girls” — bully women at twice the rate they bully men. Over two-thirds of women who bully target women. 65% of bosses are bullies.\n\nIn many cases, misogyny is a bully’s best friend. You could say it comes naturally to them. As many as a third of decision-makers agreed that sexist behaviour exists in the workplace. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 86 women break the glass ceiling.\n\nBorderline is a word that used to worry me; now it scares me. I hear it used in casual conversation more and more, mostly aimed at other people. “She’s borderline.” To flippantly call someone borderline is nothing short of dangerous.\n\nOr “he’s bipolar,” commonly used in urban slang to describe someone who suddenly changes their mind. This is very worrying stuff.\n\nAn effective way to bully someone is to undermine their emotional disposition, or their mental health, even if that stretches to grounding them with medical conditions they don’t have. It's not uncommon in recent years to have an employee diagnosed as “unfit for work” because of employer grievances towards them.\n\nKarlene Petitt\n\nI’m reminded of the story of Karlene Petitt, a senior pilot flying commercial jets for 35 years. She received a letter from her employer, Delta Airlines, on Christmas Eve 2016, which informed her she was mentally unfit for duty and therefore banned from flying forever.\n\nHer achievements up to that point were nothing short of impressive. She was raising three young children, was the proud owner of two masters degrees and a university doctorate, seven type ratings, and had written a stack of books, including Flight To Success – Be the Captain of Your Life, all while displaying perfect performance as a long-haul pilot.\n\nPetitt had become a thorn in Delta’s side, criticising the company’s safety culture, including concerns she had over issues involving her piloting colleagues, which she had detailed in a number of emails she had sent to her bosses. In March of that year, she had been grounded pending a medical assessment by a company-assigned doctor. \n\nDelta’s vice president of flight operations, Captain Jim Graham, a few days after she had been taken off duty, informed a colleague by email that he would put a stop to Petitt’s criticisms by inciting a ‘Section 15’ — a process that can label pilots too mentally unstable to fly.\n\nDelta’s letter that Christmas Eve informed her that she was mentally unfit for duty and her piloting career was effectively over, following a “Soviet-style” psychiatric evaluation that diagnosed Petitt with bipolar disorder.\n\nPetitt, who is now retired, fought a six-and-a-half-year legal battle to overturn the diagnosis and restore her career. Two years before, in 2020, evidence in court, supported by administrative law judge, Scott Morris, suggested Delta had manipulated its process “to achieve a desired outcome”.\n\nMorris also agreed with Petitt that Delta had ordered the psychiatric review to punish her for her criticisms, which included forcing pilots to fly while exhausted.\n\nStephen Dickson, who became head of the Federal Aviation Administration in 2019 following Donald Trump’s nomination, had helped Delta retaliate against Petitt while he was an executive with the airline.\n\nDickson was aware of and approved the reprisal measures against Petitt, the judge ruled, while Jim Graham and attorney Christopher Puckett, who were “the two key actors”, subjected the pilot to a psychiatric evaluation, selecting a doctor at a cost of €74,000 who they knew would be inclined to find her unfit to fly, even though other independent doctors later testified that the examination was unwarranted.\n\nDr David Altman later testified that his diagnosis was driven by Petitt’s achievements — her degrees, her books, and her piloting career — all while raising three children under three. It was “well beyond what any woman I’ve ever met could do,” he told the court. \n\nHer huge workload suggested to him she was manic, instead of just acknowledging she was an over-achiever. Altman later surrendered his medical license to avoid charges.\n\nIndependent doctors later cleared Petitt of any disorder. She won her case, forcing Delta to reinstate her as a pilot.\n\nTrump has sent out a dangerous message to employers — misogynists in particular — who use mental health as a weapon to settle scores. This man who treats women like doormats gave me a reason during the week to look for a book I bought years ago called Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women by Susan Faludi, a shocking assessment of how women were treated in Reagan’s America.\n\nNow the flames of misogyny are being fanned even higher in the land of Trump. It’s a book that’s more relevant than ever in today’s America, as much as it is here at home. \n\nIn the author’s words: “When the enemy has no face, society will invent one.” My lasting impression of Donald Trump will be his nasty belittling attempts to defeat people whose only violation was to say the word “no\".","summary":"My lasting impression of Donald Trump will be his nasty belittling attempts to defeat people whose only violation was to say the word 'no', writes Gareth O'Callaghan","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41564779.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8965/4482829_12_seoimage1x1_9c6dec0e74324505b390154ae1dd38a8.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:23:00","author":"Gareth O'callaghan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Gareth O'callaghan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":285896336,"title":"Helicopter black box recovered from Washington DC plane crash site","text":"Authorities plan on mapping the debris in the river so they can better understand how the aircraft responded to the collision. \n\nWork to remove large segments of the aircraft from the water by crane starts on Sunday and will continue throughout the week, said Mr Inman.\n\nOver 500 people have been working around the clock at the site of the crash in the Potomac River, Washington DC fire chief John Donnelly said.\n\nMr Inman was asked about reports that one air traffic controller was managing both control for helicopters and airplanes flying in the area\n\nHe did not comment on specifics, but said officials plan to examine the controller's behaviour over the past several weeks and in particular, the 72 hours before the crash. \n\n\"Obviously we'll be looking at not only staffing that day...[but also] how many people, what job functions they've done, are they being combined.\"\n\nThe Air Traffic Control group is still conducting interviews.\n\nMr Inman was also asked whether his team is in contact with the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested without evidence that the helicopter involved in the crash \"was flying too high\".\n\nRecordings of air traffic control conversations published online suggested that a controller tried to warn the helicopter about the American Airlines plane in the seconds before the collision. \n\nThe helicopter pilot appeared to respond to confirm they were aware of the plane, but moments later the two aircraft collided. \n\nTrump has also said suggested that diversity hiring at the FAA may have led to safety issues. \n\n\"Our job is to find the facts,\" Mr Inman said. \"More importantly, our job is to make sure this tragedy doesn't happen again - regardless of what anyone may be saying.\"","summary":"NTSB officials say recorders from both aircraft have been recovered in good condition as the investigation into the crash continues.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp1jzgpdeo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/197f/live/2f5941a0-e032-11ef-a819-277e390a7a08.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:22:30","author":"Madeline Halpert","authors":["Madeline Halpert"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.567},{"id":285894636,"title":"Ruth Langsford opens up on 'difficult' divorce from Eamonn Holmes for the first time and admits she is 'embracing' being single and looking to move on after ex went public with new love","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Feb 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall plane crash in Philadelphia leaves multiple injured as footage shows huge explosion and smoke billowing into the sky\n\nLily Collins welcomes her first child via surrogate with Charlie McDowell\n\nRestaurant critic Giles Coren, 55, reveals he has prostate cancer in shock diagnosis\n\nThe truth behind rumor DC crash Black Hawk co-pilot was this transgender servicewoman\n\nI'm a celebrity who was hooked on cocaine.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:10 GMT, 1 February 2025 |Updated:00:20 GMT, 1 February 2025 \n\nRuth Langsford has opened up on her divorce from Eamonn Holmes for the first time in a new interview since they announced their shock split last year.\nThe Loose Women star, 64, discussed their 'difficult' break up after 14 years of marriage and 27 years together and how she has picked herself up and moved on.\nShortly after their separation, Eamonn went public with his new relationship with dating counsellor Katie Alexander, 43, while Ruth remains publicly single.\nSpeaking to woman&home about their divorce, Ruth is determined to look ahead and feels an enthusiasm for what's next, including meeting someone new.\nWhen asked how she is feeling now, Ruth said: 'I'm alright. Relationship breakdowns are very difficult – marriage, friendship, whatever it is – but you just deal with it and you have to move on. You can either let yourself crumble or you pick yourself up and get on with life. It's a choice.'\nRuth, who shares son Jack, 22, with Eamonn, added: 'I'm not delighted my marriage is over but I've accepted that my marriage is over, so I am trying to now embrace the fact that I'm single and can make choices that are just about me.'\n\nRuth Langsford has opened up on her divorce from Eamonn Holmes for the first time in a new interview since they announced their shock split last year\n\nThe Loose Women star, 64, discussed their 'difficult' break up after 14 years of marriage and 27 years together and how she has picked herself up and moved on (pictured together in 2021)\n\nShortly after their separation, Eamonn went public with his new relationship with dating counsellor Katie Alexander, 43, while Ruth remains publicly single\nThe former This Morning host, who co-presented the Friday show with her ex-husband Eamonn, went on to discuss navigating a break-up in the public eye. \nShe said: 'A break-up of a relationship is hard enough for anybody to deal with. A divorce is very difficult and it's very painful, but most people don't have to do it in the public eye, with everybody having an opinion about you and writing things about you and commenting things about you. \n'But that's the nature of my job. I've always had that and if you can't cope with that, you shouldn't be doing this job.'\nDiscussing being on her own again after the split, she said: I'm quite fine being on my own, but not forever. \n'When you're in a relationship, it's easy to say, \"Great, I've got a weekend to myself,\" but when you think that might be every weekend, it's a different story.'\nRuth revealed that the toll of the situation has caused her to lose weight, while she also revealed a hormone check and the end of the menopause may have also been affected. \nShe said: 'I have lost weight. Divorce obviously has something to do with it but I also went for a hormone check and rebalance, which helped. It could also hopefully mean that I'm coming to the end of menopause.'\nRuth also admitted that throwing herself into work over the past year has proved a welcome distraction from the heartache of her marriage ending.\n\nSpeaking to Women and Home about their divorce, Ruth is determined to look ahead and feels an enthusiasm for what's next, including meeting someone new\n\nWhen asked how she is feeling now, Ruth said: 'I'm alright.

On Friday, the court issued a 13-page order formalizing that opinion.\n\n“The Court finds that the record now before it substantiates the likelihood of a successful claim that the Executive’s actions violate the Constitution and statutes of the United States,” McConnell writes.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget issued the memo in question on Tuesday — an attempt to make good on a series of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump, which outlined spending priorities. Within hours, the federal government lurched into chaos.\n\nIn response to the specter of frozen entitlement systems, downed websites, and a general state of panic across administrative agencies, the administration quickly performed a volte-face and rescinded the OMB memo with a terse second memo that also directed employees to follow up with agency lawyers if they had any questions.\n\nThat quick rescission, the government argued, rendered all of the multiple lawsuits filed against the spending freeze moot.\n\nNot so, said the judge.\n\n“The Defendants now claim that this matter is moot because it rescinded the OMB Directive,” the Friday order reads. “But the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts. The substantive effect of the directive carries on.”\n\nIn his comments from the bench, McConnell took note of an X post by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in which she cast doubt on the efficacy of the second OMB memo to do away with the first memo.\n\n“This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,” Leavitt wrote. “It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court’s injunction. The President’s EO’s on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”\n\nIn Friday’s order, the judge cited the press secretary’s post, and an Environmental Protection Agency email sent Wednesday purporting to implement the original OMB directive by pausing all disbursements as evidence that the memo lives on.\n\n“Based on the Press Secretary’s unequivocal statement and the continued actions of Executive agencies, the Court finds that the policies in the OMB Directive that the States challenge here are still in full force and effect, and thus the issues presented in the States’ TRO motion are not moot,” the order reads.\n\nThe judge also expressed severe doubt as to the upshot of the administration’s actions after the initial kerfuffle.\n\nFrom the court’s order, at length:\n\nIn response to this lawsuit and the Court’s stay order, they say they have rescinded Memo M-25-13 and ceased the allegedly unlawful conduct. But basic principles of voluntary cessation make clear that alone is not enough to thwart this Court’s jurisdiction (let alone evade its administrative stay). Particularly in light of the government’s shifting actions and explanations with respect to the funding freeze, Plaintiffs can have no assurances that the government will not simply resume implementing and enforcing the challenged policy going forward — assuming they fully stopped at all.\n\n“It has said that, notwithstanding the Court’s stay and the purported ‘rescission,’ the freeze of Federal funds announced in Memo M-25-13 remains in effect, and the only purpose of the ‘rescission’ was ‘to end any confusion’ about the Court’s order,” the judge goes on. “The Court should not brook the government’s transparent efforts to evade the force and effect of its stay order or thwart its jurisdiction to resolve this continuing dispute.”\n\nIn issuing the formal temporary restraining order, the court mused that the state plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims as the litigation moves through the court system.\n\nKey to the judge’s ruling is a finding that the Trump administration’s spending freeze constitutes both a violation of the U.S. Constitution and longstanding federal law, namely, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which often blocks an administrative agency’s action when it can be shown that what the government is doing is “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\n“Congress appropriated many of these funds, and the Executive’s refusal to disburse them is contrary to congressional intent and directive and thus arbitrary and capricious,” the order reads. “Congress has not given the Executive limitless power to broadly and indefinitely pause all funds that it has expressly directed to specific recipients and purposes and therefore the Executive’s actions violate the separation of powers.”\n\nWhile this is the second time McConnell has ruled against the would-be government spending freeze, McConnell himself is at least the second federal judge to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Washington, D.C.-based U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan issued an administrative stay blocking the policy, a less intrusive manner of pushing back on the administration’s plans.\n\nIn the Rhode Island case, New York State is the lead plaintiff. After McConnell issued his ruling, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, issued a press release hailing the court’s decision.\n\n“This administration’s reckless plan to block federal funding has already caused chaos, confusion, and conflict throughout our country,” James said in a statement. “In the short time since this policy was announced, families have been cut off from childcare services, essential Medicaid funds were disrupted, and critical law enforcement efforts were put in jeopardy. I led a coalition of attorneys general in suing to stop this cruel policy, and today we won a court order to stop it. The President cannot unilaterally halt congressional spending commitments. I will continue to fight against these illegal cuts and protect essential services that New Yorkers and millions of Americans across the country depend on.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is talking to journalists while on Air Force One&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court rules against Trump administration&#8217;s attempt to freeze spending first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/court-rules-against-trump-administrations-attempt-to-freeze-spending/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Judge-blocks-Trumps-freeze-on-federal-aid-programs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:16:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":285893756,"title":"CBS agrees to hand over '60 Minutes' Harris interview transcripts to FCC","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump's ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 million over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good. Published reports said that CBS' parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump's lawyers about a settlement.\n\nThe network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump's appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. “60 Minutes” has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.\n\nThe case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump's lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.\n\nThe Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on “Face the Nation” on Oct. 6 and the next night on “60 Minutes.” The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker's question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted “partisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.”\n\nTrump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe network has not commented on talks about a potential settlement, reported by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Paramount executives are seeking Trump administration approval of a sale of the company to another entertainment firm, Skydance.\n\nABC News in December settled a defamation lawsuit by Trump over statements made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library rather than engage in a public fight. Meta has reportedly paid $25 million to settle Trump's lawsuit against the company over its decision to suspend his social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

They come as the Trump administration fires hundreds of civil servants, government watchdogs and career officials deemed insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump and enacts sweeping changes at the Justice Department and other federal agencies.What To KnowThursday's filing was signed by Robert McGuire, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee. It relates to an ongoing legal battle over the government's seizure of a cell phone belonging to Tennessee Representative Andy Ogles.The U.S. \"moves this Court to withdraw Assistant United States Attorneys Robert S. Levine and J. Christopher Suedekum as prosecutors and counsel of record on this matter,\" the filing says.Ogles is a longtime Trump loyalist and made headlines earlier this month when he put forward a proposal to allow presidents to seek a third term in office.He is also the subject of an FBI investigation into whether he violated campaign finance laws when he said in federal disclosures that he personally made a $320,000 loan to his campaign. The feds seized Ogles' cell phone last August as part of that investigation.McGuire said in Thursday's filing that the investigation into the Tennessee congressman will now be led by John P. Taddei, a prosecutor in the DOJ's public integrity division. The head of that office, Corey Amundson, resigned this week to avoid a Trump administration directive ordering him to transfer to a sanctuary cities enforcement group within the Justice Department.Newsweek reached out to Ogles' office, the DOJ and the White House for comment via email on Friday.The Justice Department has undergone a series of sweeping personnel changes since Trump took office.Ed Martin, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., fired roughly 30 federal prosecutors who worked on the department's sprawling investigation into the Capitol riot on Friday evening. The Washington Post first reported on the firings, citing two people familiar with the matter.The Associated Press also reported earlier Friday that the Trump administration is moving to fire FBI agents who were involved in the investigations into Trump. It's unclear if those agents were included in the dismissals carried out by Martin's office.Trump, who was charged with crimes related to the riot by the special counsel Jack Smith's office, has repeatedly denigrated the department's investigation into the January 6, 2021 events at the Capitol and said it was politically motivated.Smith's office dropped its cases against Trump after he won the November election and the Justice Department fired several career lawyers involved in prosecuting Trump earlier this week.What People Are SayingFrank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director and frequent Trump critic, weighed in on the withdrawal of two prosecutors from the Ogles investigation, writing on X: \"I'll say it again, we'll see corruption cases on friends of Trump dropped like hot rocks.\"The FBI Agents Association said of the Trump administration's reported plan to fire agents involved in the Trump investigations: \"Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.\"What Happens NextThe president, as well as the billionaire Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency, has pledged to dismiss a number of career civil servants as part of what they describe as an effort to trim the federal bureaucracy.Trump signed a slew of executive actions to that end after taking office on January 20, but he's been met with significant resistance in the form of lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, immigrants' rights advocates and labor unions representing federal employees.","summary":"Two federal prosecutors withdrew from a criminal investigation into a top Trump ally and the case has been transferred to the DOJ.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/prosecutors-withdraw-andy-ogles-investigation-2024540","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2578815/andy-ogles.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:10:34","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":285894226,"title":"Air traffic controllers were first given the option to take buyouts and were advised to think about exiting government service","text":"Just a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., employees at the Federal Aviation Administration were sent an offer to resign with eight months’ pay.\n\nThe union for air traffic controllers recommended to its members that they not accept Tuesday’s offer, because the FAA had not decided which positions would be included in the resignation plan. An official for the Office for Personnel Management, the U.S. government’s human resources arm, said Friday that controllers weren’t eligible for the resignation plan or subject to the hiring freeze across much of the rest of federal government.\n\nThe crash Wednesday that killed all 67 people on board an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter has renewed focus on the real-world implications of President Donald Trump’s push to slash the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThere’s no evidence that the White House effort to downsize government played any role in the collision, with shortages of air traffic controllers long predating Trump taking office. But those who’ve worked in air safety say that those who try to dramatically shake up the federal workforce need to remember that lives are on the line.\n\n“It concerns me that there are people who don’t want to reform or restructure institutions, they want to destroy institutions,” said James Hall, who was head of the National Transportation Safety Board under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. “The American people enjoy the safest aviation system in the world. I don’t doubt there should be changes in government, but someone should remember the old adage to look before you leap.”\n\nOn Thursday, as the investigation into the crash was well underway, FAA employees were among the federal workers who received an email telling them to quit and find more useful work.\n\n“The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,” read the memo from OPM.\n\nAn official with OPM, which made the resignation offers, said air traffic controllers are exempt from a hiring freeze that Trump announced on taking office on Jan. 20 and they are not eligible for a buyout even though they were sent the offer. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal government operations.\n\nIt was unclear if the controllers themselves have been notified by OPM whether they are exempt. After the initial offer went out, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association recommended in an email to its union members not to submit a request for the resignation until more information was available. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the union email.\n\nNATCA President Nick Daniels said officials had not explained to the union the details of how its employees would be affected by the retirement program.\n\n“NATCA has not received a briefing on how or whether the deferred resignation program will be implemented in the FAA,” Daniels said in a statement provided to the AP Friday.\n\n“It is not yet clear how this program will affect aviation safety workers represented by our Union,” he added. “However, we are concerned about the potential effect to public safety and the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic control system if FAA were to lose experienced aviation safety personnel during a universally recognized air traffic controller staffing shortage.”\n\nThough the new administration insists its cost-cutting will exempt public safety workers and keep citizens safe, its rhetoric and approach have been more sweeping than surgical.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the technology mogul Trump tapped to lead the effort, has said “bureaucracy is killing America” and repeatedly called for massive, across-the-board reductions in the federal workforce. Trump and his supporters have made personal loyalty to the president a top priority in hiring new workers or keeping existing ones.\n\nDuring the campaign, Musk demanded the resignation of FAA administrator Michael Whitaker, who clashed with Musk over regulating SpaceX and stepped down the day before Trump took office. That left the FAA leaderless until Trump, at a Thursday press conference after the crash, named an acting head of the agency.\n\nTrump blamed diversity hiring after the crash — despite no evidence about the qualifications of anyone involved in the collision — and alleged that former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama lowered standards to meet racial or other quotas. He decried an FAA diversity policy that existed during his first administration.\n\nThough the Trump administration talks about the need to shed federal workers, the government has been desperate to hire air traffic controllers for nearly a decade. The FAA has struggled to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of commercial flights, even as there had been no fatal air accidents since 2009. Last year, Biden pushed for funding to hire 2,000 more controllers and announced the hiring of 1,800 controllers in September.\n\nAn FAA report obtained by the AP said that air traffic control staffing at the airport Wednesday “was not normal,” with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision. A person familiar with the matter noted that the positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.\n\nDon Kettl, an emeritus professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, warned that it is likely to become even harder to recruit those sorely needed air traffic controllers now.\n\n“The fact that there’s so much uncertainty in such a short time period and the fact that the president personally seems to have blamed them,” Kettl said, “is bound to make it more difficult to hire more controllers.”\n\nKettl warned that there are many critical, demanding and high-skilled government jobs that are already tough to fill — from food safety inspectors to surgeons at Veterans Administration hospitals — and that may get even tougher now.\n\n“The fiber of government is woven throughout our lives,” Kettl said. “If you downgrade the capacity, you downgrade what you get.”\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa; Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Riccardi reported from Denver.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJust a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Air traffic controllers were first given the option to take buyouts and were advised to think about exiting government service first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/air-traffic-controllers-were-first-given-the-option-to-take-buyouts-and-were-advised-to-think-about-exiting-government-service/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Air-traffic-controllers-were-initially-offered-buyouts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:09:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":285890734,"title":"CBS News to send \"60 Minutes\" transcript and video to FCC","text":"CBS News will provide the Federal Communications Commission with the transcript and camera feeds from a \"60 Minutes\" interview at the center of a complaint alleging news distortion.The FCC sent a letter of inquiry on Wednesday demanding the \"full, unedited transcript and camera feeds\" from an October interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris about her candidacy for president.\"We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do,\" CBS News said in a statement.The Center for American Rights, a conservative law firm, filed the FCC complaint on Oct. 16.

Pictures of the chaotic moments following the gunfire show a number of Secret Service agents attempting to shield the candidate and move him safely off stage. Several of those agents happened to be women, and as questions mounted about what kind of security lapses might account for a shooter getting so close to Trump, plenty of right-wingers let it be known that they believed only men should be hired for the job. “There should not be any women in the Secret Service,” wrote the Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh on X. “These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women.” \n\n It hardly helped that the Secret Service Director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, was also a woman — she was forced to resign 10 days after the assassination attempt. In congressional probes, lawmakers took the opportunity to allege that she had not earned the role. “You are a DEI horror story,” Rep. Tim Burchett told Cheatle during a House Oversight Committee hearing. “My wife and I have told my daughter multiple times about how she is going to succeed. She will succeed in life by achieving. Ma’am, you have not achieved today. You’ve let the American public down, and if it were up to me, you’d be gone.” Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin asked if she had avoided hiring men to “meet certain targets.” The many male agents present at the Butler rally did not, for some reason, face this level of suspicion.","summary":"No matter what goes wrong in America these days, President Trump and MAGA world have the same wrong explanation","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/dei-catastrophe-donald-trump-diversity-1235252412/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Every-Disaster-Blamed-on-DEI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:05:34","author":"Elisabeth Garber-Paul,Miles Klee","authors":["Elisabeth Garber-Paul","Miles Klee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":285892430,"title":"Tice defends convicted Reform MP amid Farage’s ‘near catastrophe’ vetting claim","text":"Richard Tice has said a Reform UK MP convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend 18 years ago will not be suspended and would pass the party’s new vetting process.\n\nThe deputy leader said James McMurdock was someone who had “got things wrong, learnt from it and has grown and succeeded”.\n\nThe former investment banker did not publicly disclose his conviction for assault before being elected, and claimed he had “pushed” his partner when details were first disclosed this summer.\n\nHowever, The Times later obtained information about his sentencing from the courts, which said he was detained for 21 days in a young offender institution for kicking the victim “around four times” in 2006 when he was a teenager.\n\nSpeaking after a party rally in north-west Essex, Mr Tice told the PA news agency: “We’re a Christian nation and part of Christianity is about faith, it’s about trust but it’s also about forgiveness.\n\n“We’re all sinners, we all make mistakes, and James by his own admission made a mistake, a bad mistake, but actually he did his time.\n\n“So the system works. He was sentenced, he did his time, paid the price and now he’s shown a great example of someone who had a bad start with a bad mistake but look how well he’s done.\n\n“And what that shows actually is, we can forgive and we learn from things, but people can succeed. And I think that’s really important.”\n\nWhen asked if Mr McMurdock could ever face suspension for his conviction, Mr Tice responded: “The opposite.\n\n“He’s doing brilliantly and he’s a shining example of someone who’s worked hard, got a lovely family.\n\n“His wife’s pregnant literally as we speak, with a new baby on its way, and to be an MP is a great privilege, and we’re very proud of him and he’s doing a great job.\n\n“(He’s) really really focused on his constituents and it’s another success story.\n\n“Someone who made a mistake, got things wrong, learnt from it and has grown and succeeded, taken a risk coming into politics and good on him. He’s put his head above the parapet and we’re very proud of him.”\n\nSpeaking at the rally on Friday, party leader Mr Farage conceded the vetting of candidates had been “probably quite near a catastrophe” in the past, after several were dropped for making sexist remarks and using racial slurs.\n\nBut Mr Tice said he was confident Mr McMurdock would still pass Reform’s new vetting process, a system he has described as “getting better and better”.\n\nHe added: “We had many, many, great candidates but some candidates let us down. We had a vetting company that completely let us down, which is why we had some challenges.\n\n“But to put it in context, the Green Party, at the general election they had to withdraw support from ten candidates. You never read about that in the press and I wonder why.\n\n“So every party is worried about vetting. Every party is doing their best on vetting, it’s like an MOT. It’s good at the time you do it.\n\n“But if someone then goes out the following day, has a bad day and says or types something daft at the wrong moment. It’s a never-ending process but yes of course we’re getting better and better and that’s a really important thing.”\n\nMr Farage compared Reform UK’s rise in the polls with Donald Trump’s presidential victory in the US, as the party squared up to the Tories with the rally in their leader Kemi Badenoch’s constituency.\n\nThe rally, which heard speeches from four of Reform’s five MPs, followed a spat between Conservative Party leader Mrs Badenoch and Mr Farage over party membership figures during the Christmas period.\n\nMr Farage told Reform members on Friday that the Tories “should be bloody scared of you” as he spoke about the argument with Mrs Badenoch.\n\nThe rally comes as polling suggests the party has pulled level with, and possibly overtaken, the Conservatives.\n\nA Techne UK poll has put Reform in second place with 24%, one point ahead of the Conservatives on 23% and two points behind first-placed Labour on 26%.","summary":"The deputy leader said James McMurdock was someone who had ‘got things wrong, learnt from it and has grown and succeeded’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/richard-tice-nigel-farage-green-party-the-times-house-of-commons-b1208506.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/01/00/dba5e39d1ac0500c249fca0156d5ce2bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM4NDUzMjI4-2.78857858.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 00:05:15","author":"William Warnes","authors":["William Warnes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":285894634,"title":"Wynne Evans embroiled in new row as 'union claims it warned BBC about complaints against him while he was taking part in Strictly'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Feb 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall plane crash in Philadelphia leaves multiple injured as footage shows huge explosion and smoke billowing into the sky\n\nLily Collins welcomes her first child via surrogate with Charlie McDowell\n\nRestaurant critic Giles Coren, 55, reveals he has prostate cancer in shock diagnosis\n\nThe truth behind rumor DC crash Black Hawk co-pilot was this transgender servicewoman\n\nI'm a celebrity who was hooked on cocaine.

As she approaches, Wynne warns her with a grin: 'Not too close to Jamie [Borthwick]!'\nHe then pulls a suggestive face at the actor, behind Janette's back, as she moves between them. It is at that point Wynne makes his disgusting joke at her expense.\nSeconds later, her dancer husband Aljaz Skorjanec, who was standing nearby, asks her: 'Darling, are you OK?' She replies curtly: 'Yep.'\nFollowing the widespread revulsion caused by the revelations in the Mail story, Wynne was replaced on his morning radio show on Monday by comedian Robin Morgan, who also stood in for Wynne while he appeared on Strictly last year.\n\nProfessional dancer Katya, was partnered with Wynne on 2024's Strictly and the pair caused a stir when viewers noticed Wynne's 'wandering hand' on the dancer's waist and stomach which she firmly pulled back up, with them later insisting it was just a private joke between them\n\nThe Welsh star confirmed his departure from the Strictly live tour in a grovelling statement \nA source told MailOnline the break was sparked by the furore surrounding his comment, plus the fact he is still mourning his older brother Huw, combined with the physical toll of being on the road. \n\n Strictly's Wynne Evans faces fresh allegations of 'inappropriate' language \nOn Tuesday Wynne confirmed his departure from the tour in a grovelling statement.\nHe said: 'I've agreed with the BBC that I’ll take some time out from my radio show and the Strictly Live tour, as well as my other public commitments, to prioritise my wellbeing.\n'I am deeply sorry for the pain my inappropriate actions have caused, and plan to take this time for self-reflection.\n'Apologies to those I won’t get to see at the remaining performances and I’m grateful to my fellow tour gang for all the amazing support they have given me.'\nHis girlfriend Liz Brookes is reportedly standing by him despite previous reports they had split after she was left 'humiliated'. \nThe pair began dating in the spring of last year following the break up of his 16 year marriage.\n\nAs well as stepping back from his BBC Wales radio show and the Strictly Live Tour, Wynne now faces an uncertain future, with his travel show Wynne & Joanna: All At Sea, with Gavin & Stacey actress Joanna Page\n\nHis girlfriend Liz Brookes is reportedly standing by him after he withdrew from the live tour (pictured) \nDespite his tumultous time on Strictly, Liz supported Wynne throughout his time on the show and was often spotted cheering him on from the audience and sharing a sweet snap of them together, where she gushed she was 'proud' of him.\nDuring his Strictly stint, it was revealed that Wynne had found love again with Liz after the breakdown of his 16-year marriage left him contemplating suicide.\nHe'd previously admitted he hit 'rock bottom' in the midst of his depression, stemming from the end of his marriage to Welsh violinist Tanwen, the mother of his two children, in 2016.\nThey pair had first met on a British Youth Orchestra course, where Wynne was starring in a production of Robin Crusoe.\nStrictly Come DancingBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWynne Evans embroiled in new row as 'union claims it warned BBC about complaints against him while he was taking part in Strictly'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nBlake Lively's bizarre texts to Justin Baldoni threaten to expose her 'dragon' husband Ryan Reynolds... for all the famous lovers he's burned\n\nEmily in vitro!

The helicopter pilot, the American Airlines pilot, the air traffic controller — who?\n\nHarry Truman said, “The buck stops here.” Since Trump was president at the time of the crash, perhaps he should have been focusing more on the problem of the inadequate number of air traffic controllers than on renaming the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRobert Feigelson\n\nTest score stories should\npick new benchmark\n\nRe: “State students lag peers in U.S.” (Page A1, Jan. 30).\n\nIn the news story, the gap between Hispanic and White students’ test scores was mentioned along with the gap between Black and White students’ test scores. This leaves the impression that Whites are the race/ethnicity with the highest test scores when it’s actually Asians. For example, the 2024 average 8th-grade NAEP reading score for Asians was 282 and for Whites, it was 267. The gap between math scores was even higher.\n\nThis wouldn’t in any way diminish the story of the struggle to improve student abilities in reading and math. But making Asians the benchmark would more clearly reflect the actual gap between the highest and lowest performing students.\n\nAlso, Silicon Valley is no longer White majority or plurality. In our area, there are more Asians than Whites. \n\nDavid Baldwin\nSanta Clara\n\n$25M settlement should\npay for Jan. 6 damage\n\nRe: “Meta to pay Trump $25M to settle suit” (Page C9, Jan. 30).\n\nThis payment is an outrage. Donald Trump encouraged his followers to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and they caused millions of dollars of damage to our Capitol. His inability to accept defeat cost the taxpayers. The funds associated with suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts should be allocated to paying for the damages he caused.\n\nHow does one justify rewarding this unconscionable behavior that resulted in death, injury and destruction to federal property? The added insult of pardoning those responsible for this insurrection should highlight the fact that this person has no regard for law or justice.\n\nPay the $25 million to the federal government to cover the damages.\n\nBiden’s calm negotiation\nover Trump’s bluster\n\nRe: “Biden’s feckless policy lengthened Gaza war” (Page A6, Jan. 28).\n\nHas it ever occurred to the letter-writer that the hostages were kept alive because of the very intense negotiations of the Biden administration aimed entirely at their safety and release while Israel was decimating Gaza, Hamas, and the Hezbollah Hamas sympathizers in Lebanon?\n\nNote to everyone around me: If I ever get kidnapped by a terrorist group, please be certain not to have a swashbuckler at the table negotiating for my safety and release. I will put my faith and trust for my safety and release in a “feckless” policymaker like President Biden over a one-dimensional thinker like Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats must\nmoderate views to win\n\nRe: “Democrats are still divisive about abortion” (Page A6, Jan. 30).\n\nFrank Barry’s opinion piece is spot on. If Democrats want to win elections they can’t afford to force extreme positions on topics where the country is clearly divided.\n\n• Per Bill Clinton, abortions should be safe, legal and rare.\n\n• Clear laws on immigration and deportation for those who don’t comply with and break our laws seems consistent with jail time for those who attacked police on Jan. 6.\n\n• Passports with just two gender designations are not the end of the world.\n\n• The U.S. energy portfolio is an evolving mix of fossil and renewable sources. No one source is the enemy.\n\nForcing extreme progressive positions has resulted in Donald Trump as our 47th president and health care, the environment, truth and freedom under attack.\n\nTom Calderwood","summary":"Also: New benchmark &#124; $25M settlement &#124; Calm negotiation &#124; Moderate views.

The focus, instead, is on bilateral trade in the national currencies of BRICS members, the people said, adding that the US President may be indulging in grand posturing. The reality is that a common BRICS currency — discussed a few years ago by member states — is no longer on the agenda. The Kazan Summit, like the 2023 edition held in South Africa, both discussed boosting non-dollar transactions in context of trade in national currencies between member states, according to people familiar with the BRICS process. A few months ago, external affairs minister S Jaishankar clarified along the same lines. Since the Ukraine conflict, India and Russia are conducting a significant amount of trade in their national currencies, but even there, exchange rates are often pegged to the dollar. India and the UAE (now a BRICS state) have also begun direct trade in the rupee and dirham. India has established such a bilateral mechanism with over a dozen countries. Russia and China conduct trade in local currencies. Moscow has been in talks with various countries, including India, for a non-SWIFT system for financial transactions after it was barred from using the global financial messaging system in the backdrop of the Ukraine conflict. According to people familiar with international financial transactions, more and more countries are considering trading in their currencies after it was felt that the dollar has been weaponised, and that others could also find themselves in the same kind of situation as Russia. People in the know said BRICS members, partners and several states of the Global South are keen to trade in national currencies, seeing the impact of sweeping sanctions on Russia.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has threatened BRICS members with 100% tariffs if they attempt to introduce a new currency to replace the US dollar.

Abbott Issues 'Color-Blind' Order in Blow to Diversity Policies","text":"Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed Executive Order No. GA-55, which seeks to install \"color-blind guarantees,\" which some have claimed effectively seeks to follow the federal government's example and end diversity programs.The Texas governor's office directed Newsweek to a press release when asked for comment.Why It MattersThe Trump administration has prioritized ending Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) practices. President Donald Trump, on January 21, signed an order to end all such offices in federal departments. After his confirmation as Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth issued an order to end all DEI practices at the DOD.Some companies have also ended their diversity initiatives—most notably, Target, which announced last week that it would discontinue its DEI program and other equity initiatives.What To KnowAbbott signed GA-55 on Friday, declaring that the state must pursue \"the color-blind guarantee of both the state and federal Constitutions, including by ensuring that all agency rules, policies, employment practices, communications, curricula, use of state funds, awarding of government benefits, and all other official actions treat people equally, regardless of race.\"In the order, Abbott declared that DEI \"agendas,\" which he labeled \"new forms of racism,\" aim to \"divide us rather than unite us and have no place in the state of Texas.\"In 2023, Abbott signed Senate Bill 17, which prohibited DEI policies in state colleges and universities, including diversity offices and employees.The groundwork for GA-55 was laid out by the Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller's \"war on DEI\" declaration on Tuesday.Miller announced that effective immediately, he would direct TDA staff to cease doing business with vendors or subcontractors who \"promote, maintain, or enforce biased, prejudiced, and unfair DEI or DEIA policies based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion or national origin.\"What People Are SayingTexas Governor Greg Abbott, in a press release: \"DEI agendas divide us rather than unite us and have no place in the state of Texas. These radical policies deviate from constitutional principles and deny diverse thought. Every Texan is equal under the law, including the state and federal Constitutions, both of which prohibit government discrimination based on race.\"That is why I directed all state agencies to eliminate any form of DEI attempting to divide Texans. We must always reject race-based favoritism or discrimination and allow people to advance based on talent and merit.\"Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, in a press release: \"During the four years of the Biden Administration, these dangerous policies were allowed to infect all aspects of our federal government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, and institutions of higher education.\"Miller added: \"Not only do they violate the letter and spirit of the hard-won civil rights laws of our state and nation, but they also undermine our national spirit and weaken the traditional values that have made America strong and the envy of the world.\"What Happens NextExecutive Order No. GA-55 will take effect and supersede all previous orders.

I may be late for Chrismukkah, but still early for Valentine’s Day.\n\nSusan Mulcahy and Frank DiGiacomo's oral history of The New York Post 1976-2006\nCourtesy of Simon and Schuster\n\nPaper of Wreckage by Susan Mulcahy and Frank DiGiacomo, former Page Six honchos, is an oral history of the New York Post in the Murdoch era from 1976-2006. It is the perfect read and gift for any native New Yorker and media junkie. On the one hand, you’ll recall the stories and the characters that punctuated a New York era that was bracketed by the Summer of Son of Sam, Ed Koch’s Mayoral reign, the Donny Manes tragedy, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson, The Mayflower Madam, Bernie Goetz, the Preppy Murderer, the Central Park Five (now the Exonerated Five), the Long Island Lolita, Studio 54, Roy Cohn, and his spiritual spawn, that Page Six constant, Donald Trump.\n\nThere were the headlines, from “Headless Body in Topless Bar” to “Best Sex I Ever Had.” The Post had its share of characters, a parade of bylines that include Steve Dunleavy, George Artz, Jamie Bernard, Claudia Cohen, Richard Johnson, and the unstoppable Cyndi Adams. In a ship on turbulent seas, there was the steady hand of Eric Fettman, and the pleasures of reading our own Nick and Nora, George Rush and Joanna Molloy.\n\nAnd of course, there’s Rupert Murdoch himself who comes off neither as hero nor villain but as a man with a point of view for which he will grind every ax (and staffer).\n\nIt’s a big book, and it takes more than a couple late nights to breeze through. Do I wish there was less sports? Sure. Could there have been more about Eric Breindel, the opinion pages, and how Murdoch launched not just conservative media but also a generation of neo-cons? Sure.\n\nBut the Post was always a paper you picked up on your way to the subway and tossed on your way out. Like, And like The Post in its heyday, it’s a fun read of a bygone era of tabloid journalism.\n\nShifting to the other coast, for your Los Angeles and Hollywood loving friends, there’s no more memorable read from last year than Griffin Dunne’s The Friday Afternoon Club.\n\nGriffin Dunner's memoir\nCourtesy of Penguin Random House\n\nThis is a remarkably honest book, and a well written one. That may not seem like much, but in the world of celebrity (or celebrity adjacent) memoirs that is saying a lot. Griffin Dunne’s father Dominick Dunne was a successful TV director in the days of Playhouse 90, and his uncle and aunt were John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion. His best friend was Carrie Fisher. So far so good but Dominick Dunne was gay, was an alcoholic, ended his marriage, lost his career, and of course had to endure the success of his brother and sister-in-law. Griffin’s younger sister Dominique, an actress, was murdered by her boyfriend. Covering that trial for Vanity Fair remade a now sober Dominick Dunne’s last act as a successful writer. Griffin Dunne’s delivers the nuance of a Hollywood life envied by all except those who lived it.\n\nGeoff Dyer's Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi\nCourtesy of the publisher\n\nJeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi by Geoff Dyer has been on my “should read” list for years. The novel is essentially two novellas each in its own way can be seen as a riff on Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice. The first concerns an older male freelance art critic at the Venice Biennale who has a passionate affair with a younger woman. The other concerns a writer, who may or may not be the writer of the first story, who visits the Ganges in India for a magazine story and ends up extending his stay indefinitely. Both are witty, quirky, filled with word play, and assume a level of worldliness that is true to denizens of a certain class but rarely appears in contemporary novels. The ways in which the novellas thematic concerns play off those of Mann’s Death in Venice, adds another layer worth considering.\n\nPleasures Guilty and Otherwise: Kunstlers in Paradise by Cathleen Schine, a wonderful and charming pandemic novel that travels between the 93 year old narrators lockdown with her grandson in Venice, and her childhood among Santa Monica’s émigré community of the 1940s; The French Novel by Ruth Reichl is filled with great restaurants, chefs, and Paris – what’s not to love? The Heart in Winter Kevin Barry, an irresistible monologuist at the top of his game; and Lies and Weddings by Kevin Kwan, the fourth novel by the Crazy Rich Asians author who gives you along with a romance, the inside dope on exclusive haunts of the superwealthy in Hong Kong, LA and points in between.\n\nKeep reading!\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

That same month, McDonald’s announced it would roll back its diversity goals, joining other major companies like Moline-based John Deere and Walmart. \n\nMcDonald’s on Friday said it disagreed with AAER’s claim but will settle the lawsuit. There was no financial exchange as part of the settlement, nor any admission of wrongdoing by McDonald’s, according to the company.\n\nMcDonald’s “will remove the criteria for at least one parent to be of Hispanic/Latino heritage,” it said in a statement. “Instead, applicants must demonstrate their impact and contribution to the Hispanic/Latino community through their activities, leadership and service.”\n\nAAER’s legal challenge would have placed 2025 applications and scholarships on hold. McDonald’s said “settling this lawsuit and evolving the program is the right thing to do for its recipients.”\n\nDuring a virtual media briefing on Friday, a McDonald’s spokesperson said, “There are kids counting on this money now.” \n\nAAER President Edward Blum previously formed Students for Fair Admissions, which filed lawsuits that led to the U.S. Supreme Court ending affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald’s announcement comes a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which he and conservatives have said are discriminatory.\n\nMcDonald’s said more than 3,000 students had applied so far for this year’s HACER scholarship. The Feb. 6 deadline will be extended to Mar. 6 to accommodate the change in application criteria. Scholarship winners will be announced this spring.\n\nThe HACER program, started in 1985, previously awarded 30 college scholarships worth up to $100,000 each year to students with at least one parent of Hispanic/Latino heritage, among other criteria.\n\nMcDonald’s said changing the program’s criteria will “safeguard HACER, which has been a deeply important program that has existed for nearly 40 years and has been instrumental in creating educational opportunities for Hispanic students pursuing higher education.”\n\nSince its inception, more than $33 million in scholarships have been awarded to more than 17,000 students, according to McDonald’s.\n\nFor its other education scholarships, McDonald’s will “continue to evaluate and look at programs and evolve them where it makes sense,” said a spokesperson.\n\nThe fast food chain doesn’t expect legal challenges to its Black & Positively Golden Scholarship Program with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. That scholarship is for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities and does not focus on applicants’ identity, said a spokesperson.\n\nA McDonald’s fact sheet said its overall “position and our commitment to inclusion is steadfast.” But the fact sheet added, “As part of our ongoing inclusion efforts, our work is evolving.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/01/31/lawsuit-mcdonalds-hispanic-heritage-college-scholarships","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e5bb42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5586x3189+0+269/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Ff3%2Ffaf60476488f8b81aabac004fdbd%2Fmcdo","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:54:15","author":"Amy Yee","authors":["Amy Yee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":285895906,"title":"Washington midair crash: What we know so far","text":"Washington, United States — A US commercial airliner with 64 people aboard and a military helicopter collided over Washington on Wednesday before crashing into the Potomac River.A rescue mission had turned into a recovery operation by Thursday, with no survivors expected.Here's what we know so far: .What happened?Just before 9:00 pm (0200 GMT Thursday) a Bombardier jet operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA was approaching Reagan National Airport when it collided with a US Army Black Hawk helicopter.American Eagle Flight 5342 was flying to the US capital from Wichita, Kansas -- typically a journey time of just under three hours.Air traffic controllers asked the jet to switch its landing route from one runway to another shortly before the crash, according to The New York Times, which added this was a routine request for regional flights.Ahead of the crash, controllers warned the helicopter it was on course to collide with the passenger jet.Footage from the nearby Kennedy Center captured a small aircraft heading towards a well-lit descending plane before a fireball can be seen.Both plunged into the Potomac River, with the plane fuselage splitting into three separate pieces. .No survivorsAuthorities say they do not expect any survivors from the crash, and were on Thursday working to recover 67 bodies from the river.American Airlines reported 60 passengers and four crew members were aboard the flight, while three US Army personnel were on the helicopter, according to a military official.The plane was carrying athletes and coaches from the elite figure skating world, including former Russian world pairs champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov.US Figure Skating said \"several\" members of its community were aboard the flight.The plane pilot was identified by US media as Sam Lilley, a 28-year-old with six years experience at American Airlines, and who was engaged to be married. .Complex recovery operationWashington fire chief John Donnelly said a large-scale and \"highly complex\" recovery operation was launched Wednesday night. Boats were still on the water Thursday looking for victims and wreckage.Water conditions were cold enough for hypothermia to set in within 30 minutes, according to experts, and some debris had spread downriver into Maryland.None of the so-called black box flight recorders had been located as of Thursday afternoon, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said, adding they were believed to be underwater. .Was it avoidable?Both aircraft were on standard flight patterns on a clear night with good visibility, albeit in an airspace that is extremely busy with military and commercial craft.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said those aboard the helicopter -- a captain, staff sergeant and chief warrant officer -- were a \"fairly experienced crew.\"Authorities said the weather Wednesday night was clear, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy adding that the crash was \"absolutely\" preventable.President Donald Trump told a news conference that the American Airlines plane was \"doing everything right\" before the collision.\"You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter,\" Trump said. \"You could have done a million different maneuvers. For some reason, it just kept going.\" .Investigation underwayThe New York Times reported that staffing in Reagan National's air traffic control tower was \"not normal,\" citing an internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report.A controller was monitoring both planes and helicopters -- jobs that \"typically are assigned to two controllers, rather than one,\" the newspaper reported.The NTSB, the federal agency that probes civilian transportation accidents, said it will leave \"no stone unturned\" in its investigation into the incident.After the crash Trump blamed so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies under presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for poor safety standards, building on the Republican's wider attacks on DEI practices since he took office last week.Asked about the president's claims, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters: \"As part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine and the environment.\" .Philippines says its police officer among US plane crash victims","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/01/31/washington-midair-crash-what-we-know-so-far","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-01-31/lwdt9e5t/00036WU7P4.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:49:48","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":285899370,"title":"Mid-air collision of jet, helicopter near DC — what we know","text":"American Airlines Flight 5342 hit an Army helicopter near Washington D.C.'s Reagan National Wednesday night, sending the two aircraft into the Potomac River and killing all 67 aboard in the deadliest U.S. air crash in more than two decades.\n\nThe crash around 9 p.m. threw one of the world’s most tightly controlled airspaces into chaos, 3 miles south of the White House and U.S. Capitol. Officials were probing the cause Friday as they searched the river.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, crews had recovered 41 bodies and 28 had been positively identified, D.C. Fire Chief John Donnelly Sr. said at a news conference. He said 18 families have been told loved ones died.\n\nThe regional jet out of Wichita, Kansas with 60 passengers and four crew was preparing to land. The UH-60 Black Hawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia was on a training exercise carrying three soldiers, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nSkies were clear.\n\nA few minutes before the Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-700 series twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked Flight 5342 if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed. Controllers cleared the landing. Flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach to the new runway.\n\nLess than 30 seconds before the collision an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. The military pilot responded yes.\n\nMoments later the controller made another call to the helicopter, apparently telling the copter to wait for the jet to pass.\n\nThere was no reply and the aircraft collided.\n\nThe plane’s radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the Potomac, and the plane was found upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water. The helicopter’s wreckage was also found in the river.\n\nNTSB investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the plane.\n\nDC’s crowded airspace\n\nLocated along the Potomac just southwest of Washington, Reagan National requires pilots to navigate hundreds of commercial planes, military aircraft, and restricted areas.\n\nFederal authorities, aviation experts and pilots have long worried about an increase in close calls. In May, an American Airlines plane canceled its takeoff from Reagan to avoid a plane that was landing on an intersecting runway. It was the second close call in six weeks.\n\nA little more than 24 hours before Wednesday’s collision, a different regional jet descending to land at Reagan executed a go-around maneuver because of a military helicopter in the same area. Flight tracking sites and air-traffic control logs show the Embraer E-175 was cleared to land and advised about a helicopter in its vicinity when its automated collision avoidance system pushed it out of proper alignment for landing. It landed safely minutes later.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s crash, authorities restricted some of the airspace near the airport. Later the Federal Aviation Administration indefinitely barred most helicopters from using routes that run under or parallel to flight paths, an official told the AP on Friday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nTwo of Reagan National’s runways were closed Friday afternoon because recovery efforts caused flight cancellations and delays, airport manager Terry Liercke said.\n\nThe investigation\n\nFederal investigators will try to piece together any communication between the jet and the helicopter and air traffic controllers, other pilot actions and the aircraft altitudes.\n\nA key question early in the investigation is how high the helicopter was flying, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News. Its maximum altitude allowed was 200 feet (about 60 meters), said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear if it went higher: Koziol said investigators need to analyze flight data before making conclusions about altitude.\n\nHegseth said the army also wants to know if the helicopter crew was using night vision goggles.\n\nAir crash investigations normally take 12-18 months, and investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause.\n\nBut at a news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump cast blame on the helicopter pilots without evidence and baselessly alleged that diversity initiatives had undermined air safety. Trump doubled down in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform that said the helicopter was “flying too high” at the time of the crash.\n\n“It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” Trump said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked Friday afternoon how Trump knew that that helicopter was flying too high. She said Trump was being briefed by investigators.\n\nThe victims\n\nIt was the deadliest U.S. air crash since 2001.\n\nAmong the passengers were members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.\n\nVictims included teenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, the teens’ mothers and two Russian-born coaches, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won a 1994 world championship in pairs skating.\n\nThe victims also included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, schools and four steamfitters members of a steamfitters’ local in suburban Maryland and two Chinese nationals.\n\nThe plane captain was Jonathan Campos, 34, according to multiple media reports.\n\nKoziol said the helicopter crew was “very experienced” and familiar with the congested flying around Washington.\n\nThe Army on Friday identified two of the three soldiers on the helicopter — Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. The third soldier’s name was not being released at the family’s request, the Army said. Only O’Hara’s remains had been found by Friday, officials said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press writer Zeke Miller and Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington; reporters from throughout the U.S..","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/nation-world/2025/01/31/washington-crash-jet-helicopter-air-traffic-control","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/046c9e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5606x3200+0+273/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F03%2F91%2Fc0c8c8e34435b80085a5e80504ba%2Fdc-c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:48:38","author":"Dave Collins | AP,Hallie Golden | Ap","authors":["Dave Collins | AP","Hallie Golden | Ap"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.63},{"id":285898508,"title":"Trudeau promises 'forceful and immediate' response from Canada to Trump's tariffs","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is ready with a \"forceful and immediate\" response to tariffs that will be enforced as early as Saturday. \n\nPresident Donald Trump followed through on a threat to impose debilitating tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

An official for the Office for Personnel Management, the U.S. government's human resources arm, said Friday that controllers weren't eligible for the resignation plan or subject to the hiring freeze across much of the rest of federal government. \n\nThe crash Wednesday that killed all 67 people on board an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter has renewed focus on the real-world implications of President Donald Trump's push to slash the federal bureaucracy. \n\nThere's no evidence that the White House effort to downsize government played any role in the collision, with shortages of air traffic controllers long predating Trump taking office. But those who’ve worked in air safety say that those who try to dramatically shake up the federal workforce need to remember that lives are on the line.\n\n“It concerns me that there are people who don’t want to reform or restructure institutions, they want to destroy institutions,” said James Hall, who was head of the National Transportation Safety Board under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. “The American people enjoy the safest aviation system in the world. I don’t doubt there should be changes in government, but someone should remember the old adage to look before you leap.”\n\nOn Thursday, as the investigation into the crash was well underway, FAA employees were among the federal workers who received an email telling them to quit and find more useful work.\n\n“The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,” read the memo from OPM. \n\nAn official with OPM, which made the resignation offers, said air traffic controllers are exempt from a hiring freeze that Trump announced on taking office on Jan. 20 and they are not eligible for a buyout even though they were sent the offer. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal government operations. \n\nIt was unclear if the controllers themselves have been notified by OPM whether they are exempt. After the initial offer went out, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association recommended in an email to its union members not to submit a request for the resignation until more information was available. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the union email.\n\nNATCA President Nick Daniels said officials had not explained to the union the details of how its employees would be affected by the retirement program. \n\n“NATCA has not received a briefing on how or whether the deferred resignation program will be implemented in the FAA,\" Daniels said in a statement provided to the AP Friday. \n\n“It is not yet clear how this program will affect aviation safety workers represented by our Union,” he added. \"However, we are concerned about the potential effect to public safety and the efficiency and capacity of the air traffic control system if FAA were to lose experienced aviation safety personnel during a universally recognized air traffic controller staffing shortage.”\n\nThough the new administration insists its cost-cutting will exempt public safety workers and keep citizens safe, its rhetoric and approach have been more sweeping than surgical.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the technology mogul Trump tapped to lead the effort, has said “bureaucracy is killing America” and repeatedly called for massive, across-the-board reductions in the federal workforce. Trump and his supporters have made personal loyalty to the president a top priority in hiring new workers or keeping existing ones.\n\nDuring the campaign, Musk demanded the resignation of FAA administrator Michael Whitaker, who clashed with Musk over regulating SpaceX and stepped down the day before Trump took office. That left the FAA leaderless until Trump, at a Thursday press conference after the crash, named an acting head of the agency.\n\nTrump blamed diversity hiring after the crash — despite no evidence about the qualifications of anyone involved in the collision — and alleged that former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama lowered standards to meet racial or other quotas. He decried an FAA diversity policy that existed during his first administration. \n\nThough the Trump administration talks about the need to shed federal workers, the government has been desperate to hire air traffic controllers for nearly a decade. The FAA has struggled to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of commercial flights, even as there had been no fatal air accidents since 2009. Last year, Biden pushed for funding to hire 2,000 more controllers and announced the hiring of 1,800 controllers in September. \n\nAn FAA report obtained by the AP said that air traffic control staffing at the airport Wednesday “was not normal,” with one person doing the work normally assigned to two people at the time of the collision. A person familiar with the matter noted that the positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.\n\nDon Kettl, an emeritus professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, warned that it is likely to become even harder to recruit those sorely needed air traffic controllers now.\n\n“The fact that there's so much uncertainty in such a short time period and the fact that the president personally seems to have blamed them,” Kettl said, \"is bound to make it more difficult to hire more controllers.\"\n\nKettl warned that there are many critical, demanding and high-skilled government jobs that are already tough to fill — from food safety inspectors to surgeons at Veterans Administration hospitals — and that may get even tougher now.\n\n“The fiber of government is woven throughout our lives,” Kettl said. “If you downgrade the capacity, you downgrade what you get.”\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa; Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Riccardi reported from Denver.","summary":"Just a day before a deadly midair collision at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ap-donald-trump-federal-aviation-administration-bill-clinton-joe-biden-b2690205.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/31/23/Aircraft_Down_12898.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:47:31","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon and Nicholas Riccardi,Thomas Beaumont","authors":["Adriana Gomez Licon and Nicholas Riccardi","Thomas Beaumont"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":285890268,"title":"Here's the latest as Trump's tariff deadline looms","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump says he will impose a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods on Saturday.\n\nPoliticians and business groups are making a final push today in the hope of avoiding or mitigating the move, and the economic uncertainty that would follow.\n\nHere's the latest (all times Eastern):\n\nPublic Safety Minister David McGuinty, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Immigration Minister Marc Miller held a joint press conference from Washington.\n\nJoly says the ministers have yet to see any \"clear decision-making\" or specific details about a Trump tariff plan. \n\nShe says Canada will be ready with a strong retaliation plan, if needed.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Regina, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said it's no good to discuss counter tariffs when Trump's proposed tariffs haven't been imposed yet.\n\n\"It's our hope that I'm going to be able to say that tomorrow as well,\" he said Friday, adding that he's met with industry to discuss diverting more exports to other markets.\n\n\"We would ask President Trump's administration to not put those tariffs on and we would also ask our federal government to address the priorities that President Trump has raised.\"\n\nA spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the premier would not be commenting on the notion oil and gas may get a lower tariff than 25 per cent until after the details are finalized.\n\n\"The Premier is waiting, along with everyone else, to see the details of the U.S. tariffs announced today. She will have more to say as soon as we see those details,\" press secretary Sam Blackett said in an e-mail. \"The Premier has been clear from the start that any tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian goods will hurt American and Canadian consumers, workers and businesses. That view has not changed.”\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and his staff board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews. The president is going to be in Palm Beach for the weekend.\n\nEarlier in the evening, at 5:17, the president said he was \"going to the Winter White House\" and \"will be working all weekend.\"\n\nTrump says he will probably impose tariffs of 10 per cent on Canadian oil after the White House confirmed he was going to go forward with 25 per cent levies on imports from Canada on Saturday.\n\nTrump made the remarks to reporters in the Oval Office late Friday afternoon.\n\nHe repeated his previous claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada and said \"they've treated us very unfairly.\"\n\nTrump said the U.S. should not be \"subsidizing\" Canada, a word he has frequently used to characterize the trade balance between the two countries.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and the U.S.-Canada cabinet committee he revived after Trump's election win have been meeting for more than two hours this afternoon.\n\nThe meeting is taking place mostly virtually, with Trudeau and his cabinet ministers in multiple different cities.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says a plan to meet U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, tariff for tariff would be the best show of strength and unity.\n\nAsked what Ontario's plans are going into the weekend, Ford says there are a lot of tools in the toolbox.\n\nFord also says the goalposts are shifting minute by minute and it's important to find out what's going to happen before taking action.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says U.S. President Donald Trump will implement 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10 per cent tariffs on goods from China on Saturday.\n\nShe did not offer any details about possible exemptions and said media reports that the tariffs would be delayed until March were false.\n\nAsked during the briefing about the possibility of a trade war, Leavitt dismissed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's promise to respond to tariffs in kind.\n\nShe said Trudeau should speak to Trump directly.\n\n\"The tariffs are incoming tomorrow on Canada,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he is not sure what Trump will ultimately do with tariffs. Speaking on \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" on Thursday, Rubio said the tariff threats are “not hostile moves.”\n\nHe said Americans and Canadians have a common interest in keeping the border safe. But he added that Trump “clearly wants to address both illegal migration but ultimately also our economic interests.”\n\nRubio said he doesn’t think Canada is a strategic threat to the United States and noted his recent meeting with Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly.\n\n“We have issues we need to address with Canada. They’re good friends. I mean, we work with them on a lot of things,” he said. “We have a deep partnership with them, and – but there are some issues we’re going to need to address.”\n\nRubio was asked about Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford’s comments about cutting off electricity and not bringing a knife to a gunfight. Rubio asked where Ontario would sell its electricity if the U.S. is cut off. The secretary of state also said it shows the importance of America boosting its own energy supply.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s a reminder, when you talk about Canada, of why energy is a national security matter and why the U.S. must be able to have a reliable and consistent source of energy, or we are in a lot of trouble.”\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Rubio also spoke about Trump’s talk of wanting to purchase Greenland and the importance of the Arctic in pushing back against Russia and China.\n\nThe Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since the early days of the pandemic as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods loomed and Statistics Canada reported the economy contracted in November.\n\nThe Canadian dollar dipped below 69 cents US earlier in the day on fears of a trade war.\n\nDesjardins managing director Royce Mendes says in an analysis this morning that the loonie could fall further if tariffs take effect.\n\nAlthough currency markets reacted to the announcement, Mendes says the magnitude was relatively minor compared to what should be expected if 25 per cent across-the-board tariffs are in place for an extended period of time.\n\nIt remains unclear what U.S. President Donald Trump has decided in regard to slapping Canada with tariffs, as well as the outcome of his Thursday night deliberations on whether oil will be included in the duties.\n\nThere will be a White House briefing at 1 p.m. where press secretary Karoline Leavitt will face questions from reporters.\n\nTrump is scheduled to sign executive orders around 3 p.m. The president has used these opportunities, including one on Thursday, to answer questions from the press.\n\nTrump is set to leave the White House around 5 p.m. to travel to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida club which has become a base for Republicans and the president’s team.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is ready to deliver a \"purposeful, forceful but reasonable immediate\" response if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Canadian imports.\n\nDuring an event in Toronto today, Trudeau said that it's \"not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"\n\nHis comments come as three federal cabinet ministers are in Washington making a last-ditch attempt to stop Trump from slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian imports as early as Saturday.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Public Safety Minister David McGuinty and Immigration Minister Marc Miller are all in the U.S. capital making a final diplomatic push to convince Republican lawmakers and Trump's team to sway the president.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 31, 2025.\n\nThe Canadian Press","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump says he will impose a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods on Saturday.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/heres-the-latest-as-trumps-tariff-deadline-looms-10161393","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/02/db3654dec0c08cfc2e3ab085b43dbc442ee05e781a2b7d8a5bbf0f884932dba2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:46:37","author":"Canadian Press","authors":["Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":285893680,"title":"Trump turns aviation tragedy into new front in the culture wars","text":"He began with a sombre tone.\n\n\"This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history — a tragedy of terrible proportions,\" Donald Trump told the packed room of journalists.\n\n\"As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.\"\n\nHe asked those at Thursday's press conference to join him in a moment of silence to reflect on the 67 lives lost the night before.\n\nBut that moment proved to be the proverbial calm before the storm.\n\nAn almost instant pivot from mourning to anger.\n\nThe president of the United States unleashed a blizzard of accusations, quickly suggesting blame for the collision.\n\n\"We do not know what led to this crash,\" he admitted, \"but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now.\"\n\nHis strongest opinion? That progressive policies had allowed incompetent people into critical jobs.\n\nHe mocked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for its \"diversity push,\" claiming the agency was too focused on inclusion and wanted people with severe disabilities to become air traffic controllers.\n\nHe insisted that air traffic controllers need to be \"talented, naturally talented geniuses,\" implying that a person with a disability couldn't be one. Perhaps he's unaware of Stephen Hawking.\n\nTrump also took a direct swipe at former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, sarcastically calling him a \"real winner\" before swearing from the podium: \"He's a disaster. Now he's just got a good line of bullshit.\"\n\nHas an American president ever profanely insulted a political opponent while trying to console a grieving nation in the wake of a horrific tragedy?\n\nA few kilometres away from where Trump was delivering his tirade, divers were still in the frigid, dark waters of the Potomac, undertaking the unimaginable task of searching for bodies — bringing some level of comfort to the bereaved families.\n\nWhile they worked in silence, the commander-in-chief used his platform not to honour their efforts, not to order flags flown at half-mast in respect for the victims, but to make a political point.\n\nPolitics of a tragedy\n\nIn the face of a tragedy like this, most politicians steer clear of direct partisan attacks — either because they recognise it as distasteful or because they believe the public would find it so.\n\nTrump holds no such qualms.\n\nTo a hammer, everything is a nail.\n\nTo Trump, a tragedy is an opportunity — to play politics.\n\nTo rail against what he sees as one of the great ills of America: the push for diversity.\n\nWhen pressed for evidence that diversity hiring had contributed to the crash, President Trump simply replied: \"It just could have been.\"\n\nPressed again, he responded: \"Because I have common sense, OK? And unfortunately, a lot of people don't.\"\n\nIf it turns out that the individuals involved in this tragedy were hired despite failing to meet the accepted standards of the job, Trump may feel vindicated.\n\nBut there is no evidence that this occurred.\n\nThe employees working in the control tower that night are undoubtedly under immense psychological pressure, having witnessed and been involved in such a catastrophic event.\n\nTo then have the president suggest that incompetence played a role only compounds their pain.\n\nThe Overton window keeps shifting\n\nThe culture war over \"woke\" policies has only intensified in recent years, and Trump's instinct is to continuously fan the flames.\n\nHe has campaigned to dismantle policies designed to address systemic disadvantages by providing opportunities to marginalised groups. He argues these policies are unfair and lead to lower standards.\n\nHe is not alone.\n\nHis ally, Elon Musk, has also aggressively pushed this narrative. A year ago, the billionaire provoked outrage when he criticised United Airlines and Boeing for efforts to hire non-white pilots and factory workers.\n\nMusk even mocked the acronym DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) by deliberately misspelling it as \"DIE,\" writing on X:\n\n\"It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE.\"\n\nThe belief that diversity is being prioritised over competence has taken root within the MAGA movement. So, when this tragedy occurred, it was almost instinctive for Trump to blame DEI policies — despite offering no evidence to support the claim.\n\nA similar reaction followed the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles. The tragedy was swiftly politicised, with the city's fire chief facing the brunt of the criticism.\n\nKristin Crowley, a 22-year veteran and the first LGBTQ fire chief in LAFD history, was targeted by conservative commentator Megyn Kelly.\n\nKelly called her an \"obese lesbian\" and raged that the department was too focused on diversity, claiming it was being run by \"overweight, out-of-shape women.\"\n\nIt was cruel, personal language.\n\nYet, it says everything about how far the Overton window — the range of subjects and arguments politically acceptable to the mainstream population — has shifted in America that such remarks no longer shock the public.\n\nTrump argues that America should be \"colourblind\" and a true meritocracy, where diversity is not a goal in itself.\n\nBut whatever one's opinion on DEI programs, the most telling aspect of Trump's response to this tragedy is what it reveals about his leadership.\n\nWhat this tells us about Trump's second term\n\nIn the lead-up to his second term, there were questions about whether Trump might soften his approach.\n\nWould winning re-election — including the popular vote and stronger support from minority groups — satisfy his ego? Would he become more conciliatory, particularly in moments that demand it?\n\nHis response to this tragedy gives us a clear answer.\n\nTrump remains the same politician he has always been.\n\nHe sees every day, and every event, as an opportunity to push his agenda, to shape America in his desired vision, and to attack his political enemies.\n\nDonald Trump never does sombre for long.","summary":"In the face of tragedy, most politicians avoid partisan attacks.

[+] Florida.\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nJudge John McConnell said the 22 states that sued the Trump administration over the guidance successfully “put forth sufficient evidence at this stage that they will likely suffer severe and irreparable harm if the Court denies their request” to stop Trump from freezing potentially $3 trillion of funds and said the actions in the memo could be found to “violate the Constitution.”\n\nThe government tried to claim the matter of the funding pause was moot because the Office of Management and Budget rescinded the directive via a one-sentence memo, but McConnell said the “alleged rescission” was “in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts.”\n\nThe judge pointed to a post from Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt on X—in which she said “the President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented”—as evidence the directive was still in effect and the issue was not moot.\n\nMcConnell wrote in the ruling released Friday that while there are likely some “aspects of the pause that might be legal and appropriate” for Trump to take, “the Court must act … under the ‘worst case scenario’ because [of] the breadth and ambiguity” of Trump’s pause.\n\nUnder the temporary restraining order that was granted, Trump’s administration cannot “pause, freeze, impede, block, cancel, or terminate” federal financial assistance to the states, and it cannot “impede the States’ access to such awards and obligations.”\n\nThe memo, issued by OMB earlier this week, ordered a pause in all federal assistance “including, but not limited to” grants related to diversity, foreign aid and “woke gender ideology,” and was designed so agencies could review whether funding was “consistent” with Trump’s policies.\n\nBut, the memo did not specify which grants and funding sources would and would not get cut off, causing chaos and concern among many federal workers and grant recipients.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Plaintiffs in the suit led by the National Council of Nonprofits argued the guidance to pause disbursement of funds would have a “devastating impact” on nonprofits that receive government grants and rely on them “to fulfill their missions, pay their employees, pay their rent—and, indeed, improve the day-to-day lives of the many people they work so hard to serve.” A U.S. district judge temporarily blocked the freeze from going into effect Tuesday as part of that lawsuit, but the pause is only set to last until Feb. 3. The temporary restraining order issued by McConnell will last until further order of the court.\n\nWhich States Sued Over The Memo?\n\nThe states listed as plaintiffs on the lawsuit were: New York, California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“Make no mistake: this federal funding pause was implemented to inspire fear and chaos, and it was successful in that respect,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement after the ruling. “These tactics are intended to wear us down, but with each legal victory we reaffirm that these significant and unlawful disruptions won’t be tolerated, and will certainly be met with swift and immediate action now and in the future.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Administration Rescinds Grant Freeze Memo—Here’s Everything We Know (Forbes)\n\nStates And Nonprofits Suing Trump Over ‘Catastrophic’ Pause In Federal Funding: ‘Immediate Nationwide Harm’ (Forbes)\n\nJudge Pauses Trump’s Plan To Freeze Federal Aid Spending (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Smith - involving Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, the Covid vaccine and 9/11 - after a shock poll revealed the ESPN star has more political support than many big-name Democrats.\n\nWhitlock accused Smith of being a 'plant', citing the 'Building 7' 9/11 conspiracy theory and making the baseless claim that Disney, the NBA and 'the powerful elite' are conspiring to 'install their puppet' the Oval Office as part of a 'well-orchestrated... dangerous' plan.\n\nEarlier this week, John McLaughlin - Donald Trump's chief pollster - asked 1,000 general election voters who they would back if the 2028 Democratic primary election for President was held today.\n\nTwo percent said they would choose Smith, more than backed the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent). \n\nWhitlock claimed the system has been 'rigged' and warned 'naive' voters that there is a real possibility Smith - who he called a 'clown' a 'fraud' and an 'idiot' - could reach the nation's highest office. \n\n'There's no one with a functioning brain who would watch Stephen A.

That dependence is particularly heavy for natural gas, and any increase in prices could add to the already steep rate increases ratepayers of natural gas and electric utilities have seen during the last five years.\n\n“Customers should be worried about it,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a ratepayer advocacy group. “It could have a substantial impact.”\n\nState regulators, meanwhile, said it’s too early to know how tariffs could hit consumers.\n\nMore than one in three Oregon households use natural gas as their primary source of heating, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About a quarter of the electricity consumed in Oregon is generated by burning natural gas. And the price of natural gas is significant driver of the cost of wholesale electricity, which utilities buy to meet demand, particularly at times of energy scarcity.\n\nUtility companies typically pass along the cost of purchasing energy sources like natural gas directly to customers.\n\nEnergy markets are dynamic, however, and it’s not immediately clear how tariffs would filter through to consumers. Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, a Portland-based energy consultant, said previous spikes in Canadian gas prices have shown up immediately in U.S. wholesale electricity prices paid by utilities.\n\n“There is no, ‘What happens in Alberta, stays in Alberta’ rule,” he said. \n\nSince the natural gas currently produced in British Columbia and Alberta have no direct outlet to export to other countries, he said, a tariff effectively turns into a tax on U.S. firms that purchase it.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute sent a letter this week to the U.S. Office of Trade Representative urging the Trump Administration to exempt crude oil and natural gas from any tariffs, saying they would directly affect affordability and availability for consumers.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said it’s not clear who the president is listening to.\n\n“Donald Trump isn’t exactly consulting with anybody beyond himself and his circle of cronies on tariffs on Canadian energy or any other tariff,” Wyden said in an emailed statement from his office. Wyden accused Trump of being more concerned with settling personal scores than in targeting tariffs to change long-term behavior and cut costs for Americans, while Trump insists the tariffs are necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigrants at the northern and southern borders.\n\nDue to geographic proximity and existing pipeline networks, the Pacific Northwest is heavily dependent on Canada for its supply of natural gas. About two thirds of Oregon’s natural gas arrives on pipelines from British Columbia and Alberta, according to data from the Oregon Department of Energy.\n\nAbout half that gas is used to generate electricity, fueling about a quarter of overall electrical use in the state and up to 40% of the electricity delivered by the state’s largest electric utility, Portland General Electric, according to state reports and PGE.\n\nThere are 17 gas-fired plants in the Northwest, nine of them in Oregon, all of which rely on gas supplied from Canada, according to data gathered by Energy GPS, a Portland-based energy consulting firm. Collectively, they consume about 1.1 billion cubic feet a day of Canadian gas to produce about 5,600 megawatts of electricity in winter months – enough to power more than 5 million homes.\n\n“There is no viable substitute for the Canadian natural gas without major gas pipeline infrastructure expansion,” said Tim Belden, a principal at the firm.\n\nWhile the impact of gas costs on electricity bills varies widely by utility, they typically make up about two thirds of home energy bills from a natural gas utility, according to the American Gas Association.\n\nNorthwest Natural, the state’s largest gas utility, buys about 60% of its natural gas supply from Canada, according to a 2023 filing with state regulators.\n\nWhile utilities typically source a portion of their gas supplies under long-term supply contracts that protect them from immediate swings in wholesale prices, it’s unclear how the provisions of those contracts treat tariffs. Federal filings show Northwest Natural buys about a quarter of its gas supply under long-term contracts.\n\nNorthwest Natural declined to comment on the potential impact of tariffs.\n\nState regulators at the Oregon Public Utility Commission examine each utility’s energy prices annually, considering forecasted prices and actual costs from the previous year, which can result in an increase or decrease of rates.\n\nThe annual power cost adjustments are subject to a cost-sharing mechanism that incentivizes utilities to control energy costs where possible, and an earnings test that examines whether the utility’s earnings are still within an authorized range despite any change in energy costs.\n\nKandi Young, a spokesperson for the Oregon Public Utility Commission, said it is too early to tell what price impact tariffs may have on power costs and consumer rates.\n\n“The PUC will continue to monitor any impacts and will scrutinize any requests for rate recovery on a case-by-case basis,” she said.\n\n- Ted Sickinger is a reporter on the investigations team.
