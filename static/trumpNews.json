And before we start, this is a holiday shortened week, so we have a long weekend coming up, so we will be saying bye to you a little earlier this week. Our top stories, The US is headed into recession and India into recovery.Why does India stand to pull in more foreign portfolio investor flows in coming months? Inflation could go below 4%. Don't ask for tax cuts, we will bring down your logistics costs, says India's transport minister.A new pharmaceutical research and manufacturing sector is opening up in India and can grow if we get a few things right.Time To Decouple AgainThe United States is headed into recession and India into some form of recovery. Now, the second part, that India might be a little open-ended and a tad early to proclaim, but the first part has been pretty much promised by US President Donald Trump. He refused to rule out the fact that the US economy would enter a recession this year, telling an administration-friendly news channel that there will be a period of transition for what we're doing is very big.The reasoning apparently is, from what I've picked up from elsewhere, that there are things other than prices that matter, like family values and cultural issues, which matter to Trump's base more specifically, and the stock market movements, including in the short term, are less important in that context. So that's the view right now. Meanwhile, Wall Street is further reacting, having, of course, given up all the gains it saw since November 2024, when the elections that brought in Donald Trump took place.Remember, Wall Street had also gone up in anticipation of a Trump victory, which they felt would be good for Wall Street rather than, as such, Main Street. Trump, in his second administration, clearly is more focused on Main Street, at least right now. So that's that.And it would be interesting to see how this plays out with all his tech bro friends who are seeing their wealth diminish by the day. On Wall Street again, stock futures dropped on Monday as selling pressures continued. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 427 points, or 1%.S&P 500 futures were also down, similarly as were NASDAQ 100 futures, pointed out by CNBC. Tesla's stock, by the way, had never seen such a stretch of red. For seven straight weeks since Elon Musk went to Washington to join the Trump administration, shares in the automaker have declined and closed Friday at around $270, according to CNBC, which added that this is the longest such losing streak for Tesla in its 15 years as a public company.Last week, the S&P 500 lost about 3.1%. Its worst weekly marks in September, Dow lost 2.4 and the NASDAQ composite 3.5. All of this from CNBC. September 24 is also the time and the point at which the Indian markets had hit a peak and then took that about turn. Analysts are now telling CNBC that the risks of a bear case have risen and some are looking at a 14-20% drawdown, which of course brings it closer to the Dow Street.So what does this mean for global flows? Well, we have some good answers on that coming up. Back home, the BSE Sensex swung up and down and then closed down 217 points at 74,115.It started in the positive though, usually a sign that some larger investors wait for the markets to open up and then start selling. The Nifty 50 was down 92 points at 22,460. The broader markets were hit too with the and the small cap about 2%.Foreign institutional investors have been selling consistently into 2025 and into March as well. But how can we put those flows in perspective? And what do they mean in the overall context of the flows that we've seen over the decades?And what can we compute from the allocations that India gets from what kind of...","url":"https://www.thecore.in/podcasts/the-us-is-headed-into-recession-and-india-into-recovery-831231","image":"https://www.thecore.in/h-upload/2025/03/10/1050702-e528-1200x630.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 01:07:52","author":"Govindraj Ethiraj","authors":["Govindraj Ethiraj"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":298815412,"title":"Judge temporarily blocks deportation of arrested Palestinian Columbia student","text":"A U.S. judge on Monday ordered that Palestinian Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil not be deported for now as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on some anti-Israel protesters, and set a court hearing in the case for Wednesday.\n\nTrump publicly denounced Khalil and said more arrests would follow. Khalil has been moved to a federal jail for migrants in Louisiana to await deportation proceedings, according to his lawyers and a U.S. detainee database.\n\nDemonstrators on the streets of New York City, the state attorney general and the American Civil Liberties Union have denounced his arrest by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents as an attack on free speech.\n\nPolice and hundreds of protesters briefly clashed in lower Manhattan and at least one person was detained, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nKhalil, who had held legal permanent resident status and was arrested Saturday, has been a prominent figure in Columbia's pro-Palestinian student protest movement that set off campus demonstrations across the United States and around the world last year. Trump branded Khalil a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\" on social media.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman put a hold on his deportation \"unless and until the Court orders otherwise.\"\n\nKhalil's lawyers also urged Furman to order Khalil's return to New York. They accused the government of seeking to deprive Khalil of access to legal counsel by sending him far from New York.\n\nTrump said on social media that Khalil's \"is the first arrest of many to come.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has not said Khalil is accused of or charged with a crime, but Trump wrote that his presence in the U.S. was \"contrary to national and foreign policy interests.\"\n\nThe Education Department on Monday sent letters to 60 U.S. universities, including Harvard, Columbia, Yale and four University of California schools, warning them of cuts in federal funding unless they addressed allegations of antisemitism on campus.\n\nEven before Khalil's arrest, students say federal immigration agents have been spotted at student housing around Columbia's Manhattan campus since Thursday, a day before the Trump administration announced it was canceling $400 million in federal grants and contracts awarded to the school because of what it described as antisemitic harassment on and near Columbia's New York City campus.\n\nThe federal agents have been trying to detain at least one other international student, according to the Student Workers of Columbia labor union. Spokespeople for DHS and ICE declined to answer questions about the union's account, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of State said visa records are confidential under U.S. law and so the department could not comment.\n\nOn Saturday evening, agents from the Department of Homeland Security arrested Khalil in front of his wife, a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant, telling him his student visa had been revoked, according to Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil.\n\nHis wife showed the agents Khalil's green card and they also threatened to arrest her if she did not leave her lobby, Greer said.\n\nThey then said the green card was also revoked and handcuffed Khalil, Greer said.\n\nHours before his arrest, Khalil told Reuters he was concerned that the government was targeting him.\n\nKhalil and other activists note that Jewish students are among the protest organizers, and say their criticism of Israel and its U.S. government support is being wrongly conflated with antisemitism.\n\nJewish faculty at Columbia held a rally and press conference in support of Khalil outside a university building on Monday, holding signs saying \"Jews say no to deportations.\"\n\n\"There is a chill in the air. It's a chill of fear and despair,\" said Marianne Hirsch, professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, who grew up in Romania as a child of Holocaust survivors.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has cited concerns over antisemitism, the president and his allies have themselves been accused of enabling antisemitism.\n\nFollowing a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where some demonstrators carried torches and chanted \"Jews will not replace us,\" Trump said there were \"fine people on both sides.\"\n\nTrump, who denies allegations of being antisemitic, also faced criticism in 2022 for dining with white supremacist Nick Fuentes.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"A U.S. judge on Monday ordered that Palestinian Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil not be deported for now as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on some anti-Israel…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-arrested-palestinian-columbia-student","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/d2/5b/e6b78ae65b41895916d618e7de11e9178759/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 01:01:28","author":"Japan Today Editor,Jonathan Allen","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Jonathan Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":298813004,"title":"Trump-backed plan to avert shutdown heads for House vote","text":"A plan to avert a partial government shutdown backed by President Donald Trump is heading for a House-wide vote on Tuesday. The House Rules Committee, the final gatekeeper before legislation hits the House of Representatives chamber, advanced the bill along party lines on Monday evening. Tuesday is expected to first see a vote to allow for lawmakers to debate the bill, known as a \"rule vote,\" followed by a chamber-wide vote on the legislation itself later in the afternoon. It's a major test for Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., as they seek to corral a House GOP conference that's been exceptionally fractured on the subject of government funding. DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY REBUKE PARTY MEMBERS WHO JEERED TRUMP DURING SPEECH TO CONGRESS: REPORT The bill is a continuing resolution (CR), which is a rough extension of fiscal 2024 funding levels to keep the government open through the start of fiscal 2026 on Oct. 1. Republicans are largely expected to shoulder the bill alone in the House, despite a significant number of GOP lawmakers who would normally be opposed to extending Biden administration-era funding levels. Democrats have outnumbered Republicans in anti-government shutdown votes in recent years, but this time their opposition to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has many left-wing lawmakers signaling their opposition. But what's lending optimism to Johnson allies is the fact that two of the measure's most vocal backers are the senior-most members of the hawkish House Freedom Caucus. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, the group's policy chair, told Fox News Digital on Monday morning that a key part of conservatives' pitch to fellow fiscal hawks is that Trump will likely still move to spend less money than the CR appropriates, including funding that he's already blocked by executive order. \"Step 1 is the CR freezes spending, guys, that's a win; No. 2, no earmarks; No. 3, no giant omnibus; No. 4, we believe the president can impound,\" Roy said of his pitch. Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., cited Republicans' near-uniform vote on their Trump-backed federal budget bill last month. \"There were a lot of people in Washington who said we would never pass a debt ceiling increase with only Republican votes, and we did in the House,\" Harris said. \"I think, similarly, there's some people who, including some of the Democrats, who think, 'Well, they're going to have to come to us, because they can never pass a continuing resolution with only Republican votes.' And I think we're going to see the same result [Tuesday].\" But with razor-thin margins, Johnson can afford precious little dissent to still pass the bill on party lines. At least one Republican is already opposed: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a staunch Johnson critic, wrote on X late Sunday, \"Unless I get a lobotomy Monday that causes me to forget what I’ve witnessed the past 12 years, I’ll be a NO on the CR this week. It amazes me that my colleagues and many of the public fall for the lie that we will fight another day.\" The 99-page legislation was released over the weekend. GOLDMAN SACHS HIGHLIGHTS TARIFF WARS WINNERS AND LOSERS The bill allocates an additional $8 billion in defense spending to mitigate national security hawks' concerns, while non-defense spending that Congress annually appropriates would decrease by about $13 billion. There are also some added funds to help facilitate Immigrations and Customs Enforcement operations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cuts to non-defense discretionary spending would be found by eliminating some \"side deals\" made during Fiscal Responsibility Act negotiations, House GOP leadership aides said. Lawmakers would also not be given an opportunity to request funding for special pet projects in their districts known as earmarks, another area that Republicans are classifying as savings. It allows Republican leaders to claim a win on no meaningful government spending increases over fiscal 2025.","summary":"House lawmakers are poised to vote on a bill supported by President Donald Trump to avert a government shutdown.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-backed-plan-avert-shutdown-heads-house-vote","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/trump-johnson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:55:03","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":298812748,"title":"Analysis:Japan firms must get used to reverse break-up fees after Nippon Steel's $565 million blow","text":"TOKYO/NEW YORK : Japanese suitors face a heightened chance of U.S. targets baking in hefty termination fees to protect against a deal collapsing due to regulatory or political reasons, following Nippon Steel's stranded $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel.\n\nA reputation for reliability has long given Japanese firms almost a bye when so-called reverse break-up fees are broached in M&A talks, yet an increasingly protectionist U.S. has left deals at the mercy of national security and fluid trade policy.\n\nNippon Steel is challenging the U.S. decision, taken under the administration of President Joe Biden, to block its purchase of U.S. Steel citing security concerns. If it fails, it has to pay U.S. Steel $565 million as previously agreed to cover costs incurred by the latter throughout the acquisition attempt.\n\nThat prospect will do little to dampen Japanese interest in their biggest target nation yet the increased chance of outside forces scuppering deals has meant reverse break-up fees are looming larger in negotiations, said lawyers and bankers.\n\nThe risk of Japanese suitors being unable to close a deal has long been seen as far lower than for companies from many other nations. Even so, U.S. boardrooms are now likely to point to the Nippon Steel deal and demand \"protection\" in transactions, said U.S. law firm Skadden partner Kenton King.\n\n\"I think what's going to happen for a while is you will see more reverse termination fees. You'll see them at levels that aren't crazy, not 10 per cent levels, but manageable levels that aren't too scary to people,\" King told Reuters.\n\nReverse break-up fees were once almost non-existent in deals involving Japanese suitors to the extent that Western targets were even advised against negotiating them higher, lawyers said.\n\nThey now feature in one in 20 domestic and cross-border deals involving listed Japanese firms, said Managing Director Tosh Kojima at DC Advisory, the international investment banking arm of Daiwa Securities.\n\n\"Once extremely rare, they are occasionally seen these days, but the vast majority of Japanese boards typically do not approve them,\" Kojima said. \"Culturally it still doesn't fly.\"\n\nMedian reverse break-up fees worldwide over the past two years have been 4 per cent to 5 per cent of the target's enterprise value, including debt, but are generally lower for Japanese firms, bankers and lawyers said. Nippon Steel's $565 million is 3.8 per cent.\n\nTAKING ON RISK \n\nJapanese merger-and-acquisition deals in the U.S. totalled $54.5 billion last year, up 35 per cent from the year earlier, showed data from LSEG. Of deals overseas, the U.S. accounted for 53 per cent of targets, the data showed.\n\nOver 60 per cent of large deals involving public U.S. companies reviewed by investment bank Houlihan Lokey in a 2023 study contained a reverse break-up fee provision, versus 57 per cent the year prior.\n\nRecent Japan-U.S. deals with reverse break-up provisions include Mizuho Financial Group's $587 million purchase of M&A adviser Greenhill & Co, which closed in 2023. The fee would have been $38.5 million, or 6.6 per cent of enterprise value.\n\n\"As a seller, when you see deals like that (Nippon Steel's) being blocked, you're going to be even more insistent on a break fee and buyers taking that risk,\" said Nick Wall, partner at law firm A&O Shearman in Tokyo.\n\n\"If you can't get your boards to agree to take on that risk, the deals may fall through.\"\n\nFor suitors of U.S. assets, reverse break-up fees are increasingly sought due to possible hurdles presented by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which screens deals for national security risk.\n\nGiven U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on protecting American industry, CFIUS reviews are likely to become stricter, said Michihiro Nishi, partner at Clifford Chance in Tokyo.\n\n\"The Japanese companies that are serial acquirers are accustomed to a world where they don't present any special regulatory or political risks in the U.S.,\" said Noah Carr, M&A partner at Freshfields in Tokyo.\n\n\"The risk profile and track record historically put downward pressure on the break-up fee. Now we're going to see upward pressure.\"","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysisjapan-firms-must-get-used-reverse-break-up-fees-after-nippon-steels-565-million-blow-4992016","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--sqNPSo_Y--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-03-11t004851z_2_lynxmpel2a00u_rtroptp_3_japan-companies-security.jp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:47:20","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":298815420,"title":"GOP senator argues that Democrats are ‘cheering’ for America’s failure","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air March 10, 2025 07:09 \n\n GOP senator argues that Democrats are ‘cheering’ for America’s failure \n Sen.

While speculation has been rampant that his wife Casey will attempt to keep the governor's mansion in the family, no official announcement has been made concerning her potential candidacy.Trump's early endorsement of Donalds, coming before he even announced his candidacy, could give the congressman a significant advantage in a GOP primary race with Florida's first lady despite her name recognition and support in the state for her husband's governorship.What To KnowAn internal Donalds campaign poll conducted by Fabrizio Lee & Associates, led by Trump's own campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio, found the congressman with a 34 percent to 30 percent lead over Casey DeSantis in a hypothetical gubernatorial primary race, according to a Monday report from Florida Politics.However, when the pollster informed respondents that Trump had endorsed Donalds, the congressman's lead over DeSantis grew to a massive 45 percent to 23 percent advantage. When told both that Trump endorsed Donalds and that Ron DeSantis endorsed his wife, respondents preferred the congressman by 38 percent to 28 percent.Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, a rumored Republican candidate, registered in a distant single-digit third place to Donalds and DeSantis. Nearly 30 percent of respondents were undecided. The poll was conducted among \"likely\" Florida GOP primary on February 26 and 27. It has a 5 percent margin of error.Trump said Donalds would make \"a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida\" in a post to Truth Social last month, while adding that the congressman would have his \"Complete and Total Endorsement\" if he ran. The remarks seemingly had a major impact on Donalds, who officially announced his candidacy less than a week later.While Ron DeSantis officially endorsed Trump's 2024 presidential campaign after dropping his own ill-fated Republican primary bid, the governor's relationship with the president deteriorated significantly since challenging him for the GOP nomination.What People Are SayingFabrizio, in a statement shared with Florida Politics: \"Much like the DeSantises' fool's errand in 2024 against President Trump where he got crushed, this data shows that the DeSantises would suffer a similar fate in Florida if Casey should run for Governor ... The only real questions are: Will they betray President Trump again? And how many Tallahassee fools will follow them off the cliff a second time to do so?\"Ron DeSantis, commenting on speculation about his wife's political future during a press conference late last month: \"I will tell you this: I won by the biggest margin that any Republican has ever won a governor's race here in Florida. She would do better than me, there's no question about that. She's somebody with the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles that anything we've accomplished, she'd be able to take to the next level.\"What Happens NextThe Florida gubernatorial primary election is scheduled to take place on August 18, 2026. So far, Donalds is the only major candidate to officially announce a run.","summary":"Casey DeSantis has not yet said whether she will be a candidate in the 2026 Florida governor's race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/byron-donalds-chances-against-casey-desantis-potential-primary-poll-2042577","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2604269/byron-donald-casey-desantis-2026-florida-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:42:19","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.159},{"id":298814228,"title":"Vincent Cassel, 58, frolics on the beach with his bikini-clad wife Narah Baptista, 28, in Brazil after revealing they've welcomed their first child","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Mar 11th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk reveals who is behind 'massive' cyberattack on X\n\nMother-of-four revealed as the woman shot dead on her doorstep in a case of 'mistaken identity'\n\nCould ship that hit US tanker have been hacked?

I am'.\nWhile Narah replied: 'Amor' which is Italian for love. \nVincent and wife Tina, who welcomed a daughter, Amazonie, in April 2019, were believed to have separated after he deleted all traces of her from his social media.\nA source told DailyMail.com at the time that the couple are headed for divorce. They said: 'They separated weeks ago. Tina is heartbroken.'\nVincent tied the knot with Tina in 2018, two years after they were first linked, and they welcomed a daughter, Amazonie, in April 2019.\nSince their separation, Tina has shared several images from photoshoots.\nMeanwhile Vincent has been touted for two new movies, The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan, and Liaison, an Apple TV+ film he features in alongside Eva Green. \nAnd while he failed to post anything about Tina's birthday, the actor did share a tribute to his daughter Deva.\nVincent and Monica, 59, wed in 1999 after meeting on the set of their 1996 movie, The Apartment.

I knew I wanted to work in that industry at some point in my life, but I definitely didn't expect to love it this much and make a living out of it.'\nInstagramBrazil\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVincent Cassel, 58, frolics on the beach with his bikini-clad wife Narah Baptista, 28, in Brazil after revealing they've welcomed their first child\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 15\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will take the Democratic resistance on the road, appearing in GOP-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York in coming weeks.\n\nAOC divulged her plans to the Associated Press for a story Monday, after fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, attracted big crowds in Warren, Michigan on Saturday, for a stop on his ‘Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here’ tour. \n\nThe New York Democrat said she would be joining Sanders on the road soon and also be doing the solo appearances. \n\n‘You look around – who else is doing it? No one,’ Ocasio-Cortez said. ‘My hope is that the dam wil break in terms of Democrats going on the offense … We need to take the argument directly to the people.’\n\nOn Saturday, more than 6,000 people were packed into three different auditoriums for Sanders’ joint appearance with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain. \n\nSanders said he was targeting Congressional districts that narrowly went to President Donald Trump, like Warren, a Detroit suburb. \n\nThe Vermont independent also made stops in Altoona and Kenosha, Wisconsin. \n\nHe’s using the push to encourage swing members of Congress to vote against a funding bill that slahes Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs.\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin – and also Pennsylvania, where AOC will travel – have been the most important swing states in modern politics.\n\nThey make up the three ‘blue wall’ states that went to Trump in the 2016 election – states Biden won back four years later. \n\nThey again swung to Trump in 2024, when he defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nAnd while New York leans Democratic at the presidential level, it could help Democrats win back the House in 2026 with its handful of swing districts. \n\nSince Democrats have found themselves booted from the White House and in the minority in both the House and Senate, party leaders have struggled to find their footing. \n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats responded to Trump’s joint address before Congress by holding up signs, wearing pink and protesting. \n\nEven members of their own party found their actions to be performative.\n\n‘Why are democrats just sitting there? The signs are not landing. It is giving bingo!

Surely we should be free to speak the truth,” he said.\n\n“Or are we going to muzzle our service for fear of offending Mr Trump? I mean, really, Sally, is this where we’ve got that we’ve become, you know, is the ABC become so pusillanimous that you’re seriously suggesting that we shouldn’t be free to speak the truth in Australia, for fear of Donald Trump. \n\n“Is that the depths you’ve sunk to? I believe in Australia and I believe in standing up for Australia and I think, I’m sorry, apparently you don’t.” \n\nThe host responded by saying “Don’t put words in my mouth with respect, it’s my job to ask questions about your comments.”\n\nSpeaking on the Today show, host Sarah Abo wondered if it wasn’t time for Mr Turnbull to just shut up.\n\n“Here we were worried about Trump. When it turns out Malcolm Turnbull might be the one. The death knell here,” she said.\n\n“I mean, honestly, former prime ministers just need to shut up. I mean, Julia Gillard comes to mind. Even Tony Abbott’s been pretty quiet. They need to (shut up).” \n\nAbo raised concerns that the intervention had come at the worst possible time during an interview with Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth and Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie on Tuesday morning.\n\n“It’s not his (Mr Turnbull’s) role to meddle here. He got the deal done when he was in government,” Abo told Ms McKenzie. \n\n“There’s one person that can get this done and it’s not sending your whipping boy Jim Chalmers over last week. It is actually about getting on the plane and getting this done. There are over 100,000 jobs. Sarah, that rely on our steel and aluminium works,” Ms McKenzie responded. \n\nHitting back, Ms Rishworth replied: “Bridget, to suggest we’re not taking that seriously is completely disingenuous. The Prime Minister is working hard, along with all our government.” \n\n“Yeah he’s working hard, working the phones,” Ms McKenzie interjected, suggesting the Prime Minister should “get on a plane” to the US to discuss the tariffs. \n\nTurnbull’s extraordinary interview\n\nIn an extraordinary interview on the ABC’s 7:30 program on Monday night, Mr Turnbull warned Australia shouldn’t “suck up” to Mr Trump and accused political leaders of gaslighting voters over the threat he posed to the world.\n\nThere are now fears that the fallout could hit the March 25 budget, amid Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ warning that “we’ve got a lot at stake as Australians” amid escalating trade tensions around the world.\n\n“I mean, the reality is – if you suck up to bullies, whether it is global affairs, or in the playground, you just get more bullying,’’ Mr Turnbull said.\n\n“And unfortunately, you know, we are now seeing somebody that is utterly unconstrained. And if the advice is to go and suck up to him, well, where does that get you?\n\n“I mean, are we just going to become just a conga line of sycophants creeping through the White House, paying homage to this guy and telling him he’s a genius?\n\n“It’s ludicrous! I mean, the leaders of other countries, particularly friendly countries, are among the few people that can speak truth to Trump because he can’t sack them.”\n\nMarch 25 budget under pressure\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers and the Reserve Bank have warned the Australian economy is at risk from the escalating global trade war after the US President vowed to introduce reciprocal tariffs on top of the steel and aluminium tariffs for “friend or foe” on April 2.\n\nThe steel tariffs are scheduled to apply from this week unless negotiators can cut a deal. Former PM and US ambassador Kevin Rudd held talks this week that proved fruitless for now.\n\nSenior government sources concede they don’t know if Mr Trump will offer an exemption but say Mr Turnbull’s intervention was poorly-timed.\n\nTrump slams Turnbull as ‘weak, ineffective’\n\nEarlier, Mr Trump slammed Mr Turnbull on social media on Monday after the former Australian prime minister warned the United States’ poor treatment of its allies was providing “an opportunity” for Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n“Malcolm Turnbull, the former prime minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from ‘behind’, never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,” Mr Trump wrote in a post to his own social media platform Truth Social on Sunday evening (Monday AEDT).\n\n“I always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian’s [sic] agreed with me.”\n\nMalcolm Turnbull unleashes on Donald Trump\n\nThe Trump social media post appears to be in retaliation for Mr Turnbull’s appearance in an interview on Bloomberg television, where he argued the United States was an increasingly unreliable ally.\n\nAn unrepentant Mr Turnbull then accused the US President of trying to “extort allies” as he unloaded on his “harassing and bullying” behaviour.\n\n“Well, I do not believe that you should give in to bullies, right?’’ he said.\n\nMr Turnbull warned the situation ‘has changed’.\n\n“Trump wants people to suck up to him, and to be sycophantic. And I have dealt with Trump in the past. I mean, you know, the fact is – I stood up to Trump, and got him to do things he didn’t want to do, because I wasn’t being bullied by him.\n\n“Most of the people, pretty much all of the people I’ve seen, international leaders, that have sucked up to Trump and been sycophants, have been run over.\n\nMr Turnbull said the situation was unprecedented.\n\n“Look around us. The impact that Trump is having on the world, on the Western alliance, on markets, on our economies – I mean, these are matters that we have to talk about,’’ he said.\n\n“We cannot continue this bipartisan gaslighting that is going on at the moment where there are these massive changes in Washington affecting us and the whole world.\n\n“I mean, look at the extraordinary treatment of Canada.\n\n“Efforts to basically cripple Canada’s economy in order to bully them into becoming the 51st state.\n\n“This is all unprecedented, but yet, if you look at our political leaders – there’s nothing wrong with AUKUS, everything is fine, the relationship is fine, nothing has changed! Well, it has changed.”\n\nMr Turnbull said he would not stay silent on the issue despite concerns it might impact tariff negotiations.\n\n“All of this erratic behaviour will be taken advantage of by China, because what China will do is they will say – they’ll be the opposite of Trump, where Trump is erratic, they’ll be consistent,’’ he said.\n\n“Where Trump is rude and abusive … they’ll be respectful. They’ll play a very different game to what they did in the first Trump Administration.\n\n“So you know, look, he’s actively helping Putin in Ukraine, and perhaps not deliberately, but effectively he’s helping Xi Jinping.”\n\n“You know, where people are trying to be friends with both sides, if Trump abuses them, seeks to bully them, puts crippling tariffs on them, they will naturally edge closer to China – of course, they will.”\n\nHowever, Mr Turnbull clarified he obviously did not include Australia in that group, who might lean towards China.\n\nBad for business\n\nMr Turnbull said if Mr Trump triggered a global wave of protectionism, it would clearly be “bad for business.”\n\n“Trump seems to have a view that America can prosper at the expense of everybody else,’’ Mr Turnbull told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“That’s not going to work, that’s what they tried at the time of the Great Depression.\n\n“You’ve had tariffs going on, going off, going back on again, and then, you know, this uncertainty is, you know, better than anyone at Bloomberg is hitting the markets too.\n\n“It’s bad for business.”\n\nBut Mr Turnbull warned it was different this time around under Trump 2.0.\n\n“You know, he’s surrounded by yes men, supporters. In the first Trump administration, he didn’t really expect to win,’’ he said.\n\n“He wasn’t really prepared. He hired a lot of people that were not from his camp, or his MAGA movement, and they were trying to steer him in more conventional directions, but, you know, he hasn’t got that restraint now, so you’re seeing a much more undiluted Donald Trump, second time around.”\n\n“This is a very different United States. Trump does not subscribe to the same values that we have in the past shared with America. Doesn’t care about treaties or alliances. You know, he’s got a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he entered into, I thought he signed it, and he’s just walked away from that. So I think we’ve got to work out how we are going to defend ourselves and how we will pursue a more independent, independent of the United States approach to international and security affairs.”\n\nMr Turnbull did secure a tariff exemption the first time around but was pessimistic about Australia’s chances this time.\n\n“I mean, the government is using exactly the same arguments I used in 2018, namely, that Trump has a surplus with Australia,’’ he said.\n\n“He’s got a free trade deal with Australia. But I think the argument saying that the promise of the aluminium export volumes was broken, well, I didn’t give you that promise. So aluminium was barely mentioned in my time. All the focus was on steel. Aluminium was just a footnote. But apparently, when (Scott) Morrison was Prime Minister, the Americans had noticed aluminium exports from Australia were increasing, and Scott gave some kind of undertaking that they, you know.”\n\nDeputy PM: ‘Australian exemption makes sense’\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said he was still advocating for a reprieve.\n\n“We’ve been advocating very forcefully to the Trump administration about why it makes sense for there to be a carve-out for Australian steel and aluminium, Australian exports in general,” Mr Marles told Sky News.\n\n“Our two-way trade with the United States is very much in the United States’ favour.\n\n“It makes sense that all of this is tariff free. And indeed, to the extent that we do provide exports to the United States, that’s supporting US jobs.\n\n“Now that’s an argument that we’ve been making with the US administration.”","summary":"Malcolm Turnbull has hit back over his blow up with US President Donald Trump, while a Today show host has given her 10 cents.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/shut-up-host-blows-up-at-turnbull/news-story/3a57773f02fb9a0a517546eae0a7f475?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c1e7c093b48b463d2cccb625f5965d26","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:33:11","author":"Samantha Maiden","authors":["Samantha Maiden"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":298810526,"title":"Harvard Announces a Hiring Freeze as Funding Is Threatened","text":"Harvard University, one of the nation's wealthiest schools, on Monday joined the list of universities across the country imposing hiring freezes, citing the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's threats to slash funding for higher education.\n\nThe move was announced in an email to the school community by Dr. Alan M. Garber, Harvard's president.\n\nThe announcement comes three days after the Trump administration pulled $400 million in grants and contracts from Columbia University over accusations that the school had failed to protect Jewish students and faculty from antisemitism.\n\nA number of other universities have announced hiring freezes or \"chills\" in the past month in response to potential policy changes of the Trump administration. But the step by Harvard, which has an endowment of more than $50 billion, illustrates the gravity of the situation facing higher education as the Trump administration continues its crusade against colleges and universities.\n\nHarvard, like Columbia, is one of 10 schools the Trump administration identified last month as subject to review over accusations that it had not done enough to curb antisemitic behavior on campus during protests over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn a similar move Monday, the University of Pennsylvania -- which is not among the 10 schools the Trump administration identified last month -- announced a freeze on staff hiring. It also announced a review of faculty hiring, citing changes to federal research funding, including \"stop-work\" orders that Penn already received.\n\n\"The direction is clear, and we are already experiencing reduced funding,\" said the announcement, in an email to Penn staff by two university administrators.\n\nIn addition to issuing a freeze on staff hiring, with some exceptions, the university said it was freezing some raises and reducing other expenses by 5%. Those freezes come after funding cuts prompted some departments at Penn to retract verbal admission offers to incoming doctoral students.\n\nCampuses have been embroiled in debates over whether the protests against Israel constitute antisemitism. Although many such demonstrations have been peaceful, some episodes with pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counterprotesters supporting Israel have deteriorated into violence. Many of the protesters themselves are Jewish, and activists, political leaders and university officials have debated what, precisely, constitutes antisemitism.\n\nIssuing claims of antisemitism, which could violate federal law, is just one of the methods the Trump administration is trying in an effort to hobble funding of higher education.\n\nOther methods include threatening to increase taxes on large university endowments, cutting overhead reimbursements for federal grants and promising to target schools that allow diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nGarber's email, which was posted to the university's website, did not mention Trump by name, but it said that universities throughout the nation \"face substantial financial uncertainties driven by rapidly shifting federal policies.\"\n\n\"Effective immediately, Harvard will implement a temporary pause on staff and faculty hiring across the University,\" the email said.

Now he's hedging as markets dip.","text":"When President Donald Trump wanted to make the case for his first term’s success in an interview last month, he turned to the stock market. “I was very proud to have handed over the country when the stock market was higher than it was, previous to the pandemic coming in,” he said in a Fox News interview Feb. 9. “It was an amazing achievement.” And in his second term, he has promised that trend would continue. “The stock market is going to be great,” he told the crowd at an investor conference Feb. 19. But after stocks began a downward spiral last week on fears Trump's use of tariffs will tip the United States into a recession, his tone has changed. “You can’t really watch the stock market,” Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. “If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters.” On Monday, stocks sank further, erasing all of their gains since Trump’s election. The S&P 500 had its worst day since September, and shares of technology companies were among the hardest hit as the Nasdaq had its biggest one-day drop since 2022, wiping out $1 trillion in value. None of the more than two dozen posts on Trump’s Truth Social account Monday addressed the market sell-off. A White House official downplayed the market moves in a statement to reporters. “Since President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.” The White House cited several surveys showing improved confidence among business leaders, though the surveys were conducted before Trump imposed the tariffs on Canada and Mexico last week. After Trump’s first term in office, he frequently used the stock market like an EKG tracking the health of his presidency with posts like “Stock Market at all-time high. That doesn’t just happen!” At rallies, he would often cite the market and talk about workers’ thanking him for making them rich because their stock portfolios were doing so well. While the stock market had its ups and downs during Trump’s first term, including a dramatic fall at the start of the pandemic, it was largely on an upward trajectory, with the S&P 500 index increasing nearly 70% during Trump’s first term. The market continued its overall rise during President Joe Biden’s time in office. On the eve of Trump's inauguration, when the S&P 500 was up around 3% since the election, he referred to the increase in stocks, along with other improvements in the economy, as the “Trump effect.” “Everyone is calling it the — I don’t want to say this, it’s too braggadocious, but we’ll say it anyway — the Trump effect. It’s you. You’re the effect,” Trump said at a rally with supporters. “Since the election, the stock market has surged, and small-business optimism has soared a record 41 points to a 39-year high. Bitcoin has shattered one record high after another.” But as Trump’s policies have begun to take shape in his first 50 days in office, some of that optimism from investors has reversed course. The decline in markets accelerated last week, when Trump carried through on a threat to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, two of America’s closest trading partners, and put an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. While Trump backed off on many of the Canada and Mexico tariffs days later, the levies remained on many products, and he reiterated that more tariffs were coming in April. On Monday, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on a variety of U.S. agriculture products, while Ontario’s premier announced the province would begin charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans. U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum were set to go into effect later this week, which would drive prices higher for some U.S. manufacturers. “The underlying fundamentals of the economy are really strong. There is unfortunately a huge amount of uncertainty right now that is affecting boardrooms and investors,\" Peter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a top budget official in the Obama administration, said in an interview on CNBC. \"I think people could understand tension with China. It’s Canada, Mexico and Europe that is confusing. So the good news is this is a choice.\" Trump hasn’t dismissed the notion of some economic pain from his tariffs, warning that there will be a “period of transition” in his interview Sunday on Fox and a “little disturbance” in his address to Congress last week. His top economic officials also offered a warning last week, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying there would be a “detox period” as the economy shifts away from government spending and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying prices on some items would go up as a result of tariffs — though they wouldn’t increase overall inflation. On Sunday, Trump maintained his position on the tariffs in remarks to reporters as he flew back to Washington from a weekend at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. “I think the tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we’ve ever done as a country,” Trump said. “It’s going to make our country rich again.”","summary":"When President Donald Trump wanted to make the case for his first term’s success in an interview last month, he turned to the stock market.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-made-stock-market-marker-success-now-hedging-markets-dip-rcna195704","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250310-donald-trump-mn-1450-b76640.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:26:23","author":"Shannon Pettypiece","authors":["Shannon Pettypiece"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.132},{"id":298811502,"title":"Fox correspondent makes desperate plea to Trump amid stock market free fall","text":"One of the top financial voices at Fox News warned Donald Trump to avoid talking up his tariff plans as the stock market takes a tumble. \n\nWall Street kicked off the week with one of its worst days in three years, as investors wrestled with economic uncertainty and fresh turbulence from Washington.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 890 points on Monday, down over 2 percent, while the S&P 500 tumbled 2.7 percent.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq fell the furthest, shedding 4 percent in the day's trading.\n\nCharlie Gasparino, Fox Business Senior Correspondent, advised the president and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to not bring up the tariffs as he touts his record to the American people.\n\n'They have to go out there and maybe stop talking about tariffs so much and start talking about how we're gonna infuse the economy,' he said.\n\nGasparino believes that focusing too much on tariff trauma influences a 'herd mentality' held by Wall Street insiders. \n\n'The herd is really negative right now, and it's focused on tariffs,' he said. \n\nThe longtime finance journalist was critical of a 'wonky' speech Bessent gave at The Economic Club of Washington.\n\nHe advised instead to talk primarily about the benefits the Trump economy will bring to American business.\n\n'We're getting good stuff coming from this economy. And for the markets, I think some of this is a sales job. We're gonna release the animal spirits. We're gonna deregulate stuff.'\n\nThe market sell-off sent CNN's Fear of Greed Index, an indicator that measures seven different factors in the stock market to determine what sentiment is driving the investors, into 'extreme fear' territory. \n\nThe March 6 sell-off continues a volatile week for investors, as all three indexes saw major swings. \n\nFirst, markets tumbled into Tuesday after the President announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China - and the countries retaliated. \n\nWall Street gained some momentum back on Wednesday after President Trump removed tariffs for automakers until April 2.\n\nBut then the Trump administration announced it was pulling back most tariffs on Mexican imports in a social media post on March 6. \n\n'After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,' President Trump said on his social media app, Truth Social. \n\nThe USMCA is a free-trade agreement struck between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada during the first Trump administration. \n\nTrump said the Mexican tariffs will also be delayed until April 2. \n\nThe rapid changes have thrown investors off-kilter. \n\n'You're just having confusion,' Keith Lerner, the chief market strategist at Truist, told CNBC. \n\n'That confusion is permeating into the day-to-day swings of the market.' \n\nTech stocks have been hit the hardest.\n\nNvidia, a dominant microchip producer that is seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, lost 5 percent of its stock value by mid-day. \n\nThe losses continue a trend for Nvidia, which has lost over 13 percent of its value this month and over 19 percent since the beginning of 2025. \n\nApple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Intel are also trading in the red. \n\nMultiple tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, assemble and manufacture products outside of the U.S., leaving them susceptible to pricing volatility if Trump keeps tariffs in place. \n\nThis isn't the first time Trump made an about-face on his tariff decisions after markets reacted poorly. \n\nIn February, the President postponed tariffs to early March after global markets entered deep red. \n\nThen, days later, the President launched global tariffs on all aluminum and steel entering the country. The taxes on metal didn't drive any major stock swings. \n\nDuring his recent address to Congress, Trump warned that the economy may incur some dark days as he imposed tariffs. \n\n'There may be a little bit of an adjustment period - you have to bear with me,' he said during his 90-minute speech. \n\n'Tariffs are about Making America Great Again. There may be a little disturbance.'\n\nThe import taxes are not the only factor driving Wall Street's volatility. \n\nStocks are also contending with signs that American consumers are pulling back spending after facing years of inflated costs. \n\nSeveral major retailers - including Walmart, Target, and Best Buy - have all forecast less-than-rosy growth outlooks in 2025.\n\nWalmart's prediction of slumping sales had the largest impact of the bunch. The Arkansas-based retailer said it expects growth of 3 to 4 percent in 2025. \n\nLast year, the company grew by more than 9 percent.","summary":"One of the top voices at Fox warned Donald Trump to avoid talking up his tariff plans as the stock market takes a tumble.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14483855/fox-correspondent-charlie-gasparino-donald-trump-stock-market.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/10/22/96046601-0-image-a-4_1741647278154.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/03/5708530853469598172/1024x576_MP4_5708530853469598172.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:22:38","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

'He needs to clean it up, you don't want a bum breaking in and living there.' \nPhotos taken sometime after the blaze show that the house had been completely destroyed, with just the foundation remaining, though much of the building debris and ashes had apparently been carted away already.\nOther photos documented the trash that still littered the property, along with multiple trash bins that appeared to have been left unattended. \nThe property is now set off by a tall fence that has since been covered in graffiti, and an inner wall separating one side of the property is also covered with spray-painted designs. \nThe current state of the property is a stark contrast from Google maps photos apparently taken before West's purchase.\nThe ranch-style home on the property was once tucked away with plenty of shade from trees hanging over it, while a line of palm trees separated it from the main Cornerstone property.\nBut West's property had already begun to sour by late 2023, and the recent photos suggest little to no attention has been paid to the area.\nThe first that overtook the building reportedly began on October 14, 2024, just after 12:45 a.m. \n\nThe first that overtook the building reportedly began on October 14, 2024, just after 12:45 a.m., and authorities said it may have been due to arson; pictured with Bianca Censori on Feb. 2 in LA \n\nAccording to The Sun, West was hit with a tax lien on the home in December for outstanding 2024 taxes of around $19,525; seen in February 2024 in Milan\nAuthorities indicated that the fire may have been started as the result of arson, though no details have publicly emerged about a potential culprit. \nFirefighters reportedly worked for around half an hour to put out the blaze, which spread to some of the trees next to the house, those most appear to have survived the fire. \nAround the time of the fire, KCAL News reported that no one was injured in the fire, but a home nearby suffered some superficial damage due to the extreme heat of the flames. \nSo far, the Los Angeles Fire Department hasn't commented on the matter. \nAccording to The Sun, West was hit with a tax lien on the home in December for outstanding 2024 taxes of around $19,525. \nHowever, the property doesn't appear to have been sold, and the hitmaker hasn't rented out the property.\nKanye WestLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West's $1.5M abandoned church building in LA burns to the ground\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The same day, Tesla's stock fell more than 15% amid concerns that include declining EV sales and politically driven protests against the manufacturer. And last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded in Florida during launch, showering some places with debris.\n\nMusk on Monday quickly blamed the X issues on a cyberattack stemming from Ukraine, without providing evidence. He posted on X that Democratic donors were responsible for seeding protests against Tesla, again without evidence. In response to the SpaceX explosion, he said on X: \"Rockets are hard.\"\n\nQuestions about Musk's continuing oversight of his companies are coming to a head as he spends more time in Washington on a major cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, trimming thousands of government jobs and contracts. But even there, he is facing questions about his role after a contentious Cabinet meeting last week in which Trump limited Musk's power to advising the departments.\n\nThe effects of Musk's government involvement are particularly prominent at Tesla. The company, where Musk is CEO, has faced protests and violence at some of its dealerships, including shots fired last week at a dealership in Oregon. In Boston, someone set fire to Tesla charging stations, and protesters were arrested at a nonviolent rally at a Tesla dealership in lower Manhattan.\n\nAlso last week, a report found Tesla car sales in Germany, Europe's largest market for EVs, dived 76% in February compared with a year earlier, sounding alarm bells for the entire European market. Monday's stock decline -- more than 50% lower than a mid-December peak -- was the biggest for Tesla stock since 2020.\n\nX, which Musk purchased in 2022, experienced intermittent outages Monday, mostly on its app, according to Downdetector, which tracks reports of problems from users on websites.\n\nThe first outages were reported before 6 a.m. Eastern time, after which the site and app seemed to resume functioning. But about 10 a.m., more problems arose, and there were 41,000 reports of outages on X, according to Downdetector.

Mexico must resolve this crisis by engaging in good faith negotiations to account for their illegal actions,” the letter said. \n\n“… Under the direction of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), Mexico’s military forces invaded Vulcan’s facilities and unlawfully shut down Vulcan’s operations,” the members of Congress said.\n\n“… Additionally, on September 23, 2024, President AMLO effectively expropriated Vulcan’s property by designating it a ‘naturally protected area.’ President Sheinbaum is currently considering a ‘management plan’ — which could potentially benefit Mexican and other foreign interests at the cost of an American company,” they said. \n\n“The Yucatan Peninsula’s strategic location, less than 400 miles from Florida, requires vigilant protection of both U.S. economic and national security interests,” the lawmakers said. \n\nSheinbaum said that her government would send letters to the members of Congress and Trump to “clarify” what has happened on the coast of Quintana Roo.\n\n“In that letter they’re suggesting that there was an expropriation. There was never an expropriation — the land is theirs, the property is theirs,” she said.\n\n“The problem is that they went completely out of their authorized area of operation,” Sheinbaum said, referring to Vulcan’s limestone quarrying activity.\n\n“They went to other areas, affecting cenotes and aquifers,” she said.\n\n“So they were informed, they were told … [to stop] but they continued with the quarrying, and then President López Obrador decided to change the [permitted] land use, but there is no expropriation,” Sheinbaum said\n\n“Now it’s a natural protected area where the exploitation of these materials isn’t permitted because it’s severely affecting the environment,” she said.\n\n“… The company should have complied with the environmental impact authorization it had. No company can violate its environmental impact authorization, but they expanded their area of operation,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nShe also said that her government is “meeting with the company to look at alternative solutions” to avoid a “legal conflict” between the two parties.\n\nIf the two parties can’t reach an agreement, the matter “will be resolved in court,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nNo Chinese funding of Maya Train \n\nIn their letter, the 35 members of U.S. Congress also raised concerns about possible Chinese funding of the Maya Train railroad, an ambitious project built by the former Mexican government that runs through the states of Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Chiapas.\n\n“Beyond the concerning expropriation of Vulcan’s property, we are troubled by reports that the adjacent Mayan Train project may be funded by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” the lawmakers said without providing any information about the reports they were referring to.\n\n“We request that your administration urgently investigate to clarify the true developers of this project to ensure the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative does not establish a presence in this strategically vital location,” the members of Congress said to Trump \n\nSheinbaum told reporters that the source of the funding for the railroad is “public.”\n\n“You can see it in the public accounts reports — everything that was invested in the Maya Train is public [information], it was [built with] the resources of Mexicans who paid taxes and they came back to build the Maya Train. So there is no Chinese funding,” she said.\n\nShe said that “if any company” involved in the construction of the Maya Train had some connection to China or the Chinese communist party, “that has nothing to do with the funding” of the railroad.\n\nMexico’s trade and investment relationship with China and Chinese companies could be a sticking point with the United States and Canada in the 2026 review of the USMCA free trade pact.\n\nThe Mexican government is currently aiming to reduce dependence on Chinese imports, and has recently imposed tariffs on some Chinese goods, including textiles and clothing.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"Sheinbaum responded to U.S. Republicans' concerns about a land dispute with a U.S. company and Maya Train funding.\n\n\nThe post No land grab in Vulcan dispute, Sheinbaum says: Monday&#8217;s mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-vulcan-dispute-sheinbaum-monday-mananera-recap/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sheinbaum-monday.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:18:52","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":298808258,"title":"YouTuber Alysha Burney dead at 25 after 'being laced' on birthday trip to Mexico","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Mar 11th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk reveals who is behind 'massive' cyberattack on X\n\nMother-of-four revealed as the woman shot dead on her doorstep in a case of 'mistaken identity'\n\nDonald Trump set to lift ban on sharing aid and intelligence with Ukraine after last-minute plea by Keir Starmer before crucial talks in Saudi Arabia\n\nInside Manchester's ultra-luxury influencer towers: They're filled with OnlyFans stars making £30k a month.

Khalil, who has Palestinian heritage, holds a green card and is married to a U.S. citizen who is eight months pregnant.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered the government not to remove Khalil from the United States while the judge reviewed a petition challenging the legality of his detention. Khalil's lawyers also filed a motion Monday asking the judge to compel the federal government to transfer him back to New York.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Khalil's case was \"the first arrest of many to come.\"\n\n\"We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\" Trump said on social media Monday.\n\n\"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply,\" he added.\n\nThe arrest and attempted expulsion of Khalil by Immigration and Customs Enforcement has provoked alarm over free-speech rights and the Trump administration's escalating crackdown on immigration and on universities that Trump and his aides argue are too liberal.\n\nThe administration did not publicly lay out the legal authority for the arrest. But two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio relied on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives him sweeping power to expel foreigners.\n\nThat provision says any \"alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"\n\nRubio also reposted a Homeland Security Department statement that accused Khalil of having \"led activities aligned to Hamas.\" But officials have not accused him of having any contact with the terrorist group, taking direction from it or providing material support to it.\n\nRather, the rationale is that the anti-Israel protests Khalil helped lead were antisemitic and fostered a hostile environment for Jewish students at Columbia, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Rubio's argument is that the United States has a foreign policy of combating antisemitism around the world and that it would undermine this policy objective to tolerate Khalil's continued presence in the United States, they said.\n\n\"We haven't seen anything like this as far as I've been a practicing attorney,\" said Robyn Barnard, an immigration lawyer at Human Rights First. \"It's just really deeply concerning to see the U.S. government deciding to use their limited resources in terms of enforcement of immigration laws to target someone whose speech they just disagree with, but otherwise doesn't seem to violate our First Amendment.\"\n\nTrump has taken measures to try to suppress protests and other activities on campuses that officials in his administration consider anti-Israel or antisemitic, often conflating the two. On Friday, the Trump administration announced it was canceling $400 million of grants and contracts with Columbia, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nWhile a student at Columbia, Khalil, who was a negotiator and spokesperson for the protesters, played a major role in campus protests that broke out after Hamas launched an assault on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping about 250 others. The Israeli military carried out strikes in the Gaza Strip that have killed nearly 50,000 Palestinians, according to health officials there.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests and a student encampment at Columbia -- as well as the university administration's response, which included asking police to clear out protesters -- became a lightning rod in national debates over public criticism of Israel. Some protesters adopted slogans like \"globalize the intifada\" and called for freeing Palestine \"from the river to the sea,\" a phrase that has radically different interpretations by Israelis and Palestinians and which led to accusations of antisemitism.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment Monday. The Department of Homeland Security referred questions to the State Department.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump previewed that he intended to expel foreign students who participated in anti-Israel protests as part of his broader plans for a sweeping crackdown on immigration. He generally framed that plan in terms of canceling student visas, however -- not expelling lawful permanent residents.\n\nKhalil, who was born and raised in Syria, became a lawful permanent resident in 2024 after having entered the United States on a student visa around December 2022 to pursue a master's at Columbia, his lawyers said.\n\nHis lawyers said Khalil was detained Saturday night by four people dressed in plain clothes who entered the lobby of his New York apartment building, which is owned by Columbia, and identified themselves as Homeland Security officers looking to arrest him. Khalil's wife and his lawyers, whom Khalil got on the phone, told the officers that Khalil had a green card, but the agents arrested him anyway, his lawyers said.\n\nA lawful permanent resident, or green-card holder, is protected by the Constitution, which includes First Amendment free-speech rights and Fifth Amendment due-process rights. The Trump administration's attempt to expel Khalil under that statutory provision is likely to face a constitutional challenge, several legal experts said.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAmy Belsher, the director of immigrants' rights litigation at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she could not recall any previous instances in which a secretary of state had invoked that provision since Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act, or INA, in 1952.\n\n\"It's an escalation,\" she said. \"This provision has not been historically invoked and is incredibly vague and would raise real concerns about the weaponization of the INA to remove people who the administration just disagrees with.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nBecause any prior use of the provision appears to have been rare at most, legal specialists were still sorting through what it would mean procedurally -- including whether an immigration judge would need to formally revoke Khalil's green card and issue a final removal order.\n\nIt was also not clear whether administrative removal proceedings, should they be a necessary first step, would delay the ability of Khalil's lawyers to pursue a constitutional challenge in federal court. Khalil's lawyers did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday.\n\nNor was it clear whether any legal challenge to his detention and deportation proceedings would play out in New York, where he was arrested, or in Louisiana. The appeals court that oversees federal judicial proceedings in Louisiana is particularly conservative.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nAt a rally in Iowa on Oct. 16, 2023, Trump declared that, \"in the wake of the attacks on Israel, Americans have been disgusted to see the open support for terrorists among the legions of foreign nationals on college campuses. They're teaching your children hate.\" He added: \"Under the Trump administration, we will revoke the student visas of radical, anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at our colleges and universities, and we will send them straight back home.\"\n\nAt a speech in Las Vegas on Oct. 28, Trump said that \"we'll terminate the visas of all of those Hamas sympathizers, and we'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country.\" And at a Nov. 8 campaign stop in Florida, he said he would \"quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism.\"\n\nOn Monday, Rubio met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in part to discuss efforts to end the war in Gaza. As a Republican senator representing Florida, Rubio was a vocal supporter of Israel in the war, telling one protester confronting him in the Capitol that the \"vicious animals\" of Hamas were to blame for all the devastation and civilian deaths from Israeli military strikes in Gaza.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration invoked an obscure legal statute over the weekend in an attempt to deport a recent Columbia University graduate and lawful permanent resident of the United States who helped lead campus protests against Israel last year,…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-administration-seeks-to-expel-a-green-card-holder-over-student-protests/article_295307a1-1738-503c-8f4b-6b2aef061910.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:12:26","author":"Charlie Savage,Edward Wong,Hamed Aleaziz and Luis Ferré-Sadurní,North Adams Pride","authors":["Charlie Savage","Edward Wong","Hamed Aleaziz and Luis Ferré-Sadurní","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.151},{"id":298810534,"title":"For #MeToo Movement, Mayor's Race in New York City Poses a Test","text":"NEW YORK -- Four years ago, allegations of sexual misconduct turned the New York political sphere upside down.\n\nNumerous allegations against Andrew Cuomo led to his resignation as governor in August 2021; months earlier, Scott M. Stringer, a former city comptroller, saw his bid for mayor fall short after two women accused him of sexual harassment decades earlier.\n\nThis year, three Democratic candidates for mayor of New York City -- Cuomo, Stringer and the incumbent, Eric Adams -- will provide a durability test for the #MeToo movement in New York politics. All three have faced allegations of sexual misconduct; all have forcefully denied the accusations and challenged the accusers in court.\n\nThe contours of the June 24 Democratic primary have mostly centered on issues of competency and who might best steer the city through concerns of public safety, affordability and interference from President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nBut some of the accusers, their lawyers and women's groups are trying to keep the sexual misconduct allegations front and center, hoping to persuade voters that they should be viewed as disqualifying behavior.\n\nBy far, the most visible and most organized effort is aimed at Cuomo. Outside a recent union gathering for the former governor, participants in a \"Women Against Cuomo\" rally shouted to union members who were waiting in line: \"You are endorsing a sexual harasser!\"\n\n\"We're here to remind everyone who thinks that they are supporting a man who's going to stand up for them, who he actually is,\" Erica Vladimer, co-founder of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, said at the rally.\n\nWhen Cuomo held a fundraiser reception in Manhattan on Friday organized by a group of more than 200 women, a smaller competing group, led by one of his most persistent accusers, protested outside.\n\nCuomo told reporters Sunday after attending a church service in Harlem that he did not agree with a report by state Attorney General Letitia James that found that he had sexually harassed 11 women.\n\n\"I said at that time it was wrong, I said at that time it was political, it has been discredited and nothing has come from any of it,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not here to talk about past politics. New Yorkers want to talk about the present, they want to talk about the future.\"\n\nAdams, who is running for a second term while also facing federal corruption charges, was accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a colleague in 1993. The colleague, Lorna Beach-Mathura, said she asked him for career help when he was a police officer. He requested oral sex, forced her to touch his penis and ejaculated on her leg, according to her complaint. Adams' allies have questioned her credibility and history of filing lawsuits.\n\nHer suit was filed under the Adult Survivors Act, which took effect in 2022, but she documented her account a year earlier in emails she sent to the New York Post and to the campaign of Andrew Yang during his 2021 bid for mayor.\n\nAdams and his lawyers have moved to dismiss the case, which could go to trial later this year. Beach-Mathura, who recently declared bankruptcy, said she had tried to publicize her story in 2021 after she was offended that Adams had portrayed himself as a \"law and order candidate.\"\n\n\"I don't think Eric Adams is qualified to be mayor, just like I didn't think he was qualified to be mayor in 2021,\" Beach-Mathura said in a statement.\n\nShe said she was glad that voters would now \"be more informed about who Eric Adams is.\"\n\nKayla Mamelak Altus, a spokesperson for the mayor, said: \"As Mayor Adams has repeatedly stated, these allegations are false, and he has no recollection of ever even meeting this individual -- an individual who, by the way, literally wrote a book on how to file lawsuits because, in her own words, 'You just may win.'\"\n\nBeach-Mathura's claims did not become known until she filed a lawsuit in 2023. The accusations against Stringer surfaced in 2021, when Jean Kim held a news conference to accuse him of sexually assaulting her in 2001 when she was involved in his campaign for public advocate. Another woman, Teresa Logan, accused him of unwanted advances when she worked for him in the 1990s.\n\nKim said Stringer repeatedly groped her without consent, pressured her to have sex and warned her not to tell anyone. Stringer disputed her account, saying they were peers and that their relationship had been consensual.\n\nStringer sued Kim for defamation in 2022, contending that she had done \"irreparable harm to him and his political future.\"\n\nKim's husband, Anthony Caifano, said in an interview that his wife opposed Stringer's campaign but was wary of speaking out because of the defamation case.\n\n\"Jean still stands behind her allegations,\" Caifano said. \"There is a narrative now that her allegations were disproven and they weren't.\"\n\nStringer's campaign sent a six-page document seeking to undermine Kim's claims and arguing that her account was not corroborated.\n\n\"This false allegation has been a difficult and painful experience, and it's been particularly tough on my wife and kids,\" Stringer said in a statement. \"As my children get older, I want them to know the truth, and I am hopeful they will.\"\n\nThe defamation case is pending. In September, a judge denied Kim's request to dismiss the case.\n\nCuomo has gone further. In December, he filed a notice of intent to sue an accuser, Charlotte Bennett, for defamation. Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who accused Cuomo of an unwanted kiss and who attended the protest Friday, said she had had to spend more than $1 million on legal fees.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAnd when Cuomo held a rally last week to kick off his campaign, his lawyer Rita Glavin was close at hand, ready with a quick defense of Cuomo's move to seek an accuser's gynecological records.\n\nOn Monday, Brad Lander, the city comptroller who is running for mayor, criticized Cuomo for costing state taxpayers roughly $60 million in legal fees, including nearly $18 million spent to counter the sexual harassment allegations. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, disputed the figure and said that it included legal fees unrelated to the former governor.\n\nCuomo's launch video referred to painful mistakes from his past without identifying them. Asked by a reporter to name those mistakes, he said he wished he had added more police in the transit system and did not mention the allegations.\n\nAzzopardi said that \"the supreme irony is that the only harassment and bullying going on\" was by the women protesting against the former governor.\n\nSeveral of the accusers say they fear retaliation and have faced financial hardships after telling their stories and that it has been painful for them to navigate the legal system.\n\n\"Emotionally, it's still very upsetting for Jean,\" Caifano said. \"She just wants to move on.\" He added that she could no longer afford to pay for a lawyer to represent her.\n\nHow voters regard the #MeToo allegations may depend on how they weigh the individual circumstances and each candidate's broader record. Still, the allegations could influence some voters in a competitive primary with Cuomo, Adams and Stringer often among the top five candidates in polls.\n\nSuzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia University, said the #MeToo movement had faced setbacks, but it had not disappeared.\n\n\"Not every accusation will result in criminal charges, termination or even political consequences, but that doesn't mean that accusations of sexual harassment and assault have faded from public awareness,\" she said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSome women say the presence of three male candidates with #MeToo allegations underscores the urgency to elect the city's first female mayor. Two women are running: Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, and Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker. Ramos, whom Kim and Boylan have supported for mayor, said in a statement that voters deserved better choices on the ballot.\n\n\"If people think their only choice is between a sex pest and a corrupt liar, of course they're not going to think government can work for them,\" she said. \"How can we keep trusting a system that empowers men who have shown they don't care about us?\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"NEW YORK -- Four years ago, allegations of sexual misconduct turned the New York political sphere upside down.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/for-metoo-movement-mayors-race-in-new-york-city-poses-a-test/article_310cfc40-03b4-5aaa-9e04-d92d47ddf74c.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:10:49","author":"Emma G.

Political speech is protected speech in this country.\"\n\nAfter President Donald Trump posted that Khalil would not be the last pro-Palestinian demonstrator arrested, Osman pledged protesters would not be intimidated.\n\n\"We are just getting started,\" she said. \"I do think protesters should be scared. I think protesters should be upset and angry.\"\n\nDemonstrators carried signs that said, \"No political prisoners in the United States\" and \"Release Mahmoud Khalil.\"\n\nThe arrest of Khalil, a green card holder, also prompted the institution to ramp up security measures in an attempt to thwart any protests.\n\nSEE ALSO | Trump administration cancels $400 million worth of grants and contracts to Columbia University\n\nColumbia public safety has restricted access to three gates on its Morningside Heights campus and it is only open to students, registered guests and alumni.\n\nAn attorney for Khalil said Monday afternoon that he is currently being held at a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. He has not been formally charged with a crime.\n\nHis lawyer, Amy Greer, said the agents who took him into custody at his university-owned home near Columbia initially claimed to be acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa. But when Greer informed them that Khalil was a permanent resident with a green card, they said they would revoke that documentation instead.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim civil rights advocacy group, said Monday that it is working with Khalil's lawyer and called for his immediate release.\n\nKhalil \"is a lawful permanent resident of our nation who has not been charged with or convicted of a single crime,\" the Washington-based group said in a statement. \"The Department of Homeland Security's lawless decision to arrest him solely because of his peaceful anti-genocide activism represents a blatant attack on the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, immigration laws, and the very humanity of Palestinians.\"\n\nSome students told our sister station, ABC7 Eyewitness News in New York, they are outraged.\n\n\"I think we need to protect the integrity of this institution as a place where people can feel comfortable sharing all opinions on these subjects,\" said a Columbia student named Emma. \"And I think this is a violation of academic and of human integrity broadly.\"\n\nKhalil filed a petition in federal court in Lower Manhattan, claiming it has no basis for his detention, other than the federal government is looking to quiet an outspoken activist.\n\nIt names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting ICE New York field office director William Joyce and acting ICE Director Caleb Vitello as respondents.\n\nA federal judge on Monday then temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation while he weighs the petition. A court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday morning.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced that it was cutting $400 million in grants and contracts for Columbia University after saying the institution failed to fight antisemitism on campus.\n\n\"I think that's going to hurt people who have absolutely nothing to do with this,\" said a Columbia student named Brian.\n\nThe Jewish student, who fears retribution, says the government's decision to pull funding is misguided, but says antisemitism is a deep-seeded issue at the university.\n\n\"There's like an embedded systemic problem at Columbia with administrators, faculty and professors,\" Brian said.\n\nHe thinks ICE should go after them, and not the grad student they did arrest, but another student thinks the arrest was the necessary.\n\n\"He has been openly antisemitic. He has engaged in just objective wrongdoing, violating university conduct and rules,\" the student said. \"You know, if the administration doesn't do anything, then it is up to our federal government to show up and hold the student accountable.\"\n\nThere is concern that ICE could return to the campus after the Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"we will be revoking the Visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nRestrictions at additional college campuses are expected after Barnard College announced it would also be increasing security measures on Monday \"due to active concerns for violence.\"\n\nKhalil is the first person known to be detained for deportation under Trump's promised crackdown on students protesting the war in Gaza. He received a master's degree from Columbia's school of international affairs last semester. His wife, who is an American citizen, is eight months pregnant.\n\nFederal immigration authorities also visited a second international student at Columbia over the weekend and attempted to take her into custody but were prevented from entering the apartment, according to a union representing the student. The woman has not been identified, and it's not clear what grounds ICE had for the visit.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"A federal judge has blocked the removal of Mahmoud Khalil from the United States, while he weighs the petition challenging his arrest by ICE agents.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-pro-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-columbia-grad-arrested-ice-new-york/16004047/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16003842_031025-wabc-columbia-protests-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wabc/031025-wabc-palestinian-columbia-student-glassberg-6pm-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:10:37","author":"The Associated Press,WABC","authors":["The Associated Press","WABC"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":298808964,"title":"Elon Musk Says He’s Running His Companies ‘With Great Difficulty’ As Tesla Shares Plummet","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nElon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMusk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business.

Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTesla Stock’s Election Rally Is All Gone—Erasing 91% Gain (Forbes)\n\nStock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’ (Forbes)\n\nTrump’s Net Worth Slides $300 Million As Trump Media Shares Hit 5-Month Low (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Miller, made the disclosure at the start of a two-week hearing in the war crimes case while describing an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty at her Pentagon office over expected staff and budget cuts.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth would be considering the offer under the current formula for the military commission system. But Miller said a military chain of command has yet to send it to him.\n\nThe defendant, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, 60, sat silently with his legal team, at times swiveling in his chair, while Miller described the pretrial agreement, as the plea offer is called.\n\nNashiri, who has been in U.S. custody since 2002, is charged in the longest-running death penalty case at Guantánamo Bay. Two suicide bombers blew up a bomb-laden skiff alongside the Cole during a refueling stop in Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. Nashiri is accused of helping to orchestrate the attack, which killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded dozens of others.\n\nMiller made the disclosure in a bid to suspend the proceedings at least until September 2026 to work on resolving the plea offer or, in the alternative, prepare for trial. The judge has scheduled the trial to begin Oct. 6, days before the 25th anniversary of the attack.\n\nProsecutors have struggled to bring the case to trial since Nashiri's arraignment in 2011. The reasons for the delay include challenges to the evidence, a walkout by a defense team and a decision by a judge to exclude Nashiri's confessions as tainted by torture.\n\nIn that time, parents of sailors who were killed in the attack have died and many victims have stopped traveling to the Navy base to watch the painfully slow pretrial proceedings.\n\nOn Monday, only James G. Parlier, a retired Navy command master chief who survived the attack, was observing the proceedings. For years, he had bristled at the delays and pressed for a capital trial. But on Monday he said he had come to support resolving it through a plea agreement, at the risk of angering some of his former shipmates.\n\n\"We've got to close that chapter of our lives,\" Parlier said. \"There are others who feel the same as me, want to get on with it. I know even if there's going to be a death sentence we'll be old men or dead by then.\"\n\nHe said he had been told that the proposed sentencing range would be 20 years to life imprisonment, and \"I'm fine with that.\" By the time the sentence ended, he noted, Nashiri would be over 80.\n\nA separate filing asks the judge to suspend the case until July 4, 2026, or until after an effort by Elon Musk to downsize the federal workforce \"finishes dismantling the federal government, the Defense Department and the Military Commissions Defense Organization, whichever were to happen sooner.\"\n\nMiller described an atmosphere of anxiety, distraction and disruption in her staff's ability to prepare for a trial, in part because the Trump administration has canceled the contracts of some new members of her team whose hirings were underway at the time of the presidential transition. Other team members who are on probationary status or whose contracts are expiring are awaiting word on whether their jobs will be eliminated.\n\nDefense lawyers have asked to call Hegseth, Musk, the director of the office of military commissions and others to testify on the personnel and policy changes.\n\nMilitary prosecutors objected and will argue against their testimony later in the hearings.\n\nMiller described the guilty plea offer as caught up in the transition between the Biden and Trump administrations. After Nashiri and his defense team signed the document on Dec. 12, Miller said, she brought the offer to Rear Adm. Aaron C. Rugh, the chief prosecutor for military commissions. But he declined to present it to then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, she said.\n\nThe judge, Col. Matthew S. Fitzgerald, acknowledged the political climate. \"We all realize we are operating in dynamic circumstances,\" he said.\n\nIn the war court system, plea agreements are made between a defendant and the overseer of the military commissions, who is called a convening authority. Traditionally, the secretary of defense has delegated that authority to a lawyer.\n\nBut last year Austin took control of the plea agreements after retired Brig. Gen. Susan Escallier, a former career Army lawyer he put in charge of the court, made a deal in the Sept. 11 case. That authority passed to Hegseth when he became defense secretary under President Donald Trump.\n\nThe lead prosecutor in the case, Capt. Timothy J. Stinson, a Navy lawyer, declined to comment on whether he had endorsed the agreement. Miller said in court that he had.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- A Saudi prisoner accused of plotting al-Qaida's bombing of the USS Cole warship in 2000 has signed an offer to plead guilty to avoid a death-penalty trial, his lawyer announced Monday.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/defendant-in-uss-cole-bombing-case-signs-plea-offer/article_f99b3a67-8af5-53e3-85a5-47264477d893.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:09:43","author":"Carol Rosenberg,North Adams Pride","authors":["Carol Rosenberg","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":298808000,"title":"Happy Harriet Tubman Day.

Budget","text":"WASHINGTON -- The stopgap spending bill that Republicans are pushing to avert a shutdown at the end of the week would effectively slash the District of Columbia's budget by roughly $1 billion over the next six months, a change that local leaders warn would force dramatic cuts to essential services.\n\nThe reductions are under consideration because of a series of legislative quirks that Republicans are using to force the District, a Democratically run and predominantly Black city with a significant number of federal workers, to absorb the same freeze to its local budget that they are applying across the federal government. President Donald Trump, who has demonized government employees, has said he wants to \"take over\" D.C.\n\nUnder a law that established \"home rule\" in Washington more than 50 years ago, Congress maintains power over the city, including final approval over its laws and annual budget. Historically, Congress has included routine language in its spending bills that approves the D.C. budget, about 75% of which is funded through local revenues.\n\nBut Republicans omitted the standard language from the temporary spending bill that is set to come to a vote in the House as early as Tuesday. That has thrust Washington's fate into the center of a political debate over funding the U.S. government. Democrats could seek to block the measure in the Senate, but with a Friday deadline looming to keep federal funding flowing, doing so could earn them blame for a government shutdown.\n\nThe bill would largely freeze federal spending at levels approved last year and, if passed as currently written, would also force D.C. to return to the lower spending levels in its budget approved by Congress in 2024.\n\nThat would result in a cut of $1.1 billion mandated halfway through the fiscal year. It would require the district to cut 16% of all remaining funds that have not been spent, according to a memo from Mayor Muriel Bowser's office sent to lawmakers over the weekend.\n\nAt a news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, D.C. leaders urged Congress to revisit the temporary spending measure, saying that the effects of the freeze could be \"devastating\" for the city, likely leading to layoffs in public safety and public schools.\n\nGiven that the budget freeze would come six months into the city's fiscal year, the district would need to scramble within a matter of days to find $1 billion in savings between now and the end of September.\n\nSince much of that money was tied up in contracts, leases and Medicaid, all of which take time to be accessible, local officials warned that the most immediate target for the cuts would be the salaries of city workers, including police officers and teachers.\n\n\"There's no way to cut that kind of money in the time that we would have in this fiscal year not to affect police or not to affect teachers and not to affect some of the basic government services that allow us to keep our city clean, safe and beautiful,\" said Bowser, a Democrat who explicitly appealed to the president's oft-spoken desire for a world-class capital.\n\nBowser said she had been in touch with the White House.\n\n\"They've indicated that it didn't come from them,\" she said of the omission.\n\nLocal officials complained that it was unfair to extend the spending freeze Republicans have agreed to apply to the federal government to Washington, since most of the money in the city's budget comes from D.C. residents, not federal sources.\n\n\"It's not really savings, because these are D.C. dollars,\" said Phil Mendelson, chair of the D.C. Council. \"Most folks, unfortunately, in this country think the District of Columbia is funded by the federal government. We are not.\"\n\nMost of the district's funds are generated through local revenue. Another 24% comes through federal grants, while less than 1% comes from direct federal funds.\n\nD.C. is required to submit a plan balancing its budget over five years, and Bowser last April had proposed about $500 million in cuts in city programs, including the elimination of a program that gives stipends to child care workers and early education teachers. The D.C. Council reversed most of those cuts, including by restoring $70 million to the child care program.\n\nRep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the District of Columbia as a delegate but has no vote in the House, on Monday proposed an amendment to the stopgap spending bill that would allow D.C. to proceed with its budget as planned.\n\n\"D.C. has not been treated as a federal agency for funding purposes in more than 20 years, precisely because doing so can force dramatic overnight cuts to essential services, including police, sanitation and schools,\" Norton said. \"Cuts to these services would work against Republicans' stated goal of improving public safety and order in D.C.\"\n\nBut it seemed unlikely that Republicans would agree to adopt it.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have increasingly sought to weigh in on D.C.'s governance. Last year, the GOP-controlled House voted by large margins for two disapproval resolutions to overturn a pair of laws passed by the D.C. Council.\n\nThey have also used amendments on spending bills to ban the city's ability to tax and regulate the sale of cannabis and prohibit the spending of city funds on abortion services for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The stopgap spending bill that Republicans are pushing to avert a shutdown at the end of the week would effectively slash the District of Columbia's budget by roughly $1 billion over the next six months, a change that…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/gop-spending-bill-would-force-1-billion-cut-to-d-c-budget/article_38c771e7-f364-5cc3-a0a5-ff315bc656c5.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:07:34","author":"Catie Edmondson and Campbell Robertson,North Adams Pride","authors":["Catie Edmondson and Campbell Robertson","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":298806694,"title":"China’s Aluminum Firms Win Big on Stunning Drop in Raw Material","text":"US President Donald Trump’s 25% levy on imports of the lightweight metal starts on Wednesday, driven in part by concerns that China is flooding the world market.

The next stop on his St Patrick’s trip will be the big one: Washington DC.\n\nThe Taoiseach is due to visit US President Donald Trump in the White House on Wednesday, where the two will briefly appear together in front of media before retreating to a private meeting that is scheduled to last nearly an hour.\n\nMartin will be the first European leader to sit down with Trump in the Oval Office since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s tumultuous meeting last month. Everyone watching will be waiting to see whether Trump stays civil this time around or if his temper comes to the fore — and, if it does, how the Taoiseach responds.\n\nThe Taoiseach’s trip comes against the backdrop of international tensions and concerns over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Trump threatening to impose 25% tariffs on goods the US imports from the EU. \n\nMartin has said he’s being offered “a lot of advice” on how to handle Trump.\n\nWe asked our readers what they think the Taoiseach should say to Trump when they meet.\n\nDo they think Martin should raise issues like Ukraine, Gaza and the tariffs? What about the importance of American business to Ireland? Are there other matters people think Martin should raise with Trump – or do our readers think he should stay away from contentious issues altogether? \n\nHere’s what they said.\n\nKeith, Laois\n\n“I think that Micheál Martin should play it safe. Keep criticism to a minimum and all behind closed doors.\n\n“We have to be realistic and understand that Trump is 100% behind Israel and has it in for the EU on trade. So use it more to try and build support in the Irish American lobby to try and fend off the worst of any actions.\n\n“There is a time to play it safe and that is definitely now with this guy in charge of the US.”\n\n“For starters, none of the holier than thou rubbish that the opposition would have us say on Gaza and Ukraine. Micheál Martin needs to be grown up on this special occasion that only the Irish get out of all the countries in the world.\n\n“He needs to discuss how fragile our economy is in relation to tariff wars against Europe. He needs to point out how a majority of Irish holiday in the US, spending on US goods and services.”\n\nPJ recommends Martin asks the US President: “What in the world would have to change so that you would defend us like you defend Israel?” \n\n“I think the Taoiseach should wish the President well and give him a compliment or two. He should remind President Trump that Ireland and the Irish have always had a close relationship with America and Americans.\n\n“Perhaps don’t make a joke about Ireland becoming the 51st US state, as it might give him ideas.\n\n“I don’t think he should mention the jobs American corporations provide in Ireland as that also might give him ideas how to stop that. He wants those jobs for Americans in America.”\n\nFormer Taoiseach Simon Harris meeting former US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office in October 2024Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\n“He should tell Trump that the area of seawater below Florida is the Gulf of Mexico.”\n\n“I believe Trump will use it to humiliate Michéal Martin, be it over our opposition to the genocide of the Israeli government, but more than likely over our corporation tax. He will demand the €14 billion Apple tax back.”\n\n“Keep away from contentious issues.”\n\n“I suggest that as long as immigrant and trade/tariffs dominate discussion that the taoiseach use a ‘single transferable’ speech, and every year repeat Enda Kenny’s comments at his Patrick’s Day visit.”\n\n(Former Taoiseach Enda Kenny’s remarks in Washington in 2017 included reference to St Patrick being an immigrant himself and being now seen as the “patron of immigrants”. He discussed Irish people’s history of migration to the US and how they contributed to the “economic, social, political, and cultural life” of America.)\n\nEnda Kenny presenting Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrock on his St Patrick's Day visit in March 2017Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\n“Micheál Martin should raise issues with President Trump. Words have consequences and threatening ethnic cleansing of Gaza and invading Greenland, which is sovereign territory of a European country, cannot be let slide.\n\n“President Trump is entitled to put what tariffs he likes on US trade. That’s his prerogative.”\n\nThomas, Letterkenny\n\n“I don’t want An Taoiseach to say anything to President Trump that he wouldn’t have said to Biden last year. This is a courtesy by the President of the United States given to the country, not an occasion for him to start grandstanding.”\n\n“I think he should tell him how we, like the rest of the world, are appalled by his & Vice President JD Vance’s treatment of Zelenskyy in the White House. It was absolutely disgraceful.\n\n“I also think he should convey our disgust at Trump’s decision for the US to side with Putin’s Russia, who is the aggressor and who has invaded Ukraine.\n\n“He should also ask Trump how, in the name of God he could cut off all aid and intelligence to Ukraine while they are still being bombed, effectively throwing Ukraine under a bus while they try to defend themselves against a brutal dictator who must be stopped. Has he no conscience?\n\n“He should be asked how he thinks it’s just or fair to demand that Ukraine make peace on Putin’s terms, i.e. concede all the territory they have lost, while receiving no security guarantees from the US – and at the same time give the US the right to strip their country of precious minerals as a repayment for aid given? Zelenskyy would be mad to agree to those terms without getting Nato membership for his country.\n\n“How can Trump possibly know if Putin can be trusted not to invade Ukraine again – or indeed, invade other countries?\n\n“He should ask him: why has he decided to wreck the world economy with his stupid tariffs?\n\n“He should ask him how he could possibly think that the US has any right to take over Greenland or Gaza?”\n\nA street in Rafah, Gaza destroyed by Israel's war. 20 January 2025.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nMargaret, Louth\n\n“Micheál should smile, tell Trump he is great. That is what he wants to hear. We need Trump not to put tariffs on Irish products so we suck it up and pretend to think Trump is wonderful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Winston Churchill said ‘‘when your head is in the lion’s mouth, you do what the lion says’. The better part of valour is discretion.”\n\n“I think that he should highlight issues concerning Irish defence and ask to buy some second hand military equipment from them.\n\n“I think the Taoiseach should mention the Ukraine war and to urge him to give more military aid but I think he should only say that if he promises to provide military aid to Ukraine as we have sent none, and also to let the president know that Ireland plans to increase humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\n“I think he should share the issues Ireland is having with immigration and relate to Trump in that sense. He should say to Trump that any tariffs imposed on Ireland will be responded to with the same force, posing a potential deterrent to any tariffs imposed on Ireland.\n\n“He should remind the president of how a large population of Americans are Irish-American and how Trump has assets in Ireland and to ask Trump not to harm Ireland economically. And I think he should congratulate Trump on his presidency and hope for closer relations between Ireland and the US in the coming years.”\n\n“I hope the meeting between President Trump and Micheál Martin will be cordial. This is not a meeting to discuss world affairs. It is a friendly meeting to honour a tradition over many years to give the president of the United States a bowl of shamrock and say that we hope our two countries can continue to work together to the benefit of both countries and shake hands.”\n\nMaureen, Dublin\n\n“Micheál Martin should stick to non-contentious conversation unless Trump raises some topics about tariffs, Gaza or Ukraine. If that happens, he should state honestly how the Irish people feel.”\n\n“The importance of American business to Ireland. Period.”\n\n“Help Scotland to gain independence.”\n\n“Ireland supports Ukraine, not your delusions of dictatorship.”\n\n“Goodbye, Trump. History will not forget you but it won’t be like Biden who is loved here. You’ll be remembered as the fascist you are.”\n\nAnonymous, Dublin\n\n“I suggest that he wears an Aran jumper to the meeting and gifts Aran sweaters to Trump, Vance and all the team along with the bowl of shamrock.”\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nRodger, Galway\n\n“Keep his visit as short as possible. Don’t mention tariffs, Gaza or his hair. Leave the North off the agenda as a mention of Orangemen could trigger something. Have imodium on standby for such events.\n\n“Do mention Ukraine and the refugees that Ireland took in. Mention historical links, The Quiet Man, Doonbeg and do a quick riverdance twirl and leave with a hididdlyho as he leaves the Oval Office.”\n\nJessie, Mayo\n\n“The Taoiseach should first and foremost urge Trump to pressure Israel to immediately resume delivery of aid and building materials to Gaza, stop annexing the West Bank, progress to the second stage of the ceasefire deal in Gaza, withdraw all Israeli troops from Gaza, release all Palestinians held without charge in Israeli prisons, especially minors, and return the bodies of Palestinians to their families.\n\n“He should speak out against the genocide in Palestine and highlight the importance of international law and ending the illegal occupation. He should state Ireland’s clear intention to enact the Occupied Territories Bill.\n\n“This should be Martin’s main message to represent the vast majority of Irish people who decry the world’s complicity in genocide.”\n\nAnonymous, Mayo\n\n“Since Micheál Martin is determined to humiliate Ireland by handing a bowl of shamrock to a fascist, he might as well play to Trump’s ego.\n\n“During the televised speech he could say, ‘Wasn’t Joe Biden a heartless bastard, killing all those kids in Palestine? But I believe in you, Mr President—you’re not like Sleepy Joe. I know you’ll tell Netanyahu and the Zionazis to feck off and finally give the Palestinians equal rights. That’ll guarantee you the Nobel Prize for Peace, which you obviously deserve. And sure, we’ll even welcome you bigly to Ireland’.”\n\n“My opinion is that Martin would be best to make a point of not visiting Trump as he can only appear supplicatory and has nothing Trump needs other than some sort of fuzzy green appeal to Irish American Trump supporters.\n\n“It will do zero for Ireland’s real economic or soft power interests as Trump will do whatever Trump decides to do unilaterally then or later and without bothering to consider if it’s something we need. Trump is about transactions and pain so supplicating him is utterly pointless.\n\n“If he does go, then I think he should just say Ireland is on the side of justice, rules-based order, equality and free trade that benefits all without being specific to Ireland.\n\n“He should bring up Palestine and Palestinians’ plight and defend Palestinians’ rights and bring up Israel’s genocidal revenge and land grab.”\n\nCiaran, Mayo\n\n“Mr President, the besieged people of Ukraine need the support of the free world just as many Irish received it. We make peace in the world with kindness. We have a saying in Ireland: ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed.’”\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyat Shannon Airport on 27 February 2025 while Zelenskyy was en route to meet Trump in the White HouseAlamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nCatherine, Wexford\n\n“I think that Micheál Martin should avoid politics and concentrate on the links between Ireland and the US, but please don’t invite him on a state visit, we don’t want him in Ireland.”\n\n“It should be clear to everyone that attempting to engage with Trump on any of the current ‘international issues’ would be complete folly. The long-standing undocumented Irish issue is about as much as should be discussed with any hope of making an impression and not damaging relationships.”\n\n“Micheál should refuse to be drawn into an argument about tariffs, undocumented Irish, Gaza or Ukraine while on camera before ‘hand-picked’ media. Those items should be fleshed out off-camera.\n\nThe show piece for the public, where Trump wants to score points to enhance his tough image, should be kept as neutral as possible and no heated reaction to finger-wagging by Trump or Vance, which is their undiplomatic way to provoke controversy.”\n\n“Keep the atmosphere of the visit light with references to the very extensive Irish diaspora in the US, many of whom are Republicans. Do not bring up the subject of Gaza or indeed Ukraine. Remind Trump that Ireland is a member of the European Union and fully supports it. Keep it simple. It is St Patrick’s day after all and a time for celebration, not heavy politics.”\n\n“You would not print what I would love to say to him.”\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nThe Journal Team\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “'Keep things short' and 'avoid politics': What our readers think the Taoiseach should tell Trump”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “'Keep things short' and 'avoid politics': What our readers think the Taoiseach should tell Trump”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nDonald Trump\nIn the White House\nIreland-US relations\nSt Patrick's Day\nst patrick's day trip\n\nthe morning lead\ntrump's tariffs\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nChildren's care home owner sentenced for 'altered' Garda vetting and 'fake' staff background checks\n\nGaeltacht housing\nGaeltacht communities protest over \"depopulation and displacement\" caused by lack of housing\n\nCrew member missing and vessels still ablaze following tanker collision with cargo ship\n\nFive-year-old boy with autism takes legal action against HSE over delay in access to services\n\nnew recruits\n'Hugely positive': Over 6,700 people applied to become gardaí during recruitment drive last month\n\nElon Musk says X has been target of 'massive cyberattack' that originated in 'the Ukraine area'\n\ngood evening\nHere's What Happened Today: Monday \n\nTributes paid to 'absolute gentleman' who died in M50 collision yesterday\n\nCrew member missing and vessels still ablaze following tanker collision with cargo ship\n\nThe Morning Lead\nTaoiseach has landed in the US for perhaps the most high stakes St Patrick's Day visit yet\n\nJane Matthews\n\nReports from Texas\n\nWoman who was raped by three men she met at Dublin nightclub says she was treated as 'an object'\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nDaft.ie Property Magazine\n\nAllianz Home Magazine\n\nThe 42 Sports Magazine\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

We are working with them to determine a date and logistics,\" a White House official told Fox News Digital. A team spokesperson also confirmed to Fox News Digital that \"the Philadelphia Eagles organization has accepted an invitation to visit the White House and is currently working on scheduling a date and logistics.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM There were questions about whether the Eagles would accept an invitation after not doing so in 2018, but Trump told The Spectator late last month that the team would be visiting this time around. \"They’re coming here. Philadelphia is coming here,\" Trump told the outlet. Trump also announced the invite to the team last month. EAGLES TO RECEIVE WHITE HOUSE INVITE AFTER SUPER BOWL LIX WIN, TRUMP SAYS \"They will be [invited]. We haven't yet, but we will be,\" said Trump, who was in the Caesars Superdome to watch the Eagles beat the Chiefs, 40-22. \"I thought it was a great performance by them. Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation. We'll do it right away. We'll do it some time today. They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\" Eagles captain Lane Johnson said a White House visit would be a \"team decision\" after they won the Super Bowl. \"I’d be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we’ll see,\" Johnson said via Sportico’s Eric Jackson. \"It’s ultimately a team decision. I’ll do what’s best for the team.\" Johnson, who has spent all 12 of his NFL seasons with the franchise, was on the team when it won the organization’s first-ever Vince Lombardi Trophy in 2018, defeating the New England Patriots. However, controversy ensued that year when Trump rescinded his invitation to the Eagles as some players said they wouldn’t visit the White House due to the then-45th president’s criticism of those who kneeled or raised their fists during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Trump released a statement at the time regarding his invitation cancellation, saying that \"the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.\" \"They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country,\" Trump’s statement read seven years ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Seven years later, both parties are ready to celebrate a different win. As both sides noted, time and logistics must be worked out as next steps to making the visit. Fox News' Greg Wehner and Jackson Thompson contributed to this report.

And I was only heckled three times.”\n\nPlum’s head of money Rajan Lakhani said: “When people do engage, they realise it’s much easier to take action than they think, whether it’s tax-free returns through an Isa to setting money aside for a rainy day.”\n\nCensuswide surveyed more than 2,000 people across the UK in February.\n\nHere are some jokes from the “Improv” Your Finances book:\n\n– My friend invested badly in balaclavas and now he’s in over his head.\n\n– It’s difficult to know what to do with your money. Someone said I should put it in my current account but I have no interest in that.\n\n– My granddad got into art when he retired. Every week he draws his pension.\n\n– I’ve invested well in a lot of stock, it’s all gravy.\n\n– I love saving so much that I get really annoyed when taking money out of my Isa.

Tuttle is \"no longer affiliated\" with the university after he was allegedly seen tearing down a poster of Israeli hostages during an anti-Israel rally last week. The Harvard Crimson reported on Monday that Tuttle, who had previously worked as a cataloger for the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe Institute, was no longer employed. Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed in a statement Sunday that the \"Harvard employee involved in an incident during a protest last week is no longer affiliated with the University,\" according to the Crimson. Tuttle was allegedly filmed during a Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine rally on March 3 ripping down posters of the Bibas children, Israeli hostages who were killed after being kidnapped by Hamas and brought into Gaza. Their remains were finally returned by Hamas in February. HARVARD PRESIDENT PRIVATELY TELLS FACULTY UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO RETHINK MESSAGING AFTER GOP VICTORY Harvard Chabad, the school’s Jewish student organization, posted the video to their Instagram account shortly after it occurred, identifying the perpetrator as a Harvard library employee. However, the school’s guidelines on doxxing prevented them from displaying his face and name, though it was reported he was wearing Tuttle’s ID badge. Harvard launched an investigation into the matter and Harvard’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, Sherri A. Charleston, confirmed Wednesday that the protester was a university employee in an email to \"University affiliates,\" according to the Crimson. The Crimson reported, \"Charleston wrote in her email that the poster’s removal violates the University’s rules on the use of campus spaces. The rules, released in August 2024, prohibit ‘tampering with or removing’ approved displays.\" She condemned the action at the time as \"hateful\" and an \"affront\" to free speech. \"The response to speech with which we disagree is more speech, not less; it’s more listening, more dialogue,\" Charleston wrote in the email. \"It disparages those in our community when their perspectives or experiences are negated by destructive acts like these.\" \"Let us stand united in condemning acts that undermine the fabric of our community,\" she added.

[+] 2025. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nA South African entrepreneur who spent time at PayPal, is pro-crypto, and just been handed a top tech job by Donald Trump. Before you blurt out your Jeopardy question, here’s a spoiler alert: it’s not Elon Musk. And here’s the real spoiler alert: the question is “Who is David Sacks?”\n\nAmerica’s new AI and crypto czar moves in the same circles as Musk, and the men have much in common. But this isn’t a thought piece on Musk (the internet doesn’t need another one of those) but rather an analysis of Sacks’ next steps now he’s been handed the private keys to America’s crypto kingdom. In the coming months, we’ll get a clear indication of whether the US is serious about making the nation a hub of web3 innovation – or whether its pro-crypto President is merely playing to the crowds.\n\nUnpacking Trump’s Crypto Credentials\n\nBefore we delve into known unknowns, like which crypto initiatives the new US administration is serious about supporting, let’s start with the known knowns. Donald Trump wasn’t always a fan of Bitcoin – virtually no world leaders were at first – but he saw the light quicker than most and has been an unashamed supporter ever since.\n\nWe also know that he’s got no shame when it comes to making a quick buck from crypto, be it indirectly through investment group World Liberty Financial or through questionable but highly successful memecoins launched in his and his First Lady’s names. But only a cynic would assert that his decision to appoint a Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, not to mention the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, was an attempt to justify his memecoin degeneracy.\n\nOn the subject of known knowns, another thing we know is that in his second and final term in office, Trump has hit the ground running, boasting of getting more work done in the first month than the Biden administration did in four years. While that particular claim may warrant scrutiny by the fact-checkers – who suddenly have a lot of spare time in which to parse such statements, now that the Facebooks and Twitters of the world have dispensed with their services – other Trump achievements are less qualitative.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Panic-Selling’ Could Be About To Crash The Bitcoin Price\n\nStock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’\n\nFBI Warning—Delete These Texts On Your iPhone, Android Phone\n\nHe fulfilled his campaign promise to release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of darknet marketplace Silk Road, from a life sentence. This may seem a minor achievement, but Ross is worshiped within a certain libertarian corner of the crypto community, and in honoring his pledge to bring him home, Trump’s shown that he can keep his word on the small things. What then, about the big things like returning crypto innovation to the USA, from which the SEC under Gary Gensler, and with the encouragement of the Biden administration, effectively banished it?\n\nBringing the USD Back Home\n\nThe unabashed Americanism – frequently intermingled with protectionism – that’s defined Trump’s first weeks in office has been rampant. Broadly speaking, his administration aims to bring everything that’s great about the USA back to the USA, from oil production to manufacturing. So it’s no coincidence that one of the first tasks for crypto czar David Sacks is to address the matter of stablecoin regulation.\n\nThere’s a great irony in the bulk of the world’s stablecoins being denominated in USD and yet originating from overseas, out of necessity because of the previous administration. It must rankle with US officials that other nations are essentially capitalizing on the US dollar’s brand and stability, and yet little of these stablecoin issuances are controlled and governed by US regulators.\n\nSacks has already confirmed that stablecoin regulation is one of the first tasks he’ll be tackling, with the goal of giving US businesses greater regulatory clarity on the matter. This will allow them to potentially utilize stablecoins for payments and other services without fearing censure. Senator Bill Hagerty is proposing a bill that will provide new guidance on stablecoins and, ever the businessman, Sacks has been swift to point out the potential revenue that US-based stablecoins could generate while also helping to lower interest rates.\n\nA phone call away at the SEC, Sacks will find an agency willing to lead on crypto matters under the leadership of Hester Peirce, whose character couldn’t be more contrasting with that of Gary Gensler. While Peirce broadly views crypto as an opportunity rather than a threat that must be regulated to kingdom come, she’s naturally keen to prove she’s no pushover, which means that protecting investors must still take priority.\n\nUnder her stewardship, it appears that the SEC’s definition of investor protection will evolve beyond suing any US-adjacent startup that dares to issue a token or dabble in crypto staking. Rather, the agency will focus on practical steps such as clarifying the rules that constitute a digital asset being a security – sensible stuff that will doubtless keep the SEC’s Crypto Task Force busy for the months ahead.\n\nDespite Trump’s famously autocratic style of leadership, there are signs that when it comes to crypto regulation, dialogue beats diktat. A roundtable of US Senators, as well as crypto figures such as Singularity Finance CEO Cloris Chen, recently met to discuss the treatment of digital assets, with the goal of making the US more crypto-friendly. Tax reform, stablecoins, and tokenized assets were among the topics of conversation, with attendees appearing to be broadly aligned in terms of the outcomes they’re seeking: more innovation, less bureaucracy.\n\nBitcoin Reserve, A Strategic One\n\nWith stablecoin regulation, token classification, and red tape reduction all in hand, and David Sacks promising major news on the crypto front very soon, it seems the Trump administration has been adroitly addressing everything on its tech tasklist. During the historic White House Crypto Summit in early March, President Trump pledged to roll back regulations on cryptocurrency and announced plans for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), a major pledge which crypto investors are praying will eventually go through. Expectations need to be tempered, however.\n\nThe short answer as to why this hasn’t happened yet is that it’s a simple concept to propose but a much more complex one to implement, requiring specialist boards, expert committees, and all manner of other policymakers to determine everything from digital asset composition to custodial arrangements. While it’s by no means certain that the SBR will soon come to pass, it remains months – at least – away from being implemented.\n\nIt’s possible that some of Trump’s bolder crypto pledges, will get kicked into the long grass, destined never to resurface. But even if the headline acts have to be quietly canceled, the appointment of figures like Sacks and Peirce signal that the reactionary era of US crypto policy is over. In its place has come something far less radical. The age of common sense crypto is here.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"David Sacks’ next steps will show a clear indication of whether the US is serious about making the nation a hub of web3 innovation, or not.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/10/crypto-enters-common-sense-era-as-us-tech-czar-gets-down-to-business/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67cf052d71a060d001b2a78e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1817,944,x0,y266,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 00:00:00","author":"Contributor,Jim Watson,Sean Lee","authors":["Contributor","Jim Watson","Sean Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":298810610,"title":"Elon Musk accuses Mark Kelly of betraying his country for backing Ukraine","text":"Elon Musk and Sen.

He added that any peace deal with Russia “has to protect Ukraine’s security and can’t be a giveaway” to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nKelly also criticized President Donald Trump, saying he was “trying to weaken Ukraine’s hand.”\n\n“You are a traitor,” Musk wrote on X on Monday, the platform he owns, in response to Kelly’s posts.\n\n“Traitor?

I’ve sworn an oath to this country, I’ve flown in combat, I served in the Navy for 25 years.

Other days, he borrows language from the insults hurled at him by middle-school peers, and says he wishes he were “a real boy.”\n\nJake has identified as transgender for as long as he can remember; at 2 years old, he pointed to his mother’s pregnant stomach and declared that he was soon to be a big brother.\n\nStill, no amount of time could prepare 13-year-old Jake or his mother, Allison (both mother and son have requested pseudonyms to protect their identities), for the recent slew of political threats to transgender children.\n\n“I used to think, if I provided him with a really supportive environment, if I didn’t allow people that do not support him into our lives, if I took him to the Gender Clinic — if I did everything you’re supposed to do to take care of a trans child — then he would be good,” said Allison. “But that’s just not the case.”\n\nTensions between Maine lawmakers and the Trump administration have escalated in recent weeks over Maine’s policy allowing transgender girls to play sports in line with their gender identities.\n\nFollowing a viral social media post by Maine House Republican Laurel Libby, R-Auburn — a critique of the state’s policy accompanied by a photograph of a transgender high school athlete — President Donald Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine schools.\n\n“See you in court,” responded Maine Gov. Janet Mills, when President Trump addressed her at a meeting of governors in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Trump administration and lawmakers across the country have been taking aim at transgender people in recent weeks. One of the first executive orders signed by President Trump called on the federal government to define sex as only male or female; another, since temporarily blocked by a federal judge, seeks to stop transgender people under 19 from accessing gender-affirming care.\n\nIn Iowa, lawmakers recently passed, and Gov. Kim Reynolds signed, a bill removing gender identity from state civil rights protections. In addition to the federal executive orders, more than 690 bills across 49 states currently target transgender individuals, including bills recently introduced in Maine.\n\nWhile the landscape has injected fear into the lives of transgender children and their families, organizations that support LGBTQ+ youth said Maine’s legal protections remain strong.\n\nExecutive orders do not function as laws; they are subject to over-rule by Congress and the Supreme Court, said Mary Bonauto, senior director of civil rights and legal strategies at GLAD Law. Withdrawing funding allocated by Congress “is not something that is simply at the will of the president,” said Bonauto.\n\n“If the federal government is going to place a condition on funding, there are processes that they must go through that are real and take time. Funding conditions cannot deny constitutional rights.”\n\nCongress is invested with the “power of the purse,” the ability to tax and spend public money. As the Trump administration tests the boundaries, however, it remains uncertain to what extent the Supreme Court will issue a check on the use of executive power.\n\nQuestions over control of funding appropriated by Congress are already making their way through the courts. Earlier this week, a federal judge blocked an attempt by the Trump administration to withhold funding from hospitals providing gender affirming treatment; on Wednesday, a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\nIn a conversation with the Portland Press Herald, Dmitry Bam, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maine Law School, said there is “rightful skepticism” regarding the likelihood that the Supreme Court will limit presidential authority. (The University of Maine is currently under federal investigation for Title IX compliance, following Trump’s threat to pull funding from Maine schools that don’t comply with the executive order. Representatives from the law school declined to speak for this story).\n\nSeveral advocates in Maine, however, said they had “relative confidence” the state would continue protecting the rights of transgender Mainers.\n\n“I would be very surprised to see any anti-trans legislation come out of this [the Maine] Legislature,” said Bre Danvers-Kidman, executive director of MaineTransNet and the first openly nonbinary person to run for U.S. Senate, in early February.\n\nWhen The Maine Monitor checked in with Danvers-Kidman this week they expressed somewhat more trepidation.\n\n“We are starting to see the federal government test the waters with financial pressure … it’s a lot of federal money [on the line] and it’s scary. But we’ve seen no indication that Maine intends to back down on protecting our human rights,” said Danvers-Kidman, adding that they’re heartened by statements from Gov. Mills, Attorney General Frey, and the Maine Principals Association in support of transgender Mainers.\n\nBoth Danvers-Kidman and Gia Drew, executive director of MaineTransNet, cited the Maine Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on a protected class, including gender identity and gender expression, in employment, housing, places of public accommodation, education, and extension of credit, as an additional bulwark against the federal pullback on transgender rights.\n\nCONFRONTATION OVER TRANS ATHLETES ESCALATES\n\nThe confrontation between the state and the Trump Administration has intensified in recent weeks, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services finding that Maine is in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender student-athletes to compete in women’s sports.\n\nThe letter announcing the finding came on Feb. 25, just four days after the U.S. DHHS opened its investigation; no state officials were interviewed before the U.S. DHHS reached its findings. The Department is also investigating the Maine Department of Education and the University of Maine System.\n\nIn addition to the federal DHHS investigations, Maine has been the target of several probes since the spat in D.C., including by the U.S. Department of Education, which said it was investigating the Maine Department of Education and SAD 51, the Greely school district, for allegedly violating Title IX, and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said it was investigating the University of Maine.\n\nThere are also several bills related to trans athletes in girls’ sports making their way through the Maine legislature. L.D. 233, sponsored by Rep. Richard Campbell, R-Orrington, would bar transgender athletes from playing on girls’ sports teams. A similar bill, L.D. 868, sponsored by Rep. Liz Caruso, R-Caratunk, would bar transgender girls from girls’ sports teams, bathrooms, and changing rooms. It drew a crowd of both supporters and opponents to the State House in late February.\n\nMaine House Joint Resolution 500 seeks to pull funding from any educational institution that pays dues, or is a member of, an organization that allows trans girls to play sports in alignment with their gender identities.\n\nGov. Mills has refused to take a position on the state’s policies governing transgender students’ participation in athletics, saying recently that the topic was “worthy of a debate” in the State House.\n\nWhile polling by the Washington Post in 2023 showed that a majority of Americans support laws prohibiting discrimination against trans people, fewer appear to support the participation of trans athletes in girls’ sports. A January 2025 New York Times/Ipsos poll found that only 18% of Americans believe transgender female athletes — those who were assigned male at birth — should be allowed to compete in women’s sports.\n\n“How are people falling for the idea that the biggest problem in our state is a handful of children who want to play sports?” asked Danvers-Kidman in response to the recent events. When it comes to physical advantages in sport, they added, there are as many variances between cis-gender kids of the same gender as there are between kids of different genders. “It’s not about sports, it’s about who is expendable in our society.”\n\nThe Maine Principals’ Association has reaffirmed in recent weeks its support for transgender athletes competing in sports that align with their gender identity, a policy it says aligns with the Maine Human Rights Act.\n\nGENDER-AFFIRMING CARE, PROVIDERS ALSO TARGETED\n\nLawmakers in Maine are also taking aim at health care for transgender people, particularly children. L.D. 380, sponsored by Sen. David Haggan, R-Penobscot, would change laws that protect patients who seek gender-affirming care, and the medical professionals who provide it, modifying the law with regards to address confidentiality, medical malpractice insurance, and other provider protections. The bill has yet to be scheduled for a hearing.\n\nMaine law protects the right to gender-affirming care and ensures coverage under private health plans and MaineCare. Maine is also one of 14 states (plus D.C.) that protect minors’ rights to best practice, gender-affirming medical care.\n\nIn June 2023, Gov. Mills signed into law L.D. 535, which allows transgender minors to receive gender-affirming puberty-blockers and hormone treatment — but not surgery — without the consent of their parents, if they meet the following criteria: they are at least 16 years old, they have received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (a term used to describe psychological distress resulting from incongruence between a person’s gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth), they are experiencing harm or will experience harm without this care, and they are mentally and physically able to provide consent.\n\nIn 2024, Gov. Mills signed a shield law, which protects Maine’s providers of reproductive and gender-affirming care from retaliation by states with more restrictive policies. Maine became one of only 14 states with a shield law protecting gender-affirming care. Similar laws protecting those providing abortion care across state lines are currently being tested in court.\n\nEfforts to block care for minors go against medical research and the endorsements of every major health organization, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, said advocates.\n\n“When all the major medical associations say that gender-affirming care is appropriate when you have a certain diagnosis, politicians should not be getting involved in the decision-making process between a young person, their doctor, and their family,” said Drew of EqualityMaine.\n\nThe debate on gender-affirming care for minors — including what constitutes “best practice” — has engendered strong emotions across the political spectrum. But only a very small percentage of minors actually receive gender-affirming surgery and medications.\n\nA recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics analyzed private insurance claims from 2018 to 2022 to find that less than 0.1% of transgender and gender diverse minors received puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormone treatment.\n\nOver email, lead author Landon Hughes told The Maine Monitor that he is not aware of any state-level data that reflects the number of adolescents in Maine using gender-affirming medications. Danvers-Kidman, of MaineTransNet, said the percentage of Maine minors on hormone treatment is likely much smaller than 0.1%, as this figure includes both hormones and puberty blockers.\n\n“Minors in particular, but all patients getting transition-related care, are [starting with] the least invasive, least-permanent treatments,” said Danvers-Kidman. “Puberty blockers just give you more time to make a decision about whether you want to go through the puberty that your body would naturally do, or whether a different choice would cause less harm to you.”\n\nAs for gender-affirming surgery, a 2024 study analyzed insurance claims from 2019 to find similarly low rates among minors. The vast majority (96.4%) of gender-affirming surgeries among adolescents involved the chest, and 97% of adolescent breast reductions were performed on cisgender boys.\n\nTo Allison, the political debate on gender-affirming care complicates an already taxing process for transgender youth and their families.\n\nThroughout his childhood, Jake would visit the MaineHealth Gender Clinic to test for signs of puberty, via bone density scans. A few years ago, he started puberty blockers. Jake cannot start hormone treatment until he turns 14, in accordance with current medical standards.\n\n“But most of his peers have already gone through puberty. He’s going to be in high school next year. He really wants to start T[estosterone],” said Allison, who also said she has discussed many difficult topics with her son, including the fact that he will not have biological children if he continues with treatment. Jake already knows this, said Allison, and he does not wish to go through female puberty or to be pregnant.\n\n“The potential for him to lose access to health care is terrifying,” said Allison. “There’s just a few more years before he turns 18. Hopefully, they’ll leave him alone after that.”\n\nRepresentatives of LGBTQ+ focused organizations are quick to point out that the impacts of anti-transgender executive orders extend far beyond the potential legal ramifications.\n\nAccording to a National Survey by the Trevor Project, roughly half of all transgender and nonbinary youth in the U.S. seriously considered attempting suicide in 2023. The survey found worsened mental health outcomes following anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, and improved outcomes among youth who found their schools and home environment to be gender-affirming.\n\nIn a 2022 JAMA Network study, transgender youth with access to gender-affirming care were far less at risk of committing suicide.\n\nDespite the current environment, said Allison, Jake is a joyful and charismatic kid.\n\n“He loves musical theater. He loves video games. He likes to play basketball,” said Allison, smiling. “He’s just a kid.” She credited the protections in Maine, her son’s access to gender-affirming care and the supportive environment in which he lives for his positive attitude.\n\nMedical providers, including Planned Parenthood, MaineHealth and Northern Light Health, Maine’s two largest hospital systems, said they will continue to provide gender-affirming care.\n\n“MaineHealth has made no change to its service offerings following the President’s executive order regarding transgender health care as it continues to evaluate the scope and meaning of all the executive actions undertaken by the new administration,” wrote MaineHealth spokesperson John Porter via email.\n\nMaine Attorney General Aaron Frey also affirmed the state’s commitment in recent weeks, joining a coalition of 15 state attorneys general to release a joint statement.\n\n“We stand firmly in support of health care policies that respect the dignity and rights of all people,” wrote the attorneys general. “Health care decisions should be made by patients, families, and doctors, not by a politician trying to use his power to restrict your freedoms.

It has seen the United States suspending military aid to Ukraine and the sharing of strategic information.\n\n And possibly the most visible example of the breakdown in the relationship between the US and Ukraine came with a heated debate at the White House between Trump and Zelensky, with the images broadcast around the world. Trump claimed Zelensky was “disrespectful” and “gambling with WW3” in an ugly confrontation at the Oval Office. \n\nLikely to be happiest with the arguments would have been Russia. Nate Vance, the vice-president's cousin, who has reportedly fought for Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, accused Trump and Vance of “ambushing” Zelensky in order to \"placate\" Putin.\n\n Speaking to Le Figaro, Vance said: “Donald Trump and my cousin clearly believe they can placate Vladimir Putin. They are wrong. The Russians are not about to forget our support for Ukraine.\" Nate, who returned to the United States in January, continued: “We are Vladimir Putin’s useful idiots.\" \n\nThe Vice President's cousin apparently travelled to Ukraine just three weeks after the country was invaded in February 2022 and enlisted in the “Da Vinci Wolves” battalion, which saw action in some of the conflict's bloodiest battles to date.\n\nIn contrast to his cousin, Vice President Vance has long been ambivalent on the issue of the Ukrainian war. Before the invasion, Vance infamously said: “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.” However, despite his criticism of his cousin's approach to Ukraine, Nate admitted that the Vice President was a “good guy, intelligent\" but was playing the \"game of politics\".\n\n“When he criticised aid to Ukraine, I told myself that it was because he had to please a certain electorate, that it was the game of politics,” Nate said. But he added about the meeting at the Oval Office with Zelensky: \"What they did to Zelensky was an ambush of absolute bad faith.”","summary":"United States President Donald Trump and JD Vance have been called &quot;Vladimir Putin's 'useful idiots'&quot; by the vice-president's own cousin over their behaviour towards Ukraine","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/jd-vance-branded-putins-useful-34835171","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34835179.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_trump-vance-putin-main.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 23:52:59","author":"Tim Hanlon","authors":["Tim Hanlon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.238}]}
