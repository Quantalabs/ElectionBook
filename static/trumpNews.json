It feels – at the very least, it’s careless.’\n\nThe joint investigation by CFIA and CBC discovered that from November 2024 to mid-July, the CFIA received 97 complaints about product country-of-origin claims. \n\nAmong those reviewed, 32 percent stemmed from company violations, mostly concerning bulk produce, according to CBC. The reported breaches have since been addressed, as per the outlet.\n\nThe term ‘Maple Washing’ was coined earlier this year as trade war tensions grew, and tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration led many Canadians searching for homegrown products. \n\nDineen found herself in Sobeys grocery store shopping for organic broccoli under signage that said ‘product of Canada’.\n\nBut when she inspected further, the tag on the product said ‘produce of USA.’ \n\nCBC investigated other stores operated by Sobeys, Loblaws, and Metro in Toronto and found similar issues. \n\n‘At each store, one or more country-of-origin shelf signs in the produce section stated the accompanying product was a “product of Canada” or Mexico, but the product’s sticker or packaging said it was a “product of USA”,’ the outlet reported. \n\nSobeys was found to have labeled products such as almonds and avocado oil with Canadian flags and ‘Made in Canada,’ which resulted in an April case that eventually led to no repercussions for the chain.\n\n‘We don’t grow almonds in this country. Those should not meet the Made in Canada threshold,’ Mike von Massow, a professor in the Department of Food, Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Guelph.\n\nWhile some errors can be attributed to human error and short staffed grocers, shoppers are growing tired. \n\nIn a statement to CBC, a spokesperson for Sobeys said: ‘Fresh produce can change week-to-week and unfortunately mistakes can happen from time to time.’\n\nSobeys, Loblaw and Metro told the outlet that they strive for accurate country-of-origin signage, and noted the difficulty of dealing with large amounts of inventory. \n\nA Reddit thread, simply called ‘Maple-washing Safeway,’ exposed an example of dishwasher tablets with ‘Product of USA’ on the back with a Canadian flag stuck next to its pricing label. \n\n‘Just another post about shady practices by grocery stores. Local Safeway thinks we can’t read,’ the post said. \n\nOne user fumed: ‘There needs to be penalties for misleading consumers!’\n\n‘Why are Canadian entities that are supposed to protect Canadian consumers not giving out massive fines and forcing and mandating changes in significant ways to various corporations that abuse Canadian consumers time and time again?!’ another raged. \n\n‘It’s beyond absurd, it is ignorant, insulting and allows those massive corporation to take advantage of Canadian consumers without repercussions in any significant way to help prevent it from happening again to alleviate the concerns of Canadian consumers of being pick pocketed by them over and over.’\n\n‘I’ve noticed Loblaws doing this too. They mark them as Canadian because “the store brand is Canadian” but the product wasn’t made in Canada,’ a comment pointed out. \n\nThe Buy Canadian Movement has not only been a contentious topic for outrage caused by maple-washing, but also for the cost of non-imported goods. \n\nFood labelling expert Mary L’Abbé said that in just six months the Buy Canadian Movement had shoppers losing their patience. \n\n‘It’s important to Canadians, and I think they have a responsibility to their consumers who expect them to interpret the regulations correctly,’ said L’Abbé, a nutritional sciences professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. \n\n‘I think the retailers have to step up to the plate and actually get their act together.’ \n\nDineen said: ‘Why would you put a Maple Leaf on a product that very clearly is imported? It just erodes the trust. It just makes you think, “OK, so that’s meaningless.”‘\n\nCanada recently removed its retaliatory tariffs on US goods in August, signaling a major thaw in trade tensions between Canada and the US.\n\nThe move aimed to reset trade talks between the two countries, and should lead to lower tariffs on Canadian goods entering the US.\n\nThe move came a day after Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump spoke by phone for the first time since the two countries missed a self-imposed deadline to reach a trade agreement earlier this month.\n\nIn March, Canada imposed counter-tariffs of 25 percent on a wide range of US products after Washington slapped duties on steel and aluminum.\n\nCarney said the rollback, starting September 1, will match US exemptions on goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal (USMCA).\n\nHowever, Canada’s 25 percent tariffs on US autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place for now — costs that will be felt more acutely by Canadian consumers than American ones.\n\nIn July, former President Trump announced he would raise U.S. tariffs on Canada to 35 percent, citing both the rise of fentanyl and Canada’s reluctance to cooperate with the U.S. as factors in his decision.\n\nThe Trump administration later exempted goods covered by the trade deal.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDozens of Canadian supermarkets have been exposed for hiding &#8216;Made in USA&#8217;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Canadian Supermarkets Exposed for Concealing &#8216;Made in USA&#8217; Labels During Tariff Dispute first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/canadian-supermarkets-exposed-for-concealing-made-in-usa-labels-during-tariff-dispute/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dozens-of-Canadian-supermarkets-busted-for-hiding-Made-in-USA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-14 00:04:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":360289546,"title":"Lisa Cook called Atlanta condo a ‘second home’ in some documents","text":"Sept. 13 (UPI) -- Federal Reserve Gov.

According to her family's attorney, she had recently moved in with her partner, was taking English classes, and had texted that she was on her way home before the fatal attack.The case has prompted federal charges and calls for enhanced public transit security, while highlighting systemic issues around repeat offenders and mental health treatment.What To KnowThe Fox News exchange began as co-hosts discussed Brown's extensive criminal history and the broader homelessness crisis.Co-host Lawrence Jones argued for eliminating choice in treatment options, stating: \"This is happening all across the country, and it's not a money issue. They have given billions of dollars to mental health and the homeless population. A lot of them don't want to take the programs, a lot of them don't want to get the help that is necessary. You can't give them a choice. Either you take the resources that we're going to give you, or you decide that you are going to be locked up in jail. That's the way it has to be now.\"Kilmeade then interjected with his execution proposal: \"Or involuntary lethal injection.\"When Jones responded \"Yeah,\" Kilmeade continued: \"Or something. Just kill them.\"Co-host Ainsley Earhardt showed no objection to the statement, instead asking: \"Yeah, Brian, why did it have to get to this point?\"The conversation then shifted to electoral politics, with Kilmeade arguing that voters need to elect candidates who would be tougher on crime. He specifically criticized several district attorneys and urged North Carolina voters to support stricter law enforcement policies, connecting the discussion to upcoming elections and criminal justice policy.On Thursday, in a letter to the Chief Judge of North Carolina Judicial District 26, Roy H. Wiggins, 10 Republicans questioned Judge Teresa Stokes, a magistrate judge for the Charlotte District in Mecklenburg County Court, North Carolina, over her decision to release Brown in a case earlier this year. They said this decision gave \"grounds for removal.\"In January 2025, Brown was arrested for alleged \"misuse of the 911 system\" and was released after signing a written promise to appear at his next court hearing, according to court documents signed by Stokes and seen by Newsweek.He previously was convicted of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon and communicating threats, leading to a six-year prison sentence in 2015 for incidents dating to 2013 and 2014. He was released in 2020; then, months later, he was charged with assaulting his sister.The GOP lawmakers added that releasing Brown \"had devastating consequences\" and that Zarutska's murder was \"a direct result of failure of judicial responsibility.\"What People Are SayingCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom responded to the Fox News exchange with Proverbs 21:13 on X: \"Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.\"President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic.\"He continued: \"The perpetrator was a well known career criminal, who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January, a total of 14 TIMES. What the hell was he doing riding the train, and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP. The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer's knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail, including Former Disgraced Governor and 'Wannabe Senator' Roy Cooper.\"\"North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it! Additionally, where is the outrage from the Mainstream Media on this horrible tragedy? VOTE FOR MICHAEL WHATLEY FOR UNITED STATES SENATE, HE WON'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!\"Charlotte City Council Member Edwin Peacock III, a Republican, on X August 30: \"A week ago, 23-year-old #IrynaZarutska was brutally killed on Charlotte's light rail. Her death is a tragedy we cannot ignore. Who's riding without paying? Are they the ones causing problems? We need answers.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi said Brown would: \"Never again see the light of day as a free man.\"What Happens Next?Brown is being held without bond at the Mecklenburg County Jail. A judge has ordered a competency evaluation, according to WBTV. His next court appearance is scheduled for September 19.Meanwhile, the new federal charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or execution.","summary":"Fox News host Brian Kilmeade proposed executing homeless people with mental illness who refuse help during a show discussion.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-host-proposes-lethal-injection-homeless-2129492","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2721980/ainsley-earhardt-left-brian-kilmeade.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4a1d613d7dd8a5754ffc7d5bc7971426","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 23:34:41","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":360285418,"title":"Accused Charlie Kirk killer awaits formal charges","text":"The Utah trade school student jailed on suspicion of fatally shooting right-wing activist Charlie Kirk will be charged next week over an act of violence widely seen as a foreboding inflection point in US politics.\n\nTyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night after relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Governor Spencer Cox said on Friday, telling a press conference, \"We got him\".\n\nThe arrest capped a 33-hour manhunt for the lone suspect in Wednesday's killing, which President Donald Trump called a \"heinous assassination\".\n\nKirk, co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and a staunch Trump ally, was killed by a single rifle shot fired from a rooftop during an outdoor event attended by 3000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem.\n\nA bolt-action rifle believed to be the murder weapon was found nearby, and police released images from surveillance cameras showing a \"person of interest\" wearing dark clothing and sunglasses.\n\nA break in the case came when a relative and a family friend told the local sheriff's office he had \"confessed to them or implied that he had committed\" the murder, Cox said.\n\nRobinson, a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah's public university system, was taken into custody at his parents' house, about 420km southwest of the crime scene.\n\nRobinson was held on suspicion of aggravated murder and other charges that were expected to be formally filed in court early next week, the governor said.\n\nKirk's movement, meanwhile, announced on Saturday that a memorial event for Kirk will be held on September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nThe killing has stirred outrage among Kirk's supporters and condemnation of political violence from across the ideological spectrum. Allies of Kirk have taken to the internet in organised efforts to try to have anyone minimising or mocking his death fired from their jobs.\n\nCox called Kirk's murder a \"watershed in American history\" and compared it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nHe declined to discuss possible motives for the killing. Investigators found messages engraved into four bullet casings, which included references to memes and video game in-jokes. One casing, according to the arrest affidavit, had been inscribed: \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao\".\n\nMany Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence - even as the president and his allies routinely invoke violent imagery against their opponents.\n\nState records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. A relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nKirk's murder comes amid the most sustained period of US political violence in decades. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump himself has survived two attempts on his life, one that left him with a grazed ear during a campaign event in July 2024 and another two months later foiled by federal agents.\n\nDemocrats have fallen victim, too. In April, an arsonist broke into Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence and set it on fire while the family was inside. In June, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife.","summary":"A memorial for assassinated right-wing activist Charlie Kirk will be held in his home state of Arizona in a week as police prepare to charge his accused killer.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/crime/accused-charlie-kirk-killer-awaits-formal-charges-c-20013286","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20013286/4fdeab88073492f552e6e8d3b4396f39b03c2d52-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 23:30:33","author":"Andrew Hay","authors":["Andrew Hay"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":360284340,"title":"Huge 'gas explosion' in Bradford 'blows up house on residential street': Emergency services rush to the scene","text":"Latest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: 100 new Epstein emails 'that could destroy' Prince Andrew: Cache of 'devastating' messages between the Duke and convicted paedophile unearthed in US probe\n\nStarmer cried: 'You're supposed to be protecting me'.

Moscow, which invaded the Eastern European nation in February 2022, announced a pause in peace talks with Ukraine and accused European nations of hindering the process, according to Reuters.Moscow also accused Kyiv of not recognizing \"the realities on the ground,\" while Ukraine continues to accuse Russia of not genuinely pursuing any peace deal.Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress since returning to office, having claimed he would swiftly bring the conflict to an end once he was president again. He admitted earlier this year that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be just \"tapping me along\" about seeking a peace deal, and he has criticized Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of not taking the appropriate steps to reach a deal.What To KnowOn Saturday, Trump took to Truth Social to demand NATO members end their use of Russian energy before he commits to more sanctions, arguing that once that economic pipeline was shut off, he could also increase tariffs on China, fully suffocate Russia's economy and end \"this deadly but ridiculous war.\"\"I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" Trump wrote.The president continued: \"If NATO does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States.\"Europe had agreements to buy Russian gas that expired at the end of 2024, at which point Ukraine cut off the gas transit, upsetting Russian officials, who warned the decision would have \"the most negative impact on the standard of living of European citizens.\"Retired U.S. Admiral and former Supreme Allied Commander of Europe James G. Stavridis on Saturday backed Trump's ultimatum, saying during an appearance on CNN: \"Let's point out that the vast majority of Russian oil and gas is no longer purchased by Europe, but there are still some holdouts. The president is right to call those out.\"\"At the same time, we're going to need not only that economic package, but also those sanctions, particularly against China, and, finally, I think we need to look at confiscation of Russian resources, their assets that are held in European banks in Brussels,\" he said. \"We need both economic and military tools to get the attention of Vladimir Putin.\"Russia has continued to evade sanctions by selling its energy to nations such as India and China, which led Trump to hit both with heavy sanctions—a move that upset India after an otherwise conciliatory relationship.Why Do Some NATO Countries Still Buy Russian Oil?Part of the appeal is Russia's willingness to sell at a cut rate, making the energy cheap as global costs for oil and gas remain high, which has contributed to the cost-of-living crisis in some countries.Some NATO members still buy oil from Russia—chiefly, Turkey, which has been the third-largest buyer after China and India between January 1, 2023, to July 30, 2025, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Turkey has spent around $90 billion on Russian energy, with about $62 billion spent on oil alone.Hungary and Slovakia also continue to buy oil from Russia, with Hungary buying around $13.4 billion on oil and gas and Slovakia spending around $10 billion on oil and gas—making them both top 10 importers of Russian energy.It remains unclear if Trump will directly confront Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, both of whom have been allies to the American president.The European Union (EU) attempted to shift away from Russian energy by switching over to a supply line operated by Azerbaijan, but some researchers have suspected that Azerbaijan has imported more fuel from Russia to then pass along to Europe in order to meet the demand, according to Politico. However, Azerbaijan has insisted that any gas imported from Russia is for domestic use only.","summary":"Amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, President Trump has demanded NATO members that still buy Russian oil and gas end their reliance and find new supplies.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nato-nations-hooked-russia-oil-gas-energy-2129488","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2721976/czech-republic-russian-gas-oil.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=83f0a8eaa90e87eb684c559dd054a061","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 23:28:28","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":360284328,"title":"Trump and Melania 'thrilled' Kate will be 'front and centre' during two-day State visit","text":"President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania are 'thrilled' that the Princess of Wales will be 'front and centre' during their two-day State visit.\n\nKate will greet the couple alongside husband William in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Wednesday morning and formally introduce them to the King and Queen.\n\nThe two couples will then enjoy a horse-drawn carriage procession through Windsor Great Park with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nKate will join the Trumps for lunch followed by a visit to see artwork in the Royal Collection. \n\nThe Trumps will then pay a private visit to the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II at St George's Chapel.\n\nPresident Trump will visit Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers, where he will be welcomed by bagpipers, and be shown items from the Sir Winston Churchill archives provided by the National Trust at Chartwell House. \n\nThe two leaders will also host a reception with British and US investors, such as GSK, Microsoft and Rolls-Royce, and witness the signing of a new tech partnership deal, before a lunch of Dover sole with peas and potatoes.\n\nThe princess, who is recovering from cancer, will appear at a State banquet on Wednesday evening and then join Melania in Frogmore Gardens in the castle grounds the next morning, where they will be shown the Scouts' Squirrels programme.\n\nA Trump source said: 'The President and First Lady are thrilled that the Princess of Wales will play such a prominent role in their visit.\n\n'The inclusion of Princess Kate in so many events during the state visit is an honour. \n\n'The Trumps very much hoped she would be part of their visit but nothing was confirmed until this week because of the princess's health situation.","summary":"President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania are 'thrilled' that the Princess of Wales will be 'front and centre' during their two-day State visit.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15095989/Trump-Melania-thrilled-Kate-State-visit.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/13/23/102115073-0-image-m-50_1757803189423.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 23:20:01","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.204},{"id":360289034,"title":"Dem Rep Keeps Up Post Calling Alleged Charlie Kirk Assassin ‘MAGA’ After Authorities Said He Was Leftist","text":"California Rep.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia was deliberately expanding its drone operations and that the West needed to respond with tougher sanctions and closer defense cooperation. In Washington, President Trump said he was ready to impose major sanctions on Russia — just as soon as all NATO nations did the same thing and stopped buying Russian oil. Romania's defense ministry said Saturday that the country's airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighboring Ukraine. The country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets late on Saturday to monitor the situation following the strikes, said a defense ministry statement. The jets \"detected a drone in national airspace\" and tracked it until \"it disappeared from the radar\" near the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, it added.Also Saturday, Poland said it and its NATO allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine not far from its border. Because of the drone threat, \"Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached their highest level of alert,\" the country's military command posted in a statement on X. Later Saturday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the high alert had been lifted, while cautioning: \"We remain vigilant.\" Poland and its fellow NATO countries have been on their guard since Warsaw said nearly 20 Russian drones entered its airspace overnight Tuesday to Wednesday. While Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries including France, Germany and Sweden have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response. \"Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"Also today, Poland responded militarily to the threat of Russian attack drones,\" which had also been active in different regions of Ukraine all day, he added. The Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air,\" said Zelenskyy. The latest drone incursions were \"an obvious expansion of the war by Russia\", he added. What was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defense system, Zelenskyy argued. \"Do not wait for dozens of 'shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,\" he warned, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday expressed concern at the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace earlier in the week. If it turned out to have been deliberate, \"then obviously it will be ... highly escalatory,\" he told reporters in Washington. Mr. Trump's suggestion on Thursday that the incident might have happened by \"mistake\", was quickly dismissed by Tusk.","summary":"Romania's defense ministry said Saturday that the country's airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighboring Ukraine.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/romania-scrambles-fighter-jets-after-reporting-drone-incursion-russia-ukraine/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/13/ae3b6479-1f79-48b3-b4b6-17298a084581/thumbnail/1200x630/44f43dc9b88f6cc4e69ffd51f583ac72/gettyimages-2224927095.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 23:15:22","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08},{"id":360283952,"title":"Thomas Skinner admits he cheated on his wife Sinead just weeks after their wedding when a 'moment of madness' saw him almost 'ruin his life'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: 100 new Epstein emails 'that could destroy' Prince Andrew: Cache of 'devastating' messages between the Duke and convicted paedophile unearthed in US probe\n\nStarmer cried: 'You're supposed to be protecting me'.

It was nothing more than that. It was the one time, it was a mistake. I woke up feeling absolutely terrible about it.\n'I felt so guilty. I told my wife. I let her down in that brief moment of madness where I wasn’t thinking, where I didn’t appreciate what I had.' \n'When I told my wife, I fully understood if she was to never speak to me again. No one else made me do what I’ve done. But it just shows something so brief could ruin your life.' \nThomas, who has become known for his social media videos and 'Bosh' catchphrase, met Sinead in a bar in London back in 2018.\nHe announced he had proposed to her in July 2020, just three months after the couple revealed they were expecting their first child. \nIt comes after Thomas brushed off his meltdown and got his dancing shoes on days before his Strictly Come Dancing debut, in an Instagram video on Friday.\nThe former Apprentice star left journalists shocked on Tuesday when he abruptly left a press call after snatching a reporter's phone.\nAddressing the scandal himself, Thomas took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a statement in which he apologised to the journalist and admitted he was working to 'move past difficult moments in his past'.\n\nThe admission comes after Thomas grabbed a female reporter's phone during an interview after 'numerous messages about a personal story from his past' flashed up on her phone \n\nSpeaking about the 'fling' for the first time, Thomas told of how he met the woman, Amy-Lucy O’Rourke, in a pub before taking her up on an offer of some free cosmetic treatments\n\nThe TV personality went on to reveal he had a 'two week thing' with the beauty clinic boss and was 'fortunate' that Sinead forgave him \n\nHe said: 'When I told my wife, I fully understood if she was to never speak to me again.

I felt it was best to step away and gather myself.'\nThomas continued: 'This had nothing to do with the interviews or Strictly itself.\n'I'm sorry I picked up someone else's phone and I don't even know if the journalist realised their messages were visible, and I don't want to suggest any bad intentions on their part.\n'What I do want to say is how excited I am to be part of Strictly this year. I'm so grateful for all the love, kindness and support I've been shown so far. It means the world to me, and I can't wait to give it my all on that dancefloor.

But we're dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don't play fair and they never did.'\n\nThe remarks come just days after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly opened fire during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, killing the 31-year-old Kirk in what authorities are investigating as a politically motivated attack. \n\nAccording to investigators, bullet casings found at the scene were etched with obscure fascist memes, video game references, and online slang deepening fears that political discourse online is turning deadly.\n\nOfficials say Robinson had no prior criminal history and was previously unaffiliated with any political party. \n\nPublic records indicate his last voter registration was in July 2021 with no party declared. But according to a relative, he had voiced strong criticism of Kirk at a family dinner shortly before the Utah Valley event.\n\nRobinson now faces multiple felony charges, including aggravated murder and obstruction of justice.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued his most explosive remarks yet following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\n\nTrump blamed the 'radical left' for obstructing national healing and explicitly called for billionaire Democratic donor George Soros and 'radical left son' Alex to be jailed \n\nProsecutors have not announced whether they will pursue the death penalty despite Trump's insistence.\n\nWhile the investigation into Robinson's motives remains ongoing, Trump wasted no time casting blame far beyond the shooter. \n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Fox & Friends, Trump accused George Soros, the 95-year-old Hungarian-American philanthropist and founder of the Open Society Foundations, of playing an indirect role in Kirk's death.\n\n'We're going to look into Soros,' Trump said, suggesting he could face prosecution under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) - a law typically used to go after organized crime.\n\nPressed again on Saturday by NBC, Trump doubled down: 'He should be put in jail. He's a bad guy.'\n\nHis remarks echoed those posted on his Truth Social platform last month.\n\n'George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America. We're not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more, never giving it so much as a chance to 'BREATHE,' and be FREE,' Trump wrote.\n\n'Soros, and his group of psychopaths, have caused great damage to our Country! That includes his Crazy, West Coast friends. Be careful, we're watching you!' \n\nThe remarks come just days after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly opened fire during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, killing 31-year-old Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk is seen at Utah Valley University, greeted by supporters and security personnel. This moment occurred minutes before the fatal shooting that ended his life\n\nThe incendiary rhetoric prompted a swift and firm rebuttal from Soros's organization, the Open Society Foundations.\n\n'The Open Society Foundations, founded by George Soros and chaired by Alex Soros, do not support or fund violent protests. Allegations to the contrary are false, and the threats against our founder and chair are outrageous. \n\n'Our mission is to advance human rights, justice, and democratic principles in the United States and around the world. We stand for fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the US Constitution, including the rights to free speech and peaceful protest that are hallmarks of any vibrant democracy.'\n\nKirk's killing has sent shockwaves through conservative circles, with tributes pouring in from right-wing lawmakers and influencers. \n\nBut the aftermath has also sparked renewed debate about the dangerous temperature of political rhetoric on all sides.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, issued a plea for unity and restraint.\n\n'Now is not the time for more finger-pointing. We need to ask ourselves what kind of political culture we are fostering and whether we're doing enough to prevent tragedy.'\n\nBut Trump showed no interest in dialing down his rhetoric.\n\nRepublicans have long accused Soros of funding violent demonstrations and riots\n\nIn 2023, Soros, 95, handed control over the philanthropic organization to his youngest son Alex. During the 2024 election, Alex supported and raised money for Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris. The younger Soros is married to Hillary Clinton’s close aide Huma Abedin\n\nTrump shared his throughts on George Soros late last month \n\nTrump accused George Soros, the 95-year-old Hungarian-American philanthropist and founder of the Open Society Foundations, of playing an indirect role in Kirk's death\n\nPeople run after shots were fired during an appearance by Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University\n\nPeople attend a vigil in Provo, Utah after right-wing activist and commentator, Charlie Kirk, an ally of President Trump, was fatally shot \n\n'They [the left] don't like what's been happening,' he told NBC. 'We've been winning very big.'\n\nOn Wednesday, in a somber video recorded from the Oval Office, Trump promised to hold not just the killer accountable, but 'each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity… including the organizations that fund and support it.' \n\nTrump's remarks also reflect a broader strategy duing his 2024 campaign when he painted a picture of a nation under siege by liberal elites, shadowy donors, and violent activists.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation into Tyler Robinson’s alleged attack is continuing. \n\nAuthorities have not publicly confirmed a motive, but sources familiar with the probe say digital evidence, including online posts, gaming chat logs, and Discord messages are being reviewed for signs of ideological radicalization.\n\nSo far, no evidence has emerged linking Robinson to any group funded by Soros or affiliated with the Open Society Foundations.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump blames huge 'barrier' for stopping America from healing after Charlie Kirk's killing... and calls for George Soros to be thrown in jail\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump says there's one major reason America can't begin to heal after Charlie Kirk's killing and he's naming names.

It comes as the US President prepares to jet to Britain this week for an unprecedented second state visit and a private lunch with Mr Starmer. Mr Trump will be treated to a display of the British Army's Red Devils, who are set to fly into Chequers to keep the erratic President entertained. He will also be shown special artifacts from Winston Churchill’s life, which No10 said show the wartime PM's \"close personal affinity\" with America. No10 said the leaders will dine on the \"British favourite Dover Sole, served with peas and potatoes for the main and the American classic key lime pie for dessert\". Theresa May's former chief-of-staff told The Mirror the PM should avoid exposing Mr Trump to “big protests” during his state visit. Gavin Barwell, who worked in No10 during the previous state visit of the US President, backed the right to protest, but said ministers should organise events \"further away”. Thousands of people will gather in central London this week to demonstrate against the visit, with campaigners accusing the US leader of denying climate change and enabling genocide. Mr Barwell, a former Tory MP, also accused Nigel Farage of deliberately trying to wind up Mr Trump before he visited to create issues for the government. Asked about the visit in 2019, he said:“He was kind of wound up by Farage or by people in Farage’s circle beforehand, so he gave an interview to a British newspaper where he was pretty disparaging about where the Prime Minister was on Brexit , so that was the backdrop which made it difficult. I suspect the recent trip to Washington to go and see him was partly with that in mind, to wind him up on a few issues. “In terms of the visits themselves, what you are trying to achieve is some good quality face to face time between the President and Prime Minister, and then to show off something about the UK that will make him feel more warm towards it. “I think one of the advantages we have is that he does seem to view the UK in a more positive light. Sometimes that was history or pomp and circumstance. We had dinner at Blenheim Palace, we took him into the cabinet war rooms, also showing the ways we were supporting the USA. “The final factor is you’re probably trying to avoid any kind of event being held right in the centre of big population centres, because you don’t want to expose him to big protests.” Mr Barwell said the protests were not a concern, but something to manage. He explained: “I don’t think you have to be worried about them, because people have a right to protest, but you don’t necessarily want to organise the visit in a way where the President is confronted face to face with the protests. It’s better if you’ve got venues that are further away.” Mr Barwell also suggested the PM could make progress on Gaza and Ukraine by framing the argument as it would be good for Trump. He said: “Like any negotiation, the starting point is to understand the person you’re negotiating with, what’s important to them, what motivates them, and think about how you can deploy your arguments in ways that sound like you’re trying to get them what they want. “One of the things about Trump that’s pretty clear about President Trump is he’s very invested in winning the Nobel Peace Prize. I would be saying to him, look, you’ve already got a list of achievements - Armenia Azerbaijan, India Pakistan, Thailand Cambodia, the DRC Rwanda, but the two big ones are Ukraine and Gaza. “In order to stop those conflicts, you’re going to have to apply a bit more pressure to Putin and Netenyahu. You don’t go in with a full frontal, you should be doing this, but you portray it in the context of what he’s trying to achieve.\" Other protests planned include those from Everyone Hates Elon, a group which has raised more than £27,000 to plaster an image of Mr Trump with Jeffrey Epstein across the UK. On Tuesday a memorial was unveiled to Epstein at Trump’s Aberdeen golf course, while on Wednesday a bus stop ad was unofficially placed by the US Embassy with the simple words “ Donald Trump is a rapist.” A spokesperson for Everyone Hates Elon said: “With Trump arriving next week, we’re getting ready for a big celebration of the special relationship - the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. “His supporters are tearing themselves up over the Epstein files. Now he’s hoping to escape it all to have tea out with the King. But there’s no way we’re letting him use our country to polish his image.

It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”\n\nSince 2023, Nato member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nTrump's post arrives after the Wednesday flight of multiple Russian drones into Poland, an escalatory move by Russia as it was entering the airspace of a Nato ally. Poland shot down the drones, yet Trump played down the severity of the incursion and Russia's motives by saying it “could have been a mistake”.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday that the drone incursion was \"unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous\", as he judged Nato's response so far to be appropriate. Still, Rubio said it was unclear if the drones were intentionally sent to Poland.\n\n\"The question is whether the drones were targeted to go into Poland specifically,\" Rubio said. \"If that's the case, that the evidence leads us there, then obviously that would be a highly escalatory move.\"\n\nWhile Trump as a candidate promised to end the war quickly, he has yet to hit the pressure points needed to end the violence and has at times been seen as reluctant to confront Russian president Vladimir Putin. Congress is currently trying to get the US president to back a bill toughening sanctions, after Trump last month hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.\n\nThe US and its allies are seeking to show a firmer degree of resolve against Russia. At an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Friday, acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea said America \"will defend every inch of Nato territory\" and that the drones entering Poland \"intentionally or otherwise show immense disrespect for good-faith US efforts to bring an end to this conflict”.\n\nBritain on Friday also took steps to penalise the trading of Russian oil, including a ban on 70 vessels allegedly used in its transportation. The UK also sanctioned 30 individuals and companies, including businesses based in China and Turkey, that have supplied Russia with electronics, chemicals, explosives and other weapons components.\n\nTrump, in his post on Saturday, said a Nato ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would \"also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR\".\n\nThe president said that Nato members should put the 50 per cent to 100 per cent tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that began with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.\n\n\"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,\" he posted, and powerful tariffs \"will break that grip\".\n\nThe US president has already imposed a 25 per cent import tax on goods from India, specifically for its buying of Russian energy products. He has placed in total a 50 per cent tariff on India, though Trump has indicated that negotiations with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi could help settle differences.\n\nThe prospect of further import tax hikes on China and its retaliation could carry collateral damage for the US and European economies.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump hit Chinese goods with new tariffs totaling 145 per cent, prompting China to respond with 125 per cent import taxes on American goods. Taxes at that level were essentially a blockade on commerce between the world's two largest economies, causing worries about global growth that led to negotiations that ratcheted down the tariffs being levied by both nations.\n\nSo that trade talks could proceed, America lowered its tariffs against China to a still-high 30 per cent, while China took its rate to 10 per cent.\n\nIn his post, the Republican president said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. He did not include in that list Putin, who launched the invasion.\n\nTrump's post builds on a call on Friday with finance ministers in the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialised democracies. During the call, US trade representative Jamieson Greer and treasury secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a \"unified front\" to cut off \"the revenues funding Putin's war machine,\" according to Greer's office.","summary":"US president says he believes Russia-Ukraine war would end if all Nato countries stopped ‘shocking’ buying of oil from Moscow","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-war-b2826067.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/13/22/579bc34dda3c8c22148632277d33926cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU3ODYwNjQy-2.81296614.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LmK9PLER-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:59:16","author":"Tara Cobham","authors":["Tara Cobham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":360280208,"title":"Strictly star Thomas Skinner admits to cheating on wife ‘weeks after wedding’","text":"Thomas Skinner married wife Sinéad Chambers in 2022 (Picture: Instagram)\n\nStrictly Come Dancing star Thomas Skinner has admitted to cheating on his wife ‘weeks’ after their wedding.\n\nSkinner, 34, rose to fame as an entrepreneur on the 2019 series of The Apprentice, where he finished in eighth place. \n\nHe soon found a fan following for his distinctive ‘bosh’ catchphrase and social media videos in which he shares his love of beer, kebabs and fried breakfasts. \n\nIn 2022, Skinner married wife Sinéad Chambers, with whom he already shared a two-year old son.\n\nSinéad, who later gave birth to identical twin girls in 2023, had initially convinced him to apply for The Apprentice after he had founded several businesses of his own.\n\nAhead of his Strictly debut, Skinner has revealed how he cheated on his wife in a ‘two-week fling’ which occurred shortly after their wedding.\n\n Skinner will appear on this year’s Strictly Come Dancing (Picture: BBC/PA Wire)\n\n Skinner and Chambers met at a London bar in 2018 (Picture: Instagram)\n\nIn an interview with The Sun, Skinner shared what had happened, describing the incident as ‘the biggest mistake of [his] life.’\n\n‘I met her in a pub,’ said Skinner of the fling, which he shared with a beauty clinic manager and single mum, 35.\n\n‘I had a fling. It was nothing more than that. It was the one time, it was a mistake,’ he continued.\n\n Skinner and his wife share three children together (Picture: Instagram)\n\nDescribing the aftermath, Skinner said: ‘I woke up feeling absolutely terrible about it. I felt so guilty. I told my wife.\n\n‘I let her down in that brief moment of madness where I wasn’t thinking, where I didn’t appreciate what I had.\n\n‘My wife is the best thing that’s ever happened. I’m so lucky she forgave me.’\n\nSkinner described the moment he came clean to Sinéad as ‘terrible’ and ‘the worst thing I’ve ever had to do.’\n\n Skinner revealed how he had a ‘fling’ with another woman following his marriage (Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nThe former Celebrity MasterChef star continued: ‘I’m a very, very open book and I don’t hide anything from my wife.\n\n‘She was obviously distraught, upset. Didn’t think I’d do that to her.\n\n‘When I told my wife, I fully understood if she was to never speak to me again.’\n\nHowever, the pair were able to move on from his betrayal, even after what he describes as a ‘very, very dark time’ for their relationship.\n\n Skinner described the incident as the biggest mistake of his life (Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nAcknowledging that ‘no-one else made me do what I’ve done,’ he said: ‘It just shows something so brief could ruin your life.’\n\nPrior to Skinner’s fling, a close friend named ‘Big Mark’ had died, leaving the future Strictly star ‘distraught.’\n\n‘I’m not making excuses,’ he said. ‘I was just in a sort of mad headspace.’\n\nHe added: ‘The best advice I can give anyone is to be honest and own up. Because we are in an incredible place now. We are strong. It’s forgotten about.’\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for Skinner’s fling partner told The Sun: ‘This has been an incredibly stressful chapter in her life.\n\n‘She did not have a fling with Mr Skinner, she had a relationship with him.’\n\n He recently provoked controversy after apparently ‘storming out’ of a Strictly press event (Picture: Shutterstock)\n\nSkinner has proved a controversial name since news of his Strictly appointment broke.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that he had ‘stormed out’ of a press event set up for Strictly 2025 after clashing with journalists.\n\nAt one point, Skinner is understood to have picked up a journalist’s phone from the table, before they eventually got it back from him.\n\n What happened at the Strictly Come Dancing press event? \n\n Metro understands that Skinner was being interviewed with football star Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink by a group of journalists at the time of the incident. \nAt one point, Skinner is said to have picked up a journalist’s phone from the table, before they eventually got it back from him.\nThe 34-year-old had yet to answer any questions when he abruptly left the interview, prompting Hasselbaink to follow him out of the room.\nYet it was only Hasselbaink that returned to complete the remainder of their interviews, with Skinner unavailable for any other journalists in attendance. \nWhen Skinner first walked into the press room alongside stars including Dani Dyer and Vicky Pattinson, he was smiling and seemed in good spirits. \nThe Daily Mail has claimed that his actions ‘left organisers furious and BBC bosses in crisis talks over whether he should remain on the show’.\n\nA source told The Daily Mail: ‘This is exactly what Strictly did not need. With all the recent controversy, bosses wanted this series to be smooth sailing, but Tom is already causing havoc.\n\n‘It’s unprecedented for a celebrity to walk out of the show’s media launch day, and bosses think it’s really bad form.\n\n‘If this is a sign of things to come, Strictly has a big problem.’\n\n Skinner met with US Vice President JD Vance earlier this month (Picture: Instagram)\n\nLast month, Skinner met with US Vice President JD Vance while he was on holiday in the Cotswolds.\n\nSkinner previously expressed support for Republican candidate Donald Trump, saying: ‘I love Trump, I think he is brilliant, that’s my opinion. I think it’s good he is back in charge, it will be good for the UK economy.’\n\nSkinner has also come under fire for ‘inflammatory’ remarks which include his describing London as ‘hostile,’ ‘tense’ and ‘not safe out there anymore.’\n\nMore recently, he joked about how he is getting ‘ten grand’ for doing Strictly – a figure The Times noted ‘should not be taken as his full fee.’\n\n‘But seriously, I’d do it for a tenner,’ he added.\n\nMetro has contacted Thomas Skinner’s representatives for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"The former Apprentice star described the incident as 'a moment of madness.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/09/13/strictly-star-thomas-skinner-admits-cheating-wife-weeks-wedding-24156963/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SEI_265948465-fb26.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:44:00","author":"Joel Harley","authors":["Joel Harley"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":360283516,"title":"Who Is Tyler Robinson’s Partner?

I never thought I’d see this in this country.” Other attendees said they were more worried about migration. “It’s an invasion,” 28-year-old Ritchie, who only gave his first name, said of the record levels of UK immigration in recent years, including tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving annually on small boats across the Channel.\n\n“They don’t understand we want our country back,” he said of the ruling centre-left Labour government and its Conservative predecessors, calling Robinson “a hero”.\n\nAt the anti-racism event, veteran Labour politician Diane Abbott accused Robinson and his allies of spreading “nonsense” and “dangerous” lies that asylum seekers were a threat.\n\n“We need to be in solidarity with asylum seekers, and we need to show that we are united,” she told Sky News.\n\nFar-right speakers \n\nLondon police, who drafted in officers from other forces to manage the crowds, have placed conditions on the protest routes and timings, insisting they end at different times and that both conclude by evening.\n\nSpeakers included Elon Musk, who joined via video-link, French politician Eric Zemmour and Petr Bystron of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\n“You’re in a fundamental situation here,” Musk told the crowd, claiming “the left is the party of murder and celebrating murder”.\n\n“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” \n\nAsked by Robinson why he was supporting the event, South African-born Musk said: “I’m of primarily British heritage, British ancestry.\n\n“I want Britain to be greater than it ever has been, I want Britain to remain Britain, there’s something beautiful about being British.\n\n“What I see happening is a destruction of Britain, initially slow erosion but a rapidly increasing erosion with massive uncontrolled migration\n\n“The Government has failed in its duty to protect the people.”\n\nThe rally comes just over a year after anti-immigration riots swept several cities, which Robinson was accused of fuelling with incendiary online posts, and as free speech concerns become more mainstream.\n\nThe government has faced widespread criticism after banning the Palestine Action group in July. Police have since arrested under anti-terror laws hundreds of peaceful protesters holding up signs supporting the group.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent arrest of Graham Linehan, an award-winning comedy writer, for allegedly insulting transgender people online prompted widespread derision.","summary":"Violent clashes have broken out, with riot police attacked, as Elon Musk and Tommy Robinson addressed a huge crowd at a far-right rally.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/europe/uk-politics/tensions-flare-protestors-attack-riot-cops-with-missiles-violent-clashes-erupt/news-story/252120885c5627ded0beeb4f0b024022?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a27e49a1a4c82264363ab66448579764","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:36:38","author":"Megan Palin","authors":["Megan Palin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.011},{"id":360277018,"title":"‘Ugly momentum’ of political violence building in America","text":"The attack on Mr Kirk, while he spoke to students at Utah Valley University, was the latest in a grim litany of incidents.\n\nIn June, a wannabe assassin targeted two Democrats in Minnesota and succeeded in killing one of them, along with her husband.\n\nIn April, someone tried to burn down the house of Pennsylvania’s Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro while he and his family were inside.\n\nDuring last year’s presidential election campaign, there were two attempts to kill Donald Trump, one of which very nearly succeeded, with the bullet grazing his ear.\n\nLast December, Brian Thompson, the CEO of a health insurance company, was murdered on the streets of New York.\n\nWe could keep going, with these examples, for some time.\n\nThe assault on former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s husband.\n\nAn alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nThe shooting of a senior Republican Congressman, Steve Scalise.\n\nThe near-fatal assassination attempt on Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.\n\nThe mob that fought police and hunted for politicians inside the halls of Congress, while chanting about hanging the Vice President.\n\nLittle wonder that, after Mr Kirk’s death, members of Congress are reportedly “scared to death” of threats to their own safety, and are seeking to boost their security.\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Nancy Mace has cancelled all her public outdoor events, and says she intends to have a gun on her “at all times”. She’s not alone in that stance.\n\nAnd House Speaker Mike Johnson says there have been thousands more threats to members of Congress, this year, than in 2024.\n\nWhy wouldn’t they be worried? Mr Kirk’s murder is a reminder, as if one were needed, that they live in a country where some people believe they deserve to die for their opinions. All it takes is one radicalised lunatic with a gun, in a nation where there are more guns than human beings and astonishingly few restrictions on accessing them.\n\n‘A shock, but not a surprise’\n\nEvery country has people with the potential to turn violent; there’s nothing special about the United States in that regard. But bloodshed has nevertheless marked much of US history.\n\nThe nation began with a war for its independence. Less than a century later, it descended into a full-blown civil war. Politically tinged violence exploded in the 1960s, with multiple famous figures assassinated, including the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nFour US presidents have been murdered, three more have been shot, and we know about plots, of varying degrees of seriousness and competence, to assassinate at least 15 of them.\n\nWhat if the relative calmness of the 1990s and 2000s – and I really do stress the word relative, there – was an aberration? What if the norm in America is for political violence to be common, and we’ve swung back in that direction?\n\nOne risk factor is motive. Are Americans more likely now than they have been in the past to develop murderous intent? We’ll get to that. First though, another factor: opportunity.\n\nI said every nation has people with the potential to be violent. Most at least try to make it difficult for those people to get their hands on deadly weapons.\n\nAmerica, notoriously, prefers a lighter touch, for reasons Mr Kirk himself often explained.\n\n“I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights,” he said in 2023, for example.\n\nI share this quote not to dunk on Mr Kirk, or shame him or whatever. We’re not interested in victim-blaming. There’s just such a twisted level of irony here.\n\nThe result of America’s relaxed attitude towards gun deaths is apparent in its obscene homicide rate, which is almost seven times higher than Australia’s. It is much, much easier for an American who’s become mentally unbalanced to kill someone. And if the goal is a targeted assassination, they can do it at range.\n\n(Mr Kirk’s attacker is believed to have shot him from well over a hundred metres away. You can’t do that with a knife.)\n\nShortly after Mr Kirk was attacked – though it got relatively little attention amid all the political noise – there was a shooting at a high school in Colorado. One of dozens recorded across America this year.\n\nConsider that for a second. The country’s gun violence is so frequent that two horrific shooting can happen at practically the same time, causing one to drown out the other.\n\n“It’s always a shock, when it happens, but it’s not a surprise,” Bruce Wolpe, a senior fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, told news.com.au.\n\n“Gun violence in the United States is as American as apple pie. It happens all the time. It happens at every level.\n\n“It’s part of the fabric of American life. So at the moment, of course, it’s a shock. Oh, my goodness, someone has been killed, murdered. But there’s nothing unusual about it.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s getting worse. I just think it’s endemic.”\n\nHe stressed that incidents like Mr Kirk’s murder will continue to happen until Americans “talk seriously” about addressing their gun laws.\n\nWhat of the other element, though, the motivations behind political violence?\n\n“It’s a broader problem that has been with us in modern times, since the assassination of John F. Kennedy. You know, in our lifetimes, George Wallace was the victim of an attempt. There were two attempts on Gerald Ford that failed. So again, it’s just part of the fabric (of US society),” said Mr Wolpe.\n\n“But there is a new level of hyper-partisanship. It’s been brewing for at least 30 years, since Newt Gingrich and shifted the Republican Party and their take over the House in the 90s to today,” he added.\n\n“I don’t see anything to break this, to stop this ugly momentum. I just think it’s going to continue for a while.\n\n“Ultimately, these are leadership issues. I mean, if Trump stood up and said we need to do something about semiautomatic weapons, that would be a big deal, but he wants to cultivate and benefit from his support from the far-right gun movement.\n\n“That’s the way politics are. It’s horrific. It is horrific. But that’s the way it’s going to continue until many stand up on both sides and just say, ‘We’ve had enough.’”\n\nThe hyper-partisanship Mr Wolpe mentioned has been evident, to say the least, in the fallout from the Kirk shooting.\n\nMr Trump immediately pinned the murder on “the radical left”, before anything about the culprit was known. He said his opponents’ rhetoric was “directly responsible for the terrorism we’re seeing in our country”, and listed incidents of violence against conservative figures (he conveniently omitted every comparable example of violence against Democrats).\n\nHe was echoed by most of the conservative media, while some more strident voices went so far as to call for Mr Kirk to be “avenged”.\n\n“They want us dead. They’re killing us,” said political commentator Matt Walsh, without specifying who the “they” in question were.\n\n“Now is not the time for kumbaya stuff. This is real.”\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk cast a similarly wide net of blame, labelling the Democrats “the party of murder”.\n\nThere was deeply unedifying rhetoric from some extreme lefties on social media too, expressing a pointed lack of regret at Mr Kirk’s death, or at least claiming he was undeserving of being remembered fondly. That attitude, thankfully, did not seep into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\n\n“Whoever has done this, there will be a forensic political examination of them,” said Mr Wolpe (he spoke to us before the suspect was identified).\n\n“We’re already at a hyper-partisan stage in our political life in America, and that will lead to those fissures getting deeper.”\n\nHe cited a quote from Mr Trump’s deputy chief of staff in the White House, Stephen Miller, who said “all of us must now dedicate ourselves to defeating the evil that stole Charlie from the world”.\n\n“And the evil is not the gun. The evil is the political motive. So this enters the culture wars, the political wars, the wars of dominance over America’s future,” said Mr Wolpe.\n\nIn the past, presidents from both sides took a deliberately measured approach to moments of political violence, urging Americans to remain calm and stressing the need for unity.\n\nMr Trump’s response, this week, was to do the opposite.\n\n“What do we do about our country? We have radicals on the right and left, people are watching videos and cheering, some people are cheering that Charlie was killed. How do we fix this country? How do we come back together?” he was asked on Fox News on Friday morning, US time.\n\n“I’ll tell you something that is going to get me in trouble, but I couldn’t care less,” Mr Trump responded, before going on to suggest extremists on the right were justified in their views.\n\n“Radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime.”\n\nHow does this spiral of violence, particularly gun violence, stop?

He was hailed as an intellectual on the right and praised for his willingness to debate issues with left wing opponents on University Campuses.\n\nFrom what I could see he used a variety of cheap tricks to create the impression that he knew what he was talking about.\n\nThe tricks included changing the subject regularly, shifting the goal posts, and not properly engaging in the matter being discussed. This was wrapped up in uber confidence and to a casual observer he would have appeared impressive. Think Nicola Willis or Chris Bishop on steroids. Your average Phd student would have been able to destroy Kirk in a properly moderated debate.\n\nThis recent video of a debate between Kirk and a Cambridge student reinforced my impression.\n\nThe maker of this film had this wonderful description of what the debate should be, and that is the pursuit of truth and not victory.\n\nFast forward to now and news from the United States reinforces the strong perception that the country is broken. The Republican Party immediately issued a full blitzkrieg against the Democrats and the left in general and essentially blamed them for what happened.\n\nAn increasingly frail Donald Trump refused to call for unity and instead chose to go all culture war on it. \n\nThis Guardian article quotes him as saying this:\n\nThe radicals on the right are radical because they don’t want to see crime … The radicals on the left are the problem – and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy. They want men in women’s sports, they want transgender for everyone, they want open borders. The worst thing that happened to this country.”\n\nSenior Republicans and right wing media chimed in with similar allegations and also blamed the left.\n\nSenior democrats were careful in their language. The odd lefty who said disparaging things about Kirk were doxxed and ambushed which makes you wonder about the right’s commitment to freedom of speech given some of the rather extreme things that Kirk said during his life.\n\nMore responsible progressive commentators such as the crew at Pod Save America have denounced the violent end to Kirk’s life and at the same time distanced themselves from his views and decried what violence was doing to the US.\n\nThe problem for the right is that their narrative is unravelling.\n\nIt does not appear that the killer was a far left trans cross dresser immigrant.\n\nInstead it appears to have been a young engineering student who was a gun nut and who lived in a staunch Republican family.\n\nRussell Brown has pointed out that the messages inscribed onto bullet casings found at the scene appear to be groyper memes.\n\nThis is a subculture that looks to Nick Fuentes, a far-right figure who thought that Kirk was too moderate. There are possible links between the shooter and the movement and there is also an allegation that he told police that police that he admired Nick Fuentes and did not like Kirk.\n\nThe right used claims following Kirk’s death to try and stake political advantage. The left has held back wanting to know what the truth was.\n\nPolitics should not be like this. It should be a proper debate about the issues and the attempt to reach consensus, or if consensus is not possible then an informed electorate should decide what happens. And there should not be a rush to judgment.\n\nClearly America is not there right now.","summary":"The US right's claim the left was responsible for the assassination of Charlie Kirk is unravelling as more details of the alleged killer emerge.","url":"https://thestandard.org.nz/the-primary-concern-of-the-left-is-truth-not-victory/","image":"https://cdn2.thestandard.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Charlie_Kirk__Donald_Trump_53786991842.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:35:33","author":"Mickysavage","authors":["Mickysavage"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zw","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":360289036,"title":"Dem Mayor Orders Flags To Full Staff Post Charlie Kirk Assassination, Firefighters Say No","text":"Democratic Mayor John Laesch of Aurora, Illinois ordered flags to fly at full staff in the city despite proclamations from President Donald Trump and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, according to a memo circulating on social media.\n\nAuthorities have arrested Tyler Robinson, accusing him of assassinating Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk during a TPUSA “Prove Me Wrong” event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, during which Kirk was debating attendees on a variety of topics. Trump ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Kirk’s memory Wednesday, while Pritzker issued a proclamation Friday ordering the flag to be flown at half-staff in honor of “victims of political violence,” avoiding any mention of Kirk.

As directed by the mayor, all City of Aurora buildings, including the fire stations, are to have their flags at full staff,” the memo from Fire Chief David McCabe of the Aurora Fire Department posted by Franck Ricci, a retired New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter, read. “I know everyone has their own opinion on whether the flag should be at full or half-staff, but that is irrelevant. Someone will be coming around to raise all station flags to full staff.”\n\nThe memo went on to say that any manipulation of the flags to place them back at half-staff would be viewed as “a violation of a direct order.”\n\nThe source on the ground told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the local firefighters’ union reached an agreement with Laesch that no member of the union would have to raise the flag to full staff. A video posted to X by Ricci appears to show Fire Assistance Chief of Operations Matt Anslow moving the flag to full staff.\n\n“In flagrant disregard for unity, the mayor and chief raised the flags, chasing cheap political points over national mourning, exposing the left’s relentless pursuit of division over decency,” Ricci told the DCNF.\n\nAccording to the proclamation by President Trump, flags were to be flown at half-staff until sunset Sept. 14. Pritzker’s proclamation ended the period of flying the flag at half-staff at sunset Sept. 14.\n\nLaesch explained his order to raise the flags in a statement reported by local media outlet Fox 32 Chicago. Laesch’s statement, as reported by the outlet, does not appear to mention Kirk’s assassination.\n\n“Our focus was on remembering the lives lost on September 11th. On Friday, our flags were raised again as we moved forward, carrying with us the spirit and memory of those who died,” Laesch said in the statement. “I recognize that some employees and community members may not agree with this decision, but lowering the flag is a solemn act that carries great weight. The choice to do so should not be made cavalierly. Doing so diminishes the importance of the remembrance of tragedies like September 11, 2001.”\n\nKirk was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs less than an hour’s drive from Aurora.\n\nDemocratic Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles also ordered that flags be kept at full-staff, according to a post on X. In Iowa, Johnson County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jon Green posted on Facebook he would defy the proclamation from Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa to fly the flag at half-staff to honor Kirk.\n\nMayor Laesch and Chief McCabe did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the DCNF.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The total includes journalists, academic workers and teachers. On Friday, a junior Nasdaq employee was fired over her posts related to Kirk.\n\nOthers have been subjected to torrents of online abuse or seen their offices flooded with calls demanding they be fired, part of a surge in right-wing rage that has followed the killing.\n\nSome Republicans want to go further still and have proposed deporting Kirk's critics from the United States, suing them into penury or banning them from social media for life.\n\n“Prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death,” said conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump and one of several far-right figures who are organizing digital campaigns on X, the social media site, to ferret out and publicly shame Kirk’s critics.\n\nU.S. lawmaker Clay Higgins said in a post on X that anyone who \"ran their mouth with their smartass hatred celebrating the heinous murder of that beautiful young man\" needed to be \"banned from ALL PLATFORMS FOREVER.\" The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on the same site that he had been disgusted to \"see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.\"\n\nRepublicans' anger at those disrespecting Kirk's legacy contrasts with the mockery some of the same figures – including Kirk – directed at past victims of political violence.\n\nFor example, when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul was clubbed over the head by a hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist during a break-in at their San Francisco home shortly before the 2022 midterm elections, Higgins posted a photo making fun of the attack. He later deleted the post.\n\nLoomer falsely suggested that Paul Pelosi and his assailant were lovers, calling the brutal assault on the octogenarian a “booty call gone wrong.” Speaking to a television audience a few days after the attack, a grinning Kirk called for the intruder to be sprung from jail.\n\n\"If some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco or the Bay Area wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out,\" he said.\n\nLoomer and Higgins did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nWEBSITE \"EXPOSE CHARLIE'S MURDERERS\" REGISTERED\n\nThe campaign to fire Kirk’s critics has not slowed. Calls to run people out of jobs have flooded across X. A newly registered site, \"Expose Charlie's Murderers,\" has 41 names of people it alleged were “supporting political violence online” and claims to be working on a backlog of more than 20,000 submissions.\n\nA Reuters review of the screenshots and comments posted to the site shows that some of those featured joked about or celebrated Kirk's death. One was quoted as saying, \"He got what he deserved\" and others were quoted providing variations on \"karma's a bitch.\" Others, however, were critical of the far-right figure while explicitly denouncing violence.\n\nStill others appear to have done little more than point out that a longtime gun control foe had been shot to death. At least three accurately quoted Kirk's 2023 comments in which he told a crowd that some gun deaths were \"worth it,” saying that the annual drumbeat of firearms-related killings in the United States was \"a prudent deal\" in exchange for the Constitution's Second Amendment.\n\nOne person who was featured on the site said their employer had been bombarded by phone calls, with callers threatening not to let up until they were fired or disciplined. The person said they plan to avoid the office in the coming days.\n\n“To be very, very clear, I don’t condone the murder of Charlie Kirk,” the person told Reuters in a phone call, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid further harassment. “But I do, at the same time, have to appreciate the irony of this situation,” they said, referring to Kirk being shot through the neck with a rifle following years of vociferous opposition to gun control.\n\nReuters could not establish who is running the website. The site did not respond to questions about its ownership, methodology, or why quoting Kirk accurately could be seen as \"supporting political violence.\" Squarespace, the site's host, did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nJay Childers, an associate professor of communications at the University of Kansas, said there was a long history of government officials and political elites attempting to control rhetoric and suppress dissent.\n\n“I do not think this moment is really new in that sense,\" he said, although he noted that \"the ability for anyone to post their thoughts on the internet certainly makes far more people potential targets of any attempts to control political speech.”\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"After the fatal shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, U.S. Republicans have a warning for Americans: Mourn him respectfully or suffer the consequences.\nOver the past several days,…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/charlie-kirk%27s-allies-warn-americans-mourn-him-properly-or-else1","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/44/b6/213b5b21371e61ee09dc80801fec4cac334e/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:32:48","author":"Japan Today Editor,Raphael Satter","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Raphael Satter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":360282414,"title":"Charlie Kirk assassination latest shooting committed by trans people and advocates","text":"The assassination of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk marks the latest example of a growing wave of murders and other shootings committed by transgender people and others advocating for their rights.\n\nAudrey Hale, a transgender shooter who murdered six people at Nashville’s Convent School in March 2023, raged about hating America, being miserable while being raised as a girl and wanting to “kill all the white kids.”\n\n“I only wore some nice girl clothes as a cover-up from the truth, which I denied myself all these years.

closer defence cooperation.\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose major sanctions on Russia – just as soon as all Nato nations did the same thing and stopped buying

until \"it disappeared from the radar\" near the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, it added.\nAlso Saturday, Poland said it and its Nato allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine not far from its border.\nBecause of the drone threat, \"Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, and ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have

Tuesday to Wednesday.\nWhile Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries, including France, Germany and Sweden, have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response.\n\"Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\"Also today, Poland responded militarily to the threat of Russian attack drones,\" which had also been active in different regions of Ukraine all day, he added.\nThe Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air,\" said Zelensky.\nThe latest drone incursions were \"an obvious expansion of the war by Russia\", he added.\nWhat was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defence system, Zelensky argued.\n\"Do not wait for dozens of 'shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,\" he warned, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using.\n'Stop buying Russian oil' \nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio on Saturday expressed concern at the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace earlier in the week.\nIf it turned out to have been deliberate, \"then obviously it will be... highly escalatory,\" he told reporters in Washington.\nTrump's suggestion on Thursday that the incident might have happened by \"mistake\" was quickly dismissed by Tusk.\nOn Saturday, Trump returned to the issue of sanctions against Russia, putting the ball back in the court of his Nato allies.\n\"I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\nTrump has repeatedly threatened sanctions against Russia without following through.\nIn Russia, an official reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit one of its largest oil refining complexes, 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.\nThe drone had sparked a fire and caused minor damage at the complex, which belongs to Russian oil company Bashneft and lies on the outskirts of the central Russian city of Ufa.\nA source in Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency claimed responsibility for the attack.\nSince Moscow launched its full-scale military offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian refineries in an attempt to curb the Kremlin's ability to fund the conflict through its fossil fuel industry.","summary":"Romania tracked that drone’s intrusion

Million As Donations Pour In On GiveSendGo","text":"Following the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Wednesday, Americans across the country have donated millions of dollars online to support his family. Fundraising campaigns on the platform GiveSendGo have raised over $2.8 million in a short span. The company said to Fox News Digital that one campaign set a record for collecting the most money in the shortest amount of time. GiveSendGo co-founder and co-CEO Heather Wilson said the rapid response shows how deeply Kirk impacted people. “When people feel powerless in the face of tragedy, giving becomes a tangible way to express love, solidarity, and care,” she said. Wilson also said that the platform has a prayer button next to the donation button, allowing people who cannot contribute financially to still share hope and encouragement with the family. Support Through GoFundMe Several campaigns have also been launched on GoFundMe to help Kirk’s wife and children and to create a permanent memorial at Utah Valley University (UVU), where Kirk was shot. Organizers include UVU students and members of Turning Point USA, the conservative youth group Kirk founded. A GoFundMe spokesperson said verified fundraisers have raised more than $12,000 so far. The platform is carefully reviewing each fundraiser to ensure donations go to the intended recipients, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy against misuse or fraud. Charlie Kirk’s Death Kirk, 31, was fatally shot at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on September 10 while speaking at an event. He died of his injuries at a local hospital. Authorities are investigating the incident. President Donald Trump was the first prominent figure to announce Kirk’s death, posting on Truth Social, “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.

Backers of the American conservative activist rallied at U.S. embassies in Europe and Africa. And supportive world leaders chimed in, lauding him as a friend and inspiration.\n\nThe assassination of Kirk in broad daylight at a Utah university this week has resonated well beyond the United States, highlighting in democracies around the globe the same yawning political divide that has riven America.\n\nThe outpouring of grief, anger and defiance over his death also testified to his influence and impact abroad, especially among groups on the right as diverse as white Afrikaners in South Africa, anti-immigration parties in Europe, libertarians in South America and ultranationalist Israelis in the Middle East. It also gave those movements an opportunity to air their grievances against their own political opponents.\n\n“Charlie Kirk’s death is the result of the international hate campaign waged by the progressive-liberal left,” Viktor Orbán — Hungary’s populist prime minister who, like Kirk, has aligned himself with U.S. President Donald Trump and the American leader’s MAGA movement — wrote on X.\n\nThe reaction to Kirk’s death among groups on the right reflects the proliferation and rise of conservative and nationalist movements around the world. And Kirk — a Christian conservative, staunch supporter of gun rights and critic of the political and cultural elite — was emblematic of the way political conversations have increasingly crossed borders.\n\nGrief but also anger\n\nAuthorities say Kirk was killed by a single shot while taking questions during an outdoor event Wednesday at Utah Valley University.\n\nMany people worldwide, regardless of political stripe, expressed dismay at such grisly violence in the midst of a public debate, and politicians across the spectrum denounced the killing.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain’s left-leaning Labour Party, called it “heartbreaking that a young family has been robbed of a father and a husband,” adding: “We must all be free to debate openly and freely without fear — there can be no justification for political violence.”\n\nKirk wasn’t a household name outside the United States, but he had a fervent following among supporters abroad and a big social-media presence. He spoke in the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea this year, and his Turning Point USA has international offshoots.\n\nIn the wake of his killing, many political figures and commentators on the right took aim at their political opponents, calling members of the left “the enemy” and vowing “resistance” against their foes.\n\n“The left is, at all times and in all places, a violent phenomenon filled with hatred,” wrote Argentine President Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, on X alongside a photo of him, Trump and Kirk. Milei has repeatedly railed against Socialists, feminists and transgender people and praised Trump’s MAGA movement for fighting what he calls “woke ideology.”\n\nIn Berlin, about 150 people held a vigil in Kirk’s honor outside the U.S. Embassy on Thursday, and there were minor clashes with protesters, police said, testifying to the divisions.\n\nIn the European Union’s Parliament, dozens of rank-and-file lawmakers banged their hands angrily on their desks on Thursday after the parliament’s vice president denied an effort by Swedish member Charlie Weimers, of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, to lead a moment of silence honoring Kirk in the chamber.\n\nSeen as inspiration and an ally\n\nSome rising young political stars who might be seen as international counterparts to the 31-year-old Kirk spoke of the inspiration they would take from his legacy.\n\nNikolas Ferreira, who received the most votes of any federal lawmaker in Brazil’s last election, posted on social media that Kirk’s death “cries out against injustice and awakens hearts.”\n\n“They want to silence us, but what they achieved was to awaken us. From every tear, courage is born; from every injustice, resistance is forged,” the 29-year-old former YouTuber said.\n\nIn South Africa, the assassination has resonated with white conservative groups who claim that South Africa’s Black-led government is pursuing an anti-white agenda. The government has strongly rejected those allegations and denounced “misinformation” from South African and American conservatives as intended to undermine a majority-Black country.\n\nKirk voiced support of Trump’s program that offered refugee status in the U.S. to members of South Africa’s white Afrikaner minority, and said earlier this year that the United States needed more white, Christian South Africans to come.\n\nThe AfriForum group, an Afrikaner lobby group, held a small vigil for Kirk outside the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria. Its youth wing said his killing was “a wake-up call that points to a global intolerance towards conservative thinking.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the most religious and nationalist government in Israel’s history, called Kirk a “defender of our common Judeo-Christian civilization.”\n\n“Charlie was more than a friend of Israel. He was a great champion of our shared roots and values,” Netanyahu, a polarizing leader who has ruled Israel nearly uninterrupted for the last 16 years, said in a post on X.\n\nOther figures on the right offered more somber words.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, one of the European leaders who is seen as most friendly with Trump, said she was “shocked” about the killing of Kirk.\n\n“An atrocious murder, a deep wound for democracy and for those who believe in freedom,” she wrote on X. “My condolences to his family, to his loved ones, and to the American conservative community.” ____\n\nAssociated Press writers Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa; Brian Melley in London; David Biller in Rome; Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Gabriela Sá Pessoa in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.","summary":"Dozens of angry European lawmakers banged their hands on their desks after being denied a moment of silence to honour Charlie Kirk.

The president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next.”\n\nBoth Rubio and Trump met on Friday with Qatar’s prime minister to discuss the fallout from the Israeli operation, in a demonstration of how the Trump administration is trying to balance relations between key Middle East allies days after Israel targeted Hamas leaders in a strike on Doha.\n\nThe attack has drawn widespread international condemnation and appears to have ended attempts to secure an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and the release of hostages ahead of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly session at which the Gaza war is expected to be a primary focus.\n\nTrump “wants Hamas defeated, he wants the war to end, he wants all 48 hostages home, including those that are deceased, and he wants it all at once,” he said. “And we’ll have to discuss about how the events last week had an impact on the ability to achieve that in short order.”\n\nRubio will have meetings in Jerusalem on Sunday and Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.\n\nDespite tensions between Trump and Netanyahu over the strike, Rubio will be in Israel for the two-day visit. It is a show of support for the increasingly isolated country before the United Nations holds likely contentious debate on the creation of a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu opposes.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio and Vice President JD Vance met Qatari Prime Ministers Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the White House. Later Friday, Trump and special envoy Steve Witkoff had dinner with the sheikh in New York, where Trump went to commemorate the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe Trump administration is walking a delicate line between two major allies after Israel took its fight with Hamas to the Qatari capital, where leaders of the militant group had gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the nearly two-year-old war in Gaza. Qatar is a key mediator, and while its leaders have vowed to press forward, the next steps are uncertain for a long-sought deal to halt the fighting and release hostages taken from Israel.\n\nCondemning the strike but supporting Israel\n\nIsrael’s attack Tuesday also has ruptured Trump’s hopes to secure a wider Middle East peace deal, with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar all uniting in anger.\n\nTrump himself has distanced himself from the strike, saying it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals” and has promised Qatar that it would not be repeated. The U.S. also joined a U.N. Security Council statement condemning the strike without mentioning Israel by name.\n\nWhile in Israel, Rubio plans to visit the City of David, a popular archaeological site and tourist destination built by Israel in the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan in contested east Jerusalem.\n\nIt contains some of the oldest remains of the 3,000-year-old city. But critics accuse the site’s operators of pushing a nationalistic agenda at the expense of Palestinian residents.\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem, home to the city’s most important religious sites, in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed the area.\n\nIsrael claims the entire city as its eternal, undivided capital while the Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The competing claims lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and frequently boil over into violence.","summary":"Rubio and Trump met on Friday with Qatar’s prime minister to discuss the fallout from the Israeli operation.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/13/rubio-seeks-answers-from-israel-on-way-forward-in-gaza-after-qatar-strike/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_54431-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 22:05:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":360274278,"title":"Donald Trump makes major threat to Russia as WW3 fears escalate","text":"US President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Russia, threatening to impose severe sanctions amid escalating tensions between NATO and Moscow.

A murder has been committed against a group of citizens using lethal force.”\n\nThe White House defended the strike, with spokeswoman Anna Kelly calling the victims “evil Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists” and saying that Nicolas Maduro is “not the legitimate president of Venezuela” and is a “fugitive.”\n\nSeveral countries deny Maduro’s legitimacy as a democratically elected leader due to what some have viewed as unfair elections, but the Trump administration has not provided evidence linking the Venezuelan president to Tren de Aragua.

They didn’t want to lose sight of the brand Swift has meticulously crafted over the past two decades. \n\nTheir engagement is touted as the ideal American relationship — but it’s not.\n\nSwift is something of a marketing genius, constantly altering her image and music to adapt to what is culturally relevant. This skill for promotion reached its peak when she began dating Kelce, a relationship that was exhaustingly promoted by everyone from TMZ to the NFL. \n\nPerfect illusion\n\n Seeing the couple take the next step in their relationship is, generally, a good thing. Many conservatives rushed to defend the couple against those who were weary after the endless, inescapable coverage of their romance. \n\nTheir defense was correct: It is good for young people to see examples of healthy relationships ending in marriage. Swift, one of the most profitable musicians of all time, has become a cultural icon who many young women look up to. Seeing her mature into marriage is an encouraging illustration for her loyal fanbase.\n\n But it's also a kind of illusion. \n\n Swift and Kelce, both 35 years old, are millionaires several times over. They each have achieved international stardom, forging lives, careers, and fame long before they began building a life together. Their combined net worth is a number that would make most Americans laugh as they fret over the price of eggs, gas, and college. \n\nTheir engagement is touted as the ideal American relationship — but it’s not. Their engagement came only after they first pursued individual personal success. They waited until their mid-30s to begin the marital process, instead expending their younger years focusing on worldly success above all else.\n\nThey will likely never have to worry about mortgages or grocery bills, their children will probably never have to save money for college, and their age of retirement will not be based on financial necessity. Their coming marriage is entirely different from the typical American marriage. \n\nBroken blueprint\n\nBut why is that a bad thing?\n\n In a recent poll of Gen Z Americans, 34% of men who voted for President Donald Trump said that having children is the most important part of their personal definition of success. Of that same group, 29% defined their personal success by being married. On the other hand, 51% women who voted for Kamala Harris said the most important definition of personal success is having a fulfilling job or career. Shockingly, only 6% of those women believe that having children or being married are definitions of success. Even women who voted for Trump ranked their financial independence and career success above familial obligations.\n\n It’s no secret that our culture is divided. But this polling reveals where the line is drawn and how deeply it's splitting society apart. Young women, who make up a large portion of Swift’s audience, are focused on fiscal obligations. Young conservative men, who are seeking family life above all else, are the outliers.\n\n Gen Z sees marriage as something that can only come after they have achieved financial independence and professional success. Wherein marriage was once the foundation of a healthy, thriving society, it's now the capstone on a fully established life. \n\nNeed more proof? Shortly after World War II, the median age for marriage was between 20 and 22. Today, that number is much closer to 30. Meanwhile, between 1900 and 2022, the U.S. marriage rate dropped by almost 60%. \n\nTwisted priorities\n\nPundits use a plethora of excuses for these changes. They blame financial insecurity, inflation rates, crime statistics, souring housing prices, and societal disasters, like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. But wars, famines, and periods of uncertainty have always been a part of the human experience.\n\n The real problem is rooted in how young people are now taught to view marriage. \n\nRELATED: Misogyny? Please: Our real problem is female entitlement\n\n David Eulitt/Getty Images\n\nZoomers are taught that personal identity and financial success are life's greatest achievements. Public schools relentlessly promote college education as the predominant adolescent accomplishment and cite university degrees as distinguished identities. A secure bank account and a high-yield stock portfolio are championed above building families. \n\n The feminist movement has clearly made this problem much more severe for young women. As seen in the polling, women are subjected to this financial enslavement regardless of political affiliation. And as feminism wormed its way into every aspect of our culture, it removed the value of being a loving wife and mother. From an early age, young girls are told that they have been freed from the \"oppression\" of familial duties. Instead, they are encouraged to build corporate, highly marketable identities. \n\n It’s good to see Swift and Kelce take on the responsibility of marriage. But the idea that marriage is the capstone of an economically viable partnership is a rejection of the natural order. \n\nFans who want to see Swift sign a prenup and refuse to change her name are the manifestation of a confused generation. They have been taught to think that it's better to isolate the individual for their valuable branding rather than find peace in the glory of marriage.","summary":"Less than 20 minutes after Taylor Swift posted photos celebrating her engagement to Travis Kelce to Instagram, the comments section filled with young fans warning her to get a prenup or to resist taking Travis’ last name. \n\n For the fanbase, this engagement was an exciting personal achievement, but one that was not meant to be overshadowed by her individual professional achievements.

Bill Lee's office informed him earlier in the week. The Democratic mayor said conversations continued throughout the week, and he had been talking about the possibility of getting more law enforcement presence through the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \n\nThen, on Friday morning, Trump made his announcement on Fox News. He said Memphis is “deeply troubled” and “we’re going to fix that just like we did Washington,” where he deployed the National Guard and surged federal law enforcement. \n\nAsked on CNN whether he had “hard confirmation” before Trump's announcement, Young said: “No, that was the confirmation.”\n\nDays earlier Memphis police reported drops in every major crime category in the first eight months of 2025 compared with the same period in previous years. Overall crime hit a 25-year low, and murder a six-year low, police said. \n\nBut Memphis has dealt with stubborn gun violence problems for years. In 2023 the city saw a record 390 homicides.\n\nThe city also is still wrestling with fallout from the January 2023 death of Tyre Nichols after he was beaten by Memphis police officers. In December the Department of Justice under then-President Joe Biden found a host of civil rights violations in the police department, part of an investigation spurred by Nichols' death. The findings included the use of excessive force, illegal traffic stops and disproportionate targeting of Black people in the majority-Black city. \n\nIn May, now under the Trump administration, the department withdrew those findings.\n\n Details remain in flux \n\nThe governor has said how the guard will factor into efforts to tackle crime is still being ironed out. Lee and Trump talked Friday and plan to do so again early next coming week, his spokesperson Elizabeth Lane Johnson said. The governor has said the deployment would add momentum to an ongoing FBI operation alongside state and local law enforcement that “has already arrested hundreds of the most violent offenders.”\n\nThe mayor said Saturday that the specifics remain unknown about how many troops will come and when, their exact role and more. He expects to learn more next week. \n\nAsked what he would recommend the National Guard focus on in Memphis, Young suggested tasks such as support for big events, including traffic assistance. He also said they could assist law enforcement in monitoring cameras and call in backup when they see criminal activity, or lend a hand with neighborhood “beautification.” \n\n Mayor not ‘happy’ about deployment \n\nYoung has disputed Trump’s assertion that the mayor is “happy” about the introduction of the National Guard. He has said he did not ask for a deployment and does not think it will reduce crime. But he acknowledged that the city has remained high on too many “bad lists,” and since the deployment has been decided, he wants to ”drive how they engage in our city.”\n\nYoung said he understands the fears within the Memphis community and noted that the National Guard was deployed there in 1968 after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.\n\n“We don’t want to invoke those same images here,” Young said.\n\n National Guard's roles \n\nThe guard also helped enforce school integration in Clinton in 1956. \n\nIts troops have been deployed for aid in many large-scale disasters, such as floods, winter storms, Hurricane Helene and wildfires. They filled roles during the COVID-19 pandemic, including help in testing operations.\n\nThey also have been on the ground in Tennessee and elsewhere during tense moments, such as protests in both Washington and on the state Capitol grounds after George Floyd’s killing. The governor deployed them for some Trump-driven initiatives, including going to the southern border; doing administrative work for federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state; and returning to Washington under the president's recent crime-centered mission.\n\n The scene in Washington \n\nIn Washington the National Guard deployment of about 2,000 troops from seven states and the D.C. guard units continues although Trump's emergency order lapsed when Congress did not extend it.\n\nA heavy presence of armed troops remains in many public spaces traveled by tourists and visitors, including Union Station and several metro rail platforms.\n\nBecause Washington is a federal city, the guard is directly under the president’s command, making the situation somewhat different than in Memphis. \n\nGovernors control their state’s guards; it is unclear whether Memphis could see out-of-state troops.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged that the city's future includes federal law authorities doing what is more basic local work. Bowser has set up an operation center to push better coordination and communications between the Metropolitan Police and those agencies.\n\nThe one agency she has omitted from talks about cooperation is the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has rounded up hundreds of people.\n\nOn Friday agents from Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI and the Metropolitan Police worked security side by side at a high school football game, the same day the mayor and school officials announced changes in attendance because of violence between fans at recent games.\n\nAssociated Press writer Gary Fields in Washington contributed.","summary":"The Memphis mayor says President Donald Trump’s TV announcement was the first hard confirmation he received that Trump would send in the National Guard to address crime","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-national-guard-washington-memphis-fbi-b2826064.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/13/23/Trump_Memphis_91257.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 21:58:39","author":"Jonathan Mattise","authors":["Jonathan Mattise"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":360273578,"title":"Romania scrambles F-16 fighter jets after Russian drone enters NATO member state's airspace","text":"Romania became the latest NATO member state to report a drone incursion into its airspace Saturday, as Poland scrambled aircraft in response to fresh Russian drone strikes just over the border in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was deliberately expanding its drone operations and that the West needed to respond with tougher sanctions and closer defence cooperation.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump said he was ready to impose major sanctions on Russia - just as soon as all NATO nations did the same thing and stopped buying Russian oil.\n\nRomania's defence ministry said Saturday that the country's airspace had been breached by a drone during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nThe country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets late on Saturday to monitor the situation following the strikes, said a defence ministry statement.\n\nThe jets 'detected a drone in national airspace' and tracked it until 'it disappeared from the radar' near the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, it added.\n\nAlso Saturday, Poland said it and its NATO allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine not far from its border.\n\nBecause of the drone threat, 'Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, and ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have reached their highest level of alert,' the country's military command posted in a statement on X.\n\nLater Saturday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the high alert had been lifted, while cautioning: 'We remain vigilant.'\n\nPoland and its fellow NATO countries have been on their guard since Warsaw said nearly 20 Russian drones entered its airspace overnight Tuesday to Wednesday.\n\nWhile Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries including France, Germany and Sweden have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response.\n\n'Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n'Also today, Poland responded militarily to the threat of Russian attack drones,' which had also been active in different regions of Ukraine all day, he added.\n\nThe Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air,' said Zelensky.\n\nThe latest drone incursions were 'an obvious expansion of the war by Russia', he added.\n\nWhat was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defence system, Zelensky argued.\n\n'Do not wait for dozens of 'shaheds' and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,' he warned, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday expressed concern at the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace earlier in the week.\n\nIf it turned out to have been deliberate, 'then obviously it will be... highly escalatory,' he told reporters in Washington.\n\nTrump's suggestion on Thursday that the incident might have happened by 'mistake', was quickly dismissed by Tusk.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump returned to the issue of sanctions against Russia, putting the ball back in the court of his NATO allies.\n\n'I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,' he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened sanctions against Russia without following through.\n\nIn Russia, an official reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit one of its largest oil refining complexes, 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.\n\nThe drone had sparked a fire and caused minor damage at the complex, which belongs to Russian oil company Bashneft, and lies on the outskirts of the central Russian city of Ufa.\n\nA source in Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nSince Moscow launched its full-scale military offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian refineries in an attempt to curb the Kremlin's ability to fund the conflict through its fossil fuel industry.","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was deliberately expanding its drone operations.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15095883/Romania-scrambles-F-16-fighter-jets-Russian-drone-enters-NATO-member-states-airspace.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/13/22/102113775-0-image-a-73_1757798816083.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 21:56:47","author":"Editor,Olivia Allhusen","authors":["Editor","Olivia Allhusen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.08},{"id":360283954,"title":"Charli XCX wears a bridal white lace mini dress with her husband George Daniel as the couple sip on cocktails ahead of second wedding in Italy","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: 100 new Epstein emails 'that could destroy' Prince Andrew: Cache of 'devastating' messages between the Duke and convicted paedophile unearthed in US probe\n\nStarmer cried: 'You're supposed to be protecting me'.

become the most recent NATO country to confirm a drone violation of its airspace on Saturday, coinciding with Poland dispatching aircraft due to new Russian drone attacks near the Ukrainian border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cautioned that Russia is intentionally broadening its drone operations, urging the West to implement stricter sanctions and enhance defense collaboration.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump expressed his readiness to introduce substantial sanctions against Russia, contingent on all NATO countries taking similar steps and halting purchases of Russian oil.\n\nOn Saturday, Romania’s defense ministry reported that its airspace was penetrated by a drone amidst a Russian assault on infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe country scrambled two F-16 fighter jets late on Saturday to monitor the situation following the strikes, said a defence ministry statement.\n\nThe military jets identified a drone within Romania’s airspace and monitored it until it vanished from radar close to the Romanian village of Chilia Veche, they stated.\n\nAlso Saturday, Poland said it and its NATO allies had deployed helicopters and aircraft as Russian drones struck Ukraine not far from its border.\n\nBecause of the drone threat, ‘Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, and ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have reached their highest level of alert,’ the country’s military command posted in a statement on X.\n\nLater Saturday, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the high alert had been lifted, while cautioning: ‘We remain vigilant.’\n\nPoland and its fellow NATO countries have been on their guard since Warsaw said nearly 20 Russian drones entered its airspace overnight Tuesday to Wednesday.\n\nWhile Russia denies targeting Poland, several European countries including France, Germany and Sweden have stepped up their support for defending Polish airspace in response.\n\n‘Today, Romania scrambled combat aircraft because of a Russian drone in its airspace,’ said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n‘Also today, Poland responded militarily to the threat of Russian attack drones,’ which had also been active in different regions of Ukraine all day, he added.\n\nThe Russian military knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air,’ said Zelensky.\n\nThe latest drone incursions were ‘an obvious expansion of the war by Russia’, he added.\n\nWhat was required in response were fresh sanctions against Russia and a collective defence system, Zelensky argued.\n\n‘Do not wait for dozens of ‘shaheds’ and ballistic missiles before finally making decisions,’ he warned, referring to the Iranian-designed Shahed drones Russia is using.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday expressed concern at the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace earlier in the week.\n\nIf it turned out to have been deliberate, ‘then obviously it will be… highly escalatory,’ he told reporters in Washington.\n\nTrump’s suggestion on Thursday that the incident might have happened by ‘mistake’, was quickly dismissed by Tusk.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump returned to the issue of sanctions against Russia, putting the ball back in the court of his NATO allies.\n\n‘I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,’ he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened sanctions against Russia without following through.\n\nIn Russia, an official reported that a Ukrainian drone had hit one of its largest oil refining complexes, 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.\n\nThe drone had sparked a fire and caused minor damage at the complex, which belongs to Russian oil company Bashneft, and lies on the outskirts of the central Russian city of Ufa.\n\nA source in Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nSince Moscow launched its full-scale military offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian refineries in an attempt to curb the Kremlin’s ability to fund the conflict through its fossil fuel industry.","summary":"Internewscast

“Dismantle” the Left After Charlie Kirk Assassination","text":"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed Friday that he and President Donald Trump would use this week’s assassination of Charlie Kirk to “dismantle” the organized left using state power.\n\nIn a rant on Fox News, Miller — the architect of Trump’s mass roundups and deportations of immigrants — shouted that the best way to honor Kirk’s memory was to carry out a political purge against the left, which he called a “domestic terrorism movement in this country.”\n\nMiller provided few details on what specific left-wing figures or groups he believed were stoking this violence. He claimed the left was waging “doxxing campaigns” against right-wing figures, though he cited no specific examples.\n\nHe did, however, cite many examples of harsh, but nevertheless First Amendment-protected, speech that he considered an incitement to violence, including that “the left calls people enemies of the republic, calls them fascists, says they’re Nazis, says they’re evil,” and claimed that many people online were “celebrating” Kirk’s assassination.\n\n“The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven,” Miller said, was, “that we have to dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence, and we are going to do that.”\n\n“Under President Trump’s leadership,” Miller vowed to shut down these unspecified leftist groups.\n\n“I don’t care how,” he said. “It could be a RICO charge, a conspiracy charge, conspiracy against the United States, insurrection. But we are going to do what it takes to dismantle the organizations and the entities that are fomenting riots, that are doxxing, that are trying to inspire terrorism, that are committing acts of wanton violence.”\n\nRICO refers to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which the government has traditionally used to prosecute organized crime groups. Trump later said one of his targets for these charges may be the billionaire liberal donor George Soros, the owner of the Open Society Foundations nonprofit, whom Trump accused of funding “riots,” a charge Soros denied.\n\nMiller did not limit his call to destroying those who commit crimes. He also spoke of those “spreading this evil hate,” telling them, “You will live in exile. Because the power of law enforcement under President Trump’s leadership will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, to take away your power, and if you’ve broken the law, to take away your freedom.”\n\nAn official White House account on X reposted a clip of Miller’s comments calling for the “dismantling” of left-wing organizations:\n\n“Trump signaled he intended to use Kirk’s shooting as a pretext for a broad crackdown on the left,” said Jordan Weissman, a journalist at The Argument. “Here’s Stephen Miller being much more explicit. He’s talking about RICO and terrorism charges, echoing right-wing influencers.”\n\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, meanwhile, pointed out the irony of the threat coming from Miller, noting that he “routinely slanders his political opponents with vile language that treats disagreement as if it’s treason.”\n\nLittle is still known about what, if any, political ideology precisely motivated Kirk’s alleged shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was apprehended in Utah on Friday. Robinson was not affiliated with any political party, and the scrawlings he left behind at the scene of the crime contain a mishmash of hyper-online but only vaguely political symbols and phrases.\n\nBut even before the suspect had been identified or apprehended, efforts had begun on the right to use Kirk’s murder as an excuse to crack down on their left-wing enemies. In an ominous speech Thursday night, Trump blamed the shooting on the “radical left,” saying it was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”\n\nOn Fox News Friday, Trump indicated that he was extending this dragnet to anyone who has expressed harsh words for figures on the right. The president said:\n\nFor years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country and must stop right now. My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges and law enforcement officials.\n\nThe portrayal of the left as a unique “national security threat” is not borne out by data. On Friday, The Economist published an analysis of data from the Prosecution Project, an open-source database that catalogues crimes that seek “a socio-political change or to communicate.”\n\nThe findings reaffirm what has been found in previous studies: That “extremists on both left and right commit violence, although more incidents appear to come from right-leaning attackers.”\n\nDuring the same Fox interview, when a host noted the prevalence of right-wing extremism, Trump said: “I’ll tell you something that’s going to get me in trouble, but I couldn’t care less. The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime. They’re saying, ‘We don’t want these people coming in. We don’t want you burning our shopping centers. We don’t want you shooting our people in the middle of the street.’”\n\nTrump concluded: “The radicals on the left are the problem.”\n\nMeanwhile, virtually all prominent figures and groups on the left — from politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to writers for left-wing publications like Jacobin or The Nation to activist groups like Public Citizen, MoveOn, the ACLU, and Indivisible — have unequivocally condemned violence against Kirk, even while repudiating his views.\n\n“Trump explicitly threatened to use the state to target anyone he and MAGA scapegoat for Kirk’s murder,” said New Republic writer Greg Sargeant. “We really could see Stephen Miller and Kash Patel use the FBI for 60s-style domestic persecution.”","summary":"Miller threatened to deploy RICO and terrorism charges to persecute progressive organizations and individuals.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/stephen-miller-vows-to-dismantle-the-left-after-charlie-kirk-assassination/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232756062-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 21:49:57","author":"Stephen Prager","authors":["Stephen Prager"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026}]}
