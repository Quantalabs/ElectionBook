H.R. McMaster, who served as national security advisor for Trump from 2017-2018, made the remarks amid speculation that the GOP presidential nominee, if reelected, could seek direct diplomacy with Kim in pursuit of a peace deal. During his nomination acceptance speech last week, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim and signaled his apparent desire to reengage with the North Korean leader. \"I think if Donald Trump is elected president, what you're going to see right away is Kim Jong-un trying to rekindle their bromance,\" McMaster said during an online chat hosted by the Washington-based Hudson Institute. \"Then what he's going to do right after that is he's going to say, 'Hey, I've got a deal for you. I'm going to satisfy your impulse toward retrenchment, and in exchange for US forces leaving the peninsula and just letting me have only just a few nukes, I will stop my long-range ballistic missile program, and I'll limit my nuclear program,'\" he added. The former White House official stressed that Kim may angle for an agreement like the Iranian nuclear deal that Washington withdrew from during Trump's presidency in 2018. \"He's going to hope to get something like an Iran nuclear deal -- a terrible deal for the United States. He won't get that from a Trump administration, but he's posturing himself for that,\" he said. Though Trump, if reelected, could seek to complete the unfinished business of addressing the North Korean quandary, uncertainty remains over whether Pyongyang would accede to any US outreach at a time when it is deepening cooperation with Moscow in the midst of Russia's war in Ukraine. Touching on a deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang, McMaster said that what Kim wants is to \"break out of isolation.\" \"Russia has helped him do that with providing the energy needs for North Korea. This let up a lot of pressure on North Korea,\" he said. He claimed that North Korea, Russia and China want to push the US \"out of critical regions.\" \"What you hear over and over again is this mantra of getting the US out of these regions so China can establish an exclusionary area of primacy across the Indo-Pacific, North Korea can get the US off the peninsula as the first step in unifying the Korean peninsula,\" he said. \"What Iran wants to do is again to extend his hegemonic influence, and Russia wants to reestablish itself as a great power and reestablish the Russian Empire.\" On the issue of defense cost-sharing with allies, he stressed Trump's argument against \"free riding.\" \"This is where President Trump has had a very strong argument: Americans don't want people free-riding on their largesse,\" he said. He pointed to South Korea and Japan as burden-sharing examples. \"South Korea, for example, has a very robust defense capability as (it is) increasing their defense spending,\" he said. \"Both of those countries defray the cost of US forces such that if you were to move those US forces to the United States, you would pay three or four times more as taxpayers to sustain those forces and their facilities.\" (Yonhap)","summary":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may try to rekindle his &quot;bromance&quot; with former President Donald Trump if he returns to the White House, a former US official said Monday, predicting Kim could propose a deal to limit his regime&#039;s nuclear program in return for American troops&#039; pullout from South Korea.

Now, the No. 1 burning question is who will she choose as her running mate? A handful of names have been tossed around, many of them solid picks—but the choice may come down to the demographic she needs to court rather than which person she likes best. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker may be who she needs to grab that never-Trump Republican vote.The Lincoln Project Demographic While former President Donald Trump maintains fevered support from the MAGA crowd, he continues to turn moderates and GOP-leaning independents away from the Republican Party—even those who backed him in the previous elections.An example of this came during an interview of an independent voter named Scott Simeone who said, \"I can't vote for Trump. He's a crook. He's too corrupt. I voted for him, and I didn't realize he's as corrupt as he is.\"You see it in the polls as well. A New York Times poll conducted in December showed that only 24 percent of unaffiliated voters would choose Trump in the presidential match-up. In Iowa, two in 10 voters don't want a Trump presidency and in New Hampshire, it is about one in three. A quarter of South Carolinians reject him as well.It is clearly a demographic that could help break that glass ceiling and put Harris in the Oval Office.J.B. Pritzker, who defeated Republican Bruce Rauner in 2018 to become the governor of Illinois, has already voiced his support for the Harris campaign saying, \"She represents our Party's best chance to defeat Donald Trump in November, and I will work my heart out to help her do that.\"The billionaire governor is an enticing pick. His substantial net worth allowed him to nearly self-fund his 2018 and 2022 campaigns, and he is known to give freely to other democrats when needed.Pritzker is one of the founders of the Pritzker Group, a venture capital firm as well as an heir to the Hyatt hotels. Should the hypothetical Harris-Pritzker ticket need a cash infusion, he is well-equipped to provide it because \"unlike Donald Trump, he is a real billionaire.\" (Not that Madame VP needs any help on the financial front—she's already killing it on the fundraising front.)Why Harris Might Choose HimPritzker has had a hand in quite a few progressive wins for the state of Illinois.—Legalized Marijuana—Recreational use was legalized in Illinois in 2020 making it the 11th state to do so. However, the bill Pritzker signed did more than just legalize usage, it also included \"a comprehensive legalization package\" that allowed for 700,000 low-level convictions to be expunged.—Raised Minimum Wage—Making good on a campaign promise, Pritzker signed a measure in 2019 to move the state's minimum wage from $8.25 to $15 by 2025.—Protected Abortion Rights—Illinois' Reproductive Health Act, which Pritzker signed in 2019, made reproductive health care a fundamental right in the state. \"When it comes to contraception, abortion, and reproductive care, this law puts the decision-making where it belongs: in the hands of women and their doctors,\" Pritzker said at the signing.Why Never-Trumpers Might Choose HimIt is abundantly clear that Pritzker has no love for Trump. When the former president was convicted in the hush money trial, Pritzker released a statement that said, \"Donald Trump is a racist, a homophobe, a grifter, and a threat to this country. He can now add one more title to his list - a felon.\"Dislike for Trump isn't enough to garner votes though.But, conservative-leaning independents might find Pritzker palatable because of his business ties. It is no secret that Republicans love a rich white dude.The economy is a big factor in everyone's decision this election, and Pritzker may have the economic chops to collect votes in November. His supporters in the state brag about how he \"stabilized Illinois' finances,\" balanced the budget, and \"helped get the state back on its feet.\" These accomplishments will sit very well with those worried about the financial state of the nation.Problems the Ticket Will FaceA VP Pritzker would likely fare well in his state which gets 19 electoral college votes in 2024, but it has swung blue in the last eight presidential elections—not much of a help to the Harris campaign. But, he is a better choice than California Governor Gavin Newsom, who would likely lose her her a swath of California electoral votes.Pritzker's toilet scandal is not something the Trump campaign is likely to leave alone, and then there are his comments caught on a FBI wiretap to contend with. Pritzker's scandals may be a hard sell for the Harris campaign.

The fundraising will add on to the Biden campaign’s funds, which were turned over to Harris on Sunday and totaled $96 million at the end of June. Harris introduced herself to Biden’s campaign staff—now her campaign staff—in Wilmington, Delaware on Monday afternoon, giving a speech in which she leaned on her career as a prosecutor to blast Trump: “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,” she said, before adding, “So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\" Harris told staffers another Trump presidency would “put Social Security and Medicare” on the chopping block” and that the former president wants “to take our country backward.” Biden called into the staff meeting and was praised by Harris, who lauded his presidency and was told by the president, “You’re the best, kid.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

This remains unclear, with less than a month to go before the start of the Democratic National Convention, though Harris has tapped Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to lead the process of vetting her potential running mates. Figures like Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have emerged as names commonly floated as possible top contenders—all of whom have already endorsed Harris. Beshear largely demurred when asked by MSNBC on Monday about potentially joining the ticket, but called the chatter “flattering,” while Cooper said in a separate MSNBC appearance, “I appreciate people talking about me.” Shapiro at a press conference said Harris has an “important decision” ahead of her. When Could Harris Secure The Democratic Nomination? Harris swiftly won the support of many Democratic delegates after Biden ended his campaign, and by Monday evening was on the cusp of crossing the threshold of the 1,976 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, according to an Associated Press tracker, which reported she had 1,661 committed delegates shortly after 8 p.m. EDT. Democrats had been planning to choose their nominee via a roll call vote, potentially as early as the first week of August, though the exact process remains up in the air—the Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee plans to meet Wednesday to finalize the party’s process. The convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. Crucial Quote Biden, who is isolating after contracting COVID-19 last week, addressed staffers over the phone about his decision to drop out. “I know yesterday's news was surprising, and it was hard for you to hear. But it was the right thing to do.” Key Background Harris’ hot fundraising start is just one part of her efforts to lessen the polling gaps between her and Trump, as the former president commanded a six-point lead on her in a Forbes/HarrisX poll conducted July 19-21. Biden swiftly endorsed Harris after he announced his withdrawal from the race Sunday and said he believed it was in the best interest of the Democratic Party and country to “step down.” Biden was facing calls from dozens of Democrats in Congress to step down following a disastrous debate performance last month that put a spotlight on his age and mental acuity, which had been increasingly scrutinized as the 81-year-old president worked further into his term. Biden says he intends to remain president until his term ends in January.

Though there was immense pressure on the 81-year-old Biden to step down after his disastrous performance in the televised debate with former President Donald Trump in June, the President had stood firm and said only “Lord Almighty” himself could persuade him to drop out of the race. Biden’s debate fiasco was followed by more flubs at the NATO summit where he mixed up the names of his vice president Kamala Harris and his Republican rival and also addressed Ukraine’s President Zelensky as President Putin. At the same time he refused to undergo cognitive tests to assess his suitability for running for office. The last straw was the assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally that virtually sealed the deal for the former US President. As top donors pulled out of the Biden campaign and senior Democrats urged him to withdraw, the US President, self-isolating after a bout of Covid, was pushed into a corner and forced to end his presidential bid. With Biden endorsing her as the Democratic nominee for the presidential race, Kamala Harris is best placed to succeed him on the ticket which will make her the first non-white female and first Indian American candidate for the US presidency. However, her nomination is not a done deal. The process of nominating Biden’s replacement will culminate in the Democratic Party convention in Chicago in August. While Harris leads the race, other contenders for the Democratic nomination are Illinois Governor J B Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune; Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitner, who has risen in prominence in the Democratic Party; California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been pushing a progressive agenda; rising political star Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro; North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear; and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Whoever the nominee is, they will be at a distinct disadvantage because of the limited time at their disposal to raise funds for their campaign. The uncertainty in the Democratic camp offers a big advantage to Trump, who — apart from his hardcore supporters — hopes to lure floating voters too. His pet rants on immigration, the economy and US foreign policy have a captive audience. His Make America Great Again (MAGA) slogan has caught on with a large section of the electorate. However, Trump’s overconfidence may well lead to his downfall. Underestimating his Democratic rival, whoever that may be, could prove costly. The groundswell of support for the Democrats among the African American and Hispanic communities should not be overlooked. Whatever happens in November, the USA is in for interesting times as it gets ready to elect its 47th President.","summary":"","url":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/analysis/editorial-us-presidential-race-heats-up","image":"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2022-03/97eb1339-1881-4259-bb80-9d15df8cb8ca/biden_eur.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:30:00","author":"Fpj Editorial","authors":["Fpj Editorial"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":252382598,"title":"The Remarkable Story Of Boll & Branch - An Interview With Scott Tannen","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Scott Tannen, co-founder & CEO Boll & Branch There’s something romantic about America’s pastime and collecting baseball cards makes it even more enjoyable. Scott Tannen, founder and CEO of Boll & Branch, and I we were remeniscing about our favorite cards we collected in our youth. If you look closely, there are a trove of life lessons we can also glean from the sport — many of which remind me about the story of Boll & Branch which embody resilience, grit, and determination. Ken Griffey Jr. was arguably the face of the baseball in the 1990s and while The Kid belted over 600 homeruns in his illustrious career, he also struck out nearly 10,000 times. Someone without Griffey’s notoriety and perhaps who most fans have never heard of is a man who once struck out 3 times in an entire season. How is that even possible? “I never had trouble seeing the ball,” said Joe Sewell, who often claimed he could see the spiraling seams on a baseball. “That’s because I followed it in. Why, I could even see the ball leave my bat.” In 7,132 career at-bats, Sewell heard the umpire say “Strike three” just 114 times. That’s one strikeout every 17 games, or in just .014 percent of his total times at the plate during the 1920s and 30s.

Missy and Scott Tannen Boll & Branch “We launched with a simple product line. We had sheets in two colors and blankets in three colors, that’s it. We wanted to be really good at one thing in particular,” explained Scott. Before the brand exploded on Howard Stern, there were several pivotal moments that led Scott and Missy to disrupt this legacy category. As the couple was transitioning to a king size bed, Missy looked high and low for the right sheets. This problem led Scott on an internet search journey that yielded the same results and eventually Missy had to step in because of her eye for design. “If I did this by myself we would have had a great business model and ugly sheets,” Scott admitted. In hindsight, the first chapter of his life may have prepared him for this opportunity. Growing up his father emobdied the image of the classic corporate professional, donning a suit and carrying a briefcase each day. His mother transitioned from being a homemaker to becoming a real estate agent. “It was only until I began my entrepreneurial journey that I realized it wasn’t my dad who was the entrepreneur, it was my mom. She opened up her own office and became one of the most productive realtors in the state of New Jersey. Eventually, my father was working for her.” His wife, Missy, mirrored his mother’s path in many ways. Missy had been a third-grade teacher before they decided to start a business together. When they founded their company, Boll & Branch, Missy was at home with their children. Her transition from homemaker to businesswoman highlighted the immense talent and capability that often remains untapped. Scott cut his teeth in digital marketing at CPG brands like Nabisco and Wrigley. It’s also where he observed and engaged with people who shaped his leadership philosophy today — like the art of receiving feedback. “I was leading a gaming website which at the time was one of the top 100 most visited websites on the internet and I was the young superstar. While everyone was telling me how great I was, Mike Brandstaedter, who later went on to become the CEO of Topps, gave me some of the best feedback.” Scott shared stories about the guidance from Mike before and after high profile meetings. “Mike would challenge me and he would help me stay grounded. He would prepare for big meetings and after when everyone would tell how great I did — he would constructively point out things I could have improved.” As Scott leaned in, he also acknowledged that he made a lot of mistakes in his career. At his last video game company he realized that the commercial success covered up some of the gaps in the organization and he learned his lesson the hard way. “When the iPhone came out and I knew the gaming industry was about to change. I had to question if we were good enough as a company and if I was good enough as a leader to go head to head against Electronic Arts. In the end, I decided to sell the company because I didn’t think we could win.” Backing down from a challenge wasn’t natural to Scott. But in hindsight, his mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness shortly thereafter and he was able to spend more time with her in those coming months — which I think was a blessing in disguise. This inflection point made him question everything. The real moment Boll & Branch was born wasn’t when he was searchign the internet for linens. It was this moment when he decided making an impact in his next role was paramount. It took nearly two years to go to market from the inecption of Boll & Branch because Scott and Missy were untangling the legacy manufacturing practices of the linen industry. “I remember learning that the life expectancy of a conventional cotton farmer in India at the time was 36 — and I was around the same age at that time. I began to question, why? It’s not hard to see things if you want to find the answers.” Scott learned that these farmers who were living below the poverty line were buying seeds along with toxic chemicals to grow cotton out of desperation — not always understanding or thinking about the effects on themselves, their drinking water, or their community. “Some farmers without an education couldn’t even read the warning labels on these chemicals. So they’re strapping them to their backs and spraying them out in the fields, and ultimately onto themselves.” Just like that an entire community is exposed to toxic chemicals which can lead to higher rates of cancer and other illnesses. As Scott was knee-deep in research, he came across Chetna, an organic cotton coalition supporting Fairtrade cotton. “They were started by a Dutch NGO and they were doing their own seed harvesting and helping communities convert over to being organic. They were determined to help communities improve their lifestyles and the average life exptectancy.” Scott had heard enough — but he also read that there was no demand for the cotton so he sent a cold email with compelling proposition. “I told them while I didn’t know anything about bed sheets — I was going to make some and I was going to use their cotton.” From there, Scott and Missy detangled the rest of the supply chain. They co-invested with family owned operations and helped them verticalize their own supply chain to become sustainable and profitable. In turn, there were less markups from middle men which provided better margins for the company and better savings for the customer. The success of the company didn’t come without hard decisions that had to be made. Instead of raising venture capital and making decisions based on what investors wanted, they decided to self-fund the company in the beginning. “We wanted to build the right kind of company. Neither of us would say we’re the smartest people in the room — but nobody would outhustle us. We never questioned whether or not this would work.” The most pivotal decision, however, came at the expense of Howard Stern on Sirius XM as they had only dabbled in advertising at that point but were ready to make a splash. He took out the last $2 million in debt because that was the minimum investment required to advertise with his favorite radio host. “I strongly believed Howard can sell this stuff because people trust him. At the same time, it didn’t make any sense. We're a luxury brand in the organic space. So why Howard? We sent him and his wife sheets and they loved them.” The brand exploded after advertising on Stern and it was difficult to keep up with demand. With success comes great sacrifice. In the early days the 24/7, 800 number actually rang Scott’s cell phone. But one of the greatest lessons he learned from his father was being present. Scott and Missy figured out a way to integrate their children into the business and they took them on trips to visit manufacturers overseas. The best leaders lead by example. “I love the concept of leaving loudly. I don’t miss my child’s games. I expect for my employees to do the same and they don't have to ask permission. If your kid is in the school play, you go and everybody else can pick up around you. Just be honest about what you've got and don't make the sacrifices that you'll regret and that will make you feel sad.” Life, like baseball, isn’t always about hitting homeruns. We strikeout, we get on base, and we learn from every situation with the goal of getting better. Hall of Famer Joe Sewell was often was solicited about how he kept his eye on the ball. “There’s no excuse for a major league player striking out 100 times a season,” Sewell said in 1960. “Unless, of course, he’s blind.” Follow me on Twitter.

There tends to be a frantic spending of whatever funds they may have remaining to avoid ‘them’ from taking it away in the upcoming year. The ‘them’ being some invisible person in a finance department that is seen as swooping through a spreadsheet and either allowing the budget numbers to stay or indiscriminately snatching them away. There is commiseration between leaders, a knowing eye roll and the wringing of hands that starts popping up in meetings everywhere. We’re all in the frustration together. Yet, no one really discusses their budget and what they’re doing with it. It’s treated like a precious secret. After all, if I admit how much budget I have, surplus or not, you may try to take it from me. There is a deep and ingrained mindset of ‘lack’ that is part of the cultural language when referencing budget planning. Won’t AI make all of this easy in the near future? We may assume that AI will make much of this budgeting and forecasting a breeze. However, according to The Association of Finance Professionals (AFP), human expertise and judgment still reigns supreme. While AI can process vast amounts of data, human expertise and judgment remain invaluable. AI may not provide the same level of analytical capability that humans have in particular situations. These financial decisions and situational nuances might be a struggle for AI models. This isn’t unique to certain companies or industries. It’s prevalent across businesses everywhere. If this is the reality that emerges every year in your organization and for yourself, how can you shift to a more proactive and strategic way of engaging in this annual process? Establish aligned goals. This is the starting line. If you, as a leader who’s responsible for a budget, do not have established goals, then how can anyone properly plan a budget for the work you are delivering on behalf of the organization you’ve chosen to work for? This goes beyond simply setting goals. You will need to pitch your goals to your direct manager and make sure they are onboard. You need to make sure the goals align with the overall strategy of the organization. Communicate with all stakeholders, throughout the year. You will want to confirm that your direct manager has this aligned with what’s approved by their manager and so forth. The budget is the investment the company agrees to make for you and your team to deliver on the goals you’ve committed to. For that budget to be approved and for you to get to keep it, you will need to care and feed for it by regularly engaging with your direct manager and any other relevant stakeholders with updates, progress reports and alerts to any setbacks or changes.

Instead of seeing the budget as assigned and predetermined, understand that it is a tool that should serve the goals vs. become one. Too often we get caught up with meeting a deadline or ‘coming under budget’ as the primary success measure. Instead, when we’re clear as to what we are trying to accomplish and why, we are able to gauge what the budget needs to be. We are more apt to negotiate and manage expectations around how much budget is needed and how it should be used. Help navigate the tricky risk management landscape. A major business aspect that businesses everywhere have to manage is the risk landscape. According to Accenture Risk Study: 2024, 83% of risk teams say that complex, interconnected risks are emerging rapidly. They also report that 72% of risk teams shared that their risk management capabilities have not kept pace with the rapidly changing landscape. Remember that you are, in fact, being entrusted with a resource to deliver quality results. Part of our role as a leader is ensuring that the investment from the company produces positive outcomes. And if it doesn’t, that we head off any loss of investment and course correct as efficiently and effectively as possible. It’s not just a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet. It’s a resource that others can’t use while we are holding it. Either use it well or give it to someone who will.

According to Accenture Risk Study: 2024, 83% of risk teams say that complex, interconnected risks are emerging rapidly. They also report that 72% of risk teams shared that their risk management capabilities have. Become a budgeting partner. Budgeting should be managed as a collaborative process. As leaders, we should be discussing big picture goals and needs of the organization. We should put egos aside and determine which areas need the most investment each year vs. hoarding whatever we can to try to keep our positions secure. This collaboration requires trust, transparency and a commitment to working together towards a common goal. This partnership mentality should include those that manage the budget tracking and allocation process in your finance department. According to The Hackett Group, cost containment and cash flow optimization have jumped to the top of the priority list for finance leaders in 2024, while expecting a 5% increase in finance workloads, with a decrease in staffing and operating budget. They are not the enemy. However, their purpose can feel like it competes with our own. That’s a misconception. Build a cross-functional relationship with your key contacts in finance that is engaged with throughout the year vs. only during critical decision points. They exist as a support function to you and the organization. Engage them as such. Pitch a new budget every year. If you are always evolving your team’s capabilities, you should be setting new goals every year. This is how organizations avoid going stagnant. That also means that the budget needs will shift and change, depending on what you’re delivering. Some years it may stay the same amount but may be allocated differently. Others it may be increasing or decreasing. The focus should be on the impact you’re committing to make on behalf of the organization. But forecasting can feel unsettling. After all, we are gambling on the future that we can’t predict or control and then putting our name on that decision. It can feel far more comfortable to just work with the number that’s been assigned in the past. But that’s a recipe for becoming obsolete and losing more than just budget allocations. In this climate of uncertainty, rapid change and frequent reorganizations, it can be easy to stick towards the hoarding and ‘use or lose’ mindsets. It’s what we know. It’s how most of us have survived and watched our own mangers survive. But shifting towards being a leader that drives change and helps shape the future will make this more proactive way of budget management a must have. Follow me on LinkedIn. Heather V.

They think she is a joke. ‘Cackling Kamala’, as Trump calls her, is the star of a thousand internet memes in which she looks awkward, talks oddly, not making sense — a bit like her predecessor. Caught on camera discussing the Vice President earlier this month, Trump was as brutal as you would expect: ‘She’s so bad,’ he said, ‘she’s pathetic.’ Trump will destroy her, the Grand Old Party (GOP) believes. And they know that if the Democrats seriously thought she could be a success, the party would have already endorsed her. But what if the Republicans are all wrong? What if Trump is making a grave error in underestimating Kamala’s strengths and assuming he’s on track to win in November? Indeed, there are plenty of Democrats who quietly hope — and maybe half believe — that Kamala has the power to reinvent herself. To recycle a slightly cumbersome phrase she has used on numerous occasions, Kamala is now ‘unburdened by what has been’. She is free from working for Joe — and she might yet bring down Donald Trump. Some suggest that Kamala’s fightback started well before Biden quit the race. Look at the money she raised in the first 24 hours. Her campaign team is claiming it was a cool $230 million. It was the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle — and probably a record amount for any candidate on day one. Money matters: if you are to grab the attention of the vast majority of Americans who couldn’t care less about politics, you must pay. She will have the cash. Kamala’s supporters are now hoping she can formulate a message that resonates with a nation that in many ways was equally unenthused with both Trump and Biden. She can tap into a hunger for a divisive and volatile chapter to be closed in American life. Kamala is not yet 60. In comparison to 81-year-old Biden and 78-year-old Trump, she’s practically a spring chicken. She is also — for all her gaffes and ‘word salads’ — a very successful woman. As Attorney General of California, she was a bold and tough prosecutor, unafraid to put people in jail. Donald Trump, as she will endlessly remind people, is a convicted felon. During her brief time in the Senate she made waves: famously asking one of Donald Trump’s candidates for the Supreme Court, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whether there were ‘any laws that give government the right to make decisions about the male body’ — a reference, of course, to abortion rights. The exchange went viral on social media. She has been an effective and constant campaigner for women’s rights and there is no doubt that many Americans feel very strongly about the issue. Many Democrats blame Donald Trump for appointing the Supreme Court Justices who repealed the Roe v Wade ruling in June 2022, ending the constitutional right to abortion. Recent history has shown that when abortion is on the ballot — as it has been in some state elections recently — the Democrats do well. It is, in other words, an issue that unites Democrats and divides Republicans. Kamala can energise the issue and fiercely take on those in Trump’s party who want to ban abortions completely. Her strong record on the subject will surely give her a confidence that she did not have in the past. There is something weird that happens when power gets close: you become a ‘serious person’ almost by default — and this could happen to her. Crucial to Kamala’s prospects could be her choice of running mate. Normally the VP doesn’t matter too much, but in such extraordinary circumstances, it might. A steady governor of a swing state that the Democrats need to win might help Harris to convince Americans that she means business. But there remains one thing in the way of her future success as a politician. She needs to take charge now. To strut her stuff on the world stage so that she can meet Trump as an equal. That means Joe Biden standing down, not just from the campaign, but from the presidency itself. Stubborn Joe, of course, is determined to stay in the Oval Office as long as he can. But there is a precedent for this that, eerily, might be relevant. President Boris Yeltsin of Russia shocked his nation at the beginning of this century when he announced his resignation as president just six months before the end of his term — and handed over power to his favoured successor, the then Prime Minister of Russia. His name was Vladimir Putin. It worked out well for him. I am making no direct comparison, of course, but it can help to get the feet under the desk early.

On Monday, Florida’s Democrats signaled their support. “The state of this race has changed,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried. “Our mission has not — beat Donald Trump — and Vice President Kamala Harris is the woman for the job.” The Florida Democrats said 236 of the state’s 254 delegates to the DNC would back Harris’ bid to take over President Joe Biden’s campaign, one day after he announced he would not seek reelection. [RESULTS 2024: Want to vote in Florida? Here’s how to register and make sure you are eligible] Democrats also announced that all eight Democratic members of the state’s Congressional delegation are also now pledging to support Harris as the new nominee. It’s a big headstart for Harris, as Florida has one of the largest DNC delegations. While Biden endorsed Harris as his replacement, the Democratic National Committee says it will have an “open, transparent, fair and orderly” plan for the nomination process that will allow the nearly 4,700 delegates to the convention to decide who to nominate. Samuel Vilchez Santiago, who chairs the Orange County Democrats Executive Committee, says nearly all of Orange County’s DNC delegates support Harris, and on Monday night he expects the county’s Dems will vote to endorse Harris as well. “President Biden made it clear yesterday, when he chose Vice President Harris for vice president four years ago, he thought she will be the standard bearer for the Democratic Party,” Santiago said. “And quite honestly, the 14 million people voted for President Biden in the primaries also voted understanding that Vice President Harris would be our vice president, and so she comes with a lot of legitimacy within our Democratic base.” So far, no other Democrats have publicly entertained the notion of challenging Harris for the nomination. Many of the Democratic leaders mentioned previously as a possible replacement for Biden have already endorsed Harris, including California Gov. Gavin Newsome, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. All of them have since been named contenders to be Harris’ running mate. Santiago also mentioned Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper as good options. “We’re looking to balance our ticket so that Americans can see that the Democratic Party is in line with the American voter and that we can take the election and create a clear contrast with the extremist Republican ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance,” Santiago said. Santiago also thinks a Harris nomination will change the election completely, even in Florida, which has been written off by many politicos as a “Red State” since the Democrats’ disastrous showing in the 2022 elections. Harris has already made several visits to the state to decry new abortion restrictions put in place by the Florida Legislature, and she will likely make many more trips if she gets the nomination. In the meantime, Santiago says local Democrats are going to continue doing what they’ve been doing since January — talking to voters about all of their candidates. So far, Santiago says the Orange County Dems have knocked on over 16,000 doors this year. “It is on us to make the case, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Santiago said. “We have phone banks set up every week. We have a door for canvassing events this Saturday, we have a canvassing event on Sunday. We’re taking over street corners on Friday, and so we’re energized, and we’re going to make the case to the people across Central Florida and to the people of the United States.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nORLANDO, Fla. – Vice President Kamala Harris has about a month to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;The ideal candidate: Florida Democratic representatives supporting Vice President Harris at the convention&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-ideal-candidate-florida-democratic-representatives-supporting-vice-president-harris-at-the-convention/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/mx9fSRVOmIOUVmhXK4nt4-m6Nlw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/XODELAO3JRDOZMH4X2IUEFGYYA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:22:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.09},{"id":252382244,"title":"San Diego Food + Wine Festival 2024: A Cross-Border Celebration Of Diversity","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The San Diego Food + Wine Festival, is celebrating 20 years this November 2nd-10th, 2024.

The first message labeled as from the “Harris for President” campaign hit inboxes early Monday, arriving shortly after midnight and containing a lengthy list of Democratic lawmakers that are publicly backing the Vice President’s nomination to the top of the party ticket following the Sunday afternoon announcement by President Joe Biden that he will not seek a second term. The message, delivered from the “joebiden.com” web domain used by the now-defunct Biden-Harris 2024 campaign, declared that “hundreds of elected officials from across the political spectrum followed President Biden’s lead and announced their full-throated support for Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee for president to defeat Donald Trump in November.” “As Vice President Harris said, she ‘will do everything in [her] power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,’” the Harris campaign wrote. Later, the campaign shared a long list of liberal leaning organizations which had also jumped on board, including the American Federation of Teachers, EMILY’s List, the SEIU, and the United Farm Workers. “Vice President Harris will have the organizing force of the entire backbone of the Democratic Party behind her as she campaigns to defeat Trump,” her campaign declared. Republicans, the newly-minted Harris campaign claims, are terrified of a Harris vs. Trump general election match-up. Harris, California’s former Attorney General, is used to dealing with felons like the former President, Harris for President Spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “Vice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career – and Donald Trump will be no different. Vice President Harris has dedicated her career to making life better for working people – while Trump only cares about himself. That’s the contrast the American people will see over the next 106 days,” Moussa said. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, who stopped short of endorsing Harris on Sunday, joined the chorus of voices coming out in full force behind the Vice President in a statement shared by her campaign the very next day. “The future of our country as we know it is on the line. That’s why I am thrilled to support Kamala Harris as she works to earn the Democratic nomination and beat Donald Trump,” Healey said. Healey’s endorsement came on top of declarations of support from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, all of whom were rumored to possess presidential aspirations of their own. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still a powerhouse in the party and part of the push for Biden to step aside, also endorsed Harris. Trump, meanwhile, was “watching the Fake News” on Monday and apparently seeing coverage which led him to declare Harris is “dumb as a rock” and “a totally failed and insignificant Vice President” that the Democratic Party is attempting to make “into a future ‘great’ President.” “No, it just doesn’t work that way,” he wrote on his Truth Social Media platform.","summary":"“Vice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career – and Donald Trump will be no different,” a Harris spokesperson said.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/22/vp-wastes-no-time-swings-at-trump-through-new-harris-for-president-campaign/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24204589420813.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:18:28","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.202},{"id":252382240,"title":"New poll finds overwhelming support for Kamala Harris among Democratic voters","text":"Almost 80 percent of Democratic voters are in favor of Kamala Harris taking over the party’s nomination from Joe Biden, a new poll has shown, following the president’s shock decision to bow out of the 2024 race for the White House. A survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of CBS News showed that just 21 percent were in favor of nominating someone else over the vice president. The announcement of Biden’s departure from the campaign trail seems to have invigorated Democratic voters, with 45 percent saying that the party’s chances against Donald Trump in November were now “better.” Some 10 percent said that the chances of a Democrat win were worse, 17 percent said they were unchanged and 28 percent said it “depends on who the nominee is.” However despite this 79 percent of those surveyed backed Harris as the candidate, according to the poll. Despite the tumult of his final weeks in office, which prompted senior figures within the Democratic party to call for him to drop out, Biden’s legacy among the public remained largely favorable, according to CBS. Some 43 percent said they would look back at the legacy as “excellent”, while 39 percent said it was “good”. 15 percent said that Biden’s time in office had been fair and only 3 percent considered the president’s legacy as “poor.” This CBS News/YouGov survey was based on a national sample of 1,071 registered voters who identify as Democrats, who were interviewed July 21-22, 2024. All respondents participated in earlier national surveys of registered voters fielded July 11-13 and July 16-18, 2024, according to CBS. The numbers echoed remarks made by senior party members including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama. In a statement issued on Monday, Pelosi said America had been blessed by the wisdom and leadership of President Joe Biden,” as she offered her official backing to Harris. The support from the Democrat higher-ups echoes that of the public, demonstrated by the funds raised by the newly rebranded Harris 2024 campaign – $84 million. The surge in new donations augments the $264 million war chest raised over the last quarter when Biden was still at the helm. According to the newly rebranded campaign, the $84 million sum “reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees,” and includes 888,000 grassroots donors, a full 60 percent of whom gave for the first time this cycle. The campaign also announced a new crop of 43,000 recurring donors who signed up after Biden passed the torch to Harris, as well as $1.6m raised by a Zoom call hosted by the group Win with Black Women. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said the “historic outpouring” of support for Harris “represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections.”","summary":"A survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of CBS News, showed that just 21 percent were in favor of nominating someone else over the vice president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-democrats-voter-support-poll-b2584111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/22/23/2162454611.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HIGYYHWI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:14:59","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":252382410,"title":"Can Democrats who abandoned Biden be trusted to back Harris?","text":"Now that Joe Biden has decided to drop out of the running, there is a huge, urgent push among liberals and Democrats to get on board the Kamala Harris train. While I have said from the beginning that if it’s not the president, it’s the vice president, I think it’s important to say that this was a serious mistake. I just hope it’s not a fatal one. It’s a serious mistake because the likelihood of Donald Trump winning this election has shot up by orders of magnitude. Yes, I know what Biden’s critics said. They said he was already on track to losing. But they didn’t really know that, nor did anyone when it comes to knowing the future. What we do know is history. An incumbent, even a very old incumbent who had a disaster debate, has advantages over his challenger, even a very old one who used to be the president. Biden, moreover, has an amazing record. Plus, the fundamentals are sound. No incumbent has lost with a national economy as sizzling as ours. Moreover, Biden’s critics didn’t have more than vibes to make their case. To be sure, they had polls, but there are many polls. You can find one to prove anything, including why Biden should have stayed. Up to the moment he dropped out, 538’s forecast said he had an even chance of winning – an even chance, despite weeks of merciless scrutiny. If there was internal campaign polling that showed damage hitherto unknown, we never saw it. The best we got, in terms of reasons why the president should drop out, came from a few dozen Democrats who said, more or less, trust us. That might have been convincing if it weren’t for the suspicion that they were covering their own asses. When you look back at this episode, please remember it wasn’t the Washington press and pundit corps that pushed him out. It was his own party. Even otherwise superlative leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went soft. They could have done what the Republicans do for their nominee – gotten behind him no matter what. Trump is a fraud, an insurrectionist, rapist and criminal, but I guess Joe Biden looking old for 90 minutes was beyond the pale. There’s now a huge, urgent push to get on the Harris train. But let’s not forget how little it took – vibes! – for some of these Democrats to abandon Biden. Can these same Democrats be trusted to stick with the vice president? This is important to ask, because the vice president, as they say, is about to go through some things. If you thought being geriatric was a liability for Biden, just wait until Donald Trump, the Republicans and the rightwing media apparatus take aim at the country’s first biracial female Democratic Party nominee (presuming that she is formally nominated next month). Indeed, she has polled well, but that’s almost certainly because Democratic voters were themselves searching for someone they believed could be an alternative to Biden. Now that her candidacy is no longer theoretical, we’re going to see how firm that support is – or if it can be weakened by appeals to bigotry. For her to win, it’s going to take every single elected Democrat to stand up for her, loud and proud. Will they? I hope so, but why should I presume it? I also think there’s no small amount of naivete going into the liberal and Democratic reaction to Biden dropping out. Some of us appear to believe all the media energy that went into scrutinizing Biden for each and every sign of enfeeblement will now go into scrutinizing the former president. After all, he’s 78 years old, habitually incoherent and there are lingering questions about his mental health after his attempted assassination. Some Democratic operatives have even started saying that, with Biden gone, Trump is now the oldest candidate ever. All that makes sense, but all that presumes something – that the media energy that went into scrutinizing Biden was fair. It wasn’t. If it had been fair, there would have been equal time given to Trump’s performance during the disaster debate. That didn’t happen. The press and pundit corps barely remembered he was there. Neither did the elected Democrats who abandoned the president. Trump was a firehose of lies. He practically said the election is legitimate only if he wins. His statements were bowls of word salad. But they only had eyes for Biden. Why would we think the same standard applies to Trump? I expect that, by the end of the week, it’s going to be clearer to liberals and Democrats that whatever problems we thought we had under Biden are going to be matched evenly, at the very least, by a new set of problems under Harris. And that set of problems will become quite familiar, as they were the same set of problems the party faced under Hillary Clinton – precisely, getting swing voters in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to vote for a woman, this time a biracial woman. Biden had a path through those states, even amid the crisis. Does Harris? I hope so, because if she loses one, she’s done.","summary":"Now that Joe Biden has decided to drop out of the running, there is a huge, urgent push among liberals and Democrats to get on board the Kamala Harris train.

While it might seem like a minor end-of-July tidying of the books, it does create some interesting questions for the rest of the summer. By releasing two players, Toronto has opened up a roster spot, an additional training camp spot, and some tangible wiggle room under the luxury tax apron to make more additions. So, what next? Freeman-Liberty and Vezenkov Futures SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 31: Sasha Vezenkov #7 of the Sacramento Kings looks on in the third ... [+] quarter against the Utah Jazz at Golden 1 Center on March 31, 2024 in Sacramento, California.. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images) Getty Images Freeman-Liberty had a minimal guarantee of $100K on the books for next season, which would have turned to $150K tomorrow and $800K if he made the opening-day roster. He put up numbers in the Summer League with the Raptors last week and averaged 24 points per game in the G-League for the 905 last season. He’ll have multiple suitors for a 2-way spot around the league and has consistently been one of the better developmental players on the circuits the previous two seasons. With the Raptors drafting Ja’Kobe Walter and Jamal Shead, trading for Davion Mitchell, and currently slotting in DJ Carton as a 2-way player, they are jammed up at the guard spot. Freeman-Liberty likely can get a better opportunity elsewhere. Vezenkov’s situation was much more tricky. There had been reports that the former Euro League MVP was interested in returning to Europe after his one and only NBA season with the Sacramento Kings. Once the Raptors acquired him, it cleared the way for an eventual buyout agreement for which Vezenkov, reportedly, relinquished the final year of his deal at just over $6.6M.

Not only does Vezenkov open up a roster spot, but his cap hit is removed from the books, giving the Raptors about $11M of space under the luxury tax. How do they use it?

It would be less than the mid-level exception, but they could still make a swing for Tyus Jones to bolster their guard rotation. Maybe they’re interested in a reunion with Precious Achiuwa? Does either Luke Kennard or Robert Covington intrigue them? Is there enough room to swing for Cavaliers wing Isaac Okoro? Unlikely, but he is a restricted free agent, and it might be worth a shot. Otherwise, the pool of players is pretty underwhelming. And given the Raptors' long-term approach this summer (picking up Bruce Brown’s option and letting Gary Trent Jr. walk), it seems like they may prefer flexibility rather than adding talent right now, especially with the amount of hype around the 2025 NBA Draft.

(Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) Getty Images Congratulations to Christian Koloko for being medically cleared by his doctors to continue playing basketball. A few weeks ago, news broke that Koloko had returned to basketball after dealing with blood clot issues that forced the Raptors to waive him midway through the 2023-2024 season. Now, it’s up to the NBA to medically clear him to return. For example, Bronny James had to be cleared before the 2024 NBA Draft and was assessed by a panel of three doctors who drew up a fitness-to-play plan. Koloko would likely have to go through something similar, and the time it takes can depend. That being said, the Cameroonian big man out of Arizona showed flashes in his rookie season. Not only would he address a need at the backup center spot, but it would also be an incredible story about the resilience required to fight for your dream. One thing to keep in mind is that Koloko can be signed in any way now. So he could receive a camp deal, a two-way contract, or even a fully guaranteed spot. But it’s unlikely they do the latter because... Training Camp Battle TORONTO, CANADA - MARCH 3: D.J. Carton #3 of the Toronto Raptors dribbles against the against the ...

By waiving Freeman-Liberty and Vezenkob, Toronto can add two more development pieces into the fold to battle for the final spot. Maybe another rookie intrigued them during Summer League, similar to Freeman-Liberty last summer, who worked his way into a two-way deal with the Raptors. Regardless, it provides them with an extra cushion of flexibility. And that’ll be important as they head into a season where they’ll likely be looking to move on from Bruce Brown’s $23M expiring contract.

Now they have an extra roster spot to do the same in any potential Bruce Brown trade. Technically, the Raptors have the room to take on over $30M in contracts for Brown so that a 2-for-1 deal could kill two birds with one stone (for lack of better terms). Either way, the name of the game is flexibility for Toronto. And they just bought themselves some for the rest of the off-season. Follow me on LinkedIn.

That plan came to fruition on Sunday, when the 81-year-old president dramatically announced the end of his campaign before endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. However, a source close to Biden’s family is saying that the party put together a ‘palace coup’ over the course of recent weeks, with the president fighting it until he was threatened with being forced out. The insider says that the disastrous debate against Donald Trump on June 27 – the earliest presidential debate in history – was part of the strategy, despite being publicly requested by Biden on social media. ‘That debate was a set-up to convince Democrats that he couldn’t run for president,’ the source told the New York Post. Biden was often seen on split screen with his mouth agape and a blank stare during the showdown against Trump last month, immediately sending Democrats into a freak out. Though publicly, most of the faces of the left stayed behind Biden, in the shadows, party powerbrokers were threatening to invoke the 25th amendment. Section 4 of the amendment allows for removal of a president who is deemed incapacitated by any kind of illness, injury, or mental impairment. One of the few trusted by Biden who believed he was being pushed out: troubled son Hunter, who became a gatekeeper for his father after the debate. ‘Hunter felt he was being set up and he was very concerned about his father. These people, these officials were not on Joe’s side,’ the source claimed. They also said that it might not be a straight shot to the nomination for Harris, despite Biden’s endorsement. The source claimed that Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona may be a popular pick of delegates, though the former astronaut has already endorsed Harris. Once Biden was finally, officially convinced to get out, everything moved at the speed of light. He was isolating with COVID at his $3.4 million holiday home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when his shrinking inner circle handed him polling data showing he could no longer beat Donald Trump. That was when they composed a letter saying it was time for him to step aside for the good of the future of the Democratic party. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chances of beating Donald Trump were dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Biden had previously insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump, or if he developed a ‘medical condition’. In the end, it was the first of those developments that sealed his fate. Biden went to bed on Saturday night at the beach house, knowing he would announce his bombshell the next day. At 1:45 pm on Sunday he began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. By that time he had already told Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign – were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president’s missive. It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren’t surprised by it. Harris then announced she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democrat Party plot to get Joe Biden to drop out has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How Democrats tried to damage Biden&#8217;s campaign and the shocking ultimatum they gave him to quit the race first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-democrats-tried-to-damage-bidens-campaign-and-the-shocking-ultimatum-they-gave-him-to-quit-the-race/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-REVEALED-The-cunning-ploy-devious-Democrats-used.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:07:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":252381748,"title":"Gov. Walz, other top Minnesota Democrats, line up to support Kamala Harris for president","text":"Minnesota Democrats are coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as their favored presidential nominee after President Joe Biden announced Sunday he would not seek reelection. Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, along with most Democratic members of Minnesota’s Congressional delegation and state party leadership, joined a swell of Democrats from across the U.S. backing Harris in the 24 hours following Biden’s announcement. “I’ve known Vice President Kamala Harris for years and I’ve seen her strengthen national security, protect reproductive rights, and pass historic legislation,” Walz said on X, formerly Twitter, Monday morning. “As a prosecutor running against a convicted felon, no one is better qualified to unite our party and take on Donald Trump.” Reps. Betty McCollum, Angie Craig and Ilhan Omar, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith all say they back Harris. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin issued a statement in support of Harris on Sunday. “President Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race was difficult, but it was the right decision at the right time,” McCollum said in a Sunday statement, just two days after she had called on the president to end his campaign. “Now Democrats must unite behind Vice President Kamala Harris as our party’s nominee for President and focus on the work ahead — defeating Trump and winning in November.” The 81-year-old Biden faced heavy pressure from high-profile Democrats to step down as concerns grew about his age following a poor performance in a June debate with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. By late last week, more than 30 Democratic members of Congress, including Minnesota’s Craig and McCollum, had called on Biden to suspend his campaign. Rep. Dean Phillips, who in March ended the only serious challenge to Biden’s place on the Democratic ticket, said he believed Harris was a qualified replacement. In a social media post Sunday, however, Phillips called for a “brief, transparent, competitive” process for choosing the party’s nominee. “Invite @KamalaHarris and the top three other vote getters to a series of four, televised town halls w/audiences of delegates before voting at the convention,” Phillips said on X. While the Democratic party is rallying around Harris, the party won’t officially select its nominee for president until next month’s national convention in Chicago. Other Democrats seen as legitimate contenders for the presidency, such as Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California, also have backed Harris, limiting the number of potential challengers with a higher national political profile. Veep Walz? Minnesota’s governor has been raising his own national profile as a surrogate for Biden on cable news programs, raising speculation about his ambitions beyond Minnesota. Walz, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, attended a meeting at the White House earlier this month after Biden’s poor debate performance led to calls for the president to suspend his campaign and allow another Democrat to step forward. At the time, Walz said he believed Biden was “fit for office.” He never directly called for Biden to end his campaign. In a Monday interview with Minnesota Public Radio, Walz said he had spoken with Harris over the weekend and wouldn’t necessarily rule out being her running mate. McCollum, as she called for Biden on Friday to step aside and allow Harris to be the presidential nominee, suggested delegates to the Democratic National Convention back Walz as Harris’ running mate. Walz has built up his national profile with his leadership positions and media appearances, but political observers see more upside in Harris choosing a running mate from a swing state. Minnesota has favored the Democrat in the last 12 presidential elections, so a Harris-led ticket likely wouldn’t need a vice-presidential bump in the state to win the presidency.","summary":"Most Democratic members of Minnesota’s Congressional delegation, state party leadership, Gov.

In the 24 hours that followed the sudden and shocking announcement by President Joe Biden that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency to make way for his vice president, the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign had morphed into the Harris for President campaign and raised more than $81 million. According to Harris for President Spokesperson Kevin Munoz, donations from over 888,000 “grassroots donors” represent a shift in the Democratic party’s sentiments about the looming general election. “The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections. Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election,” Munoz said in a statement. Most of the donors over the last day were making their first donation of the election, according to the campaign, and the $81 million figure is the “highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history.” “This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. This surge of support is also accompanied by numerous endorsements from federal and state elected officials as well as major Democratic and advocacy groups united in the effort to defeat Donald Trump this November,” the campaign wrote. A single Zoom call Sunday evening held by the group Win With Black Women — a meeting that was scheduled to be attended by 1,000 but was eventually joined by over 40,000 — raised more than $1.6 million, the campaign said. “There is a groundswell behind Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his divisive, unpopular agenda can’t stand up to the Vice President’s record and vision for the American people,” Munoz said. That’s on top of the $95 million Harris has available from Biden’s war chest. In a letter sent to the Federal Elections Commission on Sunday, Harris for President Treasurer Keana Spencer proclaimed “that Vice President Harris is no longer a candidate in the 2024 election for Vice President.” “Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office,” she wrote.","summary":"In the 24 hours that followed the sudden and shocking announcement by President Joe Biden that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency to make way for his Vice President’s ascendency, the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign had morphed into the Harris for President campaign and raised more than $81 million.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-breaks-fundraising-record-pulls-in-81-million-in-a-single-day/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24204727881803.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:03:17","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.064},{"id":252381858,"title":"RFK Jr. Talked to Trump About a Job in His Administration: Report","text":"Earlier this month, independent presidential hopeful and notorious vaccine skeptic Robert F.

They are running around like a chicken with its head cut off. By the way, who is making the decisions? Rep. Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, etc.? Who is the “president” of the Democratic Party? Nobody seems to know what to do. Should it be Vice President Kamala Harris? Who else?

Brian Keane Patchogue I can’t understand how all of these highly educated individuals were trying to convince the masses our president was sharp as a tack over the past year. Do they all think American citizens are so dumb they can’t see the truth? Biden didn’t deserve to be hoodwinked into believing he could still run the country. All those around him — staff, politicians, family, the media — should be ashamed of their behavior. Unlike former President Lyndon Johnson, who recognized reality, they all preached a false narrative, allowing our country and our president to be a laughingstock, just so they can maintain power. This is not democracy; it’s voodoo politics. D. Ricciardi Brooklyn ﻿It’s tempting to call Biden the ultimate “cheap fake.” However, he was a very “expensive fake” for cities dealing with illegal immigrants, taxpayers funding war, not peace, in Ukraine and those who are stuck paying for student debt because he shifted the burden to non-students. David Bryant Easton, Conn. Biden, upon his decision to exit the 2024 race said in his letter: “I believe it is in the best interest of the party and the country for me to stand down.” Notice he put party first, country second — as has always been the case with the Democratic Party. Thoughtful leadership would have had him state that it was in the best interest of the country alone. Then again, Biden has never been right on any issue at any time, and for the Dems, it’s about winning and power alone. Tom DeFazio Spring Lake Heights, NJ On the afternoon of June 27, Democrats were fully united in supporting Biden. By the end of the night, they were not. After much hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing, the president has stepped aside. Democrats now find themselves without a candidate and no playbook on how to get one. While this is totally their own doing, it does not erase the fact that they need to decide on a candidate prior to the convention. An open convention would be a disaster, and having it in Chicago is not a good omen. Peter Kelly Hazlet, NJ Biden’s bugout is the most egregious bait-and-switch to have occurred in our history.

While Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, along with TikTok, boast far more users, X users say keeping up with the news is not the reason they use those platforms, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. X is the exception: most of the site’s users say following the news is a reason they use it and about half say they regularly get their news from there. “X is where history happens,” posted X CEO Linda Yaccarino on Sunday with a screenshot of Biden’s announcement. While a comment pointed out that the same message was posted on other social media platforms as well, the narrative remains an important one for X and its long-touted efforts to become a “digital town square.” “Other platforms have emerged with the goal of supplanting X, but what events like the Biden post shows is that this is still where people go to make both fast and consequential impact,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute. That’s even though the site has become a less reliable place to find accurate information, due in large part to changes Musk made since assuming the helm. Since the 2022 takeover, Musk has upended many of the former Twitter’s policies including around misinformation and hate speech, gutted its staff and transformed what people see on the site. “It does not appear as though would-be competitors have been able to displace Twitter from its perch as the go-to place for political news,” Kreps said. “In an ideal world, a lot of people would have and did try to go elsewhere but these alternatives needed to offer products that people want and use and they have not done that. Until that time, we’ll probably see a segment of users for whom their principles and practices are at odds.” As its owner and arguably most influential user, Musk has also used X to try to sway political discourse around the world — getting in a dustup with a Brazilian judge over censorship, railing against what he calls the “woke mind virus” and amplifying false claims that Democrats are secretly flying in migrants to vote in U.S. elections. Long before he endorsed Trump, Musk turned increasingly toward the right in his posts and actions on the platform. He’s reinstated previously banned accounts such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and former U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as accounts belonging to neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Advertisers who halted spending on X in response to antisemitic and other hateful material were engaging in “blackmail,” Musk has alleged. And it was on X that he announced he was moving the company’s headquarters, as well as those of SpaceX, to the red state of Texas from deep blue California. “The important thing about Twitter has long been the community of users who’ve embraced it. And there is a proliferation of journalists and elected officials and thought leaders who still use it today,” said Mark Jablonowski, chief technology officer at DSPolitical, a digital advertising firm that works for Democratic campaigns. “And it is an effective way of rapidly getting a message out to a large and influential group of people. However, that group is clearly waning. You are seeing users of the platform jumping ship, left and right. And as you are seeing the content become more and more extreme and unsuitable for general consumption.” Biden’s message Sunday was posted on X two minutes before it went up on Meta platforms such as Facebook and Threads. It’s not clear if this was intentional, and the campaign did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday. “It might have been just, you know, who hit enter first on the keyboard internally,” Jablonowski said. “But I think you definitely are seeing a world where five years ago, this might have been exclusively on Twitter, and now you’re seeing it across many different properties.” Political campaigns, he noted, need to meet voters where the voters are — and for many, that is still X. “Democrats still do appearances on Fox News,” he said.

For starters, Harris is expected to focus heavily on protecting abortion access, an issue she has been fluent at using against Donald Trump and the Republican Party. “She will attack them repeatedly and mercilessly on reproductive rights,” said Drew Altman, the president and CEO of KFF, a nonpartisan research group. “I think it’s been a winning card for her so far, and I would expect to see her dial that up tremendously.” Andy Slavitt, a top health care official in the Barack Obama and joe Biden administrations who has informally advised Harris, said she has an advantage on abortion, an issue that resonates with voters. “It’s awkward for President Biden to talk about it,” Slavitt said. “But I think she knows how to talk about it in ways that people relate to.” As vice president, Harris's goal has been to advance and promote Biden’s agenda. But if she secures the Democratic presidential nomination — as she's currently favored to — Harris would be free to cast her own vision to remake the health care system. And her record and 2020 presidential campaign provide some clues about how she would govern. Her campaign didn't respond to a request for comment as the Harris campaign is in its early stages. But her record and 2020 presidential campaign provide some clues about how she would govern. “We can expect her to try to build on the Biden legacy of expanding coverage,” Sabrina Corlette, a health policy expert and professor at Georgetown University. “And she’s going to have to do something to bring down costs.” Corlette predicted Harris would look to protect the Affordable Care Act and extend the enhanced subsidies designed to lower costs, which are currently set to expire at the end of 2025. She’d also likely work with Congress to try and extend Medicaid coverage in the 10 states that haven’t expanded it under the Affordable Care Act. And she could carry on Biden’s attempts to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing benefits for seniors. It’s still early for even close allies to know how Harris will seek to balance embracing Biden’s approach with carving out her own. “I have no idea,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a powerful figure within the party, though he added that the Obama-Biden health care legacy would in good hands with her. “She’s a part of it,” Clyburn said. Beyond that, Harris showed more liberal instincts on health care in her 2020 campaign than Biden did, which could be a factor. “She may be more willing to take on some of the sacred cows in health care than the Biden administration was,” Corlette said. “She obviously signed onto Medicare for All. She also supported public option proposals in the Senate. You could see more backing of a government-supported plan option for people, which could have the power to bring down the costs of insurance.” Harris signed onto the Medicare For All Act of 2019, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a few months into her presidential bid. The bill sought to expand Medicare to cover all Americans and effectively end private insurance. It divided the Democratic Party — progressives embraced it, but moderates, including Biden, feared it went too far by effectively eliminating private coverage. The issue tripped up Harris when she was quizzed on the bill's impact on the private insurance most Americans have. She later offered her own health care bill that leaned on Medicare Advantage to preserve a role for private coverage. At the time, the episode raised questions among Democratic elites and voters about where she stood ideologically. Harris ended her campaign later that year and by the time Biden chose her to be vice president, she embraced his proposals. “I don’t think she’s a disrupter. I don’t think she’s going to be pushing for some big, radical change,” Slavitt said. “People will talk about how she signed on to Bernie’s bill. A lot of people signed on to Bernie’s bill for a variety of reasons. Some, to state the ideal is universal coverage. … Some because they believe in it literally. ... I read her as more pragmatic.” Altman added that in this campaign, Democrats are highly unlikely to revive Medicare for All “because of their fear of Trump.” Republicans are combing through Harris’ past statements on health care and looking for material to use against her. A GOP strategist noted that in a June 2019 debate, Harris was among 10 Democratic candidates who raised their hand when asked if the U.S. should insure undocumented immigrants. Harris didn’t discuss it, but others on stage argued that it was humane and fiscally wise to ensure broad coverage so people are less reliant on expensive emergency care when they get sick. On the campaign trail, Altman expects that Harris will continue to promote existing initiatives from the Biden administration, particularly the ongoing rollout of the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the provisions is a $35 per month cap on the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023. Starting next year, the law will also impose a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on prescription drugs for people on Medicare. It also allows the federal government — for the first time — to negotiate prices for drugs that Medicare spends the most money on, a long sought-after goal by Democrats and some Republicans. The government is currently negotiating with drugmakers on the 10 costliest drugs under Medicare, which include popular heart medications and diabetes drugs. The new prices are expected to be published by September and go into effect in 2026. A KFF poll published in May found that more independent voters trusted Biden over Trump when it came to many areas of health care, including health care costs. Harris will be seeking to carry that years-long Democratic advantage. Altman said he expects Harris to lean into protecting Medicare and Medicaid, while highlighting GOP proposals that would partially privatize or cut those health care programs for elderly and lower-income Americans, respectively, a tactic Democrats have used against Republicans for years. Those GOP proposals include some recommendations in \"Project 2025,\" a sweeping collection of right-wing ideas to transform the U.S. government. Though it was written by former Trump officials in anticipation of a second term, Trump has said he knows “nothing” about it. “I also suspect she will be the first to bring Medicaid into the picture,” he said, “arguing that the various Republican groups from [Project] 2025 to the Republican Study Committee are proposing to eviscerate the Medicaid program by capping and cutting it.\"","summary":"A Kamala Harris presidency could have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. health care system, from abortion rights to insurance coverage to drug pricing.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-presidency-mean-us-health-care-abortion-rcna163124","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-Kamala-Harris-Healthcare-aa-601p-faff2c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:54:57","author":"Sahil Kapur","authors":["Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":252381318,"title":"New York Through The Eyes Of A Star From Broadway’s “Oh Mary”","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin \"Oh Mary\" star Tony Macht Stan Demidoff “Oh Mary” is the Broadway show hit of the summer and plays to sold out audiences at the Lyceum Theater who laugh throughout the hilarious and raucous performance.

Where do you live in New York? I live in Washington Heights in Manhattan. I’m very close to Fort Tryon Park which is my absolute favorite park in the entire city. It is home to The Cloisters, which if you don’t know, is a museum that John D Rockefeller literally imported stone by stone from Europe, it’s pretty wild. What is your favorite neighborhood in the city and why? I actually have a weird soft spot for Midtown. I went to college at Fordham Lincoln Center, so I have sort of incongruous memories of partying and having probably too much fun in Midtown, which isn’t really what Midtown is for. I also am actively trying to enjoy the craziness of the Theater District, and go with the throngs of people and not try and fight it. Can you share some of your favorite spots in a Theater District and what makes them so great? It’s no hidden gem, but Bryant Park has some of the best people watching in the city. You get confused tourists, super stressed out business people, people on first dates. If the weather is nice, on two-show-days in between shows I’ll be there with a sandwich just trying to find something funny happening.

They know that “best practices” are mostly irrelevant to the blood sport of “business.” They know that meritocracies are mostly fictional and most employees really don’t like their job, their boss or their companies, and while politicians rant about fake news, companies “lie” all the time about their products, services and numbers, as they easily absorb the tiny fines they receive for misbehaving. Incredibly, research suggests that employees believe that more than 75% of all bosses are “toxic”! In order to succeed, you have to shed most of what you believe about how business actually works, what your company wants you to believe about loyalty, and traditional career strategies you may have consciously or unconsciously adopted to succeed. What else? Most of what you believe about the relationship between performance and compensation is wrong, and the career momentum you probably feel is fake. Instead, success is about reinvention and career pivots, not long, slow straight lines. You will die-in-place if you follow paths defined by HR, executive coaches, self-help books, organizational hierarchies, traditional mentors or career planners. No, this is about rethinking the way business actually works and how this affects your career. Thinking the right ways about business is essential. Let’s look at just three. Consultants How many times have you been disappointed by your organizational and strategic consultants? Even the consultants know their services are less than impactful – but love the second homes their fees buy. How embarrassing – and risky – is outsourcing the “brains” of your company! Why is a stranger’s insights better than yours? You presumably have a talented team that solves lots of problems. (If you don’t, you have a larger problem that no one can solve.) But way too often someone decides that solutions need something more than the ones your team develops, and, well, you know, the ones that just won’t “sell” the way outside ones – with the right imprimatur – sell, which is why I guess God made McKinsey, BCG, Bain, EY-Parthenon, Kearney and Strategy& (among others). Lots of companies have been on the wrong side of outside organizational and strategic advice – and paid dearly. Not to mention the scandals that have plagued these consultancies over the years. But we still hire them looking past the scandals in favor of cache. So long as the scandal-versus-cache ratios stay favorable, I guess we’re good. There’s also the cost. Consultants cost a small fortune to engage. They’re also often engaged because they provide air cover to internal decision-makers: they’re blamable when the advice craters. Let’s not forget that companies spend over $1T a year on management consulting. Is all this advice really necessary? MORE FOR YOU Here’s How Kamala Harris Performs In Polls Against Trump—As Biden Drops Out And Endorses Harris ‘Are You Ready?’—Elon Musk Fans Wild Rumors Donald Trump Will Create A U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve And Trigger Crypto Price Chaos Eminem Stops Taylor Swift From Making History Consulting About Consulting The first step is to define “brains” versus “brawn” in detail, and make sure the brains stay home. Do you really want to pay someone tons of money to tell you how to think? Make sure you own as much of the substance as you can. Exploit strategic consultancies for what they bring to the table – optics and some brawn – but never completely default to their domain expertise, especially when they tell you what you already know. Internal consultants – your brains – should be supplemented by outside brawn, which is the best use of other kinds of consultants. The strengths of internal consultants revolve around knowledge of company processes, products and services. What’s the relative benefit of the knowledge of a company’s processes, products and services compared with distant objectivity? Do external consultants have a lock on objectivity and specialty knowledge? (No.) Should employees contribute more – or less – to a company’s strategy? (More.) And what about digital transformation, which is perhaps the most important ongoing work a company can launch? Who should run this? Can we really say that external consultants know more about the strategy, tactics and operations of their clients than the clients themselves? External consultants will reflexively say “yes, of course we do!” But they don’t. They never did. Redraw the line. Use cost as the chalk. Sell internal credibility. Fire the consultants. AI As I’ve often argued, AI is coming for you, your company and your industry. Machine learning and generative AI will obliterate knowledge workers and there will be lots of happy people when it happens. If you don’t admit that your career, company and industry are all at major risk, you will somehow, incredibly be surprised when your job is outsourced to a custom GPT. So dig deep into the biggest career threat in a generation. If you live in a company where “AI” is just an assistant, you’re already losing the game. AI is destined to become a full partner and in many areas your boss. AI for Fun & Profit You should understand how AI works and its potential to reimagine whole industries. Unless you’re close to retirement, you have no choice. You better understand what large language models (LLMs) are, how GPTs work, how to prompt and how to leverage the most powerful technology in a generation. If you understand more than most at your company – and trust me, that’s not hard to do – you can monetize that knowledge into an AI leadership position that will significantly increase your compensation. The problem is that even though you’re now an AI guru, your company may discount your contributions because you’re already there. Perhaps the best way to monetize AI knowledge and experience is to leave your company for a ton more money than they’re paying you now. Go to a competitor all dressed up as your company’s AI guru. They will welcome you with open arms and lots more compensation than you’ll get at home. Cybersecurity I’ve asked this before. Remember SolarWinds? All you probably remember – now that I jogged your memory – is that it’s linked to some kind of cyberattack, but you can’t explain exactly what happened, what was hacked or what happened after the attack. It was only a couple of years ago, right? Or was it more recent? Maybe longer? Do you know what actually happened? Were the Russians involved? What did they do? Was Microsoft involved? What did they do? Do you know if the US government still uses SolarWinds software? All everyone talks about is how the number of cyberattacks is increasing and that companies need to spend more and more money on cybersecurity. Yes, the number and severity of cyberattacks is increasing – nothing new here – but is more money the answer? Look what happens when a company is breached. While the company’s reputation suffers somewhat – because breaches are so commonplace – impact to their reputation is minimal and short-lived. The auditors then arrive to inspect everything and declare that the company did its best (or not) to prevent the breach. Sometimes there’s a fine, even a large one, but often there’s not, but the fines are generally a tiny percentage of annual revenue – and then the insurance company writes a check. Cybersecurity Passes If you know that your company will likely have to pay a fine of less than 1% of your revenue for a major breach, and that your customers will return and the price of your stock will recover, how much should you really care? If you also know no matter how much you spend you’re still vulnerable to attack, how much should you spend? Is just the right amount of underspending an acknowledgement that this is an unsolvable problem with manageable consequences? Of course it is! If you do what you must to satisfy the auditors, the Board, the executive team and the insurance company, but swim upstream when everyone calls for massive new spending, you should convince the team – with data – that enough is enough. This knowledge can save your company a ton of money and make everyone less nervous about breaches. You should quantify the savings – and brand yourself a cost management guru. Let PR worry about the messaging for a week or two. There’s More There’s a ton of misinformation and disinformation out there about business processes, models and strategies. Some of the areas we believe we understand, we really don’t. Some examples? Here are eleven more: Teams don’t work, but individual contributors with money do The calculous of compensation: where more is easy Leaders are often incompetent, dishonest and mean – so queue up Digital transformation always fails, so fake it like everyone else Your people are expendable, so why are they’re still here?

Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, who is best known for his work Hillbilly Elegy, has always been candid about his roller-coaster upbringing in the heart of Appalachian America. Vance’s story is a poignant reflection of the struggles many families face in similar socio-economic backgrounds. One of the most troubling episodes from his childhood had him almost being placed into foster care at the age of 12. As per NPR, things took a turn for the worse during a trip he had taken with his mother, Beverly Vance. He recalled, “So what happened is my mom, who was, in a lot of ways, this really wonderful person who tried very hard but also carried around the demons of her youth a little too much — had come over to my grandma's house where I was staying. She had apologized for something she had done earlier. And she had offered to take me on this trip to go and do some fun things.\" The author continued, \"And it was supposed to be a big makeup trip. But what happened is that something ignited her temper while we were together. She sped up the car on the highway... she was driving over 100 mph. And she just kept on saying, 'I'm going to crash this car and kill us both.'” As per Forbes, this incident led to Beverly's arrest for domestic violence and brought child welfare authorities into their lives. J.D. further detailed, “I...hopped in the backseat to hide from her. And this got her really angry. And she stopped the car and pulled over...was going to start hitting me. And so I ran. I ran out of the car. We were in a pretty rural part of the state. And I ran through a field to a person's house. And eventually, this set in chain a set of events where Mom was arrested. She was charged with domestic violence and I was made to sit in a police car until my grandparents and my sister came to rescue me... As soon as she was charged with domestic violence, it became a case of child abuse and neglect.” Faced with the potential of being removed from his home and placed into foster care, JD ultimately chose to lie to the authorities. He disclosed, “I was effectively given a choice between— keep talking, and we're going to have to file charges...we're going to have to take you out of the home...Or if you just keep quiet about things, then you can stay living with your family. And that was, of course, a pretty hard decision for a 12-year-old. But luckily, I had enough faith in my grandma. I knew that she wouldn't let anything too bad happen to me. And so I lied to the people who asked whether something bad had happened. I remember my mom had a domestic violence hearing. And the judge asked whether she had done anything to threaten me. And I lied. I told him no.” CHILD ABUSE: If you know of any children who are being subjected to abuse, please contact The Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at (800) 422-4453.","summary":"Faced with the potential of being removed from his home and placed into foster care, Vance chose to lie to the authorities to stay with his family.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/the-tragic-reason-why-jd-vance-was-almost-put-into-foster-care-when-he-was-12-i-lied","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706557/uploads/d344ceb0-4820-11ef-8e6c-379a17d0f57a_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:46:01","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":252381366,"title":"Cash Reserves, Donations for RFK Jr. Campaign Drop in June: Filings","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to face declining cash reserves, according to new federal filings. On July 20, two committees associated with the Kennedy campaign filed monthly disclosure statements with the Federal Election Commission covering their June activities. Those documents showed the campaign and its allied super political action committee collectively held about $21.6 million entering July. However, the groups also hold about $3.9 million in debt. Mr. Kennedy’s principal campaign committee, Team Kennedy, brought in about $5.4 million but spent $6.3 million in June. The committee ended the month with about $5.6 million in cash. Moreover, the committee told the FEC it owes about $3.1 million in debts and obligations. American Values, a hybrid PAC boosting Mr. Kennedy, raised about $228,000 in June. During the same month, it disbursed about $3.5 million. However, it entered July with about $16 million in cash on hand, balanced by about $800,000 in debts. The PAC collected only five contributions in June. The largest, $100,000, came from Abby Rockefeller, a member of the wealthy Rockefeller family. According to its disclosure, Team Kennedy ended June owing about $3.1 million to the private security firm Gavin de Becker and Associates LP. The private security firm is run by Gavin de Becker, a key supporter of American Values 2024, the hybrid PAC supporting Mr. Kennedy’s run. According to federal records, Mr. de Becker has donated close to $14 million to American Values since April 2023. According to FEC records, American Values sent Mr. de Becker a $2 million refund on June 28 in its largest transaction of the month. Going forward, the Kennedy campaign should see a drop in its security spending. On July 15, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said Mr. Kennedy would receive U.S. Secret Service protection as a major presidential candidate. Mr. Kennedy, who’s said he’s already had attempts on his person since announcing his independent run, had long complained about a lack of Secret Service protection. His uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963, and his father, former U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968 as he was making a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Campaign security, in general, became a much larger issue on July 13 after 20-year-old Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The gunman took multiple shots at the leading Republican presidential candidate, wounding him and two rallygoers. Former fire chief Corey Comperatore was killed while protecting his wife and daughter. American Values owed most of its debts to the social media giant X Corp. It listed about $763,000 in debt to the company that operates the platform formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Kennedy did not receive an invitation to the June 27 debate between President Joe Biden and former President Trump. Instead, he hosted his own livestream event on X with former television news anchor and reporter John Stossel. Combined, American Values and Team Kennedy spent about $124,000 on advertising and other services on X in June. American Values also made about $763,000 in independent expenditures supporting Mr. Kennedy on the social media site.

Harris picked up the baton where Biden dropped it off, heavily going after former President Trump.

Voters have told ABC News that this election feels like it's more of a vote against Trump than for Biden. Harris told staffers it's more than \"us versus Trump.\" \"This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump,\" she said. \"Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of the country... one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.\" Staffers were told Sunday night that they would keep their jobs, and on Monday, it was announced that former campaign co-chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon would stay on to run the campaign.

Reverend Bernice King, daughter of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and chief executive officer of The King Center, said that while she had been voting since she was 18, she had never endorsed a candidate publicly, until now. “I’m 100% in her corner, I’m going to be very strategic in the way that I move forward,” King said on the call. Win With Black Women, a political advocacy group that organized the call, later said it raised $1.5 million in three hours for Harris’ election campaign, joining a rush of other donations as Democrats raised more than $50 million online Sunday after President Joe Biden said he wouldn’t run for reelection. Biden’s decision to step aside and endorse Harris could pose a threat to the Trump campaign. Polls had shown Black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Biden during the 2020 election, had been moving away from the Democratic party following concerns about inflation, slow progress on civil-rights issues and the president’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Trump, meanwhile, had sought to make gains with Black voters. Others on the call included former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, Washington, DC mayor Muriel Bowser and Maryland’s First Lady Dawn Moore. Maryland governor Wes Moore later issued a statement supporting Harris’ candidacy. The huge attendance for the call meant that organizers had to ask Zoom Video Communications Inc. to extend the capacity limit for the meeting, which the video conferencing company was able to do for the customer. Representative Beatty, a Democrat representing Ohio in Congress, urged attendees to use their platforms to rally support for Harris in their communities. “We come with a strong message because we’re in the fight, we’re on this journey, we realize the magnitude of this moment,” she said.

The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work, but a draft of the plan they are set to approve was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday. The proposal does not list a date for when the virtual roll call begins, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by Aug. 7. “We can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,” Harrison on a conference call with reporters. The party says the virtual roll call will potentially feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates. The Democratic National Convention opens in-person on Aug. 19 in Chicago. State delegations to the gathering began pledging their near-unanimous support for Harris in the hours after Biden announced he was abandoning his reelection bid on Sunday. Biden endorsed Harris shortly after announcing he was abandoning his campaign. That doesn’t formally make her the party’s nominee, but the vice president spent hours Sunday calling 100-plus party leaders, members of Congress, labor leaders and leaders of advocacy and civil rights organizations to say she’d earn the nomination in her own right and to ensure they would support her. Harris has since been endorsed by hundreds of Democratic lawmakers, leading governors and some of the country’s most powerful unions, as well as the delegations to the convention from Florida and North and South Carolina. Biden’s departure from the race and endorsement of Harris ended weeks of questions about whether he was up to the rigors of a campaign and a second term in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican Donald Trump late last month. Democrats first announced in May that they were resorting to a virtual roll call in order to make a deadline in Ohio and ensure that Biden’s name appeared on the ballot in that state. Ohio lawmakers have since nullified the previous deadline, but the DNC said that, because the change doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1, the party still had to settle its nominee prior to the original deadline or risk legal challenges. In 2020, the in-person Democratic convention was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, and states used a virtual process to formally nominate Biden. When they gather in Chicago next month, Democrats will still hold a state-by-state roll call that is a fixture of nominating conventions, although it would largely be ceremonial. « Previous","summary":"The party says the virtual roll call will potentially feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/22/democrats-plan-to-hold-virtual-roll-call-ahead-of-their-convention-with-harris-favored/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Election_2024_Democrats_07706-1721692164.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:42:58","author":"Will Weissert,WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press","authors":["Will Weissert","WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":252381360,"title":"Here’s what happened to California Gov. Newsom’s quiet quest for the presidency","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom never said he was running for president in 2024. But it sure looked like he was posturing for it, just in case. He flew to Israel after the Hamas attack in October and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then traveled on to China to meet with President Xi Jinping. He debated conservative firebrand Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in November, then sat down for a no-holds-barred interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. He called for a constitutional amendment to enshrine gun safety laws and became a leading national voice against restrictive abortion laws. But when that just-in-case moment shook the political world Sunday with President Biden’s historic withdrawal from the race for re-election, it was not Newsom’s moment after all. “Sure, it was about running for president while not running for president, but he was not going to leapfrog his political competition in the form of Kamala Harris, the vice president of the United States,” Sonoma State political science professor David McCuan said Monday. “It was never going to happen.” After Biden’s disastrous June debate performance, Newsom maintained his support for Biden’s re-election, and last week said that if Biden did withdraw, he would support Harris. Newsom and Harris have been political allies and friends for years. Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2004, the same year Harris was elected district attorney there. Still, he left a curious 5-hour gap between the time he issued a statement praising Biden after his withdrawal from the race and his endorsement of Harris, enough room for speculation there might be other ambitions afoot. Newsom’s personal spokesman, Nathan Click, pointed to Newsom’s statement late Sunday saying “no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction” than Harris. And when it comes to Newsom campaigning for her, “yes, absolutely,” Click said, “he will hit the trail.” It didn’t help, though, that U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the powerful former House Speaker, who last week suggested an open, competitive convention if Biden dropped out, waited until Monday morning to endorse Harris. But as support has mounted for Harris, especially from would-be rival Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, the idea that Newsom or any other aspiring candidate would compete for the nomination at next month’s Democratic National Convention were kiboshed. The fundamental hesitation, however — and grist for plenty of Democratic angst — is whether Harris has a better chance of beating former President Trump than any other potential candidates. If the election really comes down to independent voters in Rust Belt swing states, would they really choose Harris or Newsom — both liberal California Democrats with deep roots in a city that has been the scourge of GOP rants about homelessness and drug abuse? Pelosi, in her endorsement of Harris “with immense pride and limitless optimism” Monday, said she has “full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November.” Pastor Amos Brown of Third Baptist Church of San Francisco said Harris has national appeal despite San Francisco’s woes, especially among Black women who are already coalescing around her candidacy, a constituency Newsom has struggled to attract. Nonetheless, pitting Newsom against Harris is wrongheaded, Brown said. He has seen the strength of their friendship back when he supported both of their candidacies, for mayor and district attorney, in the early 2000s. Harris is a member of his church. Newsom invited Brown to deliver the prayer in Sacramento at his inaugurations. “They’re not adversarial like that,” Brown said. “They’re two decent people. The issue isn’t about whose time it is. The issue is the president has spoken.” For Newsom to be in the running for the Democratic nomination now, several factors would have had to come to fruition, said Bill Whalen, distinguished policy fellow at the Hoover Institution. “The only way Newsom could have pulled this off is if he had the support of the president, which he didn’t, if he had the support of Nancy Pelosi, who’s now behind Harris, and if the other governors formed a phalanx behind him,” Whalen said. “But none of those actors were at play.” Because of his close ties to Harris, however, if she wins, Newsom, 56, who will finish his last term as governor in 2026, might land a role in her administration, in a cabinet post or as an ambassador. But he won’t be her pick for vice president. The U.S. Constitution’s 12th Amendment forbids delegates from voting for a presidential and vice presidential nominee from the same state. Although Harris now lives primarily in Washington, D.C., her official residence where she’s registered to vote is in the southern California city of Brentwood, where she moved after marrying entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff in 2014. Besides, Harris might be more likely to choose a governor from a swing state, like Shapiro from Pennsylvania or Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, to appeal to more voters, Whalen said. “So if you’re Gavin, you’re playing for, well, what if she doesn’t win this time? Will there be a possible future for me next time?” said Stanford political science professor Bruce Cain. “Even then, that’s uncertain.” Newsom might not have been the best Democrat to face Trump, anyway, Cain said, especially on moral high grounds. In 2007, when Newsom was single, he had an affair with his campaign manager’s wife. But Newsom’s international travels, charisma and rising national profile will serve him well as the 2028 election cycle approaches, Cain said. “He’s savvy enough to know this is not his moment,” Cain said. “But he’s smart enough to know, he’ll have his moment.”","summary":"In reacting to Biden's withdrawal Sunday, Newsom left a curious gap of time before endorsing Harris, enough room for speculation there might be other ambitions afoot.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/22/heres-what-happened-to-california-gov-newsoms-quiet-quest-for-the-presidency/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SJM-L-NEWSOMXI-1026-01.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:42:55","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":252381438,"title":"Lawmakers Call on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to Step Down at Hearing","text":"The Secret Service director, Kimberly A.

Ms. Cheatle declined to say how many agents were protecting Mr. Trump when a gunman shot at him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., on July 13, or who decided to leave a nearby rooftop out of the event’s security perimeter.

At times, Ms. Cheatle seemed less informed than the lawmakers quizzing her.

While Kamala Harris is likely much less prone than Joe Biden to show cognitive issues by mixing up names and losing track of what she’s saying, she’s still got to find a way to make up ground against Donald Trump in the next 104 days. A HarrisX/Forbes poll released Monday (but conducted July 19 to 21, the day Biden left the campaign) has Trump in blowout territory, leading Harris 50% to 41% overall and 51% to 40% among likely voters. “Kamala Harris starts her 2024 battle behind Trump, who is enjoying a strong post-convention bump and leads her by almost [double] digits in our polling,” commented Dritan Nesho, HarrisX CEO and chief pollster. “If the polls don’t start to close and show better traction for her, Biden’s decision to step aside for Harris may be a case of ‘too similar, too late.’” That survey isn’t the only one with red flags for the blue team. An On Point Politics/SoCal Research Sunday survey shows Trump with majority support, leading Harris 51% to 43% in one of the first national polls conducted after Biden left the race. While the poll had a +2 Republican lean in sampling (with 38% of respondents being GOP versus 36% Democrat), other data should worry Democrats — including 24% of respondents saying they’re more likely to support Trump with Biden out, against just 18% less likely to do so. The Trump camp spotlighted this survey along with a slew of Trump-Harris trial heats in its favor ahead of Biden deciding not to run, saying in an email to press that “even if Democrat Party insiders and donors are able to successfully anoint disgraced border czar Kamala Harris as the new nominee — disenfranchising millions of Democrat primary voters in the process — it won’t save them.” But not all polling is bad for Harris. A Quinnipiac poll released Monday shows a too-close-to-call race, with Trump up 45% to 41% in a six-way run including minor candidates. To put that in perspective, Trump was up by 5 points against Biden in the same scenario. “The dramatic reset at the top of the Democratic ticket does little to move the race as Vice President Harris enters the fray with numbers similar to President Biden,” said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. A Morning Consult survey released Monday shows a 47% to 45% lead for Trump, a more positive look for Dems than the 6-point lead Trump had over Biden, even though just 65% of Democrats support her to lead the ticket. That’s better than what a Sunday survey from YouGov showed. In that poll, 60% of Democrats say the Californian should be the party’s presidential nominee, with 21% of Democrats wanting someone else and 19% not sure what they want. These numbers have room for improvement, especially given that most Republican registrants have coalesced around Trump amid months of lawfare against him and his survival of an assassination attempt this month. If Harris can’t unify the party, she can’t win. And she hasn’t gotten it done yet despite help from most of the Dem establishment. Single-state polling is beginning to surface that includes at least some sampling from after Biden left the race, and it doesn’t show Harris delivering just yet. If the election were held today, she would lose at least two states Biden won in 2020. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey released shortly after Biden left the race showed Trump leading Harris, 50.5% to 45.9%. Trump’s lead over Harris was more than the 3.5% advantage he had over the current president in the same sample. And the poll suggests Harris is a turnoff among key demographics Democrats will rely on in the Peach State. Among nonblack minorities (Asians and Hispanics), Trump leads the veep by 12 points — as compared with a more modest 3.8% lead he had with the same demographics against Biden in the same sample. Harris also performs worse among women than Biden against Trump, carrying her own gender with a 7.4% margin, while Biden had a 9-point lead. Meanwhile, Republicans last won New Hampshire in 2000 — but polling conducted between July 19 and 21 suggests they have at least an even shot this year in the Granite State. The New Hampshire Journal poll released Sunday shows Trump ahead of Harris, albeit marginally — 40.2% to 39.3%, with an additional 20.5% favoring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Live Free or Die State. Pollsters also posed the Trump/Biden question. While Trump still carried that trial heat, it was by just 0.3% (39.7% to 39.4%), with Kennedy up to 20.9%. Both Trump leads are well inside the +/- 3.99% margin of error. But the polling data include an important caveat that should hearten Republicans: “Political polls using online panels occasionally display a liberal/Democratic house effect in comparison to other polls, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented above.”","summary":"After a seismic shift atop the Democratic presidential ticket, the likely new nominee faces some of the same problems the current president does.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/us-news/kamala-harris-would-lose-at-least-two-states-biden-won-in-2020-if-election-were-held-today-polls/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-q0uzx1nc1-1721691466391.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721677231&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CfNXg1yy-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:49","author":"A.g.

After President Joe Biden announced his decision to forfeit re-election, a tidal wave of memes about Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Biden backed as the Democratic presidential candidate — flooded the internet. On platforms like TikTok and X, the mood felt celebratory as many left-leaning accounts posted upbeat fan edits of Harris and made memes out of her more memorable lines from speeches. On Sunday, British pop artist Charli XCX appeared to back Harris, calling her a “brat,” a reference to her new album, which has become the Gen Z theme of the summer. Some political strategists say the memes are helping Harris generate a level of organic social media clout among Gen Z that Biden has struggled to cultivate, amplified by the spotlight of a possible presidential nomination. “She doesn’t take herself too seriously. She knows how to have fun, and she’s somebody that is willing to be a little bit less stuffy than a traditional presidential candidate would be, and I think that’s a good thing in this election cycle,” said Marianna Pecora, the communications director for the Gen Z-run political advocacy group Voters of Tomorrow. But Pecora said the viral moments aren’t just for laughs — they also indicate broader support for Harris, particularly among young people who have at times felt disenchanted by presidential candidates. “I don’t think that anyone is going to necessarily meme their way to the presidency,” said Pecora, 20, a student at George Washington University. “But I do think that being able to make this election something bright and fun and exciting and something that’s infiltrating people’s feeds and therefore their everyday lives is only a good thing.” Part of Harris’ frequent virality comes from her tendency to show off her seemingly authentic personality online. It’s why many of her vocal online supporters — who call themselves the KHive — have staunchly defended her since her first presidential run in 2020. The KHive, which is a play on Beyoncé’s BeyHive, has exhibited stan behavior in the way it circulates content and news about Harris. It has rallied around a plethora of humorous moments, from her love of Venn diagrams to her out-of-tune rendition of “Wheels on the Bus” to her propensity for busting out enthusiastic dance moves. After Biden’s debate with Trump in June, which sparked a panic about his capacity to run for re-election, the KHive gained renewed momentum online. Fans of Harris turned a speech last year in which she quoted her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, talking about a “coconut tree” into a running meme. “My mother used to, she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” Harris said in the speech. “‘You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” In the 24 hours since Biden’s announcement, Google searches for “coconut tree” spiked dramatically. The “coconut tree” army gained so much traction overnight that even elected representatives — such as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker — leaned into it. Many X and TikTok users joked that the “coconut prophecy” had been fulfilled. So far, however, Harris herself hasn’t publicly acknowledged the meme. A spokesperson for the White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Harris’ slight eccentricity has sometimes made her an easy target for jokes online. Some conservative accounts have tried to mock her more viral moments. In December, the Republican National Committee made a 4-minute-long compilation of Harris using one of her more notable lines: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” But some, like Annie Wu Henry, a digital and political strategist, said that just because some of the things Harris says are silly doesn’t mean they leave a bad impression or deter prospective voters. “Some of these phrases we’ve seen, like the coconut one, when it first got into the ether, people were like, ‘What is this quote?’” said Henry, who ran the viral TikTok campaign of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., in 2022. “But as people were reading it, they were like, ‘No, this actually is a really insightful thing to say.’ And people are having fun with that.” Even Harris’ own camp appears to be embracing the online buzz. On Sunday, the campaign’s X account, @KamalaHQ, began using Charli XCX’s neon green “brat” theme as its cover image. The X account's two-word bio also quotes Harris' speech. It reads: “Providing context.\" Though young progressives have heavily criticized Harris in the past for her conservative record as a prosecutor, several prominent young left-leaning voter groups were quick to throw their support behind her this week. The social media advocacy group Gen-Z for Change, formerly TikTok for Biden, announced its endorsement of Harris within a few hours after Biden dropped out.

Henry said she believes the support from younger progressives — even those who may not fully agree with all of Harris’ stances — is so suddenly cohesive because “people overwhelmingly understand what is at stake this election cycle.” “Nobody is ignorant to what is at stake and what we are up against, and that means we are going to consolidate and coalesce around who the candidate might be,” she said. “And if it is … Kamala Harris, I think everyone is extremely determined to make sure she wins.”","summary":"Democrats may soon nominate a presidential candidate capable of rivaling GOP nominee Donald Trump in memeability.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-internet-memes-gen-z-rcna162977","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-KamalaHarrisNCAA-aa-609p-2067ca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:41","author":"Angela Yang","authors":["Angela Yang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.297},{"id":252381880,"title":"Biden’s decision to drop out leaves Democrats across the country relieved and looking toward future","text":"HARPER WOODS, Mich.— After weeks of uncertainty about who would be at the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket in November, many voters expressed relief over the news that President Biden would drop his reelection bid and began to think about who might replace him in a dramatically altered election landscape. Jerod Keene, a 40-year-old athletic trainer from swing-state Arizona, had planned to vote for Biden in November but was thankful for the president’s decision, calling it “inevitable.” Keene said he’s excited about the next candidate, hoping it will be Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden endorsed on Sunday. “Kamala Harris is the easiest pick based on the fact that she’s vice president and it would be tough for the party to try to go a different direction on that,” said Keene, who lives in Tucson. “And I think she seems ready.” The Democratic Party has been deeply divided since Biden’s poor debate performance on June 27, which left many questioning his ability to defeat Republican Donald Trump in November and secure another term. Party leaders had increasingly called for Biden to step aside, but his reluctance to bow out left voters nationwide uncertain about who would face Trump in November. Recent AP-NORC polling revealed that nearly two-thirds of Democrats felt Biden should withdraw from the presidential race, while a majority believe Harris would perform well in the top slot. Keene’s relief that the saga surrounding Biden’s decision was over was echoed by voters nationwide in interviews with The Associated Press. In key swing states such as Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada, many expressed optimism about the party’s next nominee — whether it be Harris or someone else. In Pittsburgh, Fred Johnston said he has been terrified of another Trump presidency and had long worried that Biden couldn’t beat Trump again. After seeing Biden’s wobbly debate performance, he was eager for Biden to drop out and hand off his candidacy to Harris. “Kamala is someone we can vote for, and that’s what we need,” Johnston said. He also thinks she can win Pennsylvania: “I have no logical basis for this, but it’s good to have hope. I haven’t had hope for a while.” In Las Vegas, Lucy Ouano, 68, said she was proud of both Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and his move to quickly endorse Harris. “He’s ending on a great note,” Ouano said. “Trump should be worried. He’s now running against someone strong.” Ouano, who emigrated in 1960 to the U.S. from Thailand as a young child with her parents, said she couldn’t have imagined this outcome just a few weeks ago when she attended a Harris rally in Las Vegas meant to quiet concerns about Biden’s reelection campaign. At the time, she told the AP that while she planned on voting for Biden, she wanted Harris at the top of the ticket. “She’s going to get the Asians drummed up, and she’s going to get the women drummed up,” Oaano said Sunday after learning about Biden’s decision. Similarly, Arthur L. Downard Jr., a 72-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon, viewed Biden’s presidency favorably but said he was “very pleased” that Biden stepped aside. The Democratic voter, who cast his ballot for Biden in 2020, said his opinion of Biden changed after what he called a “disastrous” debate. “He’s been a great president and he’s gotten a lot done for our country. But he’s too old, he’s not articulate,” he said. “He’s not a good messenger for the Democratic Party.” Some voters, like Nebraska resident Lacey LeGrand, had planned to reluctantly vote for Biden simply because he wasn’t Trump. “I’m definitely not supporting Trump,” LeGrand said. “So I think by default I was going to end up supporting Biden. I wasn’t very happy about it.” LeGrand, a registered Democrat in Nebraska’s Omaha swing district, a potentially decisive electoral vote that Biden and Obama both won previously, believes Harris “has a shot” at defeating Trump, though she added, “I wouldn’t say it’s a great shot.” But not all voters were happy about Sunday’s news. Georgia voter Dorothy Redhead, 76, was “disappointed” that Biden dropped out of the race but said she is “just having to accept” Biden’s decision as one between the president and God. Jarvia Haynes, a real estate agent in New Orleans, said she has “mixed feelings” about Biden’s decision to leave the race. “I don’t think President Biden should have dropped out,” she said. “On the other hand, maybe it’s for the best.” Haynes, 72, of Harvey, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, quickly focused on who should lead the Democratic ticket, saying she is “very positive about Vice President Kamala Harris being able to handle the job.” She added that she hopes Harris would choose Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to be her running mate. “I think two women would change the whole dynamic of the race,” said Haynes, who joins Harris as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the first intercollegiate historically African American sorority. The group boasts more than 360,000 members in graduate and undergraduate chapters in 12 countries and could be a formidable political force of its own. Barbara Orr, a psychotherapist in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area, said she thought Biden was capable of running for president, beating Trump and serving as president. She viewed his decision to end his candidacy, however, as a sign that he is not guided by ego and recognized that, because of his debate performance, voters assume that he can’t do the job. Orr, 65, said she isn’t “super impressed” with Harris, “but she might rise to the occasion. That’s happened before in history.” She also acknowledged that Harris hasn’t had the chance to prove her mettle as a candidate against Trump. Orr, a self-described progressive who favored Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020, said she would probably prefer Whitmer to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket. “I love what she stands for,” Orr said. Joe DeFrain was out kayaking when a text informed him that Biden had dropped out. While the Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, resident said he wasn’t stunned to learn of the development, one thing did surprise him. “I was waiting to see if all the boaters out there were going to be screaming with joy, because a lot of them are Trump fans. And I didn’t hear anything,” DeFrain said after sitting down for dinner at They Say, a restaurant in the Detroit suburb of Harper Woods. Biden visited They Say earlier this year, a moment that manager George Ledbetter said was “the best ever.” Ledbetters’ first reaction to the news came down to a single word: “Why?” “He’s a good president. I like Biden,” Ledbetter said. But, he added, “You gotta do what you gotta do.” Ledbetter said he’ll support Harris despite his disappointment. “I’ll take that, too. I think she can do it. First woman president. That’d be nice. African American president. It’d be nice again,” said Ledbetter, who is Black. As for DeFrain, he said he’ll be watching to see what happens before and during the Democratic National Convention. “It’s going to be something we have never seen in our lifetime,” said DeFrain, who has voted for Democrats in recent elections. “It should be entertaining.” « Previous Next","summary":"Voters nationwide reacted with relief and hope to news that President Biden would drop his reelection bid.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/22/bidens-decision-to-drop-out-leaves-democrats-across-the-country-relieved-and-looking-toward-future/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Biden_Drops_Out_90923_9c63f3-1721692167.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:02","author":"JOEY CAPPELLETTI,Joey Cappelletti, Mike Householder And Charlotte Kramon,MIKE HOUSEHOLDER and CHARLOTTE KRAMON - Associated Press","authors":["JOEY CAPPELLETTI","Joey Cappelletti, Mike Householder And Charlotte Kramon","MIKE HOUSEHOLDER and CHARLOTTE KRAMON - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":252380748,"title":"RFK Jr. Talked to Trump About a Job in His Administration: Report","text":"Earlier this month, independent presidential hopeful and notorious vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke with his rival Donald Trump about possibly endorsing the former Republican president—and even taking a job working in public health in a new Trump Administration. As first reported by The Washington Post, the talks between Kennedy and Trump began only hours after the failed attempt to assassinate Trump played out at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on July 13, according to the newspaper, which cited “four people familiar with the matter.” One call between the two men appears to have been captured on video, which made the rounds online soon after it was recorded last week. In the clip, which was shared on social media by Kennedy’s son, Trump can be heard repeating unfounded vaccine claims and telling Kennedy he would “love” for him “to do stuff,” apparently a reference to potentially working in the White House together. The talks included a conversation concerning positions Kennedy could hold in a new Trump Administration—potentially in the Cabinet and other jobs for which the Senate does not need to confirm appointees—as well as a scenario where Kennedy drops out of the race and backs Trump, the four people told the Post. According to the newspaper, no agreement came from the discussions between the two men, as those around Trump voiced concern over offering a job in the administration in exchange for an endorsement, the sources said. Some advisors also raised issue over whether Kennedy would be the right pick for a job, given his anti-vaccine viewpoints, the people who spoke with the Post said. Kennedy seemingly confirmed the conversations to the newspaper on Monday, saying: “All I will say to you is I am willing to talk to anybody from either political party who wants to talk about children’s health and how to end the chronic disease epidemic.” He noted Trump has been more receptive to him than the Democratic Party. “I have a lot of respect for President Trump for reaching out to me,” Kennedy said. “Nobody from the DNC, high or low, has ever reached out to me in 18 months. Instead they have allocated millions to try to disrupt my campaign.” Notably, Kennedy said he plans to continue seeking the presidency, adding, “We’re in it to win it.” Kennedy and Trump first spoke by phone the night Trump was injured at the shooting at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the pair agreed to meet in person last week in Milwaukee as the Republican National Convention was kicking off, according to the Post. As rumors swirled about the fate of his campaign after the meeting last week, Kennedy clarified in a post on X that “national unity” was the “main topic” of their discussion. “President Trump met with RFK and they had a conversation about the issues just as he does regularly with important figures in business and politics because they all recognize he will be the next president of the United States,” Danielle Alvarez, a Trump spokeswoman, said.","summary":"REBECCA NOBLE/REUTERSEarlier this month, independent presidential hopeful and notorious vaccine skeptic Robert F.

[+] Valley Music Festival at Napa Valley Expo on May 26, 2023 in Napa, California. (Photo by Steve Jennings/WireImage) WireImage For four decades guitarist Mike Campbell had job security in one of the choicest jobs in music. Campbell got to go in the studio and on stage every night with one of the finest frontmen and songwriters in all of music – Rock And Roll Hall of Fame legend Tom Petty. It was a dream job for a musician who just wanted to play and didn’t need the spotlight. Tragically though, Campbell found himself in the position of far too many musicians who lost a friend first and a band mate second. Following Petty’s death October 2, 2017, Campbell had to figure out how best to continue his music career. Seven years later, Campbell is now the frontman, leading Mike Campbell and the Dirty Knobs in the studio and on stages every night. The band has a wonderful new album, Vagabonds, Virgins & Misfits and will continue to tour throughout 2024. I spoke to Campbell about his four-decade journey with Petty, the guests – Graham Nash, Chris Stapleton, Lucinda Williams and fellow Heartbreaker Benmont Tench – on the new album, taking on the role of frontman, songwriting advice he got from Bob Dylan and more. Steve Baltin: Congratulations, it's a wonderful record. Was there one song early on that jump started this album? Mike Campbell: Yeah, I’d just come off a little tour and I wanted to do a song as a thank you to the audience, and I just was quickly thrown together, called “You Are The Greatest.” It was just a kind of thank you to everybody for supporting us. It's the point of view of singing to the audience. We started with that, it was just a kind of a little psychedelic entrance to the album. Then the other songs started to flow together after that.

Are there people that you really enjoyed watching the way they worked or that you've learned a lot from? Campbell: Oh, yeah. Tom, obviously we were shoulder to shoulder for over 40 years. But I've been very fortunate to have conversations and work with other people that I greatly admire, such as Bob Dylan. When you're around someone like that you just kind of watch them. Bob is one of a kind. He's a very inspired writer. He gave me a tip once, because with the Heartbreakers, a lot of times we were writing a song and Tom or whoever or me, and we would write, get the verses and the chorus and a bridge maybe, and you get three verses and you're done. Bob says, when you're writing, don't stop there. It may be good, but if you got three verses in the song, write 20 verses while the switch is on. Just tap all those thoughts and all those images and stay with that character for longer. You may find, deep into the verses, you would come up with a whole other depth to the character that you would never have done if you'd have settled for the first three things you came up with. So, I do that a lot now. If I'm writing, I'll write a bunch of verses. Of course, a lot of them I'll cut out and narrow down to the best ones, but I think that's a good tip. And, [George] Harrison, I asked Harrison once, when you're writing, do you have a little cassette player or something to put the idea down so you don't forget it? He said, “No, I don't do that. I figure if I can't remember it later, no one else would've either.” I don't quite agree with that, but it's a good line [laughter]. Baltin: It is a good line. A lot of times good writing is subconscious. When you go back and look at stuff that you've written over the years, do you see these tips manifest themselves in ways that maybe you didn't realize at the time? Campbell: That's a great question. There are two modes of songwriting. There's the accept the inspiration and grab as much of the magic best as you can and put it down and do the best with it. Then you turn that mind off to some extent and turn on the analytical mathematical mind, and you start working on it and refining it and putting it into a structure. Adding this, taking that out. So there's the two different parts of your mind that work together to make the song come to life. On this album, it's interesting because we cut like 25 or 26 songs. Most of them that I had written recently. I was on a roll, but then my wife suggested, “You should go back through some of your analog tapes up in the closet that they're just sitting there.” I didn't want to do it, but I took her advice. I have some old two-inch tapes from 15, 20 years ago or more. Half the new album is from those songs, I found some gems that I've completely forgotten about. I pulled them out and I thought, “This is better than I thought, this will fit on this album.” So. it's a combination of new songs and old songs. Baltin: Are there old ones that you were surprised to see how relevant they are to you today? Campbell: Both. There were some that were crap, but the ones that were good I thought, “I'm glad I didn't erase this because I had forgotten about it and now it's coming back to me and this is really pretty good, holds up over time.” I don't know, you could write 20 songs and maybe 19 are crap, and there's one good one in there. But I found quite a few good things from the past, which surprised me. I'd play the tape, it'd start out and I'd go, \"I don't remember this.\" Then a guitar part or the voice would come in and go, \"Oh, now I remember it. Yeah, this was pretty good.\" I guess I was going to come back to it someday. Well, this is the day.” Baltin: As a fan I'm just curious, one song you wish you could have written, what is it and why? Campbell: “Like a Rolling Stone,” the first thing that pops to mind. There are so many, but that song had an effect on me when I was, 16 and that came on the radio or something. I thought he was singing about me, and I connected with the character in the song, who was lost and trying to find his way through life. I kind of felt like, \"How does he know me?\" “Johnny B. Goode” also, I thought that's about me, the poor kid sitting by the railroad track dreaming about maybe making something someday. Those two songs I just connected with because I felt like the character was me, and I'm thinking, “How does he know me? [laughter].” I wish I had written “Like a Rolling Stone,” just because it's such a well-crafted song. The rhyme schemes are just humorous at times but clever as hell and full of meaning and the music is exuberant and loose and jammy and very spontaneous sounding. Baltin: I love that you picked “Johnny B. Goode” though as well because I just had this conversation with Steve Van Zandt. To me, to this day, there's never been a better rock song than “Johnny B. Goode.” There are songs that are as good, but you can't write a better rock song. Campbell: I think you're probably right. And that's the first song I learned on the guitar too. I didn't have a teacher, I just learned it hearing it off the radio, Chuck Berry just had established the style and his lyrics were so good, his images and his descriptions of adjectives of words and the characters were so real and so rock and roll, and so exuberant and full of youth and hope. That song is, “Someday my name will be in lights.” I didn't know [laughter] at the time, but I felt like the guy sitting by the railroad tracks by a shack, playing along with the rhythm of the train, trying to learn the guitar. That was me at the time. My dreams have come true, fortunately. It is a great song. It's hard to pick one, but that's right up there. Yeah. Baltin: Let’s take this album to the road. What songs are you really excited to play live? Campbell: You're right. Some of the songs on this record, like “Don't Wait Up” and “Shake These Blues” are old songs that I played in clubs, years ago that from before the song was finished. But I know that they'll translate live on the stage because I've done them before in front of people. A lot of the songs have never been played live and I think that some of them will morph into more on the stage. Like there's this song called “Hands Are Tied,” which is a very interesting song for me because it's got two different time signatures. It's kind of jammy and I think there'll be room in that song to stretch out a little bit and let it morph on the stage and maybe turn into something better or different. But I'm looking forward to playing all of them. We now have three albums of songs on this next tour coming up. I want to play most of the new record, but we'll have to let go of some of the other songs if you like to make room for these. There are a lot of rockers on the record, a lot of great guitar stuff on the record, and there's also a couple of good ballads that are more about the lyrics so I'm looking forward to playing them, seeing how people react to them. Baltin: What were you looking for in the people you work with on this record? I like the fact, too, there's only a couple of guests, and they're very selected in there. Campbell: The guests that come on my record were an afterthought. I cut all the songs as if it was just going to be us. And then I met Graham for an interview, I knew him a little bit, and he did an interview with me, and I got up the courage to ask him if he would sing on one of my tracks, and he said he would. It was an afterthought, but he really made the song great on “Dare to Dream.” Me being a Hollies fan, I still get goosebumps when I hear his voice come in on my song he's so f**king great. Then Lucinda, I did not know that well, but I had met her and we had been on tour together. I had this song, “Hell or High Water,” that's kind of a movie, a story with a character that goes through these experiences throughout the song and gets into trouble and tries to find his way out. I was listening to it after I finished it, and I thought this would be better if the female character showed up in the song. I thought of Lucinda, she happened to be in town and she came over and very shyly sang the song. But she did it so good and it made the song ten times better because it's going along and singing about this girl that he meets, and then she shows up and has her perspective on him. She really did a great job. She's a sweetheart. She has so much passion and emotion in her voice. Then Chris Stapleton, who I had worked with before, happened to be in town and he came in and sang a verse on a rocker with me and he sang some harmony on this song about giving up alcohol at my old friends. He and I are like brothers. We totally think and feel the same way about music. Then, of course, Benmont Tench came over and played some piano, one take on “Don't Wait Up,” like some Little Richard stuff at the end, which is absolutely phenomenal. I was thrilled to have him on there. But the guests were kind of afterthoughts I didn't think of this as a song that has to have so-and-so on it. I'm just trying to make it good on my own. And as I listen to it back, it's about what can I do better? Another singer might be good. Baltin: You know what it's like when you have that chemistry with someone. So for you, how much of a joy is it, whether it's with Chris or whoever, that you find that camaraderie? Campbell: Yeah, it's a new experience for me because for all those decades, I always mostly wrote on my own. I would give Tom the music and we would write that way. And I never wrote with other people. So now I'm opening up a little bit and working with other people because my life has changed with Tom being gone. It's a little intimidating for me to bring other people into my process, but I find most of the time it works out. Like you said, if you have chemistry and you pick the right person for the right song, it's very exhilarating. Of course, Tom and I, our thing was very unique and untouchable in its own way. I'm finding it's a little scary for me to write with other people, but I'm learning how to do it. Baltin: For most people, as you get older you get more confident, more comfortable with yourself. You were put in this situation which you weren't necessarily expecting or wanted of now being a front person. Do you feel like it's something that you could have done at another point? Campbell: I don't, I think you're right. When I was working with Tom, I never had the desire or ambition to go out and establish myself as a singer or front a band. I was in a band, and I learned so much just from being a band with Tom and watching how he worked the stage and engaged the audience. A lot of that stuff I picked up and soaked up from him. And I don't know at that time if I was ready to take that on, at this point I feel like I am. It's a new adventure for me. It's a new chapter in my life and it's learning and it's exciting. It's like starting over with a lot of enthusiasm for something that's new. And when it works it's great. It's very fulfilling in a different way than being just a guitar player in a band.

He called his decision to drop out of the presidential race “the “right thing to do,” CNN reported.Biden made the remarks during a phone call he made into his former campaign’s headquarters to thank the staff and praise Kamala Harris, who visited the Wilmington office on Monday (local time) to visit with staff.During the phone call, Biden directly addressed Harris and the team, saying, “embrace her, she’s the best.”On his announcement to drop out of the presidential race, he called it “suprising news” and emphasised that it’s his belief it was the “right thing to do,” CNN reported.“I know it’s hard because you poured your heart and soul into me,” Biden told the campaign staffers and added, “You’re an amazing team.”The US President expressed gratitude to the staffers for uprooting their lives for him and his now ended campaign. He said that they have built the “best” campaign organisation in history. He said, “I’ve been honoured and humbled.” Biden said, “I’m going to be on the road and I’m not going anywhere.” He stated, “I won’t be on the ticket but I am still going to be fully, fully engaged. I’ve got six months left in my presidency. I’m determined to get as much done as I possibly can both foreign policy and domestic policy,” according to CNN report. Earlier on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to not seek re-election in the “best interest” of the Democratic Party and the country. He has endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to “come together and beat” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.In a letter posted on X, Biden stated, “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”He also expressed gratitude to US Vice President Kamala Harris for being an “extraordinary partner” for him. He even thanked people who worked for his re-election.He said, “For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can’t do – when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.”He said that the US has been a strong economy in the world and they have made historic investments in rebuilding the nation, lowering prescription drug costs for seniors and expanding affordable healthcare to a record number of Americans.Highlighting the achievements of his government in the past, Biden said, “Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We’ve made historic investments in rebuilding our nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans.”“We’ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today,” he added.In a letter, Biden said it had been the greatest honour of his life to serve as US President. Biden noted that the US overcame the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.In a statement posted on social media platform X, Biden recalled that his first decision as the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020 was to choose Harris as his Vice President, and termed it the best decision he has made.Taking to X, Biden stated, “My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term.

Earlier in Monday’s event, after her husband and second gentleman Doug Emhoff warmed up the crowd, Harris addressed the Delaware-based team. She directly addressed her opponent, Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. The former California attorney general told the Delaware-based staff, “I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” Her words echoed an advertisement released as part of her 2019 Democratic primary campaign that’s gone viral in recent days, adding to the growing meme culture around her. In it, Harris is framed as the “anti-Trump” candidate. “She prosecuted sex offenders. He is one,” the ad states, drawing a number of other contrasts between the pair. Harris told the campaign staff, “Donald Trump wants to take our country backwards, to a time before many of our fellow American had full freedoms and rights. But we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans.” Earlier in the event, after second gentleman Doug Emhoff introduced her, Harris addressed President Biden. He was listening remotely as he recovers from COVID-19. The vice president gushed over working closely with him and how the two have become like family. “It’s mutual,” Biden responded. “I’m watching you, kid. I love you.” President Biden to VP Harris: “I’m watching you, kid. I’m watching you.

Harris said that their campaign message and Dillon’s motto will remain the same: “One team, one fight.” The staff stayed committed to Biden throughout his turbulent campaign, but that apparatus is now set up to work for Harris, with the staff largely maintaining their positions. The vice president echoed similar sentiments to those from previous public addresses, saying Biden has accomplished more in one term than many presidents have in two. Harris addressed the future she hopes to deliver as president, stating that building up the United States’ middle class will be a “defining goal” of her presidency. She also reiterated that she plans to earn the party’s nomination and win the presidency. “We are going to win this election,” Emhoff said. “We are on the right side of every single issue.” The vice president led a call and response from her campaign to conclude her own speech, leading them in a round of “When we fight, we win.”","summary":"Her words echo an advertisement released as part of her 2019 primary campaign that’s gone viral\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris Compares Criminals She Prosecuted as California AG to Her Opponent: ‘I Know Donald Trump’s Type’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/kamala-harris-donald-trump-criminal-campaign-staff/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kamala-harris-president.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:33:56","author":"Tess Patton","authors":["Tess Patton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.24},{"id":252380804,"title":"Canadian shot dead after trying to stab Israelis as he cried ‘you’re murdering people in Gaza’ in town blitzed on Oct 7","text":"A CANADIAN has been shot dead in Israel after reportedly trying to stab an armed civilian unit.

The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work, but a draft of the plan they are set to approve was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday. The proposal does not list a date for when the virtual roll call begins, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by Aug. 7. “We can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,” Harrison on a conference call with reporters. The party says the virtual roll call will potentially feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates. The Democratic National Convention opens in-person on Aug. 19 in Chicago. State delegations to the gathering began pledging their near-unanimous support for Harris in the hours after Biden announced he was abandoning his reelection bid on Sunday. Biden endorsed Harris shortly after announcing he was abandoning his campaign. That doesn’t formally make her the party’s nominee, but the vice president spent hours Sunday calling 100-plus party leaders, members of Congress, labor leaders and leaders of advocacy and civil rights organizations to say she’d earn the nomination in her own right and to ensure they would support her. Harris has since been endorsed by hundreds of Democratic lawmakers, leading governors and some of the country’s most powerful unions, as well as the delegations to the convention from Florida and North and South Carolina. Biden’s departure from the race and endorsement of Harris ended weeks of questions about whether he was up to the rigors of a campaign and a second term in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican Donald Trump late last month. Democrats first announced in May that they were resorting to a virtual roll call in order to make a deadline in Ohio and ensure that Biden’s name appeared on the ballot in that state. Ohio lawmakers have since nullified the previous deadline, but the DNC said that, because the change doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1, the party still had to settle its nominee prior to the original deadline or risk legal challenges. In 2020, the in-person Democratic convention was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, and states used a virtual process to formally nominate Biden. When they gather in Chicago next month, Democrats will still hold a state-by-state roll call that is a fixture of nominating conventions, although it would largely be ceremonial.

Jerome Fishkin Walnut Creek Democratic nominee should pledge to pardon Trump The Democratic candidate for president this November should make a pledge: If he or she is elected, Donald Trump will never spend a day in jail on any currently pending federal charges. He will be issued a pardon — but only after he has been convicted of, or pleads guilty to, what he has obviously done, significantly mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice and trying to overturn a valid election. People must know that willful mishandling of classified documents and obstructing justice is wrongful and dangerous to our security, and that fomenting distrust in our elections is wrongful and destroys our fabric as a nation. This pledge should be made to help unify our country. And it wouldn’t hurt that it could heighten that candidate’s chances of victory. Jay Chafetz Walnut Creek Where will Harris be on criminal justice reforms? Where will Kamala Harris stand on criminal justice reform? Will she be a reformer or a punitive opponent of justice reform. She has switched sides before on this issue. As the San Francisco district attorney and as the California attorney general, she was leaning toward the reforms that are needed. But how will she as president impact criminal justice reform on the federal level? Is she for or against mass incarceration? Will she amend long-standing federal sentencing laws? As a justice reform activist, these are the questions I have. Her reforms will affect our nation. Join Crosthwaite Corcoran Democrats must stay focused on winning Thank you Joe Biden for your service to the party and country. Now Democrats must keep the goal of winning this election in perfect focus. Although there’s a lot of excitement about it, the goal is not to elect a woman or a Black woman as president. Clear-eyed Kamala Harris knows the main goal and will get onboard. Poll-testing of potential candidates is critical. Time is of the essence. Democrats must put forth the best candidate to get the job done period! Marcia Hulberg Campbell All immigrants crucial to U.S. economy Re: “Legal immigrants grow our economy” (Page A6, July 18). I’m writing in response to Mike Heller’s letter extolling the benefits of legal immigrants to our economy. That part is true. But he says, “This is what we need more of, not unskilled laborers who slip across our southern border.” Who does he think picks our strawberries and almonds? Who cleans our hotel rooms? Who builds our houses? Who staffs our nursing homes? We can argue about how our labor market should work, but at the present time it works because of unskilled laborers from foreign countries. If Donald Trump gets the chance to deport 11 million workers, you will see how our economy doesn’t work without them. If you think Americans will bring in the harvest, just watch your food prices rise. Jeanie Egbert Alameda DA calls out ‘bias’ where there is none Re: “DA: Death row inmate should be released” (Page B1, July 18). This article characterizes Alameda County prosecutors’ “systematically keeping Black and Jewish people off juries in death penalty cases” as “decades of racism, antisemitism and bigotry.” No. That’s not what it was at all. It may have been illegal but it was not “racism” or “antisemitism,” terms your newspaper uses excessively. Attorneys are given a number of potential jurors they can “excuse” before trial juries are formed, using these “challenges” to “excuse” jurors they believe are more likely to be “biased” against outcomes they seek. Black and Jewish jurors are historically, probabilistically, less likely than average jurors to support the death penalty. So, despite possible illegality, this strategy was pursued to help secure a “friendly” jury. It was not an effort to harm or degrade Black or Jewish people. Excessive, inaccurate use of these terms poisons the civic air we must all breathe. Steve Koppman Oakland Media must offer other parties more coverage Freedom of the press? Free to do what?

The current VP also had the backing of the late Black Panther star for the position she currently holds.

Pat Fallon, R-Texas, had never had any long-gun training in his life. He owns an AR-15 but until recently had only ever shot it once six years ago. Following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, Fallon and his team recreated the scene in Savoy, Texas. He lay on a sloped roof 130 yards from the paper target at 6:30 at night, mirroring closely the scenario in Butler. He took eight shots with two distinct types of scopes. The result was 15 out of 16 kill shots. The one he missed? It hit the target’s ear. “That’s a 94% success rate,” he said at the House Oversight Committee meeting Monday morning. “And that shooter was a better shot than me.” On Monday morning, Democrats and Republicans in the committee linked arms to issue a bipartisan drubbing upon Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over what many characterized as the worst Secret Security failure in decades. Facing heated scrutiny, Cheatle declined to answer even the most basic questions about the shooting nine days after the fact. Members from both parties were baffled and frustrated by her lack of transparency — many noted that she’d been more forthcoming in an interview with ABC News — causing most to call for her resignation. “Americans demand answers,” said Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee. “But they haven’t been getting them from the Secret Service. Americans demand accountability. It shouldn’t take this much time or preparation to tell the truth, Director Cheatle, or to tell Americans the truth.” In an exchange with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., during which the congressman alluded to the resignation of former Secret Service director Stuart King following an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, Cheatle pledged to remain at the helm of the Secret Service. “I am dedicated to finding the answers to what happened. And like every Secret Service agent, we don’t shirk from our responsibilities,” she said. “I will remain on and be responsible to the agency to this committee, to the former president and to the American public.” “Do you really genuinely in your heart believe that you being in this role is what’s right for America at this moment?” Khanna asked. “I mean, do you think there are people who are Trump supporters who have confidence in you? … I just don’t think this is partisan. If you have an assassination attempt on a president, a former president, or a candidate, you need to resign.” The hearing was marked by back-and-forths in which representatives attempted without success to ascertain details, such as when the Secret Service changed its designation of the shooter Thomas Crooks from “suspicious” to “threatening,” the type of bullets used, and basic information about the chronology of the shooting. In a moment that drew audible gasps in the room, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., asked Cheatle if she possessed a timeline of events on the night of the shooting. “I have a timeline that doesn’t have specifics,” Cheatle responded. Rep. Fallon told the Register: “I am completely unsatisfied with her testimony today and find it shameful that even as the nation desperately seeks answers, she offered nothing but bureaucratic doublespeak. Let’s be clear: The American people demand and deserve answers. Her refusal to answer direct questions is disgraceful and she must resign.” One piece of new information that did emerge from the hearing was a rough estimate for when the Secret Service’s internal investigation of the security failure will become public. Cheatle said she hoped a review would be available after about 60 days. The announcement was met with fierce blowback from across the aisle. “We are currently in the midst of an especially concentrated presidential campaign that is also paired with elections happening across the country in about 100 days,” remarked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. “So the notion of a report coming out in 60 days when the threat environment is so high irrespective of party is not acceptable. This is not theater. This is not about jockeying. This is about the safety of some of the most highly targeted and valued targets. … It has been 10 days since the assassination attempt of a former president of the United States. There need to be answers.” Perhaps Cheatle’s most damning testimony occurred during the minutes allotted to Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. Using a timeline constructed mostly through news reports, Krishnamoorthi underscored the strangeness and incompetence of the Secret Service’s decision to allow the rally to continue and Trump to go onstage despite being alerted of Crooks and his suspicious behavior. “The shooter began shooting at 6:11 p.m. Eastern,” Krisnamoorthi began. “At 5:53 p.m., Secret Service notified snipers about the gunman. The rally wasn’t paused at that point, correct?” he asked. “No.” He then showed a widely circulated video of rallygoers attempting to alert authorities of a man crawling on the roof two minutes before the shooting. “That doesn’t look like ‘suspicious’ behavior, that looks like ‘threatening’ behavior to me. And the rally wasn’t paused at that point either, correct?” “We are currently still combing through communications and when communications were passed,” Cheatle said. “Well I can point you to this communication two minutes before the shots were ringing out,” he said, pointing to the screen. “Was there ever a moment the Secret Service considered pausing the rally? The answer is no, correct?” “I can speak to you in generalities,” she said. “No, no, I don’t want generalities. I want specifics.” In addition to these exchanges and bipartisan ire directed at Cheatle, some members in both parties took the opportunity to pursue peripheral issues, such as gun control and opposition to DEI initiatives. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., pressed Cheatle to admit that the prevalence of AR-15s makes the Secret Service’s life more difficult, which she refused to do. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., accused Republicans of “exploiting this moment to continue to attack progress towards racial justice and gender equity in America.” Despite these diversions, the gravity of the security failure remained uppermost in the minds of members following the meeting. “The Secret Service is an agency that can’t ever afford to fail,” Rep. Fallon told the Register, “and the attempted assassination of President Trump last Saturday proved to be a monumental, historic failure. Anyone else in her position in any other field would be fired on the spot. Cheatle must be held accountable and that starts with her firing.”","summary":"news","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/news/kimberly-cheatle-secret-service-failures","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20240722180720_89261033b07f86a35d8e7e1e340bc412d173c8ae4b36e508ecb81c3aebfc76ee.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:26:52","author":"Peter Laffin","authors":["Peter Laffin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":252380742,"title":"You think this Kamala Harris meme fell out of a coconut tree? How the VP became the pop girlie of the summer","text":"Ever since President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he would not seek reelection and instead threw his support behind his VP, the Kamala Harris memes have been flooding in — particularly one referencing coconut trees. As if this election cycle weren't strange enough, the mashing-up of Kamala Harris laughing about coconut trees with Charli XCX's \"Brat\" as a motivating force behind the presumed future Democratic nominee for president of these United States certainly adds another layer of WTF-ism. So what does it all mean? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Well, back in May, Veep was making a speech at a White House event for advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans. To really drive her point home about none of us \"living in a silo\" and \"everything\" being in \"context,\" Harris shared an anecdote about her mother. \"My mother...would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, 'I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'\" Harris said, laughing at her own joke in true Fun Aunt fashion. \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\" At the time, the internet had a field day with the clip, implying that the VP was drunk or high or both. But with the ascension of Donald Trump and the GOP, coinciding with the decline of Biden and the Democrats, the internet has redeemed the clip the best way it knows how: pop music. Seemingly overnight, industrious online nerds have mashed-up Harris' \"coconut\" speech with some of their fave pop girlies, including Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off,\" Britney Spears' \"Gimme More,\" and Charli XCX's bop of the summer, \"Brat.\" The Harris campaign even adopted Charli XCX's lime green \"Brat\" aesthetic for its X account, and the British singer-songwriter was quick to give it her presidential seal of approval, tweeting, \"kamala IS brat.\" Whether leaning into the pop girlie ecosystem will give Harris the edge to clinch the Democratic nomination and eventually the presidency remains to be seen — but, hey, we've got (checks blood pressure) three and a half months till the election. Who knows what other future-defining memes will spring forth from the ether?","summary":"We did it, brat.","url":"https://ew.com/explaining-the-kamala-harris-coconut-tree-meme-8681931","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/Z879VTB1FOyaEj2aajjXhLD2twk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kamala-Harris-072224-1fc9fc8a78954179af2f8ae8ed060078.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/C4NqOBcC-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:23:55","author":"Lester Fabian Brathwaite","authors":["Lester Fabian Brathwaite"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.208},{"id":252381386,"title":"What steps are you taking to address mortgage costs?

It’s a testament to how ingrained the platform has become among the power players of the political and media world, as well as users looking for news and live updates of major events. While Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, along with TikTok, boast far more users, X users say keeping up with the news is not the reason they use those platforms, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. X is the exception: most of the site’s users say following the news is a reason they use it and about half say they regularly get their news from there. “X is where history happens,” posted X CEO Linda Yaccarino on Sunday with a screenshot of Biden’s announcement. While a comment pointed out that the same message was posted on other social media platforms as well, the narrative remains an important one for X and its long-touted efforts to become a “digital town square.” “Other platforms have emerged with the goal of supplanting X, but what events like the Biden post shows is that this is still where people go to make both fast and consequential impact,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute. That’s even though the site has become a less reliable place to find accurate information, due in large part to changes Musk made since assuming the helm. Since the 2022 takeover, Musk has upended many of the former Twitter’s policies including around misinformation and hate speech, gutted its staff and transformed what people see on the site. “It does not appear as though would-be competitors have been able to displace Twitter from its perch as the go-to place for political news,” Kreps said. “In an ideal world, a lot of people would have and did try to go elsewhere but these alternatives needed to offer products that people want and use and they have not done that. Until that time, we’ll probably see a segment of users for whom their principles and practices are at odds.” As its owner and arguably most influential user, Musk has also used X to try to sway political discourse around the world — getting in a dustup with a Brazilian judge over censorship, railing against what he calls the “woke mind virus” and amplifying false claims that Democrats are secretly flying in migrants to vote in U.S. elections. Long before he endorsed Trump, Musk turned increasingly toward the right in his posts and actions on the platform. He’s reinstated previously banned accounts such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and former U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as accounts belonging to neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Advertisers who halted spending on X in response to antisemitic and other hateful material were engaging in “blackmail,” Musk has alleged. And it was on X that he announced he was moving the company’s headquarters, as well as those of SpaceX, to the red state of Texas from deep blue California. “The important thing about Twitter has long been the community of users who’ve embraced it. And there is a proliferation of journalists and elected officials and thought leaders who still use it today,” said Mark Jablonowski, chief technology officer at DSPolitical, a digital advertising firm that works for Democratic campaigns. “And it is an effective way of rapidly getting a message out to a large and influential group of people. However, that group is clearly waning. You are seeing users of the platform jumping ship, left and right. And as you are seeing the content become more and more extreme and unsuitable for general consumption.” Biden’s message Sunday was posted on X two minutes before it went up on Meta platforms such as Facebook and Threads. It’s not clear if this was intentional, and the campaign did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday. “It might have been just, you know, who hit enter first on the keyboard internally,” Jablonowski said. “But I think you definitely are seeing a world where five years ago, this might have been exclusively on Twitter, and now you’re seeing it across many different properties.” Political campaigns, he noted, need to meet voters where the voters are — and for many, that is still X. “Democrats still do appearances on Fox News,” he said. When it comes to advertising dollars, however, “the money is clearly going to Meta properties and YouTube. I don’t know, at least on the Democratic side, many, if any campaigns that are looking to spend advertising dollars on (X).”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA week after Elon Musk endorsed Donald Trump for president, President Joe&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Regardless of Musk supporting Trump, X is still a popular platform for Democrats first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/regardless-of-musk-supporting-trump-x-is-still-a-popular-platform-for-democrats/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/B6LM_gcqvDYYKTuiItMrc31UMac=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/C625INPO3ZB7PHXVGPAR6NGHBA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:21:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105}]}
