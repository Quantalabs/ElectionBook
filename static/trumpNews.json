He described the situation there as “a desperate situation” that needed immediate attention.\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged the difficulties faced by those in the Palestinian enclave and assured that the US would join forces with other nations to deliver additional humanitarian aid, such as food and sanitation, to the residents of Gaza.\n\nThe US President vowed to set up food centres across Gaza – insisting: “We want to get the children fed.”\n\nHe described the scenes as “terrible” – adding: “We have to help on a humanitarian basis.\n\n“You have a lot of starving people.\n\n“We’re going to set up food centres, and we’re going to do it in conjunction with some very good people.\n\n“We’re going to set up food centres where the people can walk in and no boundaries, we’re not going to have fences.”\n\nTrump said the UK and other nations were joining the effort as the crisis deepened.\n\nHe also distanced himself from comments made by Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who insisted there was no starvation in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu had said on Sunday: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza and there is no starvation in Gaza.”\n\nAsked if he agreed with the Israeli PM, Trump said: “I don’t know. I mean, based on television, I would say not, particularly because those children look very hungry.”\n\nHe went on to say that Israel has a lot of responsibility for what’s happening, but said that the country is hampered by considerations of the remaining hostages it wants to see kept alive and freed.\n\nTrump said the Hamas militant group had become difficult to deal with in recent days, but he was talking with Netanyahu about “various plans” to free hostages still being held.\n\nTrump said: “We’ve as you know given a lot of money to Gaza for food and everything else.\n\n“A lot of that money is stolen by Hamas and a lot of the food is stolen.\n\n“The whole place is a mess. It’ll get straightened out… Food and safety right now. Hamas did a horrible thing and they’ve paid a big price.”\n\nThe President said the priority was getting food to those who were starving and that he was in discussions with Israeli PM.\n\nHe added: “But I always said when you get down to the final 20 they won’t release them, because that’s like their shield. Very unfair.\n\n“So something’s going to have to be done. And they were really unwilling to talk.”\n\nSir Keir said the situation on the ground in Gaza was “absolutely intolerable” and described images of starving children as “revolting”.\n\nHe went on: “There is a sense of revulsion in the British public at what they are seeing.\n\n“We need to galvanise other countries in support of getting that aid in, and yes, that does involve putting pressure on Israel, because it absolutely is a humanitarian catastrophe.”\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres echoed his comments at a meeting boycotted by the US and Israel.\n\nHe said: “The wholesale destruction of Gaza is intolerable…and must stop.” \n\nThe prime minister wants Washington’s help in convincing Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and attempting to end what Downing Street called the unspeakable suffering and starvation.\n\nBritain, along with France and Germany, has criticised Israel for withholding essential humanitarian assistance as hunger spreads in Gaza.\n\nOver the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid after Israel temporarily eased restriction\n\nOn Monday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 14 people had died in the past 24 hours of starvation and malnutrition, bringing the war’s death toll from hunger to 147, including 89 children.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump has spoken of a mystery plan with Israel to end&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Unveils Secret &#8216;Plan&#8217; with Israel to Stop Gaza Conflict and Introduces Efforts to Provide Aid to Civilians Used by Hamas first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-unveils-secret-plan-with-israel-to-stop-gaza-conflict-and-introduces-efforts-to-provide-aid-to-civilians-used-by-hamas/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-reveals-mystery-‘plan-with-Israel-to-END-Gaza-war.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 01:41:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":346102808,"title":"‘Dog’s breakfast’: Karl pans US beef deal","text":"Trade Minister Don Farrell on Sunday said the US President raised the issue directly with Anthony Albanese in one of the three phone conversations the leaders shared.\n\nThe Prime Minister said that was incorrect, and on Tuesday Stefanovic put criticism of the beef deal to Labor frontbencher Amanda Rishworth.\n\n“I think he has clarified his comments,” Ms Rishworth said of Senator Farrell.\n\n“We’ve discussed it on this show, that Donald Trump made public his issues around beef imports and exports.

Agency employees may seek to \"persuade others of the correctness of their own religious views\" in the office, wrote Scott Kupor, director of the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. government's human resources agency. Supervisors can attempt to recruit their employees to their religion, so long as the efforts aren't \"harassing in nature,\" according to Kupor's statement. Agencies can't discipline their employees for declining to talk to their coworkers about their religious views. The statement represents the latest effort of the six-month-old Republican Trump administration to expand the role of religion in the federal workplace. Courts have long held that employers cannot suppress all religious expression in the workplace, but can lawfully curb conduct that is disruptive or imposes an undue hardship as long as it applies equally to members of any religion.Live Events The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protects individuals' rights to practice their religion while preventing the government from favoring one religion or another or religion in general. OPM in mid-July said agency workers can get permission to work from home or adjust their hours to accommodate religious prayers, after previously demanding that workers report to offices fulltime. The new statement cites President Donald Trump's February executive order calling on agencies to eliminate the \"anti-Christian weaponization of government.\" That order directs cabinet secretaries to identify federal actions hostile to Christians. Trump has embraced the conservative Christian world view and promoted policies that speak to concerns that their religious liberty is under attack. Federal employees can also set up prayer groups in the workplace, so long as they don't meet during work hours, Kupor's statement said. The memo references Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a law that prohibits workplace discrimination based on a person's religion or religious practices. Kupor in the memo said that means the law requires employers to allow workers to proselytize, organize prayer groups on non-working time, and display religious icons. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces Title VII, has said that proselytizing in the workplace can amount to unlawful religious harassment if it is unwelcome and is so severe or pervasive that it creates a hostile or abusive work environment. \"A consensual conversation about religious views, even if quite spirited, does not constitute harassment if it is not unwelcome,\" the agency said in a 2008 guidance document. Kupor's memo is not legally binding, and any court that reviews it could disagree about the scope of Title VII's protections. But the memo could be difficult to challenge directly in court, as judges in many past cases have said they lack the power to review internal agency documents.

The Financial Times reported on Monday that the US had paused curbs on tech exports to China to avoid disrupting trade talks with Beijing and support Trump’s efforts to secure a meeting with Xi this year. \n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, US senators from both major parties plan to introduce bills this week targeting China over its treatment of minority groups, dissidents, and Taiwan, emphasizing security and human rights, which could complicate talks in Stockholm. \n\nPrevious US-China trade talks in Geneva and London in May and June focused on bringing US and Chinese retaliatory tariffs down from triple-digit levels and restoring the flow of rare earth minerals halted by China and Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, and other goods halted by the United States. \n\nSo far, the talks have not delved into broader economic issues. They include US complaints that China’s state-led, export-driven model is flooding world markets with cheap goods, and Beijing’s complaints that US national security export controls on tech goods seek to stunt Chinese growth.","summary":"STOCKHOLM: Top US and Chinese economic officials met in Stockholm on Monday for more than five hours of talks aimed at resolving longstanding economic disputes at the centre of a trade war between the world’s top two economies, seeking to extend a truce by three months. \n\n\n\nUS Treasury Chief Scott Bessent was part of a US negotiating team that arrived at Rosenbad, the Swedish prime minister’s office in central Stockholm, in the early afternoon.

The framework deal, announced on Sunday between two economies accounting for almost a third of global trade, will see the U.S. impose a 15% import tariff on most EU goods from next month, but offers some protection for critical industries like cars and pharmaceuticals. That is half the rate Washington had threatened, though much more than Europeans hoped for. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought to leverage tariff threats to reshape global trade since returning to the White House this year, feted the accord on Sunday during a trip to Scotland, calling it \"the biggest deal ever made\". But France, Europe's second largest economy, poured scorn on the agreement.Live Events \"It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission,\" Prime Minister Francois Bayrou wrote on X. French President Emmanuel Macron made no public comment. While the mood among other European governments was decidedly sombre, most agreed that the failure to strike a deal would have been disastrous. \"This agreement has succeeded in averting a trade conflict that would have hit the export-orientated German economy hard,\" said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who heads the 27-nation EU bloc's largest economy. Speaking to journalists on Monday, the top trade official for the European Commission, which negotiates trade deals for the EU, said allowing the 30% tariffs to be imposed would have been \"much, much worse\". \"This is clearly the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances,\" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said. Several EU countries acknowledged that the deal establishes some certainty with Europe's biggest trading partner following months of turmoil, with Sweden, for example, calling it the \"least bad alternative\" and Spain backing it, albeit \"without enthusiasm.\" Any final deal is likely to need approval from EU capitals. STILL WORK TO DO Since managing trade falls under the responsibilities of the European Commission, unhappiness with the outcome of the months-long negotiations from countries like France will not scupper the framework agreement. But there is still work to be done. Many of the specifics of the agreement were not immediately known, but EU officials said they would be clarified in a joint statement that should be finalised by August 1. Further negotiations over the coming weeks will be held to reach a full-fledged deal. Even Germany said more work was necessary, including with regards to the steel sector. Trump said the deal, including an investment pledge topping the deal signed with Japan last week, would expand ties between the trans-Atlantic powers after years of what he called unfair treatment of U.S. exporters. Japan's package will consist of equity, loans and guarantees from state-run agencies of up to $550 billion to be invested at Trump's discretion, Tokyo says. EU officials, in contrast, said the EU's $600 billion investment pledge is based on the combined intended private-sector investments expressed by European companies. The deal will bring clarity for European makers of cars, planes and chemicals. But the EU had initially hoped for a zero-for-zero tariff deal. And the 15% baseline tariff, while an improvement on the threatened rate of 30%, compares to an average U.S. import tariff rate of around 2.5% last year before Trump's return to the White House. MORE CLARITY, BUT A CHALLENGE European stocks opened up on Monday, with the STOXX 600 touching a four-month high and all other major bourses also in the green. Tech and healthcare stocks led the way. \"The 15% rate is better than the market was fearing,\" said Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar. Still, European companies were left wondering whether to cheer or lament the accord. \"Those who expect a hurricane are grateful for a storm,\" said Wolfgang Große Entrup, head of the German Chemical Industry Association VCI. \"Further escalation has been avoided. Nevertheless, the price is high for both sides. European exports are losing competitiveness. U.S. customers are paying the tariffs,\" he said. Among the many questions that remain to be answered, however, is how the EU's promise to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. and steeply increase energy purchases can be turned into reality. It was not immediately clear if specific pledges of increased investments were made or whether the details still must be hammered out. And while the EU pledged to make $750 billion in strategic purchases over the next three years, including oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear fuel, the U.S. will struggle to produce enough to meet that demand. While U.S. LNG production capacity is due to almost double over the next four years it will still not be enough to ramp up supplies to Europe, and oil production is expected to be lower than previously forecast this year. Despite the lingering unknowns, analysts stressed the deal still helped decrease uncertainty.

Trading partners from the European Union to Japan to Vietnam appear to be acceding to the president's demands to accept higher costs - in the form of high tariffs - for the privilege of selling their wares to the United States. For Trump, the agreements, driven by a mix of threats and cajoling, are a fulfillment of a decades-long belief in protectionism and a massive gamble that it will pay off politically and economically with American consumers. On Sunday, the United States and the 27-member state European Union announced that they had reached a trade framework agreement: The EU agreed to accept 15% U.S. tariffs on most of its goods, easing fears of a catastrophic trans-Atlantic trade war. There were also commitments by the EU to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy products and make $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to the White House. \"We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,\" Trump said Monday. But there's no guarantee that Trump's radical overhaul of U.S. trade policy will deliver the happy ending he's promised. The framework agreement was exceedingly sparse on details. Most trade deals require months and even years of painstaking negotiation that rise and fall on granular details.Live Events High-stakes negotiations break Trump's way Financial markets, at first panicked by the president's protectionist agenda, seem to have acquiesced to a world in which U.S. import taxes - tariffs - are at the highest rates they've been in roughly 90 years. Several billion in new revenues from his levies on foreign goods are pouring into the U.S. Treasury and could somewhat offset the massive tax cuts he signed into law on July 4. Outside economists say that high tariffs are still likely to raise prices for American consumers, dampen the Federal Reserve's ability to lower interest rates, and make the U.S. economy less efficient over time. Democrats say the middle class and poor will ultimately pay for the tariffs. \"It's pretty striking that it's seen as a sigh of relief moment,\" said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut.\" The EU agreement came just four days after Japan also agreed to 15% U.S. tariffs and to invest in the United States. Earlier, the United States reached deals that raised tariffs on imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom considerably from where they'd been before Trump returned to the White House. More one-sided trade deals are likely as countries try to beat a Friday deadline, after which Trump will impose even higher tariffs on countries that refuse to make concessions. Trump's long-held theory now faces reality The U.S. president has long claimed that America erred by not taking advantage of its clout as the world's biggest economy and erecting a wall of tariffs, in effect making other countries ante up for access to America's massive consumer market. To his closest aides, Trump's use of tariffs has validated their trust in his skills as a negotiator and their belief that the economists who warned of downturns and inflation were wrong. The S&P 500 stock index was basically flat on Monday, but stocks have more than recovered from the tariff-induced selloff in April. \"Where are the 'experts' now?\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X. But the story is not over. For one thing, many of the details of Trump's trade deals remain somewhat hazy and have not been captured in writing. The U.S. and Japan, for instance, have offered differing descriptions of Japan's agreement to invest $550 billion in the United States. \"The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the U.S. favorable trade terms while accepting U.S. tariffs,\" said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist. \"However, certain terms of the deals, such as other countries' investments in the U.S., seem more promising in the abstract than they might prove in reality over time.'' Trump is also facing a court challenge from states and businesses arguing that the president overstepped his authority by declaring national emergencies to justify the tariffs on most of the world's economies. In May, a federal court struck down those tariffs. And an appeals court, which agreed to let the government continue collecting the tariffs for now, will hear oral arguments in the case Thursday. And he's yet to reach an accord with China - which has deftly used the threat of retaliatory tariffs and withholding exports of rare earth minerals that are desperately needed for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines to avoid caving in to Trump's demands. The U.S. and China are talking this week in Stockholm, Sweden. Economists remain skeptical of the impacts on US consumers There is also skepticism that tariffs will produce the economic boom claimed by Trump. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said \"the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,\" but not a recession. After all, the 15% tariffs on the EU and Japan are a slight increase from the 10% rate that Trump began charging in April during a negotiation period. While autos made in the EU and Japan will no longer face the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed, they will still face a 15% tax that has yet to appear in prices at U.S. dealerships. The administration has said the lack of auto price increases suggests that foreign producers are absorbing the costs, but it might ultimately just reflect the buildup of auto inventories to front-run the import taxes. \"Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,\" Morgan Stanley said in a separate note. \"Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.\" Economist Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of a \"slow-burn efficiency loss'' as U.S. companies scramble to adjust to Trump's new world. For decades, American companies have mostly paid the same tariffs - and often none at all - on imported machinery and raw materials from all over the world. Now, as a result of Trump's trade deals, tariffs vary by country. \"U.S. firms have to change their designs and get inputs from different places based on these variable tariff rates,'' she said. \"It's an incredible administrative burden. There's all these things that are acting as longer-term drags on economy, but their effect will show up only slowly.'' Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that the United States' effective tariff rate has risen to 17.5% from around 2.5% at the start of the year. \"I wouldn't take a victory lap,'' Zandi said. \"The economic damage caused by the higher tariffs will mount in the coming months.''(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpwhite housepeterson institute for international economicsmorgan stanleyworld economytrade wartrump tariffstrump's trade dealsfederal reserveeuropean union\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Their high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 unraveled due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea. Kim has since executed weapons tests to modernize and expand his nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong said she doesn’t deny the personal relationship between her brother and Trump “is not bad.” But she said if their personal relations are to serve the purpose of North Korea’s denuclearization, North Korea would view it as “nothing but a mockery.”\n\nShe said it was worth considering that the year is 2025, not 2018 or 2019 — which was during Trump’s first term — and any attempt to deny North Korea as a nuclear weapons state would be rejected.\n\n“If the U.S. fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK- U.S. meeting will remain as a ‘hope’ of the U.S. side,” Kim Yo Jong said, referring to her country by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nShe said she was responding to reported comments by a U.S. official that Trump is open to talks on denuclearization. She likely was referring to a Saturday article by Yonhap news agency that cited an unidentified White House official as saying Trump “remains open to engaging with Leader Kim to achieve a fully denuclearized North Korea.”\n\nMs. Kim Yo Jong is a key official on the Central Committee of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party. She handles the country’s relations with South Korea and the United States, and South Korean officials and experts believe she is the North’s second-most powerful person after her brother.\n\nExperts have said previously that North Korea would only be interested in talks on a partial surrender of its nuclear capability in return for sanctions relief and other benefits, while retaining some of its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe earlier Trump-Kim diplomacy collapsed after Trump rejected Kim’s calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step.\n\nOn Monday (July 28, 2025), Ms. Kim Yo Jong rebuffed overtures by South Korea’s new liberal government, saying its “blind trust” in the country’s alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor. \n\nHer comments imply that North Korea — now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia — sees no need to resume diplomacy with South Korea anytime soon.","summary":"The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has dismissed the U.S.’s intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea’s denuclearization","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-dismisses-us-intent-to-resume-diplomacy-on-denuclearisation/article69867794.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/jn6tuf/article69867795.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Koreas_Tensions_64497.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:55:04","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":346102220,"title":"US Treasury to borrow $1 trillion in third quarter to rebuild cash","text":"Representative image.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said on Monday it expects to borrow $1.007 trillion in the third quarter partly to replenish its cash balance that dwindled during the latest debt ceiling episode. The figure was $453 billion higher than its April estimate primarily due to the lower beginning-of-quarter cash balance and projected lower net cash flows. The third-quarter financing projection assumes cash of $850 billion at the end of September for the Treasury, the department said in a statement. Much higher borrowing in the third quarter were needed to rebuild the Treasury's cash balance following President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill being signed into law on July 4.

The Treasury's cash had dropped to $313 billion on July 3, data from money market research firm Wrightson ICAP showed. \"These (financing estimates) are in line with our projections and should not be a surprise to the markets since the increased financing need is almost all due to the shortfall in cash balances on September 30, which was a function of the debt limit,\" said Kim Rupert, managing director, global fixed income analysis at Action Economics,Live Events The Treasury also said it expects to borrow $590 billion in the fourth quarter, as it projects a cash balance of $850 billion at the end of December. In the second quarter, the Treasury said it borrowed $65 billion in privately-held marketable debt, ending the period with a cash balance of $457 billion.In April, Treasury had estimated borrowings of $514 billion and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $850 billion. The Treasury will unveil details of it borrowing estimates for the quarter on Wednesday when it announces its financing plans. It is widely expected that the Treasury will maintain current auction sizes for notes and bonds and will likely keep them steady for some time. Investors will be looking for guidance as to how long the Treasury can hold off not raising the size of the debt auctions used to fund the ballooning U.S. budget deficit.

Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha that there was no phone call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Trump during the tense phase with Pakistan after the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Mr. Trump has said on multiple occasions that he extracted a ceasefire from India and Pakistan by threatening to cut off trade if they continued fighting.\n\nYemen revokes Nimisha Priya’s death sentence, claims Kanthapuram\n\nThe execution of Malayali nurse Nimisha Priya, who is on a death row for the alleged murder of Yemeni national Talal Abdo Mahdi, has been revoked by the Houthi militia in Yemeni capital Sanaa, office of Sunni leader Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliar claimed. However, Indian officials handling the case did not confirm the development.\n\nIndia, Pakistan would still be at war if not for his intervention, Trump repeats ceasefire claim\n\nIndia and Pakistan would still be warring with each other, if not for his intervention, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The U.S. President made the remarks before beginning talks with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Trump Turnberry golf course in Scotland. The President also claimed, again, repeated his claim that he used trade as leverage to get New Delhi and Islamabad to stop fighting in early May this year, after terrorists opened fire and killed 26 civilians in Pahalgam. New Delhi has consistently denied Mr. Trump’s claims that he was instrumental in bringing about the May 10 ceasefire between the two countries.\n\nAt least 34 killed in heavy rains and flooding in and near Beijing \n\nHeavy rains and flooding killed 30 people in Beijing, China’s capital, the country’s state media reported on Tuesday (July 29, 2025), bringing the death toll from the storms in the region to at least 34. State broadcaster CCTV said that 28 people had died in Beijing’s hard-hit Miyun district and two others in Yanqing district as of midnight. Both are outlying parts of the sprawling city, far from the downtown.\n\nWhy did Justice Varma submit to in-house inquiry if it was contrary to Constitution, Supreme Court asks\n\nThe Supreme Court questioned High Court judge Justice Yashwant Varma’s choice to submit to an in-house inquiry procedure into an allegation of ‘burnt cash’ found at his official residential premises in Delhi, despite finding the procedure to be “completely contrary to the Constitutional scheme”. The query came after senior advocate Kapil Sibal complained that the action taken by the Supreme Court at the time, including release of sensitive visual and audio materials showing ‘burnt currency’, “convicted” Justice Varma in the public eye.\n\nOpposition questions government on security lapses which led to Pahalgam terror attack\n\nOpposition parties, led by the Congress, questioned the Centre over “security lapses” which had led to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. The parties also attacked the government over the sudden “ceasefire” declaration and as well as claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump on having brokered it. The Congress’s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, who opened the debate from Opposition ranks on the special discussion about “India’s strong, successful and decisive Operation Sindoor in response to the terror attack in Pahalgam”, said Home Minister Amit Shah should take responsibility for the security lapses.\n\nProtests over SIR continue; Rajya Sabha fails to function\n\nRajya Sabha failed to function as the Opposition MPs continued to protest over the issue of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar.

Fourteen of these notices were on SIR exercise. \n\nPresidential Reference ‘misleading’, wants Supreme Court to sit on appeal against its own verdict in T.N. Governor case, says Kerala to Supreme Court\n\nThe States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala urged the Supreme Court to dismiss the Presidential Reference seeking clarity on whether judiciary can fix timelines for the President and State Governors to clear State Bills, saying it is a ruse to make the apex court sit in appeal of its own authoritative pronouncement in the Tamil Nadu Governor case. The Constitution, both States said, did not allow the apex court to sit in appeal of its own judgments, nor can the President vest appellate jurisdiction in the court through a Presidential Reference. Tamil Nadu and Kerala termed the Reference as “misleading” replete with “suppressed facts”.\n\nWest Bengal’s 2002 SIR electoral roll appears on CEO site amidst speculations of fresh voter list revision\n\nAmid speculations of a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) being conducted for West Bengal’s electoral roll, the 2002 voters’ list of some districts has been made available online on the website of the State’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO). Reportedly, the last SIR of the voters’ list in West Bengal was conducted in 2002. This development assumes significance considering that in Bihar, the last SIR was conducted in 2003 and the electoral roll of that year has been kept as a reference point for the submission of identification documents for the SIR of 2025. \n\nAssam govt prepares for mega eviction drive in Golaghat, to affect 2,000 families\n\n The Assam government is preparing to clear more than 10,000 bigha (over 3,300 acre) of land from alleged encroachments in Golaghat district, which will affect at least 2,000 families, officials said.

This slowdown was driven by the mining sector, which saw its worst performance in 58 months, and also by contractions in the electricity and primary goods sectors.

Mr. Anwar, who chaired the talks as head of the ASEAN regional bloc, said both sides have reached a common understanding to take steps to return to normalcy. Earlier, ceasefire talks have started between Thailand and Cambodian leaders in Malaysia in an urgent effort to resolve deadly border clashes that entered a fifth day despite mounting international calls for peace.\n\nSupreme Court takes suo motu cognisance of report over dog bites leading to rabies\n\nThe Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of a media report about incidents of dog bites leading to rabies. A bench of Justices J.B. Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan termed the news item published today in an English daily's Delhi edition as \"very disturbing and alarming\". It said every day, hundreds of dog bites were being reported in the city and on its outskirts, leading to rabies and ultimately, children and the aged were falling prey to the dreadful disease.\n\nFIDE Women’s World Cup: Divya Deshmukh is the first Indian woman champion, becomes Grandmaster\n\nDivya Deshmukh is the World Cup winner.

As we close out the month, macro liquidity trends and further signals from U.S. policymakers could dictate short-term momentum,” he added.\n\nTom Bruni, editor-in-chief & VP of community at Stocktwits, also weighed in on this matter, stating via email that bitcoin has been “Consolidating tightly between $115,500 and $120,500 over the past two weeks. Given the broader trend is to the upside, bulls expect this consolidation to resolve higher and target roughly $140,000.\"\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n“If this consolidation resolves lower by closing below $115,500, that would suggest the short-term momentum in Bitcoin has been lost and that a retest of the $105 to $110,000 range is likely,” he added.\n\n“All eyes are on the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and the remainder of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ earnings on Wednesday and Thursday to set the tone for the market through August and into September,” Bruni concluded.\n\nDoug Colkitt, a founding contributor at Fogo, took a different tack, focusing on how vulnerable the markets are to notable movements either upward or downward.\n\n“The market’s at an inflection point. Volatility is compressing, leverage is building, and the order books are getting thinner across major venues,” he stated.\n\n“That’s a classic setup for a sharp move in either direction,” Colkitt continued.\n\n“From a structure standpoint, keep an eye on open interest across perp markets and funding rates. If those flip hard, we could be looking at a classic liquidation cascade,” he added.\n\n“But if spot ETF demand holds steady, any dip might get aggressively bought,” Colkitt noted.\n\nWhen looking at key developments toward the end of this month, policy updates will be crucial, noted the YouTuber who goes by Wendy O.\n\n“As of right now, Bitcoin is currently having a little pullback which means number is going down but this past Sunday we had the highest Bitcoin weekly close ever at around $119,000,” she stated.\n\n“We also are expected to get some updates regarding the White House’s Crypto policy on July 30 along with a decision from the Fed regarding rates, which could cause some upward price action as this may be interpreted by the market as positive fundamentals,” the analyst added.\n\nDouro Labs CEO Mike Cahill also offered this perspective, indicating that “As we wrap up the month, institutional flows are going to be a key signal to watch.”\n\n“Bitcoin is increasingly trading like a macro asset, so investors should pay close attention to real-world rate expectations, ETF inflows, and post-earnings positioning in risk markets,” he emphasized.\n\n“The bigger picture here is that Bitcoin has officially become part of the traditional portfolio allocation conversation. As more institutions look to balance exposure between cash, equities, and digital assets, Bitcoin’s price will respond accordingly,” Cahill predicted.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Bitcoin analysts singled out crucial developments that market observers should monitor as July, which has been a big month for the crypto industry, comes to a close.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/07/28/bitcoin-analysts-highlight-key-factors-to-watch-as-july-winds-down/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/631a37dcd6ebad0b609de218/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:32:33","author":"Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,Senior Contributor,Wendy O","authors":["Charles Lloyd Bovaird II","Senior Contributor","Wendy O"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.01},{"id":346104982,"title":"North Korea says Trump must accept new nuclear reality","text":"North Korea said on Tuesday the United States must accept that reality has changed since the countries' summit meetings in the past, and no future dialogue would end its nuclear programme, state media KCNA reported.\n\nKim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who is believed to speak for his brother, said she conceded that the personal relationship between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump \"is not bad.\"\n\nBut if Washington intended to use a personal relationship as a way to end the North's nuclear weapons programme, the effort would only be the subject of \"mockery,\" Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by KCNA.\n\n\"If the U.S. fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK-U.S. meeting will remain as a 'hope' of the U.S. side,\" she said.

Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes, that have killed at least 35 people and displaced more than 260,000 people on both sides. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand shut all border crossings with Cambodia, with an exception for migrant Cambodian workers returning home.\n\nTroops from both sides reported ongoing fighting yesterday along border areas. Gunfire could be heard as dawn broke in Samrong in Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchey province, Associated Press reporters covering the conflict said.\n\nMaly Socheata, a Cambodian defense ministry spokesperson, said the Thai assault was “ongoing and strong” yesterday.\n\nAnwar said late Sunday that both sides would present their conditions for peace but “what is important is immediate ceasefire.”\n\n“I hope this can work,” Anwar was quoted as saying by Malaysian national news agency Bernama. “Although it’s not as bad as many other countries, we have to put a stop (to the violence).”\n\nThe meeting followed direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has warned that the United States may not proceed with trade deals with either country if hostilities continue.\n\nBefore departing for Kuala Lumpur, Phumtham told reporters in Bangkok that representatives from China and the U.S. will also attend as observers. He said the key focus would be on an immediate ceasefire, but noted trust could be an issue as Cambodia has not stopped its strikes.\n\n“We have informed that we don’t have trust in Cambodia. All they have done reflect that they are not sincere in solving this problem. So they have to show the detail how they will do to prove their sincerity,” he said.\n\nOfficials later said that the Chinese and American ambassadors to Malaysia are attending the meeting.\n\nThe violence marks a rare instance of open military confrontation between ASEAN member states, a 10-nation regional bloc that has prided itself on non-aggression, peaceful dialogue and economic cooperation.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, ASEAN foreign ministers reiterated concern over the rising death toll, destruction of public properties and displacement of a large number of people along the disputed border areas. They urged the two countries to resolve their disputes through negotiations and expressed support for efforts to find a middle ground during yesterday’s talks.\n\nThe conflict also drew the attention of Pope Leo XIV. At the Vatican on Sunday, the pontiff said he was praying for all those affected by war in the world, including “for those affected by the clashes on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, especially the children and displaced families.”\n\nAt an evacuation shelter in Cambodia’s Siem Reap province far away from the border, Ron Mao, 56, prays for a ceasefire deal during the leaders’ meeting. She and her family fled their home a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the front line when fighting broke out Thursday. They took refuge in a shelter but moved again to another camp further away after hearing artillery shelling.\n\n“I don’t want to see this war happen. It’s very difficult and I don’t want to run around like this,” she said, “When I heard our Prime Minister go to negotiate for peace, I would be very happy if they reached the deal as soon as possible, so that I and my children can return home as soon as possible.”\n\nThai evacuees shared the sentiment.\n\n“I beg the government. I want it to end quickly,” said farmer Nakorn Jomkamsing at an evacuation camp in Surin hosting more than 6,000 people. “I want to live peacefully. I miss my home, my pets, my pigs, dogs and chicken,” the 63-year-old woman said.\n\nThe 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The latest tensions erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand’s domestic politics.\n\nEILEEN NG, JINTAMAS SAKSORNCHAI, PUTRAJAYA , MDT/AP","summary":"Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire from midnight to resolve deadly border clashes, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday.

Dozens were killed while seeking food, even as Israel moved to ease restrictions on the entry of aid. Under mounting pressure over the spiralling hunger crisis in Gaza, Israel said over the weekend that the military would pause operations in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and Muwasi for 10 hours a day and designate secure routes for aid delivery. International airdrops of aid have also resumed.

Aid agencies say the new measures are not enough to counter worsening starvation in the territory. Martin Penner, a spokesperson for the UN food agency, told The Associated Press that all 55 of its aid trucks that entered on Sunday were unloaded by crowds before reaching their destination. Another UN official said nothing on the ground has changed and no alternative routes were allowed.

Israel said it would continue military operations alongside the new humanitarian measures. Newborn dies after complex surgery A baby girl died hours after being delivered in a complex emergency cesarean. She had been placed in an incubator and was breathing with assistance from a ventilator, AP footage showed. Her mother, Soad al-Shaer, who had been seven months pregnant with her, was among 12 Palestinians killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house and neighboring tents in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Another strike hit a two-story house in Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, more than half of them women and children, according to the hospital. At least five others were killed in strikes elsewhere in Gaza, according to other hospitals. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on most of the strikes. It said it was not aware of one strike in Gaza City during the pause that health officials said killed one person. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas. The daily airstrikes across the territory frequently kill women and children. Israel allows more aid to enter Images of emaciated children have sparked outrage around the world, including from Israel's close allies. US President Donald Trump on Sunday called the images of emaciated and malnourished children in Gaza “terrible.” Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages. Israel partially lifted those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead on a new US-backed aid delivery system that has been wreaked by chaos and violence. Traditional aid providers have encountered a breakdown in law and order surrounding their deliveries. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid shipments, said UN agencies collected 120 trucks for distribution on Sunday and that another 180 trucks had been allowed into Gaza. The United Nations and aid groups say the territory needs 500-600 trucks a day to meet its needs. Israel's blockade and military operations have destroyed nearly all food production in the territory of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Aid groups say airdrops are ineffective Also on Monday, two air force planes from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates airdropped 17 tons of humanitarian aid in Gaza — an amount that would fill less than a single aid truck. Aid groups say airdrops are often ineffective and dangerous, with falling parcels landing on people or in combat zones or other dangerous areas. “At the moment, 2 million people are trapped in a tiny piece of land, which makes up just 12% of the whole strip — if anything lands in this area, people will inevitably be injured,” said Jean Guy Vataux, emergency coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders. “If the airdrops land in areas where Israel has issued displacement orders, people will be forced to enter militarized zones — once again risking their lives for food,” he added. Dozens killed seeking aid, officials say. At least 25 people were killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from a truck convoy passing through the southern Gaza Strip, according to health officials and witnesses. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Four children were among those killed, according to records at Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. The shooting occurred in a military corridor Israel has carved out between the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. It was not immediately clear who had supplied the convoy. Survivors at the hospital said Israeli forces had fired toward the crowds. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid since May, according to the UN human rights office, witnesses and local health officials. The Israeli military has said it only fires warning shots at people who approach its forces. The Awda hospital in central Gaza said it received the bodies of seven Palestinians who it said were killed by Israeli fire close to an aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor. Fares Awad, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service, said at least five Palestinians were killed and about 30 others were wounded by Israeli gunfire while waiting for aid trucks from the Zikim Crossing near Gaza City. Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. They still hold 50, and Israel believes that more than half the remaining hostages are dead. Most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 59,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Its count doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The UN and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MOLLY CLAYTON SHOWBUSINESS CORRESPONDENT \n Published:01:13 BST, 29 July 2025 |Updated:01:23 BST, 29 July 2025 \n\nIt's been a busy 2025 for influencer and former Love Islander, Molly-Mae Hague.\nIn the first four months of the year, the 26-year-old enjoyed a skiing trip to the Swiss resort of St Moritz, city breaks in Budapest, Paris and Dubai, and even a family holiday to Centre Parcs with her partner Tommy Fury and their daughter Bambi, two.\nLittle wonder, then, if the reality TV star wanted a quieter summer... Or perhaps not.\nLast week Molly-Mae sparked an online backlash after posting a video on YouTube in which she complained that she's 'not done one fun thing all summer'.\nSpeaking to her sister Zoe Rae (herself no stranger to controversy this season after announcing she was disappointed by the tropical island paradise of Bali and left after just 48 hours) from her £4million mansion in Cheshire, Molly-Mae said: 'I said to someone the other day, that I am going to make it to the end of summer having not done one fun thing. \n\nMolly-Mae Hague, 26, tearfully broke her silence following recent backlash from fans who once again branded the millionaire influencer 'out of touch'\n\nTaking to Instagram the Love Island star shared a pictured of herself relaxing in first class as she jetted off to Dubai in May\n\nMolly-Mae was seen in a £294,000 on a new convertible Bentley in Cheshire just days ago, which she revealed had been lent to her for a month by the brand\n'I haven't socialised once. I haven't done one social, fun thing... I haven't a life.'\nUnsurprisingly, the comments didn't go down well with her two million-plus YouTube subscribers who said she was 'out of touch', 'tone-deaf' and 'always moaning'.\nOne former fan summed up the controversy by pointing to her slew of holidays and brand endorsements this year, writing: 'She's a millionaire. She can literally wake up tomorrow and do whatever the hell she wants.'\nOn Sunday, Molly-Mae gave a tearful defence in a separate video: 'I don't care who tells me I am out of touch with reality or all this stuff that's going on on TikTok at the minute... I don't care. I'm not going to not talk about it.'\nBut how tedious have the past three months really been for Molly-Mae? Here MOLLY CLAYTON takes a look at her summer schedule to decide if it's been fun or fuss filled.\nSEVEN-FIGURE LAUNDRY DEAL\nMolly-Mae started strong this summer by signing a seven-figure deal with consumer goods firm Unilever and starring in a new campaign for its detergent brand, Persil and Comfort, in May.\nShe fronted a new 'delicate' fragrance range with her toddler Bambi, who made her campaign debut in a fluffy pink jumper and ballerina tutu.\nPutting her name behind their 'Heaven Scent' non-bio capsules, fabric conditioner and a scent booster elixir, Molly-Mae said: 'I can be really protective of what I use at home, especially since having Bambi.\n'My skin's always been sensitive, so I need products I know are kind to my skin but still leave everything smelling amazing and this range honestly does both.'\n\nMolly-Mae started strong this summer by signing a seven-figure deal with consumer goods firm Unilever and starring in a new campaign for its detergent brand, Persil and Comfort, in May\n\nShe is also the owner of her 'dream car' a Mercedes-AMG G 63 Magno Edition, purchased in 2022 to the tune of £193,000\nQUEEN Of THE TV SCREEN\nOn May 9, she released the second part of her documentary series, Molly-Mae: Behind It All.\nThe first three episodes, which were released in January, made headlines after showcasing her split from boxer Tommy Fury – whom she'd met on ITV dating show Love Island – and her new life as a single mother.\nThe second part showed the aftermath of their New Year's Eve reunion as they gave their relationship another shot.\nPromoting the Amazon Prime show on her Instagram, Molly-Mae said she was 'overwhelmed' by the response.

A hint – if ever there was one - that filming for the second series was about to begin...\n\nAlso in May she began filming the second season of her Amazon Prime documentary, Behind It All \n\nMolly Mae shared her delight as the second series filming kicked off\n\nDETOUR TO DUBAI\nIt wasn't all work though as Molly-Mae jetted off on her sixth holiday of the year – once again to Dubai.\n\n Molly-Mae Hague complains about £86k motorhome holiday that left her 'having a breakdown' - after her sister Zoe's Bali trip fiasco \nShe and Tommy travelled business class to one of the most luxurious hotels in the UAE, the five-star Jumeirah Al Naseem, where rooms cost a whopping £13,897 per night.\nThe hotel has its own private 2km beach, a turtle rehabilitation sanctuary and an infinity pool – which the couple were pictured canoodling in.\nFARMHOUSE CHIC\nIf that wasn't enough time away from home, that month Molly-Mae also visited private members' club Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds.\nShe's not the first celebrity to be drawn to the £500-a-night retreat, with the Beckhams, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Taylor Swift also fans.\nMolly-Mae treated herself to a couple of nights in one of the cabins, where members can enjoy spa facilities, country bike rides and tennis.\n\nIt wasn't all work though as Molly-Mae jetted off on her sixth holiday of the year – once again to Dubai (pictured)\n\nSome of her summer plans have also included her boyfriend Tommy whisking her and Bambi off on a 'surprise staycation' in the Cotswolds\n\nMolly-Mae jetted off on a private jet to Disneyland Paris for a family holiday as she celebrated her 26th birthday\n\nShe shared pictures from inside the jet alongside photos complete with birthday cake, balloons and plenty of Minnie Mouse ears\nROYAL DISNEY TREATMENT\nFor her final trip in May, Molly flew on a private jet to Disneyland Paris to celebrate her 26th birthday alongside Tommy, their daughter and some of her best friends.\nShe shared pictures from inside the jet alongside photos complete with birthday cake, balloons and plenty of Minnie Mouse ears.\nGRAND EUROPEAN TOUR\nCome June, Molly told her YouTube followers she was jetting off yet again.

The U.S. president has repeatedly voiced exasperation with Putin for continuing attacks on Ukraine despite U.S. efforts to end the war.\n\nBefore returning to the White House in January, Trump, who views himself as a peacemaker, had promised to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict within 24 hours.\n\nTrump has threatened new sanctions on Russia and buyers of its exports unless an agreement is reached by early September.\n\nBut the president, who has also expressed annoyance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has not always followed up on his tough talk about Putin with action, citing what he deems a good relationship that the two men have had previously.\n\n\"We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,\" Trump said. \"And I say that's not the way to do it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill and Andrea Shalal in Scotland; additional reporting by Jeff Mason and William James; writing by Susan Heavey and Jeff Mason; editing by Doina Chiacu and Mark Heinrich)\n\n© (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was reducing the 50-day deadline he gave Russia over its war in Ukraine, underscoring his frustration with Russian President Vladimir…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-says-he-is-reducing-50-day-deadline-for-russia-on-war-in-ukraine","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/cc/55/db2c9d67ba17ba3ca6fdcb9e30aed17fedfc/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:23:21","author":"Andrew Macaskill,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Andrew Macaskill","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":346098460,"title":"University of California admits record number of students","text":"The University of California admitted a record 100,947 new first-year college students from California for the upcoming school year, a more than 7% bump from last year. The premier higher education system also admitted 22,230 international students, even as the Trump administration has created additional barriers to their attendance.\n\n“We continue to experience significant growth — a clear indication that Californians recognize the value of a UC degree,” said UC President Michael Drake, who is expected to leave his role at the end of July to return to research and teaching. “Our latest admissions numbers demonstrate that families across our state recognize that UC degrees prepare students for a lifetime of meaningful contributions in their communities and far beyond.”\n\nAccording to preliminary admission data released Monday, the highly regarded system accepted nearly 73% of all applicants. The university also offered admission to 17% more international students, who typically pay full freight.\n\nThe increases come amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration — with stricter visa screening and application processes, a travel ban and a flurry of student visa revocations — which has raised concerns about a decline in international student enrollment at universities across the country. The University of California also faces rising financial pressures from federal research funding cuts and proposed state budget cuts.\n\nAn April lawsuit filed by the California attorney general and 15 other states against the National Institutes of Health and other parties contends NIH has ended $37 million in research funds to UC, which announced a systemwide hiring freeze in March in response to the administration’s threats to slash funding.\n\nEarlier this spring, UC officials told state lawmakers that the system would be forced to enroll fewer new California students if the state went through with an 8% cut to the university’s budget, as proposed in the governor’s January budget proposal. Gov. Gavin Newsom reduced that cut to 3% in the May budget revision.\n\nAs well as increasing the number of admitted international students, UC also admitted 9% more non-California resident applicants — a change that comes as UC raised nonresident tuition fees by more than $3,400 last year. The university has said very limited UC financial aid is available for students from states outside of California, while international students are generally ineligible for student loans and eligible for very few scholarships.\n\nOverall, UC admitted 180,382 students for fall 2025 — a nearly 32% increase from last year. That total includes transfer students as well as first-time college students.\n\nUC Berkeley — with a roughly 13% acceptance rate — admitted a little over 20,000 students total, up more than 47% from last year’s 13,639 admitted students. About 10% of Cal’s first-year admitted students were international students and the total number of admitted first-year international students — 1,463 — nearly doubled from last year’s 735 students.\n\nCal said in a statement Monday that the university’s admissions target for international students was set in October 2024 — before President Donald Trump was re-elected.\n\n“We’re pleased that we were able to offer admission to more exceptional students this year — both domestic and international — while maintaining our high academic standards,” said university spokesperson Aileen Zerrudo. “We continue to see strong interest from students around the world who want to be part of Berkeley’s singular academic community and we look forward to welcoming an accomplished incoming class.”\n\nUC Santa Cruz admitted nearly 57,100 students for fall 2025 — about a 73% acceptance rate — and about 10,000 more students than last year. Approximately 10% of the university’s first-year admitted students were international students, with 4,836 students offered admission — slightly lower than last year’s 5,249 students.\n\nUC Santa Cruz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from this news organization.\n\nUC acknowledged that the percentage of students who accept an admission offer and choose to enroll is much lower for non-California and international students than California students. Only about 26% of UC Berkeley’s accepted international students enrolled for the fall 2024 semester, while UC Santa Cruz saw a little more than 4% of accepted international students enroll. The UC system overall saw a little over 21% of accepted international students enroll.\n\nThe new data shows UC admitted about 77% of all first-year California student applicants for the fall 2025 semester and the number of admitted students from lower-income families, transfers from California community colleges and first-generation students continued to rise.\n\nAbout 42% of accepted first-year California students are considered first-generation college students, including 32% at UC Berkeley and 30% at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nDespite the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and insistence that schools remove any “racial preferencing” from admissions or hiring decisions, the data showed increases in admitted students of all racial groups: Black, Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, white and “unknown.”","summary":"The admission increases come as the the University of California faces rising financial pressures from federal research funding cuts and proposed state budget cuts.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/28/uc-admission-rate-california-students/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SJM-L-AFFINITYGRAD-XXXX-03.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:19:26","author":"Molly Gibbs","authors":["Molly Gibbs"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":346103122,"title":"This is the 'source' of Gaza's humanitarian problem: Marc Thiessen","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report July 28, 2025 07:52 \n\n This is the 'source' of Gaza's humanitarian problem: Marc Thiessen \n 'Special Report' panelists analyze the status of President Donald Trump's tariff deals and aid to Gaza.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTV-VIDEODONALD TRUMPTRADETRADEEUROPEEUROPE TRAVELNORTH KOREAWHITE HOUSEAIDMIDDLE EAST POLICIESMIDDLE EAST","summary":"&apos;Special Report&apos; panelists analyze the status of President Donald Trump&apos;s tariff deals and aid to Gaza.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376260340112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/96cdb26e-c5f6-463a-a730-e037a11cf415/a6431ee4-da58-4d20-9c3a-923f47a5bb68/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:18:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":346105598,"title":"'Absolutely unprecedented': FCC commissioner sounds alarm over Trump's 'censorship' of CBS","text":"The lone Democratic appointee on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now openly condemning President Donald Trump's administration over what she alleges is a \"campaign of censorship and control\" against a major media outlet.\n\nDuring a Monday interview on MSNBC's \"The Beat with Ari Melber,\" FCC commissioner Anna Gomez — who was appointed to her position by former President Joe Biden — slammed both the Trump administration and FCC chairman Brendan Carr for the conditions imposed on CBS prior to approving parent company Paramount's merger with Skydance.

Gomez, who was put onto the three-member commission in 2023, said the circumstances surrounding the merger were \"absolutely unprecedented.\"\n\n\"The First Amendment and the Communications Act prohibits the FCC from censoring broadcasters,\" Gomez said. \"And in this case, what you saw was Paramount agreeing to self-censor based on content that this administration doesn't like.

However, she called on Americans to \"stand up and push back\" against the administration's \"attempt to censor and control\" media companies. She warned that Trump will \"use any leverage of power that it has to force corporations to bend to its will,\" adding that it was \"particularly worrisome\" for the state of democracy in the United States for a president to bully the free press into silencing dissent within its own ranks.\n\nThe Democratic FCC appointee's remarks come on the heels of Carr announcing on far-right network Newsmax that, as part of its settlement agreement, Paramount agreed to have a government-appointed \"bias monitor\" rein in criticism of Trump at CBS.

It also threatens to adversely impact recruitment and retention of highly-qualified employees of faith,” the memo reads. “The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution robustly protects expressions of religious faith by all Americans—including Federal employees.”\n\n“This memorandum provides guidance to agencies on robustly protecting and enforcing each Federal employee’s right to engage in religious expression in the Federal workplace consistent with the U.S. Constitution, Title VII, and other applicable sources of law,” Kupor wrote. “Agencies should allow personal religious expression by Federal employees to the greatest extent possible unless such expression would impose an undue hardship on business operations. And they should review and (if necessary) revise their internal policies to ensure that they appropriately protect religious expression.”\n\nKupor detailed several examples of religious expression that are allowed for federal employees, including displaying and reading Bibles, displaying crosses, mezuzahs, religious artwork and jewelry, and more, on their person and in their assigned workspaces.\n\nKupor noted that agencies “may restrict all posters, but an agency may not single out religious posters, such as those of a crucifix, a Bible verse, or a Star of David, for harsher treatment.”\n\n“An employee may wear a cross, as well as clothing displaying a religious message,” he continued. \n\nThe memo also details examples of how federal employees are allowed to have conversations about religion.\n\n“During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,” he wrote. “However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.” \n\n“An employee may invite another to worship at her church despite belonging to a different faith,” he continued. “On a bulletin board meant for personal announcements, a supervisor may post a hand-written note inviting each of his employees to attend an Easter service at his church.”\n\nThe memo additionally gives examples of how federal workers can interact with members of the public, including “a park ranger leading a tour through a national park may join her tour group in prayer,” and “a doctor at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital may pray over his patient for her recovery.”\n\nKupor noted that agencies may “reasonably regulate the time, place and manner of all employee speech, provided such regulations do not discriminate based on content or viewpoint (including religious viewpoints).”\n\nThe memo follows a July 16 memo to all agencies, notifying them that telework could be used to help with religious accommodations for some federal employees, including those who are fasting or observing holidays. The memo also told agencies that religious accommodations can include adjusting schedules around time-specific religious practices. \n\nThe Monday memo was sent in accordance with President Donald Trump’s executive orders “Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias,” and establishing a “Religious Liberty Commission.” President Trump also signed an executive order in February creating a White House Faith Office.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

But then it was like, ‘Oh, you know what? I feel like there’s something to trying to build a stand-up career and trying to do other things.’”\n\nThe airing of Meyers’ revelation came in light of CBS’ decision to cancel Stephen Colbert’s long-running “The Late Show” in the days following the host’s criticisms of Paramount’s $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump. Meyers’ “Armchair Expert” episode was recorded prior to the news of “The Late Show’s” cancelation. \n\nWhile CBS maintained that the show was canceled for “financial” reasons, the move led to widespread speculation that Trump pushed the hands of the network’s executives. Most recently, the president’s camp stated that “The View” could be the next show to be “pulled off air,” only charging up theories about Trump’s supposed involvement.\n\nMeyers said that at a certain point, the decision is above him. \n\n“I feel like I shifted from fearing that I wouldn’t be good enough, and now my fear is weirdly more outside of my control, which is … just at some point, the ecosystem might not support [late night],” Meyers said.\n\n“I guess that’s better than thinking it’s your fault, but it is weird to not feel any control over it,” he went on, sharing that he believes “this isn’t the best time” to be in late night. “If there’s a breakthrough over the 11 years of doing the show, [it’s] just show up and do the work. That’s the only part they’re paying you to do. It’s the only part you’re good at. All the other problems, we have people that are as good at that as you are at the thing you do — and don’t mess around with it.”\n\nMeyers explained that this wouldn’t be his first rodeo when it comes to facing challenges with his talk show, noting that some executives weren’t too convinced from the jump that he would last.\n\n“Whatever time we’re living in now, I’ve had lower points in the body of the show,” he said, “Early on in the show, we had some NBC executives actually say to us, ‘We’re very worried about how the show’s going to go.’”\n\nAt the end of the day, Meyers said he’s grateful he’s been able to build a legacy that people respect and enjoy.\n\n“I sometimes take stock of, oh, this isn’t the best time to be doing what I’m doing, but at least I got in,” he shared. “I think the body of my work matters enough that the world knows Seth Meyers in a way that I’m happy with … I’ve taken my opportunity to build a thing. I know what it means, and I think other people know what it means.

Cooper, who received an undergraduate and law degrees from the University of North Carolina, served four terms as attorney general from 2001 to 2017.\n\nHe was elected to the North Carolina House and Senate from 1987 to 2001.\n\n\"I never really wanted to go to Washington,\" Cooper said in the video. \"I just wanted to serve the people of North Carolina, right here where I've lived all my life. But these are not ordinary times.\"\n\nHis announcement focused on the middle class.\n\n\"For too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. I'm running for Senate because it's time for that to change.\"\n\nCooper, the son of a small-town lawyer and farmer, said it didn't used to be that way.\n\n\"It wasn't always this hard, because being in the middle class meant something,\" he said. \"You could afford a home, your kids went to good schools, your job paid enough to cover the basics, and most summers, you could get away for a few days.

This came after several controversies involving CBS, which Paramount owns, such as a lawsuit settlement with President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” segment and canceling “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n\nBased on the newly formed company Paramount Skydance Corp., the former “CBS Evening News” anchor suggested the network she was a part of could lose all of its independence.\n\n“I fear the end of CBS as I knew it,” Chung said on “CNN News Central.” “CBS was always a standalone network. It was autonomous. The news division was autonomous, and it was always unencumbered by pressures from politicians, including presidents, and unencumbered by bean counters. But now? I can see very clearly that the days that I remembered are long gone.”\n\nShe continued, “Honest, unbiased, fact-based journalism is being tainted and those who practiced that journalism, like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, that kind of journalism has disappeared. I also fear that gone are the days of Frank Stanton, who was the president of CBS, who defended the rights of the journalism, the First Amendment, the fourth estate before Congress, and he represented all journalists in many ways.”\n\nChung placed more blame on Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison for having “tainted journalism” with their “greed.” She also called out company’s pledge to not implement any new DEI initiatives as an insult to her and other women and minorities at CBS.\n\nSeveral journalists have accused CBS and Paramount of acquiescing to Trump ahead of the merger through its settlement and cancellations, including Chung.\n\n“I have difficulty believing what they claim, which is that the ‘60 Minutes’ agreement had nothing to do with the merger, or a settlement had nothing to do with the merger, and also that the disappearance of Steve [sic] Colbert had nothing to do — it had only to do with financial issues. It all smells,” Chung said.\n\nParamount has been facing an intense backlash for its recent decisions, even from some of its own employees.\n\nVeteran “60 Minutes” producer Rome Hartman told Fox News Digital earlier this month that he thought the company’s settlement with Trump was a “cowardly capitulation by the corporate leaders of Paramount” and a “fundamental betrayal” of CBS News. \n\nSenators Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also sent a letter to Ellison demanding answers about the Trump settlement and the Colbert cancellation, suggesting anti-bribery laws may have been broken in order for the merger to proceed with FCC approval. \n\nFox News’ Joseph Wulfsohn and Brian Flood contributed to this report.","summary":"Former CBS anchor Connie Chung warned on CNN Friday that the recent merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media could be the \"end\" of journalism as she once knew it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/media/former-cbs-anchor-warns-paramount-merger-marks-the-end-of-the-network/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/warns-paramount-merger-marks-the-108898119.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:02:55","author":"Brian Flood,Fox News","authors":["Brian Flood","Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":346103200,"title":"US funding cuts deepen North Korea’s isolation","text":"With the flick of a switch in Washington, a lifeline of independent news into North Korea has gone dark, prompting warnings that it will leave the country’s 26 million people more isolated than ever.\nThe abrupt halt to funding, passed by the US Senate earlier this month, ends long-standing American support for cross-border broadcasts and clandestine media channels that provided North Koreans with one of the few opportunities to access information unfiltered by state propaganda.\nAmong the most prominent casualties are Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, US-funded broadcasters that have for decades delivered Korean-language news, human rights reporting and glimpses of life beyond North Korea’s borders.\n“In the long term, we risk knowing less about the human rights situation in North Korea, as less and less information will be coming out of the country,” said Teppei Kasai, Asia programme officer at Human Rights Watch Japan.\n“The international community, including Japan, will then naturally have to rely on official statements by the North Korean government, which don’t carry a lot of credibility.”\n\nVoice of America and Radio Free Asia have slashed broadcasts into North Korea by as much as 80 per cent since May, following an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump in March calling for the elimination of their parent organisation, the United States Agency for Global Media.\nKasai warned that the funding cuts risked undermining one of the few remaining channels capable of challenging Pyongyang’s information stranglehold. “These organisations pierce the North Korean government’s strong information control and provide independent information to the people of North Korea, giving them opportunities to see through the government’s lies,” he told This Week in Asia.\nModest grants for radio broadcasts, maintaining in-country sources, satellite imagery analysis and the documentation of abuses had been provided under the North Korea Human Rights Act, which was enacted by the US Congress in 2004 and renewed three times. However, the legislation expired in 2022 and has yet to be renewed.\nEnding funding for broadcasts into North Korea “would leave the US without critical information, as Pyongyang expands its military presence overseas, including in Russia, and deepens its isolation and repression at home”, Human Rights Watch senior researcher Lina Yoon wrote in a Foreign Policy in Focus article on July 16.\nUS-funded radio stations, some broadcasting since the 1970s, have helped shine a light on the realities of the outside world for North Koreans, sharing information the Kim dynasty would prefer remained hidden, including the principles of democracy and life beyond the tightly sealed borders. Many defectors have cited foreign radio broadcasts as instrumental to their decision to escape.\nAccording to an analysis published last week by 38 North, a website run by the Stimson Centre think tank devoted to analysis about North Korea, the Trump administration’s cuts have already drastically reduced foreign broadcasting into North Korea.\n“The propagandists and censors at the Workers’ Party of Korea can hardly believe their luck,” wrote Stimson Centre senior fellow Martyn Williams in the analysis.\n\n“For decades they have battled against a constant, daily flow of uncensored news and information into North Korea that directly contradicts the stories they tell their own people about Kim Jong-un, the Korean peninsula and the world. But in the last three months, everything has changed. The battle has taken a decisive turn in North Korea’s favour and they did not need to do a thing.”\nNorth Korea’s tightening border controls in recent years have made it increasingly difficult to smuggle in USB sticks loaded with foreign films and news. The loss of radio broadcasts now risks worsening the country’s information drought.\nCompounding the impact, the newly elected South Korean government of President Lee Jae-myung has also reportedly ceased broadcasting into North Korea, as Seoul pursues a new strategy of rapprochement with Pyongyang.\nMeanwhile, South Korean authorities have also banned the launch of balloons carrying rice, cash, medicine and propaganda leaflets over the demilitarised zone.\n“As a result of the cuts, North Koreans will be less informed about local and global events and the information they do receive will be more dated,” Williams concluded in his analysis.\n“Should the political or military situation worsen on the Korean peninsula, the US and South Korea could regret losing these direct links to the North Korean people.”","summary":"With the flick of a switch in Washington, a lifeline of independent news into North Korea has gone dark, prompting warnings that it will leave the country’s 26 million people more isolated than ever.\nThe abrupt halt to funding, passed by the US Senate earlier this month, ends long-standing American support for cross-border broadcasts and clandestine media channels that provided North Koreans with one of the few opportunities to access information unfiltered by state propaganda.\nAmong the most...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3319863/us-cuts-leave-north-koreans-reliant-state-propaganda","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/28/5166272d-0f3b-4322-8abb-c39df21c2404_244cfd9c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:00:08","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":346102836,"title":"Moms for Liberty Co-Founder Named VP of Heritage Action for America","text":"Tiffany Justice, the co-founder of the conservative parental rights group Moms for Liberty, will become the new executive vice president of Heritage Action for America, the organization announced Monday.\n\nJustice became a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation earlier this year and chairs the “parental rights initiative.” \n\nShe gained national prominence since founding the nonprofit group Moms for Liberty in 2021, which has advocated on behalf of parents who object to critical race theory in school curricula, COVID-19 school masking policies, and other parental rights issues.\n\nThe group is currently spread across 48 states with 325 chapters and has hosted conservative figures such as President Donald Trump, Florida Gov.

Email: john.james@mailonline.co.uk \nBy JOHN JAMES \n Published:00:58 BST, 29 July 2025 |Updated:00:59 BST, 29 July 2025 \n\nResidents of a deprived Southern town known for its derelict high street and have claimed they are being exploited by the government after plans were leaked detailing how a new migrant hotel could be installed above a cluster empty shops. \nLocals in Waterlooville, Hampshire have said the new arrivals could bring 'chaos' to the already 'dead' community hub following unrest at other migrant sites last week which saw riot police deployed in Epping and Canary Wharf. \nThe Home Office plan to relocate 35 asylum seekers to a brand new development, where flats can sell for £250,000, is part of a new initiative to lower the numbers in hotels and 'disperse' migrants across UK towns and cities.\nHowever, it was done without any consultation with the local council to the dismay of locals and tensions in the town which has been described as a 'zombieland' due to its low visitor numbers is high. \nWith just days to go until a decision is due to be made and amid a planned protest to block the move, residents have expressed concern at being kept in the dark over major decisions that could shape the future of their town.\nWaterlooville used to be a 'thriving' high street but lost many big name stores including Waitrose, Wilko, Game and Peacocks in recent years, with much of the footfall being 'taken' by a nearby retail park. \nThese days the 'barren' high street has maintained its Wetherspoons but little else and some residents fear this complete lack of life in the town centre will lead to the migrant men loitering aimlessly. \nWhen MailOnline visited the town yesterday, tensions were high with some locals fearing for the safety of their families and the future of the town should the move go through. \n\nWATERLOOVILLE: A deprived Hampshire town could soon have a migrant hotel, pictured, installed above shops in the middle of the derelict high street\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: Locals have said the new arrivals could bring 'chaos' to the already 'dead' community hub\n\nCANARY WHARF: Protesters gathered outside the hotel, some wearing masks and others draped in St George's flags at a migrant hotel last week\n\nEPPING: A protestors jumps up and down on the roof of a police van at a protest on July 17 outside The Bell Hotel\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: Pompey fan Steve, 58, who has lived in the area his whole life, told MailOnline he fears for the safety of his family\n\nPompey fan Steve, 58, who has lived in the area his whole life said: 'I've got a 13-year-old granddaughter, when you're about that age, you want to go out up the high street, but I'd be worried now.\n'There's no criminal history checks on these people. It's easy to get swept up in that aspect, but it's not just that, I think it will attract trouble for us as well as the migrants.\n'With the planned protests, I don't want people to start smashing things up because that plays into the hands of the Home Office and police who say 'see, there we go, right wing'.\n'We have genuine concerns but the narrative can change quickly.'\nThe earmarked development is a newly converted block of 19 flats called Waterloo House. \nIt is owned by Mountley Group whose Director, Hersch Schneck, also owns a migrant hotel in nearby Cosham.\nAt the top of the market, the flats could fetch £250,000 each but falling house prices mean taking them off the market and entering into a deal with Clearsprings, a company which procures accommodation for asylum seekers on behalf of the Home Office, could be a far more profitable move for Mountley Group.\nThat's because the government could offer top of the market fees in order to get migrants into housing. As a result, Mountley Group could enjoy fixed guaranteed rates for several years and not be at risk of market turbulence.\nAs well as private rentals, the Home Office is seeking medium-sized sites such as former student accommodation and old tower blocks to house migrants.\nThe flats are located above a bric a brac store called The Junk Emporium which was once a Peacocks clothing store and before that, a Tesco.\nA member of staff at the shop, who rent from Mountley Group, told MailOnline how they only found out about the plans over Facebook and revealed the fallout of the row has severely impacted business.\nShe explained: 'Yesterday we probably took around a third less. They [customers] think it's to do with us but it's not, we just rent the shop, they kind of assume we know what is going which we don't.\n'We've had lots of phone calls and people coming in asking questions we can't answer. We were always under the impression that the flats above would be sold to commuters and people like that.\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: The flat complex is owned by Mountley Group whose Director, Hersch Schneck, also owns a migrant hotel in nearby Cosham\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: Locals fear that migrant men will soon be loitering in their 'Zombieland' high street \n\nWATERLOOVILLE: Kathleen Kingston, 67, who has lived in the area her whole life said housing people above shops on a high street is plain wrong\n\n'The only thing the owners have told us is that it will not be for 35 single men, it is families. What concerns us is this protest. We have not had any assurances in the event of damage to the shop.'\nOthers in Waterlooville, said to be named by soldiers returning from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, feel just as left out of the conversation.\nSid Conroy, who used to work for Airbus and now spends his time breeding racing pigeons, fears serious repercussions if the hotel gets given the greenlight.\nThe 68-year-old said: 'I'm dead against it, there could be fights and trouble up here. You're going to have problems here, I can tell you that.\n'There are people waiting years on housing waiting lists and it just seems like they get a brand new flat just like that? Why can't they look after us first?\n'Our government is making us unhappy because of it. People are left behind, they're thinking more of the people coming in now. You get them coming over here, causing mayhem, causing trouble, all they get is a slap on the wrist and don't do it again. This is how I see it.'\nJdarno Osborne, a mum whose children have challenging medical needs, says the hotel has left her angry because she has struggled to get stable housing in the past.\nThe 36-year-old, who has lived in the area her whole life, said: 'It's funny how they can quickly house people from out of the country yet our own don't get support.\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: At the top of the market, the flats could fetch £250,000 each\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: A shopper walks by a dilapidated shop which once housed a Store Twenty One \n'I've got six kids, I lived in a two bed flat for thirteen years and yet somebody can come over and get helped straight away.\n'My daughter is 15 now, they sometimes come here to hang with their friends. But it is worrying, there are things kicking off elsewhere because you hear of cases of rapes, harassment, stalking.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Despairing locals claim their once thriving high street is now derelict after slew of closures and new retail park opening up nearby \n'We have to deal with this but people don't seem to care.'\nThe row over the proposed hotel has triggered a political fallout which has seen local MP for Fareham and Waterlooville, Suella Braverman, the former Home Secretary, launch a petition to block the hotel going ahead.\nShe said such sites make town centres 'no-go zones for the patriotic, common-sense majority' adding: 'This site, in the centre of our town, is utterly inappropriate for migrant accommodation. It must be stopped.'\nHer petition has garnered nearly 10,000 signatures.\nLeader of Labour-run Havant Borough Council, Councillor Phil Munday, said last week how the row came about after Clearsprings, who are procuring the site, sent their consultation to the wrong email address.\nIn a furious public statement, he said he was 'extremely disappointed' that such an important issue was handled so poorly but went on to lambast Ms Braverman for 'headline-grabbing'.\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: The council have secured a 10-day consultation extension period to consider the plans. A decision is expected on 1st August\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: The town, located near the South Downs National Park, is said to have its name originated from soldiers returning from nearby Portsmouth after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815\nHe added: 'They also failed to follow up to ensure a response of some kind was registered. These consultation exercises need to be taken seriously.\nThe council have secured a 10-day consultation extension period to consider the plans. A decision is expected on 1st August.\n\n Move migrants out of Epping hotel, demands police commissioner \n'I look forward to the council providing a response that reflects the concerns of the borough', Mr Munday said.\nNikki Woodley and her 14-year-old son Harry said they also have reservations if migrants were to be relocated to the high street.\nNikki said: 'The council say the information was sent to the wrong person which I don't know if I agree with or not. But I'm obviously against the hotel. It's the worse place to put it because there are children everywhere here.\n'I'm not saying they're going to be all horrible and bad and criminals but if they're illegal we don't know who they are, we've got no idea who they are, they could have PTSD.\n'I don't suppose you'll come anyone who is for it.'\nHarry, who spoke to MailOnline with permission from his mum, said he sometimes hangs out on the high street and while the prospect of groups of young migrant men wouldn't bother him too much he said 'I'd probably feel a bit cautious' and consider socialising elsewhere.\nKathleen Kingston, 67, who has lived in the area her whole life said housing people above shops on a high street is plain wrong.\nShe went on: 'I think of the accommodation for locals like housing association, there are more people that need housing.'\nPatricia Walding, 87, added: 'These hotels are changing our towns, they are costing us a fortune and robbing the taxpayer while our own people are sleeping on the streets, I think it's disgusting.'\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: The leader of Havant Borough Council said Clearsprings, who are procuring the site, sent their consultation to the wrong email address - prompting the row \n\nWATERLOOVILLE: A man walks his dog past a closed down Game store on in Waterlooville\n\nSid Conroy, who used to work for Airbus and now spends his time breeding racing pigeons, fears serious repercussions if the hotel gets given the greenlight\n\n Canary Wharf hotel prepares for arrival of 'hundreds' of migrants with extra beds and mattresses \nBut not everyone is so against the plans.\nOne lady, an SEN teacher, who did not want to be named, feels local people are unloading unrelated grievances about their lives onto asylum seekers because they are 'an easy target'.\nThe mum said: 'People have got different views, those views are not wanting to house asylum seekers. The views and reasoning behind it are one, very racist, and two, not the right reasons. You hear it a lot, just the chat about migrants.\n'I don't believe for one second they care about the money side of things with the migrant criss or the actual safety of other people.\n'I understand people are concerned about women and children. I'm concerned about the other side of it, the protests, all these people gathering. They'll say its peaceful but it definitely wont be.\n'I've had asylum seekers as students, one of them has just past their level three and I couldn't be more proud. When you actually listen to someone like that and they tell you stories what it is really like to come from somehwere like that, you have no idea, you get to wake up in a warm bed every morning. When you see videos they won't show on the BBC.\n'Everytime I share my views, people say it's stupid. But you can't help where you're born.'\nThe Leader of Havant Borough Council, Councillor Phil Munday, said 'I understand we have an instructed duty from the Home Office to house asylum seekers within the borough, however it is important that the council works closely with all concerned to advise on the placement for these vulnerable people.\n\nWATERLOOVILLE: Two dilapidated store fronts close to the proposed site of the hotel\n\nFormer Home Secretary Suella Braverman has launched a petition to block the hotel going ahead\n'I have taken immediate action and personally called The Home Office to request an extension to their consultation in order for us to respond accordingly. This has also been followed up with formal requests in writing from our officers.\n'We are extremely disappointed that the company involved with this important consultation, considering the impact it may have on our local community, was not only sent to an incorrect email address, but they also failed to follow up to ensure a response of some kind was registered. These consultation exercises need to be taken seriously.\nCouncillor Phil Munday added 'I also have grave concerns on the impact the recent video posted by MP Suella Braverman will have, and I would urge the community to act responsibly and allow us to address this matter formally in the correct manner.\n'As part of my open letter to Suella Braverman MP on this matter I will be reminding her that those who could potentially be accommodated somewhere within our borough, will be supported asylum seekers. \n'They are categorically not recognised by the state as illegal immigrants – regardless of the headline-grabbing title of Suella Braverman's petition – and I urge people to consider this in their views and actions.'\nAs of late June 2025, there are approximately 32,000 asylum seekers housed in hotels in the UK.\nAs of July 20, 2025, over 20,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year, according to the BBC.\nThe Home Office, Clearsprings and Mountley Group were approached for comment.\nThe Home OfficeSuella Braverman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFurious locals' in deprived Hampshire town say 'secret' plan to move migrants into £250,000 flats will be the final nail in the coffin of their 'Zombieland' High Street\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

It’s Dick, your old friend. And your former president. We need to talk, because the bastards are trying to do you in, the way they destroyed me.” Nixon? Was it really Richard Nixon, sitting there in the corner of the room? \n\nYes, they had been friends, sort of, for a couple of years after Nixon’s resignation Trump had supported him in his disgrace, and they even wrote to each other quite a bit (Donald was really regretting right now his habit of writing witty letters, as he called them, to his friends). But Nixon had died more than 30 years ago. What was he doing here now?\n\n“Listen,” Nixon said, as if anticipating Trump’s questions. “I don’t know why, and from everything I do know it’s not in your character, but you were kind to me for a little while when I needed friends and recognition. So I want to help you now. You’re in more trouble than you know, and I need to give you some advice.” \n\n“If you’re talking about the Epstein stuff,” Trump said, “I’ve got it covered. With all the dirt I’ve got on the Democrats, there’s no way they can get me.” Nixon laughed, and it wasn’t a pretty sound.\n\n“The Democrats,” he said scornfully. “Do you think it was the Democrats that got me? They never laid a glove on me. It was three things. I made a few mistakes along the way, and you ought to remember what they were. \n\n\"But it was the media, the damn media, and most of all it was my own people who abandoned me in the end. And that’s always the way it is, Donald. \n\n The opposition always do their best to punish you, but if you’re looking for your real enemies they will always – always – appear on your own side.\n\nRealising he had Trump’s rapt attention, the ghost went on.\n\n“I’m surprised they haven’t given the issue a name yet. But they will, they’ll make it something that people can remember. And they’ll probably name it after me, or that bloody building that’s always associated with my name. Epsteingate, they’ll call it, and when you see that name appear in the media you’ll know they really have their claws into it, and into you.” \n\n“You’ve already made my first mistake,” the ghost of Nixon told him. “Being in the afterlife gives you certain insights, along with a lot of other stuff I don’t want to talk about. But it doesn’t enable me to see everything in those bloody files. \n\n\"I do know there’s something in there, maybe just one thing or maybe a few, that you are terrified of. And from everything the world already knows about your private life it must be pretty bad – it’s certainly not something you and I ever talked about over drinks, or when you were trying to persuade me to buy an apartment in Trump Tower.\" \n\n“It’s never going to come out,” Trump told him. “My people have promised me they’ll never let that happen.” Nixon laughed his deathly laugh again. \n\n“You’re forgetting the prime lesson of Watergate – and you’re not the only one who’s done that. That fool in London Boris Johnson forgot it too and look what happened to him. The crime is one thing, but in politics the cover-up becomes the real crime. And you’re up to your neck in a cover-up right now.” \n\n“That’s the way it has to be,” Trump said.\n\n“No,” Nixon retorted. “The pressure will build and build, and soon you’ll have to appoint a Special Prosecutor. And you won’t get away with hand-picking one of those fools from Fox News that you seem to love. It will have to be someone who at least looks independent. \n\n\"And the first thing they will ask for is the files. All the files. And suddenly they won’t be under your lock and key anymore. They’ll come after what they always called the smoking gun in my day.” \n\n“Have you forgotten?” Nixon demanded. “They looked for all my tapes, and I knew if they got them, I was finished. By the way I hope you haven’t been taping your private conversations …” Trump didn’t reply.\n\n“That probably tells me everything I need to know,” Nixon pressed on. \n\n“Remember that night in 1973 – the Saturday night massacre they called it. I told the Attorney General to fire the prosecutor, and he resigned rather than follow my orders. Then his deputy walked away. \n\n\"Then when I finally got rid of that stuffed shirt Archibald Cox as Special Prosecutor I was forced to accept an even tougher bastard in his place. And they got the files, and their smoking gun, in the end.” \n\n“My people aren’t quitters,” Trump said. “They knew what they were getting into. They’d be prepared to go down fighting rather than betray the MAGA movement.” Nixon laughed out loud, and for the first time the president felt fear.\n\n“If you believe that,” Nixon said, “you’re a bigger fool than I think you are. Do you remember how many went down fighting with me? Not one, not bloody one. The hypocrite Kissinger, even him, offering to pray with me as if I was facing execution. In the end I was entirely alone.” \n\n“So what are you telling me to do?” Trump wanted to know.\n\n“Let it out,” Nixon said. “Whatever is there, make a virtue of openness. They’ll comb through it for all the dirt. Tell them you’re going to publish the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Then you can start denying it afresh. \n\n Your base would rather believe you – or at least forgive you. And you won’t be the only one who has denials to issue. But for God’s sake don’t make the terrible mistake I did when I said I wasn’t a crook. Don’t make a speech saying, ‘your president is not a paedophile’ – there’d be no coming back from that.\n\nThere was silence then, enough for the president to think. Of all the advice he had hoped for from Richard Nixon, telling the truth wasn’t it. And he knew he couldn’t. He’d built a movement, and two terms in the Oval Office, without ever once telling the truth. He knew it couldn’t be that way. Nixon had to do better.\n\nBut when he opened his mouth to speak, he realised the other man was silent too. And the shadowy figure in the corner was gone, had faded into nothing.

David A. Wright, Trump’s pick to lead the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a five-year term, was confirmed in the upper chamber on a 50 to 39 vote on Monday. It’s not Wright’s first time as chair of the commission, having first served in the role beginning in 2020. KEY TRUMP NOMINEES STALLED BY SENATE DEMS PUTS PRESSURE ON GOP LEADERS Trump had previously tapped Wright during his first term, and again selected him to lead the NRC earlier this year. His new term is set to end in 2030. The NRC is an independent regulatory agency tasked with regulating commercial nuclear power plants, reactor licensing and renewal and other elements related to protecting public health and safety when it comes to nuclear energy. Wright's confirmation comes on the heels of Trump's announcement that the U.S. and European Union were entering a trade deal that would see the bloc purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy over the next three years. While the commission is independent from other arms of the government, Senate Democrats have balked at recent attempts to make the regulatory body, in their view, more partisan. 'ALL THE OPTIONS': GOP EYES CUTTING AUGUST RECESS TO MOVE DOZENS OF TRUMP NOMINEES STALLED BY DEMS Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order that demanded the agency consider making its safety standards less stringent, shortening the timelines for environmental reviews and a quadrupling of the nation’s nuclear power capacity by 2050: all part of the president's quest to ensure America's energy dominance. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., argued that over the last seven years that Wright has been a part of the commission, first as a commissioner beginning in 2018 and then as chair, he would fulfill the president's wishes. \"Achieving this will require experienced and highly qualified Commissioners who are empowered to lead the Agency through a period of high expectations,\" she said in a statement. \"Well, David Wright meets that mark.\" Then Trump fired a Democratic member of the commission last month, and a staffer from the president’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was reportedly detailed from the Department of Energy to the regulatory agency. That prompted Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, to warn of a \"hostile takeover\" of the commission by the Energy Department. The move hurt what began as bipartisan support for Wright’s nomination — Whitehouse initially backed him but changed his position. GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS \"I hoped to see Chairman Wright rise to the occasion, but circumstances right now at the NRC continue to deteriorate,\" he said in a statement. \"I cannot presently support his renomination.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Still, Wright’s confirmation is a win for both Senate Republicans and the White House after Trump called on the Senate GOP to ram his nominees through blockades set up by Senate Democrats. There are now over 140 pending \"civilian\" nominations for positions across the gauntlet of federal agencies, ambassadorships and judgeships. The Senate has moved at a blistering clip over the last six months to confirm nominees—they’ve clocked nearly 100 so far — the president has called on Senate Republicans to consider canceling the forthcoming August break to get more done. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., warned that if his colleagues across the aisle continued to slow walk the process in the upper chamber for the slew of remaining \"uncontroversial\" nominees, or be prepared to stick around Washington. \"Or they can rein in their reflexive anti-Trump sentiment and allow some of his rank-and-file nominees to proceed by unanimous consent or voice vote — just as Republicans did when the roles were reversed,\" he said. \"And I’d remind my colleagues about the dangerous and ugly precedent that they’re setting here. But the choice is theirs. But whether it’s the slow way or the fast way, we’re getting President Trump’s nominees confirmed.\"","summary":"Senate confirmed David A.

Since beginning his second term in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly bragged of his personal ties with Kim Jong Un and expressed hopes of restarting nuclear diplomacy between them. Their high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19 unravelled due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions. Kim has since performed a provocative run of weapons tests to modernize and expand his nuclear arsenal.

In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong said that “It is worth taking into account the fact that the year 2025 is neither 2018 nor 2019.” “Any attempt to deny the position of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state which was established along with the existence of a powerful nuclear deterrent and fixed by the supreme law reflecting the unanimous will of all the DPRK people will be thoroughly rejected,” she said, referring to her country by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

She said she was responding to reported comments by a U.S. official that Trump is still open to talks with Kim Jong Un on the North's complete denuclearization. She likely was referring to a Saturday article by Yonhap news agency that cited an unidentified White House official as saying that Trump “remains open to engaging with Leader Kim to achieve a fully denuclearized North Korea.” Kim Yo Jong said she doesn't deny the personal relationship between her brother and Trump “is not bad.” But she said if their personal relations are to serve the purpose of North Korea's denuclearization, North Korea would view it as “nothing but a mockery.\" “If the U.S. fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK- U.S. meeting will remain as a hope' of the U.S. side,” Kim Yo Jong said. Her comments suggested complete denuclearization won't be up for negotiation. Experts earlier said North Korea would only be interested in talks on a partial surrender of its nuclear capability in return for sanctions relief and other benefits, a tactic that could allow North Korea to retain some of its key nuclear weapons after winning what it wants from the U.S. The earlier Trump-Kim diplomacy collapsed after Trump rejected Kim's calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step. On Monday, Kim Yo Jong rebuffed overtures by South Korea's new liberal government, saying its “blind trust” in the country's alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor. Her comments imply that North Korea — now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia — sees no need to resume diplomacy with South Korea anytime soon. Experts say Kim Yo Jong also likely seeks to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.

But the White House had previously offered a different explanation for the falling-out. Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, said in a statement last week: “The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep.”\n\nEpstein killed himself, authorities say, in a New York jail cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Trump and his top allies stoked conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death before Trump returned to power. They are now struggling to manage the fallout after the Justice Department said Epstein did, in fact, die by suicide and that it would not release additional documents about the case.\n\nThe president and his allies, some of whom are now in the administration, had promised to release the files.\n\nThe case has dogged Trump at home and abroad and even followed Vice President JD Vance during an appearance in his home state of Ohio on Monday. A small group of protesters assembled outside a factory in Canton that Vance toured, holding signs that spelled out “JD Protects Pedophiles” and indicating that “GOP” stands for “Guardians Of Pedophiles.”\n\nThe Republican president spoke at his golf property in Turnberry, Scotland, as he sat with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after the leaders had met and were answering questions from U.S. and U.K. journalists. Asked to explain why the relationship had faltered, Trump said, “That’s such old history, very easy to explain, but I don’t want to waste your time by explaining it.”\n\nHe then explained, saying he stopped talking to Epstein after “he did something that was inappropriate.”\n\n“He hired help and I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again,’” Trump said. “He stole people that worked for me. I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He did it again, and I threw him out of the place, persona non grata.”\n\n“I threw him out and that was it. I’m glad I did, if you want to know the truth,” Trump added.\n\nTrump recently directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the public release of sealed grand jury transcripts in the case. One federal judge has denied that request; a second judge has yet to rule.\n\nVance on Monday visited the factory to promote Trump’s tax cut and border bill, but also addressed the Epstein matter, saying the president wants “full transparency” in the case.\n\n“The president has been very clear. We’re not shielding anything,” Vance said in response to a reporter’s question. “The president has directed the attorney general to release all credible information and, frankly, to go and find additional credible information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.”\n\n“Some of that stuff takes time,” Vance said, adding that Trump has been “very clear. He wants full transparency.”\n\nTrump had said back in 2019 that Epstein was a fixture in Palm Beach but that the two had had a falling-out a long time ago and he hadn’t spoken with Epstein for 15 years.\n\nTrump on Monday also denied contributing to a compilation of letters and drawings to mark Epstein’s 50th birthday, first reported on by the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper said the letter, believed to be from Trump, included a drawing of a woman’s body.\n\n“I’m not a drawing person,” Trump said. “I don’t do drawings of women, that I can tell you.”\n\nTrump also said he declined Epstein’s invitation to visit a private island the financier owned.\n\n“I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down, but a lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island,” Trump said. “In one of my very good moments, I turned it down. I didn’t want to go to his island.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The data demand comes as the Trump administration has sought to collect private information on mostly lower-income people who may be in the country illegally. It has already ordered the Internal Revenue Service and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to share private information with the Department of Homeland Security to aid in deportation efforts.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last week that it had until Wednesday to hand over the data for those enrolled in its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which serves more than 42 million people nationwide. The USDA said the data will help it combat waste, fraud and abuse. The states' lawsuit seeks an injunction to block the data transfer. In the meantime, state attorneys general in the SNAP lawsuit said they will not disclose what they consider to be private information of recipients — including their immigration status, birthdates and home addresses — because they believe it would be a violation of privacy laws.

Rollins said in a statement at the time. “The Department is focused on appropriate and lawful participation in SNAP, and today's request is one of many steps to ensure SNAP is preserved for only those eligible.” USDA officials declined a request for comment on the suit. The USDA did not mention immigration enforcement in the announcement or later notices. It is not clear why USDA officials believe the data will help it weed out fraud and abuse. The agency claims the program is already “one of the most rigorous quality control systems in the federal government.” Immigration advocates noted that the Trump administration has used the same argument to obtain other sensitive data, only to later admit it would be using the information to enhance its deportation operations. Trump administration officials, for example, initially claimed they were seeking state Medicaid data to fight fraud. Last week, a top immigration official conceded they would be utilizing that same information to locate immigrants. Agency officials have threatened to withhold SNAP funding if states fail to comply with their demand for data. While immigrants without legal status are ineligible to receive SNAP benefits, they can apply on behalf of their children who are U.S. citizens or those who are part of a mixed-status household. Under the program, formerly known as food stamps, the federal government pays for 100% of the food benefits, but the states help cover the administrative costs. States are also responsible for determining whether individuals are eligible for benefits and for issuing those benefits to enrollees. Immigration and data privacy advocates expressed alarm at the Trump administration's efforts to obtain sensitive SNAP data maintained by states. “The administration has all but told us that their intention is to comb this data and use it for unlawful purposes that include immigration enforcement,” said Madeline Wiseman, an attorney with the National Student Legal Defense Network, which filed a lawsuit in May with privacy and hunger relief groups that are also challenging USDA's efforts for SNAP data.

That is about 42% of the 255 who were voted out of a committee to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. \n\nAs of July 22, within that group, 86 key positions like ambassadors and Cabinet secretaries have been confirmed. Without significantly more confirmations while the Senate is still in Washington before it leaves for its August recess, the number of Trump confirmations will continue to lag.\n\nA civilian nominee is defined by Congress as an individual who is being proposed for a role that is not an officer position in the military or uniformed services.\n\nBy comparison, at the end of then-President Joe Biden’s first eight months in office in August 2021, about 150 of his civilian nominees were confirmed, which was approximately 74% of those voted out of committee and reported to the full Senate. By the end of August in Trump’s first term, about 130 Trump civilian nominees were confirmed, which was around 76% of those reported to the full Senate.\n\nThe discrepancy in confirmations has been driven in large part by what Republicans describe as Democrat obstructionism. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has thrown up procedural hurdles and has led the Democrat effort to prevent confirmations being passed by unanimous consent. \n\nSchumer’s GOP counterpart, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., recently noted that Trump was the only president on record “to not have a single one of his civilian nominees confirmed by unanimous consent or voice vote at this point in his presidency.” In a speech on the Senate floor, Thune compared that to the 44 Biden nominees who had been confirmed by voice vote in the Senate up to this same point in his term.\n\nThe question remains, however, if Thune is willing to break the Democrat blockade by exhausting the chamber with confirmation votes. \n\n“We haven’t ruled anything out. I think the options are on the table. The Democrats can continue with this historic and unprecedented level of obstructionism, or they can work with us, and we can get some of these things, some of them done,” Thune said Monday.\n\nTrump has nominated 356 individuals so far to make his mark on the federal government, according to a Washington Post tracker run in collaboration with the Partnership for Public Service. Approximately 1,300 federal government positions require Senate confirmation. As of July 25, there were 294 positions where Trump has not yet nominated anyone, while 177 people are serving from previous administrations or are in termed positions. \n\nAs of Monday, the president had 255 civilian nominees reported by committees to the full Senate. Within that group, there are 144 civilian nominees on the Senate calendar that are ready to be confirmed to top positions in major executive branch agencies responsible for labor, education, and agriculture, as well as the federal court system.\n\nSenate leadership has touted the number of civilian nominees approved by the upper chamber so far, but nonetheless, several senators have expressed impatience with the rate of confirmation. \n\n“There is absolutely zero reason we should have this backlog—especially with such important nominations,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nAs it stands right now, the number of confirmations for non-Cabinet appointments is far below where the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations were during the same time period. \n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have both publicly discussed letting the president make recess appointments. Those appointments are made when the Senate is out of session, therefore, they are not subject to Senate confirmation under the Constitution. Recess appointments can last for as long as one or two years before expiring. \n\nThe president, for his part, has urged the Senate to cancel its August recess to get his nominees confirmed. \n\n“Hopefully, the very talented John Thune, fresh off our many victories over the past two weeks and, indeed, 6 months, will cancel August recess (and long weekends!) in order to get my incredible nominees confirmed. We need them badly!!!” Trump said in a Truth Social post on July 19.","summary":"Republicans are contemplating new measures to increase the rate of confirmations for President Donald Trump’s nominees.

And in your case a big immigration component.’\n\nMr Trump, a long-time friend of Mr Farage, said he liked both men, adding: ‘I think the one that’s toughest and most competent on immigration is going to win the election, but then you add... low taxes, and you add the economy.\n\n‘[Sir Keir] did a great thing with the economy, because a lot of money is going to come in because of the [US trade] deal that was made. But I think that immigration is now bigger than ever before.’\n\nAlmost 20,000 people crossed the Channel illegally in the first six months of this year – a rise of 50 per cent on the same period in 2024.\n\nMr Trump, who put border control at the heart of his winning election campaign last year, warned that the level of migration to the UK was ‘ruinous’. \n\nHe warned that the small boats crossing the Channel were usually ‘loaded up with bad people... because other countries don’t send their best, they send people that they don’t want.\n\n‘This is a magnificent part of the world, and you cannot ruin it, you cannot let people come here illegally’.\n\nOn a day of high-level talks:\n\n■ Sir Keir said the British public are ‘revolted’ by the scenes of desperate hunger in Gaza, as he prepared for an emergency briefing of the Cabinet this afternoon on a ‘peace plan’ which will put Britain on the road to recognising a Palestinian state.\n\n■ President Trump pledged action to ‘get the children fed’ in Gaza, saying: ‘That’s real starvation stuff... you can’t fake that’;\n\n■ Mr Trump set a new deadline of ‘ten to 12’ days for Vladimir Putin to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine;\n\n■ He warned against the Government’s inheritance tax raid on farmers, saying he had scrapped similar plans in the US following a string of suicides;\n\n■ He praised King Charles, and spoke of his love of the UK and enthusiasm for a September state visit;\n\n■ Mr Trump savaged Labour’s obsession with wind farms, saying the UK was paying ‘massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place’.\n\nYesterday’s talks came during a ‘private’ four-day trip to Scotland during which Mr Trump has held meetings with a number of leading political figures while visiting his two golf courses in the country. \n\nIn a highly unusual encounter, Mr Trump effectively acted as host to Sir Keir in his own country, with the PM forced to make a 400-mile pilgrimage to Scotland to build on an unlikely ‘bromance’.\n\nAn hour-long press conference was humiliating at times for the PM. During one excruciating exchange, Mr Trump said Sir Sadiq was a ‘nasty person’ who had done a ‘terrible job’.\n\nSir Keir also had to endure a public lecture on the importance of cutting taxes, which Mr Trump said was key to UK growth – and Labour’s electoral fortunes. \n\nReferring to Sir Keir, who raised taxes by a record £40billion last year and is expected to raise them again in the autumn, he added: ‘The Prime Minister hasn’t been here very long. I think he will be a tax cutter.’ \n\nGovernment sources last night insisted that the trip had proved worthwhile as Sir Keir tries to galvanize international action behind a plan to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza. \n\nA source said President Trump was ‘very forward leaning on getting aid in’. No 10 was also cheered by Mr Trump’s warm language towards Sir Keir.\n\nLater Sir Keir flew with Mr Trump in Air Force One from Glasgow airport to a private dinner in Aberdeen. \n\nThey were due to land at RAF Lossiemouth, because Aberdeen airport’s runway is too short for the 747.","summary":"The US President offered Sir Keir his 'simple' formula for defeating the Reform leader - now riding high in the polls - at an extraordinary joint press conference in Scotland.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14949005/Trump-Keir-Starmer-Farage-US-President-tells-PM-cut-taxes-tackle-ruinous-immigration-wants-bury-Reform-UK-polls.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/29/00/100715425-0-image-a-117_1753744756139.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/28/7635837092955468932/1024x576_MP4_7635837092955468932.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 23:25:00","author":"Editor,Jason Groves","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":346092238,"title":"North Korea says Trump must accept new nuclear reality","text":"SEOUL: North Korea said on Tuesday (Jul 29) the United States must accept that reality has changed since the countries' summit meetings in the past, and no future dialogue would end its nuclear programme, state media KCNA reported.\n\nKim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who is believed to speak for his brother, said she conceded that the personal relationship between Kim and US President Donald Trump \"is not bad\".\n\nBut if Washington intended to use a personal relationship as a way to end the North's nuclear weapons programme, the effort would only be the subject of \"mockery\", Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by KCNA.\n\n\"If the US fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK-US meeting will remain as a 'hope' of the US side,\" she said.
