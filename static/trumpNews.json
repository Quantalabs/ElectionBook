During their time together, Trump, 79, and Zelenskyy, 47, discussed ending the war in Ukraine, and how it is becoming more of a reality.\n\n \"We could be very close,\" Trump said, according to CNN. \"There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues. But I think we’re doing very well.\"\n\n \"We made a lot of progress today, but really, we’ve made it over the last month,\" he continued. \"This is not a one-day process. It’s very complicated stuff.\"\n\n For his part, Zelenskyy agreed, stating, per The Hill: \"We discussed all the aspects of the peace framework.\"\n\n Two days prior to the politicians' Dec. 28 meet-up, Politico reported that Trump was optimistic about his meeting with Zelenskyy.\n\n “I think it’s going to go good with him. I think it’s going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,” Trump said, further explaining that he planned to speak with the Russian president “soon, as much as I want.”\n\n Trump also told The New York Post, “I think we have a good shot at [a ceasefire]. I think [Ukraine] want to do it now, and I think that Russia wants to do it. But every time one wants to do it, the other doesn’t.\"\n\n However, the president also maintained in his remarks to Politico that he held the cards over Zelenskyy.\n\n “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump said of the Ukrainian president's plan for peace. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”\n\n This latest meeting followed a contentious White House encounter between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance back in February.\n\n During that meeting, the U.S. planned to sign a natural resources agreement with Ukraine and make progress on negotiating a peace deal. However, the visit quickly turned into an aggressive confrontation, with Trump and Vance, 41, berating the Ukrainian president.\n\n Vance accused Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" for trying to litigate U.S.-Ukraine policy in front of the American journalists gathered in the Oval Office.\n\n \"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring you into this conference,” Vance angrily told Zelenskyy, who replied, \"We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel, because you're in no position to dictate that.\"\n\n Immediately after Zelenskyy left the White House, dozens of world leaders jumped to his defense and criticized the behavior of the Trump administration.\n\n A few months later, Trump invited Zelenskyy back, along with seven other European leaders. At the time, they had a \"productive meeting\" as a show of support for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\n The White House summit in August came just a few days after the U.S. president flew to Alaska to meet with Putin in person. Despite presenting the Russian president with a personal plea from first lady Melania Trump, Trump returned home without a deal.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Despite that disappointment, Trump maintained that he was the man to get the job done.

The Kremlin also described the call positively. Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin envoy, said Trump's conversation with Putin was \"good and very productive.\" He shared the update on X shortly before Trump was set to meet Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, where the talks were expected to take place in the resort's main dining room.\n\nThe phone call, which lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, came hours after Russia launched a major attack on Kyiv, killing two people and injuring at least four others. CNN reported that this was the first direct conversation between Trump and Putin since October call this year, when both leaders had agreed to hold a summit in Budapest. That proposed meeting was later cancelled by Trump, who said it would be a waste of time.\n\nZelenskyy arrived in the United States on Sunday to meet Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Before sitting down with the US president, the Ukrainian leader held consultations with NATO and European Union allies as part of his diplomatic outreach, CNN reported. Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy spoke by phone with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, briefing him on preparations for the Trump meeting and the latest developments on the battlefield.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said, \"Thank you, Keir, for the constant coordination! I started my morning in Florida today with a detailed phone call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Russia is not represented at Sunday's meeting in Florida, and there is still no clarity on whether Moscow is ready to accept an immediate ceasefire. Trump has earlier said that both Russia and Ukraine have, at times, acted as obstacles to peace. A day before the meeting, Putin warned that Russia would continue its military campaign if talks failed. According to Russian state media cited by CNN, the Russian president said that \"if Kyiv is not willing to resolve the matter peacefully, Russia will accomplish all the aims of the special military operation by military means.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from news agency ANI).","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-us-president-donald-trump-issues-big-statement-ahead-of-key-meeting-with-ukraine-leader-volodymyr-zelenskyy-had-very-productive-phone-conversation-with-russian-president-vladimir-putin-3195224","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025/12/29/2736514-trump-zelenskyy.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 01:06:00","author":"Mahima Mahajan","authors":["Mahima Mahajan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":389715130,"title":"Putin envoy praises Trump&rsquo;s peace efforts, shares Florida wake-surfing video ahead of Zelenskyy talks |...","text":"Vladimir Putin’s top negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, shared a video of himself wake-surfing off the Florida coast ahead of Sunday’s critical talks between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe appearance comes as Trump met Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Sunday, where the two leaders said they were making progress toward an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nAlso read: Trump, Zelenskyy say Ukraine peace talks ‘95% complete, but thorny issues remain’; Putin rejects ceasefire for referendums | Top updates\n\nThe Harvard-educated special envoy and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund posted the video on X with the caption, “Miami spirit,” in response to a post by Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya announcing his arrival in south Florida.\n\nMiami spirit 🤙🏄‍♂️ https://t.co/FG9LQuqYSB pic.twitter.com/K0tVDFfrfG\n— Kirill Dmitriev (@kadmitriev) December 28, 2025\n\nDmitriev later shared a picture of himself on a balcony in Florida, showcasing the provocative t-shirt he had worn during the video.\n\nAfter the meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev offered rare praise for Washington’s peace initiative, noting that global sentiment favored Trump’s approach to resolving the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"The whole world appreciates President Trump and his team's peace efforts,\" Dmitriev wrote early on Monday, following Trump's engagement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a separate phone call with Putin.","url":"https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/putin-envoy-praises-trump-s-peace-efforts-shares-florida-wake-surfing-video-ahead-of-zelenskyy-talks-watch-article-13745761.html","image":"https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/12/20251229010236_AFP__20251228__897A2G4__v2__HighRes__UkraineUsRussiaConflictWar.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 01:02:52","author":"Moneycontrol World Desk","authors":["Moneycontrol World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":389714944,"title":"Trump, Zelensky say Ukraine peace deal ‘very close’ after Florida talks","text":"Washington, Dec 29 (SocialNews.XYZ) US President Donald Trump said that peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine were “very close” following what he described as a “terrific meeting” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n\n“We’ve done very well. We’ve had discussions on just about every subject,” Trump told reporters after the meeting, adding that the two sides had “made a lot of progress on ending that war.”\n\nTrump said he and Zelensky had also spoken with several European leaders after their bilateral discussions, describing the outreach as appropriate given the stakes involved. He listed leaders from France, Finland, Poland, Norway, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We thought it was appropriate to speak with them,” Trump said. “Our meeting was excellent.”\n\nThe US president said negotiations had covered the overwhelming majority of issues required to bring the conflict to an end. “Somebody would say 95 per cent. I don’t know what percent, but we have made a lot of progress,” he said, adding that there were still “one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues.”\n\nNoting that they discussed all aspects of the peace framework, Zelensky thanked Trump and senior members of his team, including Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for what he described as sustained engagement in the talks.\n\n“We discussed all the aspects of the peace framework,” Zelensky said, adding that there had been “great achievements” across several areas.\n\nHe said the two sides were close to an agreement on security guarantees, calling them essential to ending the conflict. “We agreed that security guarantees are a key milestone in achieving lasting peace,” Zelensky said.\n\nAccording to Zelensky, US-Ukraine security guarantees were “almost agreed,” while military elements of the plan were “100% agreed,” and a prosperity plan was being finalized.\n\nTrump echoed the sense of momentum but cautioned that unresolved territorial issues remained complex. “The word agreed is too strong,” he said when asked about arrangements concerning the Donbas region. “But we’re getting closer to an agreement on that.”\n\nTrump said Russia’s position on Donbas was well known. “That’s what they’ve been asking for,” he said, adding that it was an issue that would have to be “ironed out.”\n\nZelensky said Ukraine’s position remained grounded in law and public consent. “We have to respect our law and our people,” he said, noting that any difficult provisions could require parliamentary approval or a referendum. “It’s the land of our nation,” he said.\n\nTrump said the Ukrainian public overwhelmingly wanted an end to the war. “They had a poll that it’s 91 per cent in favor of ending this war,” he said. “They want to end it like everybody wants it ended.”\n\nThe leaders said working groups would continue negotiations in the coming weeks. Trump said the US group would include senior officials and would also engage directly with Russia. “Because to work with ourselves doesn’t really solve much of a problem,” he said.\n\nZelensky said Trump had agreed to host a future meeting, possibly in Washington, that could include European leaders.\n\n“If it went really well, maybe a few weeks,” Trump said when asked about a timeline. “And if it went poorly longer.

God put me in the right place to see what I needed to see,” she recounted to JIS News.\n\nWithin hours, two concrete structures she occupied had collapsed. Yet Montaque remains firm in her belief that her survival was no accident.\n\n“If I had not gotten out when I did, the building would have gone down with me, and maybe I would have died,” she stated.\n\nWeeks later, as she stood amid the ruins of what was once her home, Montaque chose to focus, not on what had fallen, but on what still stood: life, faith, and the kindness of those around her.\n\nShe shares that neighbours arrived at daybreak after the hurricane, telling her they could not sleep knowing what she had endured. Her church family and the parents of her students continued to check in, offering encouragement and support as she rebuilds.\n\n“It’s the love and support that keep me going. People have been calling, praying with me, sending messages… it gives me strength,” Montaque said.\n\nHer encouragement to those who have suffered similar or even worse circumstances is to cling steadfastly to their faith.\n\n“Just hold on to God. It’s just a test of faith. We don’t know what the next wave is going to be,” she remarked.\n\nDrawing on the biblical story of Job, Montaque reflects that her experience is a reminder that hardship does not have the final say.\n\nShe acknowledges that restarting her life will be challenging. In addition to losing goods from her businesses, looters took advantage of her collapsed building.\n\nWhile she has had to stay with friends until she rebuilds, Montague said she remains optimistic that “something good will come.”\n\nOpportunities in this regard are beginning to unfold for Montaque, who recently participated in the Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA) Connect joint visit with GraceKennedy General Insurance. The exercise conducted damage assessments and issued payouts within the community, offering tangible support to those affected.\n\nThe visit opened her eyes to opportunities she never knew existed. Montaque shared her excitement about registering her farm for insurance and signing up for her RADA ID, which she hopes will open the door to further assistance.\n\nShe anticipates that through this newly-established relationship, she will receive guidance on improved planting methods and marketing techniques to strengthen her yam business.\n\nAdditionally, Montaque remains hopeful she will be able to get tangible assistance to rebuild her home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa hurricane relief Trelawny \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police seize illegal firearm in St Elizabeth operation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 28, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The St Elizabeth Police have recovered another prohibited weapon during an operation in the parish.

It said South Korea maintains a readiness to repel any potential North Korean provocations through its alliance with the United States.\n\nU.N. Security Council resolutions prohibit North Korea from launches involving its huge stockpile of ballistic missiles. Its cruise missile tests aren’t banned, but they still pose a threat to the U.S. and South Korea because they are highly maneuverable and fly at low altitudes to avoid radar detection. Analysts say North Korea would aim to use cruise missiles to strike U.S. warships and aircraft carriers in the event of conflict.\n\nSunday’s launches are the latest weapons display by North Korea. Last week, North Korea test-launched new anti-air missiles off its east coast and displayed photos showing a largely completed hull of a developmental nuclear-powered submarine. North Korea implied it would arm the submarine with nuclear missiles.\n\nA nuclear-powered submarine is among a slew of sophisticated weapons systems that Kim has vowed to introduce to cope with what he describes as U.S.-led security threats. Some experts say North Korea’s recent alignment with Russia — including sending thousands of troops and military equipment to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine — may have helped it to receive crucial technologies in return. \n\nNorth Korea could further increase its weapons demonstrations ahead of its planned ruling Workers’ Party congress early next year, observers say.\n\nNorth Korea has focused on weapons-testing activities to expand its nuclear arsenal since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump collapsed in 2019. \n\nBut in an apparent response to Trump’s repeated outreach, Kim suggested in September that he could return to talks if the U.S. drops “its delusional obsession with denuclearization” of North Korea. Experts say Kim might think his enlarged nuclear arsenal would give him greater leverage to wrest concessions in potential talks with Trump.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missiles-kim-7bd75f6aea212d48f7d99a6856c66754","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0799ad9/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5000x3315+0+0/resize/1486x985!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F99%2F43%2Fb0455cc2d680e8b5fea11f543fac%2F98f94e64dbef4e44bb45f1a1449451e3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:29:08","author":"Hyung-Jin Kim","authors":["Hyung-Jin Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":389712100,"title":"Winter rain floods Gaza camps as Netanyahu heads for US meeting","text":"Winter rain lashed the Gaza Strip over the weekend, flooding camps with ankle-deep puddles as Palestinians displaced by two years of war attempted to stay dry in tents frayed by months of use.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled for an expected meeting on Monday (December 29, 2025) with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida about the second phase of the ceasefire. The first phase that took effect on October 10 was meant to bring a surge in humanitarian aid for Gaza, including shelter.\n\nMr. Netanyahu made no public statement as he departed.\n\n Nowhere to escape \n\nIn the southern city of Khan Younis, blankets were soaked and clay ovens meant for cooking were swamped. Children wearing flip-flops waded through puddles. Some people used shovels or tin cans to remove water from tents. Others clawed at the ground to pry collapsed shelters from the mud.\n\n\"Puddles formed, and there was a bad smell,\" said Majdoleen Tarabein, displaced from Rafah in southern Gaza. \"The tent flew away. We do not know what to do or where to go.\" She and family members tried to wring muddy blankets dry by hand.\n\n\"When we woke up in the morning, we found that the water had entered the tent,\" said Eman Abu Riziq, also displaced in Khan Younis. \"These are the mattresses. They are all completely soaked.\" She said her family is still reeling from her husband's death less than two weeks ago.\n\n\"Where are the mediators? We do not want food. We do not want anything. We are exhausted. We just want mattresses and covers,\" said Fatima Abu Omar as she tried to prop up a collapsing shelter.\n\nAt least 12 people, including a two-week-old infant, have died since December 13 from hypothermia or weather-related collapses of war-damaged homes, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government.\n\nEmergency workers have warned people not to stay in damaged buildings, because they could collapse. But with much of the territory in rubble, there are few places to escape the rain. In July, the United Nations estimated that almost 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged.\n\nSince the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began, 414 people have been killed and 1,142 wounded in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. The overall Palestinian death toll from the war is at least 71,266. The ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.\n\n Aid groups call for more help \n\nHumanitarian deliveries into Gaza are falling far short of the amount called for under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire, according to aid organisations and an Associated Press analysis of the Israeli military's figures.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid said in the past week that 4,200 trucks with aid entered Gaza, plus eight garbage trucks to assist with sanitation, as well as tents and winter clothing. It refused to elaborate on the number of tents. Aid groups have said the need far outstrips the number that have entered.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, around 72,000 tents and 403,000 tarps have entered, according to Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\n\"People in Gaza are surviving in flimsy, waterlogged tents and among ruins,\" Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the top UN group overseeing aid in Gaza, wrote on social media. \"There is nothing inevitable about this. Aid supplies are not being allowed in at the scale required.\" \n\nCeasefire's next phase \n\nThough the ceasefire agreement has mostly held, its progress has slowed.\n\nIsrael has said it refuses to move to the next phase while the remains of the final hostage are still in Gaza. Hamas has said the destruction in Gaza has hampered efforts to find remains.\n\nChallenges in the next phase include the deployment of an international stabilisation force, a technocratic governing body for Gaza, the disarmament of the Hamas militant group and further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of truce violations.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/winter-rain-floods-gaza-camps-as-netanyahu-heads-for-us-meeting/article70447612.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/2cnuvn/article70447614.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-28T125214Z_152752450_RC2NPIABHK4S_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:25:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.64},{"id":389707598,"title":"Nancy Pelosi bets on Democratic House return, names the man she says is ‘ready’ to be speaker","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she is fully convinced that Democrats will regain control of the US House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections, paving the way for Hakeem Jeffries to assume the speakership.Speaking on ABC’s This Week, Pelosi argued that a Democratic victory would restore Congress’s institutional authority and reassert the House as an effective check on President Donald Trump.“Hakeem Jeffries is ready. He is eloquent. He is respected by the members; he is a unifier,” Pelosi said, expressing unambiguous confidence in her party’s current House leader.When asked whether she could imagine any circumstances in which Jeffries would fail to become speaker if Democrats won the chamber, Pelosi was unequivocal. “None.”Democrats eye the gavel as a tool of oversightPelosi suggested that a Jeffries-led House would move swiftly to reclaim congressional powers that she believes have been eroded under Republican control. These, she said, would include control over federal spending and the authority to demand transparency from executive agencies.On Sunday, she said a Jeffries-led House would have all the tools to push back against Trump, from controlling the purse strings to demanding information from federal agencies that are now keeping lawmakers in the dark.“It is hard to get something that he will sign because of the problem that he is, but you can hold up some of the things they may put forth,” Pelosi said.She also raised the prospect of renewed accountability measures should Democrats regain the majority, suggesting that any future impeachment proceedings would be a consequence of presidential conduct rather than partisan strategy.“She also suggested that if Trump were to face a third impeachment under a Democratic majority, he would have no one to blame but himself.”“Right now, the Republicans in the Congress have abolished the Congress,” she said. “They just do what the president insists that they do.”“That ends as soon as we have that gavel,” she said.Who is Nancy Pelosi?Nancy Pelosi is one of the most influential figures in modern American legislative history. First elected to Congress in 1987, she has represented San Francisco for nearly four decades and became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the US House in 2007.She reclaimed the speakership more than a decade later, overseeing the passage of major Democratic priorities, including the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama. Throughout her tenure, Pelosi was also a central figure in repeated confrontations with Donald Trump during his presidency.Now 85, Pelosi announced last month that she would not seek re-election, marking the end of a congressional career that has shaped Democratic strategy and legislative power for a generation.Who is Hakeem Jeffries?Hakeem Jeffries is the current Democratic leader in the US House of Representatives and is widely viewed as the face of the party’s next generation. Representing New York, Jeffries succeeded Pelosi as House Democratic leader and has worked to consolidate support across the party’s ideological wings.Known for his disciplined messaging and organisational skills, Jeffries has positioned himself as a consensus-builder capable of leading a narrowly divided chamber. Pelosi’s endorsement underscores his status as the party’s presumptive choice for speaker should Democrats secure a majority.A midterm election in US with high stakesPelosi’s remarks reflect growing Democratic optimism that next year’s midterm elections could reshape Washington’s balance of power. For Democrats, winning back the House would not only elevate Jeffries to the speakership but also revive Congress’s role as an assertive counterweight to the White House.As Pelosi framed it, the return of the gavel would mark a decisive shift. In her words, Democratic control would bring an abrupt end to what she described as congressional deference to presidential demands — and reopen a new chapter of legislative scrutiny in Washington.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/nancy-pelosi-predicts-democrats-will-win-the-house-in-mid-term-elections-and-hakeem-jeffries-will-become-speaker-11766965410176.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/28/1600x900/logo/pelosi_1766966121629_1766966121843.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:15:58","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":389708056,"title":"Takeaways from Trump’s meeting with Zelensky in Florida","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traded freezing, missile-tormented Kyiv on Sunday for the frescoed dining room at Mar-a-Lago, where he hoped to gain President Donald Trump’s sign-off on a revised 20-point peace plan to end the war in his country. Emerging after more than three hours of talks, neither man announced any major breakthrough in the grinding effort to end the conflict started by Russia in 2022. Both emphasized the process was complicated and would take more time. And Trump, who spoke by phone earlier in the day with Russian President Vladimir Putin, still offered a relatively sympathetic view of Moscow’s positions. Yet unlike some previous meetings, Trump praised Zelensky and remained confident that peace was near. “I do think we’re getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” the US president said. US, Ukrainian and European teams will continue meeting over the coming weeks, potentially in Washington, Trump said. He’s also expected to speak again with Putin, who would need to sign on to the terms of any potential peace deal. Here are the takeaways from Sunday’s meeting: The war either ends, or goes on indefinitely Trump, after he shook Zelensky’s hand on the Mar-a-Lago steps, insisted he had no deadline in mind for ending the Ukraine war. Yet he also seemed to suggest that now — with intensive talks underway led by his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner — was the ripest to finally end the nearly four-year war. “I think we’re in the very final stages of talking, and we’re going to see,” Trump said, adding, “It’ll either end or it’s going to go on for a long time, and millions of additional people are going to be killed.” Trump has been frustrated with the pace of peace talks and alternates between blaming Zelensky and Putin for the inability to end the conflict. After declaring during the 2024 campaign he’d be able to resolve the war within a day of taking office, he now says it’s harder than he imagined — in part because he hasn’t been able to leverage a warm personal relationship with Putin. Sunday’s meeting, which ended without any major announcement, seemed to underscore the difficulties. “There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues, but I think we’re doing very well,” Trump said after the meeting. “We’ve made a lot of progress today, but really we’ve made it over the last month. This is not a one-day process deal, this [is] very complicated stuff.” He offered a familiar timeline for when clarity might emerge on whether peace is possible. “It’s possible it doesn’t happen,” Trump said of a peace agreement. “In a few weeks, we’ll know one way or another.” Putin was absent, but not forgotten Putin did not leave Russia for a meeting in Palm Beach; outside of his trip to Alaska to meet Trump in August, he hasn’t been to the United States in years. Yet his physical absence from Sunday’s talks did not mean his presence wasn’t felt. Trump spoke to the Russian leader for more than an hour before the talks with Zelensky began, in a phone call the Kremlin said the US president requested. Trump also said he would speak with Putin again after his meeting with Zelensky. It’s a pattern that has disturbed Ukraine’s supporters in the past: Ahead of meeting Zelensky, Trump hears Putin’s point of view, and the subsequent meeting goes south. That sequence played out in October, when — after a call with Putin — Trump declined to provide Ukraine new long-range missiles after previously sounding open to the idea. This time, Trump’s talk with Putin didn’t preclude a positive meeting with Zelensky. But Trump still lauded Putin in one area: how he’s handled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, a key sticking point in the negotiations. “President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,” Trump said. “It’s a big step, when he’s not bombing that plant.” Trump said he still thought Putin was serious about peace. “He wants to see it happen. He wants to see it,” he said. “He told me very strongly, I believe him.” The last 10% Heading into the meeting, Zelensky said 90% of the terms of the peace plan had been agreed to, echoing a figure US officials have used. Afterward, Zelensky used the same figure, though Trump said he didn’t like using percentages. Still, it is the remaining 10% that have proved so difficult to resolve, a fact Zelensky seemed to allude to. The main sticking points include the fate of the nuclear plant, and the questions of land concession. Trump suggested it was better to make the land concessions now, before Russia invades further. “Some of that land has been taken. Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months,” he said. “And are you better off making a deal now?” Heading into the meeting, Zelensky had demonstrated new flexibility, saying he’s willing to put any peace agreement up for a referendum (Ukraine’s constitution requires any changes to its national boundaries be put up for a vote). But he said a ceasefire would be necessary to hold it. Russia, which launched a fresh barrage of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine ahead of Sunday’s talks, has refused any talk of ceasefire. And during Trump’s call with Putin, the two leaders expressed that they “generally share similar views” that a temporary truce will only prolong the conflict in Ukraine, according to Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov. He added that “given the situation on the front lines,” Ukraine should soon decide on what to do with the eastern Donbas region, the key territory sought by Putin. Trump said after his meeting with Zelensky that “we’re getting closer to an agreement” on the region’s fate, which he called “one of the big issues.” A complicated relationship Since their first, disastrous meeting in February, each meeting between Trump and Zelensky during Trump’s second term has been closely watched for its tone and tenor. None of their subsequent talks has devolved into such acrimony, though some have been described as difficult behind closed doors. Upon greeting Zelensky at his Palm Beach estate, Trump offered praise. “This gentleman has worked very hard, and is very brave, and his people are very brave,” Trump said. Zelensky began and concluded his remarks by saying thank you to Trump, notable given that the US president and Vice President JD Vance berated him in February for not being thankful to the American leaders for their role in the mediation. Trump has used Mar-a-Lago in the past to cultivate more personal relationships with his global counterparts, including Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While that did not appear to be the express purpose of Sunday’s meeting — Zelensky came to Palm Beach because Trump is spending the holidays here — the setting still provided a less formal backdrop than the White House’s Oval Office or Cabinet Room. “He walked in, he said, ‘This place is gorgeous,’” Trump said of Zelensky as the meeting ended. “I don’t think he wants to go to the White House anymore.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/28/politics/trump-zelensky-florida-meeting-takeaways","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2253059091.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:10:58","author":"Kevin Liptak","authors":["Kevin Liptak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":389709418,"title":"Trump says Ukraine-Russia peace ‘closer than ever’ after talks with Zelenskyy","text":"President Donald Trump on Sunday insisted Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace deal as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort, but he acknowledged that negotiations are complex and could still break down, leaving the war dragging on for years.\n\nThe president’s statements came after the two leaders met for a discussion that took place after what Mr. Trump described as an “excellent,” two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war nearly four years ago. Mr. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Mr. Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Mr. Trump said during a late afternoon news conference following the meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy, whom he repeatedly praised as “brave.”\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls as well as security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure it’s not invaded again in the future. After their discussion, they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy thanked Mr. Trump for his work. “Ukraine is ready for peace,” he said.\n\nTrump and Putin will speak again\n\nMr. Trump said he’d follow the meeting with another call to Mr. Putin. Earlier Sunday, Mr. Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side, lasted over an hour, and was “friendly, benevolent and businesslike.” Mr. Ushakov said Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin agreed to speak again “promptly” after Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy.\n\nBut Mr. Ushakov added that a “bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv” on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a “complete cessation” of hostilities.\n\nIn overnight developments, three guided aerial bombs launched by Russia struck private homes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the head of the local military administration, Vadym Lakh. Three people were injured and one man died, Mr. Lakh said in a post on the Telegram messenger app.\n\nThe strike came the day after Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing at least one person and wounding 27, Ukrainian authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in the early morning and continued for hours.\n\nMr. Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is “very serious” about ending the war.\n\n“I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also,” Mr. Trump told reporters as Mr. Zelenskyy stood by his side. “And I don’t say that negatively. I think, you probably have to. I don’t say that negatively. But I think, he hasn’t told me that, but there have been some explosions in various parts of Russia. It looks to me, like, I don’t know. I don’t think it came from the Congo.”\n\nMr. Trump noted that it was possible that the negotiations will fall apart.\n\n“In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think,” Mr. Trump said. “We could have something where one item that you’re not thinking about is a big item, breaks it up. Look, it’s been a very difficult negotiation. Very detailed.”\n\nThe face-to-face sit-down between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelenskyy underscored the apparent progress made by Mr. Trump’s top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans and continued to shape a proposal to end the fighting. Mr. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is “about 90% ready” – echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Mr. Trump’s chief negotiators met with Mr. Zelenskyy in Berlin earlier this month.\n\nDuring the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Mr. Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country’s bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.\n\n“Intensive” weeks ahead\n\nMr. Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed “certain substantive details” and cautioned “there is still work to be done on sensitive issues” and “the weeks ahead may also be intensive.”\n\nThe U.S. president has been working to end the war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Mr. Zelenskyy and Mr. Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the conflict. Long gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day. Indeed, on Sunday, Mr. Trump referred multiple times to the complexity of settling the conflict.\n\nAfter hosting Mr. Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Mr. Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and “stop at the battle line,” implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.\n\nPutin wants Russian gains kept, and more\n\nMr. Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.\n\nThe Kremlin also wants Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO. It warned that it wouldn’t accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a “legitimate target.”\n\nMr. Putin also has said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language, demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nMr. Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk – one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region – even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.\n\nMr. Ushakov cautioned that trying to reach a compromise could take a long time. He said U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nMr. Trump has been somewhat receptive to Mr. Putin’s demands, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.\n\nThis story was reported by the Associated Press.

My late maternal grandmother, a revered Iya Suna in Ota, raised me within the discipline of Islāmiyya. My first prayers were uttered in Arabic long before I learned English. Being a Christian by birth and, later, an ordained deacon, I have stood at the altar watching politicians crowd into churches and mosques, hoping to baptise ambition in holy water, anointing oil or other rites.\n\nThis dual heritage ─ mosque and church, Qur’an and Bible ─ has taught me the nobility of devotion in both traditions. It has also revealed how easily devotion can be twisted when priests become contractors, politicians patronise them, and prophecy and worship are turned into commodities. I recall former President Goodluck Jonathan and other nominal Christian politicians attempting to transform Holy Ghost Nights and church conventions into campaign-rally grounds ─ a moment when worship was subtly repurposed as a political amphitheatre. I have watched former Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo ─ himself a pastor ─ toggle constantly between pulpit and podium, blurring the line between sermon and stump speech. Even the wife of President Bola Tinubu bears an ordination certificate, and the titles Alhaji or Mallam remain prized ─ a reminder that, in Nigeria, religious credentials have become political capital, traded as readily as manifestos.\n\nIt is now routine for public-office holders and aspirants to junket from church to mosque, cloaking ambition in liturgy and canvassing votes by subterfuge. The spectacle intensifies during election cycles, when sanctuaries are converted into campaign halls and clerical endorsement is treated as electoral currency. The circus – familiar and disquieting – will commence anew in the coming months, an annual pageant where faith is staged not for devotion but for power. As I craft this on Boxing Day, a few instances of this uneasy marriage of statecraft and homily make me uneasy:\n\nNigeria’s skyline is punctuated by minarets and steeples, loudspeakers and choirs. Faith is woven into the rhythm of daily life, yet devotion has become a commodity: prophets draft invoices, imams broker contracts, shrines host campaign rallies. Kierkegaard warned that religion reduced to spectacle loses its inward truth; it reads like The Emperor’s New Clothes, where everyone applauds what is plainly hollow. When liturgy is priced, and the sacred becomes saleable, prayer ceases to be confession and turns into performance.\n\nDecember 2025 offered a parable of Nigeria’s uneasy marriage of politics and religion. Minister of Power Abdulwaheed Adebayo Adelabu ─ the man whose office should light the nation’s dark landscape ─ petitioned the Department of State Services, alleging that Primate (a title that, frankly, does not originate from Scripture) Elijah Ayodele demanded N150m, a 1,000 APC flags and ceremonial trumpets as the price of “spiritual intercession” for his political ascent. Ayodele’s retort was no less flamboyant: dismissing Adelabu as a “small boy” and boasting that his shoes and “toy” car each cost more than N150m.\n\nThis was not merely a quarrel between a Muslim minister and a Christian priest; it was akin to the Midas myth. Wherever the priest laid his hand, naira was expected to flow, turning devotion into transaction. In Yoruba storytelling, Esu the trickster thrives on ambiguity, testing the moral fibre of men. Here the ambiguity was stark: was prayer a sacrament or a contract? In democratic terms, the answer matters, because when sanctuaries become auction houses, citizens are taught to expect miracles in exchange for money rather than accountability in exchange for votes.\n\nThe Dasukigate scandal remains one of Nigeria’s most infamous corruption sagas, remembered chiefly for the diversion of billions in oil revenue. At its core was the trial of former National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki and his accomplices, facing 32 counts of misappropriation, criminal breach of trust and dishonest release of funds.\n\nAn EFCC investigator, Adariko Michael, testified that N2.2bn was spent on prayers in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia to “win the war against Boko Haram”, while another N1.4bn was earmarked for a “national prayer”. These allocations appeared under odious sub-headings in the defence budget, even as soldiers on the frontlines lacked ammunition, intelligence and basic supplies.\n\nIt reads like satire: a nation outsourcing victory against insurgency to incense and supplication, while its troops fought with empty magazines and inadequate reconnaissance. Swift’s Modest Proposal comes to mind ─ absurd remedies exposing the folly of leaders. In this case, the absurdity was policy: billions diverted to clerics while the war effort starved. Nigeria’s leaders may have believed that a well-timed supplication could serve as a psychic shield, but the evidence was faith-based rather than fact-based – and soldiers paid the price in blood.\n\nSheikh Ahmad Gumi’s advocacy for negotiation with bandits continues to ignite controversy. He insists dialogue is the path to peace; anecdotes from Kaduna tell of armed men arriving at “peace meetings” only to return emboldened. Critics argue such encounters legitimise insurgents; supporters say temporary cease-fires spared communities from immediate attack. Aesop’s tale of the farmer and the snake speaks of misplaced mercy: warming the serpent only to invite its bite. Mediation without transparency risks becoming complicity.\n\nThen, the night of Christmas arrived, not with a prophetic whisper but with a literal crack of thunder. In the quiet hills of north-west Zamfara and Sokoto, the sky was ripped apart by a roar that sounded less like prayer than a mythic storm. U.S. fighter jets, swift as hawks, rained precision munitions on a Boko Harām/ISWAP/bandit/ISIS’ training camp that had festered in the shadows.\n\nAesop’s farmer-and-snake fable resurfaces: the bitten farmer learns that pleading to the serpent’s “good nature” will not heal the wound; only decisive action can end the threat. The cratered mud-brick barracks, shattered communications tower, and smouldering fuel depots became the literal “crack of the whip” that snapped terror’s grip.\n\nWhile Dasukigate siphoned billions into “national prayers” and “spiritual intercession,” and Gumi’s commercialised peace efforts floundered, the strike needed only a handful of missiles and a coalition that refused to barter with incense. The contrast is stark: a treasury emptied into prayers that never echoed on the battlefield versus a single, decisive flash that silenced a hundred voices of violence.\n\nIn the Yoruba myth, Sango, the thunder god, wields lightning to punish the wicked. Donald Trump’s cold, metallic lightning performed a Sango-like act ─ delivering divine force from the sky, not from a shrine, bypassing the endless cycle that turns prayer into political currency and negotiation with satanic forces. Beneath a lone palm that once framed a televised prayer rally, families now bow in silent thanks. The ash-filled ground where terror plotted reminds us that concrete action can be sacred in a way words never are. The farmer’s plough ─ this airstrike ─ cuts the serpent’s hide; faith turned into a fiscal safety valve cannot replace the hard-won thunder of decisive force.\n\nFrom whispers of secret oaths in Ogun’s sacred groves to ritual pledges that reportedly supersede constitutional oaths, Nigeria’s politics has long been shadowed by ceremonies of fear. This Ogun scenario is emblematic of what happens across the states during this season of transition. Governance is recast as a masquerade performed beneath trees rather than within parliamentary chambers. It echoes the Janus problem ─ faces turned both to the shrine and the constitution ─ double loyalty that corrodes public trust.\n\nFormer Anambra Governor Chris Ngige confessed to being taken at midnight to the dreaded Okija shrine, where he swore allegiance to political godfathers who financed his ascent. The shrine, feared for its occult rites, functioned as a parallel institution of power, replacing constitutional vows with spiritual ones. Plato’s Allegory of the Cave comes to mind: a city ruled by fear sees only shadows. In Okija, like most shrines, superstition eclipsed the bright ideals of law, and oath-taking became a politics of night.\n\nIn February 2023, a viral audio captured Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi addressing Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Chapel with “Yes, Daddy”, urging mobilisation for the election and framing the contest as a “religious war.” Similar rhetoric surfaced in mosques, warning congregants against voting for “infidels”. This is Nigeria’s Cassandra moment: prophetic language harnessed for faction rather than justice. When elections are cast as holy wars, the electorate fractures into sectarian tribes and the common good is drowned by chants at the altar.\n\nReligion can be wielded as a wedge rather than for profit. Former Secretary to the Government, Babachir Lawal, quit the All Progressives Congress in protest against the Tinubu–Shettima “Muslim-Muslim” ticket, pledging to rally Northern Christians against exclusion. It is akin to Babel, where language ─ and by extension creed ─ fractures community. Identity mobilised as an instrument reshapes party cohesion, not by persuasion but by partition.\n\nIn 2023, the Nigeria Pilgrims Welfare Board disclosed N14.84bn spent to sponsor 4,771 pilgrimages to Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Governors called it upliftment; critics saw electoral theatre. In one northern state, buses bearing pilgrims were festooned with campaign posters; in another, returning travellers were greeted with party flags and “thank-you rallies”. Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales reminds us that pilgrimages often carry gossip and ambition along the road. Sacred journeys became odysseys of patronage: the itinerary mattered less than the loyalty stamped on tickets.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo’s My Watch recounts his erstwhile deputy Atiku Abubakar’s penchant for consultations with marabouts. In one such interface, they foretold victory for him; later reports documented holy men predicting Obasanjo’s death. Aides whisper of campaign calendars aligned to astrologers’ charts; one governor delayed his announcement until a marabout confirmed “the stars were aligned”. It echoes the Oracle of Delphi: rulers seeking destiny in riddles and marching to ruin by misreading them. Policy is neglected while prophecy dictates time, and power drifts from reason to enchantment.\n\nFrom military despot Ibrahim Babangida’s habitual “God willing” to today’s “Walahi Tallahi”, pious phrasing often deflects scrutiny. Words without truth are merely tales. This is akin to The Boy Who Cried Wolf: invocations repeated until they lose meaning, leaving citizens deaf when truth is finally needed. Democracy requires promises kept, not incantations uttered.\n\nThen, there’s Nurudeen Alowonle Yusuf, the President’s Aide-de-Camp, who rose from colonel in January to brigadier general by December ─ a trajectory so vertical it leaves the barracks dizzy. Interestingly, in his hometown, Ilumona in Kwara State, he wears a crown as oba. Villagers wait for royal decrees while their monarch appears on television saluting superiors in Abuja. Soldiers, kinsmen and women joke that “our Kabiyesi carries files instead of sceptres”, while palace courtiers whisper that the throne feels abandoned. Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, offers a distant echo: a ruler playing servant confuses the audience. Here, the masquerade risks mocking democracy rather than saving it. Dual authority blurs duty and privilege; governance requires clarity of roles.\n\nThese vignettes are not isolated scandals; they are symptoms of a systemic erosion of democratic ethics. The political class is enthralled by prophecy, addicted to enchantment and bankrupt of reason. Christianity calls for humility, service and sacrifice; Islam enjoins justice, compassion and submission to God; African traditional religion stresses reverence for ancestors, communal balance and harmony. Yet many who hold both faith and state authority embody the antithesis: opulent pastors preaching sacrifice, imams brokering contracts and politicians replacing constitutional loyalty with secret oaths.\n\nKarl Barth cautioned that religion without ethics is idolatry. Every naira spent on enchanted contracts is siphoned from schools, hospitals and barracks. Every oath whispered in a grove betrays the constitutional promise made to citizens. Every campaign staged within a sanctuary desecrates that sanctuary. The cost is not only fiscal but moral, eroding trust and corroding democracy.\n\nAs Nigeria approaches another election season, the Christian Association of Nigeria and the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs must restore integrity. They should enforce a unified Code of Conduct that bans monetised prayers, political contracts and partisan use of sacred spaces; clergy should undergo ethical training, and violations should be publicly condemned.\n\nNigeria cannot be sustained on shrines, spectacles, or sanctuaries turned into campaign halls. When faith becomes currency and prophecy a procurement, the nation loses its compass. What is needed are leaders who treat religion as conscience, not commodity – so the candles or incense of faith burn steadily enough to light and deodorise a republic built on truth, humility and service.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a prosperous 2026, Nigeria!","summary":"Explore the complex relationship between faith and power in Nigeria, where religion is a political commodity and sanctuaries become campaign grounds.

The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.\n\n“Under my leadership, our country will not allow radical Islamic terrorism to prosper. May God bless our military, and Merry Christmas to all, including the dead terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.”\n\nThe military strikes have since been framed as an operation approved by the Federal Government, with more strikes likely.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, Edun stressed that Nigeria is not at war with itself or any other country, and that the action is part of ongoing efforts to safeguard citizens and protect economic activity.\n\n“The operation in question was precise, intelligence-led, and focused exclusively on terrorist elements that threaten innocent lives, national stability, and economic activity. Far from destabilising markets or weakening confidence, such actions strengthen the foundations of peace, protect productive communities, and reinforce the conditions required for sustainable growth. Security and economic stability are inseparable; every effort to safeguard Nigerians is, by definition, pro-growth and pro-investment,” he said. \n\nThe finance minister also underscored Nigeria’s solid macroeconomic performance, noting GDP growth of 3.98 per cent in the third quarter of 2025, following a 4.23 per cent expansion in Q2. Inflation has continued its downward trend for the seventh consecutive period, falling below 15 per cent reflecting improving price stability.\n\nHe maintained, “Our financial markets remain resilient. Domestic and international debt markets are stable and functioning efficiently, supported by prudent fiscal management. Over the past year, Nigeria has received credit rating upgrades from Moody’s, Fitch, and Standard & Poor’s—clear, independent endorsements of the strength of our reforms and the credibility of our economic direction. We have maintained fiscal discipline, prioritised efficiency, and protected macroeconomic stability—demonstrating resilience in the face of external shocks.\n\n“As President Bola Tinubu noted in his address last week, our overarching objective for 2026 is to consolidate the gains of 2025, strengthen Nigeria’s economic resilience, and continue building a sustainable, inclusive, and growth-oriented economy.\n\n“The actions we take today—on security, reforms, and fiscal discipline—are aligned with that goal. As markets reopen on Monday, 29 December 2025, investors can be confident that Nigeria remains focused, reform-driven, and committed to stability. The fundamentals are strengthening, the policy direction is clear, and the resolve of this administration—to protect lives, secure prosperity, and grow the economy—is unwavering.”\n\nAs markets reopen on Monday, Edun reassured investors that Nigeria remains open for business, anchored in peace, and firmly focused on the future.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that when Trump issued the threat of a military strike in early November, both the naira and the Nigerian Exchange reacted bearishly. The naira slid from its 2025 peak of N1,421.73/$ to N1,436.34/$ — a sharp 1.03 per cent decline, or N14.61, on November 3, 2025. At the parallel market, the naira also weakened to N1,455.00/$.\n\nOn the same day, the Nigerian Exchange Limited’s All-Share Index contracted by 0.25 per cent to settle at 153,739.11 points, bringing year-to-date gains to 49.37 per cent. The trading trend also led to a loss of N245.88bn in market capitalisation.\n\nAt the bond market, Cowry Assets Management indicated that appetite for Nigerian Eurobonds weakened, with average yields expanding by five basis points to 7.70 per cent. This was indicative of bearish sentiment and defensive positioning in the offshore debt space, driven by prevailing macroeconomic headwinds and heightened geopolitical risk aversion across emerging market credit.","summary":"Finance Minister Wale Edun assures investors of Nigeria&#8217;s economic stability, stating a recent joint security operation reinforces confidence.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/nigeria-not-at-war-edun-tells-investors/","url":"https://punchng.com/nigeria-not-at-war-edun-tells-investors/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/14193828/Olawale-Edun.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:03:22","author":"Oluwakemi Abimbola,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Oluwakemi Abimbola","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.081},{"id":389706746,"title":"Trump Almost Blabbed About Major Drug Policy Change Before It Was Official","text":"President Donald Trump had to be begged not to spill the beans about a seismic change to U.S. drug policy which was made this month, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal published on Saturday.\n\nAfter extensive lobbying and some generous donations from major players in the marijuana industry, the president was convinced to follow through with his campaign promise to shift cannabis from a Schedule I to Schedule III substance during a meeting with Kim Rivers, the CEO of Florida-based cannabis company Trulieve, Trump confidante Howard Kessler and Florida Sheriff Gordon Smith in early December.\n\nEager to share the news immediately, Trump told the people in the room he planned to announce the decision on Truth Social before an executive order was even drafted.\n\nSmith remembered things getting heated as Oval Office insiders tried to stop their boss from blabbing, according to the Journal.\n\n“The lawyers and his staff, they started yelling, ’No sir, you can’t yet;

Cole Jr., who was arrested earlier this month on charges of placing pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees, should remain locked up as the case moves forward. \n\nThe memo provides the most detailed government account of statements Cole is alleged to have made to investigators and points to evidence, including bomb-making equipment found at his home after his arrest, that officials say connects him to the act. The homemade bombs did not detonate and were discovered Jan. 6, the afternoon that rioters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an effort to halt the certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nCole denied to investigators that his actions were connected to Congress or the events of Jan. 6, the memo says. But after initially disputing that he had any involvement in the pipe bombs, prosecutors say, he confessed to placing them outside the RNC and DNC and acknowledged feeling disenchanted by the election results and sympathetic to claims by Trump and some of his allies that the contest had been stolen.\n\nAccording to the memo, he told agents who interviewed him that if people “feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being — you know, relegated null and void, then, like, someone needs to speak up, right? Someone up top. You know, just to, just to at the very least calm things down.” \n\nHe said “something just snapped” after “watching everything, just everything getting worse” and wanted to do something “to the parties” because “they were in charge,” according to the Justice Department’s memo. It says that when Cole was asked why he had placed the explosives at the RNC and DNC, he responded, “I really don’t like either party at this point.”\n\nCole was arrested on the morning of Dec. 4 at his Woodbridge, Virginia, house in what law enforcement officials described as a major breakthrough in a nearly five-year-old investigation. His lawyers will also have an opportunity to state their position on detention ahead of a hearing set for Tuesday in Washington’s federal court.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/pipe-bomb-jan-6-fbi-157854dadb81c4d7663553412fd19383","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/be1ee08/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6344x4230+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F71%2F58%2F0712540ab287cc1c471dcb0bac44%2F4fdd5cfa796746a78040d0142b409c71","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:00:40","author":"Eric Tucker","authors":["Eric Tucker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":389716114,"title":"Kennedy Center Christmas Eve jazz concert canceled after name change","text":"NEW YORK CITY, New York: Jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled a planned Christmas Eve concert at the Kennedy Center after the White House announced that President Donald Trump would be added to the list of invitees.\n\nThe concert is a holiday tradition dating back more than 20 years.\n\nThe building's facade reads The Donald J.

Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin envoy, said Trump's conversation with Putin was 'good and very productive.' He shared the update on X shortly before Trump was set to meet Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, where the talks were expected to take place in the resort's main dining room.\n\nThe phone call, which lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, came hours after Russia launched a major attack on Kyiv, killing two people and injuring at least four others. CNN reported that this was the first direct conversation between Trump and Putin since October call this year, when both leaders had agreed to hold a summit in Budapest. That proposed meeting was later cancelled by Trump, who said it would be a waste of time.\n\nZelenskyy arrived in the United States on Sunday to meet Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Before sitting down with the US president, the Ukrainian leader held consultations with NATO and European Union allies as part of his diplomatic outreach, CNN reported. \n\nEarlier in the day, Zelenskyy spoke by phone with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, briefing him on preparations for the Trump meeting and the latest developments on the battlefield.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said, 'Thank you, Keir, for the constant coordination! I started my morning in Florida today with a detailed phone call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. We discussed preparations for the meeting with President Trump, as well as all our contacts with European partners. I informed him on the situation on the frontline and on the consequences of Russian strikes. We greatly value the United Kingdom's support. We will stay in contact!'\n\nZelenskyy also said the coming days could be crucial for efforts to end the war, even as Russia continues to step up missile and drone attacks across Ukraine amid intense diplomatic activity.\n\nRussia is not represented at Sunday's meeting in Florida, and there is still no clarity on whether Moscow is ready to accept an immediate ceasefire. Trump has earlier said that both Russia and Ukraine have, at times, acted as obstacles to peace.\n\nA day before the meeting, Putin warned that Russia would continue its military campaign if talks failed.\n\nAccording to Russian state media cited by CNN, the Russian president said that 'if Kyiv is not willing to resolve the matter peacefully, Russia will accomplish all the aims of the special military operation by military means.'

The seas are under control, he says, and the land will be much easier. \n\nAs I've written many times, a lot of folks have taken this to mean he's threatening a boots-on-the-ground war in Venezuela. Even though Trump says he won't rule such a thing out, if you listen carefully to what the president and Marco Rubio say about it, this is not what he's is talking about. \n\nHe's talking about going after the routes, facilities, and resources the narcos use in Central and South America to keep their drug trafficking gigs alive. And many of our allies in the region, like Ecuador, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Paraguay, have been working with us to try to put an end to the hold drug traffickers have on our hemisphere. \n\nThat said, I have no doubt that this includes putting some extra pressure on Nicolás Maduro. And it's entirely possible we just did that, assuming what the president said is true. \n\nOn Friday, Trump appeared on WABC's The Cats & Cosby Show with host John Catsimatidis and casually threw this little tidbit out there: \n\nEvery time, I knock out a boat, we save 25,000 American lives. It's very simple. And what's happening is they're having a hard time employment-wise...they can't get anybody. Oh, and we just knocked out, I don't know if you read or you saw, they have a big plant or a big facility where they send — where the ships come from. Two nights ago, we knocked that out, so we him them very hard. But drugs are down 97%. Can you believe it? \n\nHere's the audio: \n\n🚨 Trump claims US carried out secret strike on land target in Venezuela\"And we just talked out, I don't know if you read or you saw, they [Venezuela] have a big plant or a big facility where the ships come from. Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard.\" pic.twitter.com/jui7b66U3G— Conflict Radar (@Conflict_Radar) December 28, 2025\n\nWell, first of all, no, we haven't read or seen it because, seemingly, no one knew about it. There are no media reports. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon has confirmed it. Doesn't mean it didn't happen — every single military operation doesn't come with notes for the press. Just keep that in mind. \n\nThere's also the fact that Maduro hasn't, so far, said anything about it. He likes to call the narco-boats \"poor fishermen killed by the imperialists,\" so I have no doubt that if we blew up some sort of drug-related facility on Venezuelan land, he'd be all over state media talking about how we bombed some kind food factory and now the Venezuelan people can't eat. Joke's on him — the Venezuelan people can't eat because he bombed their economy years ago. \n\nSo, that's really all the information we have: a vague statement from the president. \n\nIn the meantime, there's a lot of speculation on X about what exactly this plant or facility is and where it's located. And this is pure speculation, so please take it with a grain of salt, but I'm going to share it anyway. One idea is that it might have been the Primazol company site in the state of Zulia near Maracaibo. There was reportedly some sort of explosion and fire in that area early in the morning on Christmas Eve. Both a statement put out by the company and satellite imagery appear to show proof of that. \n\nIs this the site of the attack in Venezuela of the \"Chemical Plant\" . Speculation is that this was the attack by Trump Adminstration on the #drug_lab in Venezuela. #Primazol is the name of the company. San Francisco, #Maracaibo, #San Francisco, #Zulia, #VENEZUELA pic.twitter.com/VaXq2zeRJP— Aviation and Naval Assets (@AirAssets) December 28, 2025\n\nThis is said to be a video of the aftermath. I'm also seeing Venezuelan people on X reporting that they heard the explosion. \n\n#24Dic📹#Sucesos Una nueva gran explosión se reportó desde la Zona Industrial del municipio San Francisco, estado Zulia, la madrugada de este 24 de diciembre.Vía: @Jhormancruz1#SanFrancisco pic.twitter.com/KM74H69lRH— El Martillo Venezuela (@ElMartilloVen) December 24, 2025\n\nAgain, I'm not saying this is the work of the U.S. military. Based on everything I've read, Primazol is a legitimate chemical company, and the timing may very well be a coincidence. The cause of the explosion is currently \"under investigation.\" \n\nI'm sure we'll find out more in the days to come, and I'll keep you updated as best I can. \n\nIf you've ever considered becoming a PJ Media VIP member, now is the perfect time.

I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said.\n\nThe two leaders briefly addressed reporters outside the Florida estate before heading into talks focused on a new proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Russia. Trump later described the discussions as “highly productive” and said diplomatic efforts were nearing a decisive phase.\n\n“I think we're very, we're in the final stages of talking, and we're going to see. Otherwise, it's going to go on for a long time,” he said, adding that there was no fixed deadline for a deal.\n\nTrump said Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he spoke to shortly before meeting Zelenskyy, was “very serious” about peace and that a “strong agreement” was being shaped to guarantee Ukraine’s security, with European countries playing a role.\n\n“I just had a very good and productive telephone call with President Putin of Russia,” Trump said earlier on his Truth Social platform, noting that the two leaders would speak again following the Florida talks.\n\nZelenskyy, speaking alongside Trump, said significant progress had been made on a proposed peace framework. He said a 20-point peace plan was now 90 per cent agreed, while security guarantees, Kyiv’s central demand, had been settled.\n\n“Security guarantees are the key milestone in achieving lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe added that Ukrainian and European delegations would continue technical discussions in the coming weeks to finalise remaining issues, with further talks expected to be hosted by Trump in Washington in January.\n\nLand disputes unresolved\n\nDespite progress on security arrangements, eastern Ukraine remains a major sticking point. Trump acknowledged that disagreements persist over Donbas.\n\n“It’s unresolved but it’s getting a lot closer,” he said when asked about the region.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s position on territorial integrity. “We respect the land we control,” he said, adding that Kyiv’s stance on Donbas is “very clear” and that “we have a different position to Russia”.\n\nHours before the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, Russia renewed pressure on Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Donbas region. Kremlin diplomatic adviser Yuri Ushakov said Kyiv should take the “brave decision” to pull out “without delay”, calling it a key Russian condition for any agreement.\n\nUshakov said Moscow opposed any temporary ceasefire, arguing it would only prolong the conflict. “Russia and the United States share the same position, which is that the Ukrainian and European proposal for a temporary ceasefire (...) would only prolong the conflict and lead to a resumption of hostilities,” he said.\n\nTrump echoed that view, saying Putin had not agreed to a ceasefire because he did not want fighting to pause only to resume later.\n\nAsked about the timeline for ending the war, Trump said a resolution could be reached within weeks, while acknowledging uncertainty.\n\n“In a few weeks we will know one way or the other,” he said.\n\nTrump said he could eventually see the US, Ukraine and Russia sitting together for direct talks and remained open to visiting Ukraine after securing an agreement. He also said he had offered to address Ukraine’s parliament if Zelenskyy felt it would be helpful.\n\nWhile posing with Zelenskyy outside Mar-a-Lago, Trump repeated his belief that both Moscow and Kyiv wanted a deal.\n\n“Yes, I do (believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about peace this time). I think he is. I think they both are...They have to make a deal...Too many people died and both Presidents want to make a deal...I've settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one...We are going to have a great meeting today and this gentleman has worked very hard and he and his people are very brave...I am also calling President Putin back after the meeting, and we will continue the negotiations...” he said.","url":"https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/trump-says-ukraine-peace-talks-in-final-stages-donbas-dispute-unresolved-after-zelenskyy-talks-article-13745756.html","image":"https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/12/20251228233945_AFP__20251228__897B9KL__v1__HighRes__UsUkraineTrumpZelenskyWar.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:40:07","author":"Moneycontrol World Desk","authors":["Moneycontrol World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":389715228,"title":"Trump: Ukraine peace deal ‘closer than ever before’ after talks with Zelensky","text":"Donald Trump said talks to secure a US-backed peace deal for Ukraine are “closer than ever before” after he met with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Florida.\n\nBut the two leaders acknowledged there are still “thorny issues” remaining.\n\nMr Trump, the US president, has said talks on a security guarantee – a key plank of a potential Ukraine peace deal – are “close to 95%” done.\n\nDuring a joint press conference, Mr Trump said: “I really believe we’re probably… closer than, by far, closer than ever before – with both parties.\n\n“We had sometimes when he was close and President Putin wasn’t, they would have President Putin was close and he wasn’t.\n\n“You saw that in the White House, but, but I think they both want to see it happen.”\n\nHe said there were “one or two very thorny issues” remaining.\n\nOur society has to choose and has to vote, because it's their land, the land not of one person.

A six-member mission from that organisation, working with local medics, treated people affected by Hurricane Melissa, in that region. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nHoward Campbell \n December 28, 2025\n\n\n\n\n US medical team brings dental care and trauma support to Westmoreland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team from Emirates Facial and Dental Implants Center in New York were at Little London Primary School in Westmoreland from December 17-20, treating people struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa.\n\nThe six-member team of dentists, psychologists and nurses treated adults and children in that parish which was one of the hardest hit by the Category 5 hurricane which made landfall in Jamaica on October 28.\n\nMorvia Reid-Williams, Chief Financial Officer of Emirates Facial and Dental Implants Center, said the scenes in Westmoreland were far different from their previous visits.\n\n“Our mission found many people living with great anxiety. The thought of their hurricane experience continues to traumatise victims as they struggle from day-to-day to make ends meet,” she told the Observer Online.\n\n“One of my biggest concerns was how the children were faring. When you’re a child, what happens to you sticks to you. Therefore, they have a place to compartmentalise this trauma and learn ways how to deal with it.”\n\nOver 50 children, ages three to 12, received trauma counselling. Her team also conducted checks for hypertension and glucose levels, as well as treated wounds and fungal infection.\n\nThe biggest concern was oral hygiene.\n\n“More than 80 per cent of the patients we saw had dental emergencies. There were children as young as five years-old who we were told had gone for weeks with sleepless nights due to severe toothache,” Reid-Williams disclosed. “Adults with broken and decayed teeth resulted in severe swelling and infections that distorted their faces,” she added.\n\nWith the assistance of United Mission of Goodwill and Jamaica 4 Life, over 1000 care packages were distributed throughout Little London. Patients at the Savanna-la-Mar Hospital’s maternity ward were presented with personal care packages for their babies. Other wards received medication, wound care supplies and surgical gowns.\n\nLittle London is special to Reid-Williams’ husband, Dr Dwight Williams. A respected oral surgeon based in The Bronx, New York, he was born there and retains close ties to his hometown by organising medical missions to Westmoreland.\n\nSt Elizabeth, Hanover, St James and Trelawny were the other parishes that felt Hurricane Melissa’s wrath. The destructive storm caused 45 deaths, left thousands of people homeless, without electricity and damaged hospitals and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: dental care Emirates Facial and Dental Implants Center Westmoreland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trelawny teacher holds fast to hope after Hurricane Melissa destroys home \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 28, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Long before her home collapsed in the heavy winds of Hurricane Melissa on October 28, Trelawny teacher and businesswoman Joan Mont... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police seize illegal firearm in St Elizabeth operation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 28, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The St Elizabeth Police have recovered another prohibited weapon during an operation in the parish.

Otherwise, it’s going to go on for a long time, and millions of additional people will be killed,” said Trump, adding he did not have a deadline for the process.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, good for everybody.”\n\nHe added there would be “a strong agreement” to guarantee Ukraine’s security, one that would involve European countries.\n\n“We have two willing parties. We have two willing countries … The people of Ukraine want [the war] to end, and the people of Russia want it to end, and the two leaders want it to end,” Trump said.\n\nRussia intensified its attacks on Ukraine’s capital in the days before the Florida meeting.\n\nZelenskyy, by Trump’s side, said he and the US president would discuss issues of territorial concessions, which have so far been a red line for his country. He said his negotiators and Trump’s advisers “have discussed how to move step by step and bring peace closer” and would continue to do so in Sunday’s meeting.\n\nDuring recent talks, the US agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO.\n\nThe proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country’s bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.\n\nOleksandr Kraiev, an analyst with the think-tank Ukrainian Prism, said the people of Ukraine are “quite cynical” about the talks brokered by the United States.\n\n“We tried this in 2015, 2016, 2017, and unfortunately each time the Russians broke even the ceasefire regime, not even talking about the peace process,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“So we have little faith that a proper peace process will take place. As of now we’re striving for a ceasefire as a precondition for any kind of talks… We cannot trust the Russians with a peace deal, but a ceasefire is something we’re working on.”\n\nTrump’s upbeat tone comes despite widespread scepticism in Europe about Putin’s intentions after Russia carried out another massive bombardment of the Ukrainian capital just as Zelenskyy headed to Florida.\n\nBefore Zelenskyy arrived, Trump spoke with Putin by phone for more than an hour and said he planned to speak again after the Zelenskyy meeting – catching Ukrainian leaders off guard, reported Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi.\n\n“From what we’re hearing, the Zelenskyy delegation here have been blindsided yet again by Donald Trump. And according to the Russians, it was at the Americans’ insistence there should be a call with Vladimir Putin the hour before Zelenskyy arrived,” said Rattansi, speaking from Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, while there is talk about land concessions from Ukraine’s side, they are outside the framework Zelenskyy is hoping for.\n\nThe Kremlin gave a more pointed readout of Trump’s talks with Putin, saying the US leader agreed a mere ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict” as it demanded Ukraine compromise on territory.\n\nZelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.\n\nPutin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognised as Russian territory. He also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces have not captured.\n\nKyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.\n\nTrump has been somewhat receptive to Putin’s conditions, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region, and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/us-president-trump-says-russia-ukraine-truce-talks-in-final-stages/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/afp_695183777840-1766949751-gDJTW9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:38:20","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":389705066,"title":"Trump, Zelenskyy say Ukraine peace deal close but 'thorny issues' remain after Florida talks","text":"President Donald Trump said Sunday that peace talks to end the war in Ukraine are close to completion after a meeting in Florida with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with both leaders citing major progress on a 20-point plan while acknowledging unresolved disputes over territory, ceasefire terms and Ukrainian approval. Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to reporters following their meeting at Mar-a-Lago, describing weeks of negotiations involving U.S., Ukrainian, European Union and NATO officials that have moved a potential peace framework close to the finish line, though several high-stakes issues remain unresolved. Trump said negotiations have intensified over the past month and suggested discussions are far more advanced than at any previous point in the war, while cautioning that final agreements depend on resolving a small number of difficult questions. \"We could be very close,\" Trump said. \"There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues. But I think we’re doing very well. We made a lot of progress today, but really, we’ve made it over the last month. This is not a one-day process. It’s very complicated stuff.\" ZELENSKYY READY TO PRESENT NEW PEACE PROPOSALS TO US AND RUSSIA AFTER WORKING WITH EUROPEAN TALKS Zelenskyy echoed that assessment, confirming that negotiators have largely agreed on the framework of a deal and crediting sustained diplomacy across multiple international meetings leading up to the Florida talks. He said negotiations have taken place over several weeks in cities including Geneva, Miami, Berlin and at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, with American and Ukrainian teams working toward a shared peace framework. \"We discussed all the aspects of the peace framework, which includes – and we have great achievements – a 20-point peace plan, 90% agreed,\" Zelenskyy said. MOMENTUM BUILDS IN UKRAINE PEACE PUSH, BUT EXPERTS FEAR PUTIN WON’T BUDGE Both leaders said European and NATO officials were closely involved in the process, with a joint call held following the meeting that included senior leaders from across the continent and international institutions. Zelenskyy said teams are expected to meet again in the coming weeks to finalize remaining issues and that Trump has agreed to potentially host further talks in Washington with European leaders and a Ukrainian delegation. Despite the progress, territory – particularly the status of Donbas – remains one of the most difficult unresolved issues, with Trump and Zelenskyy acknowledging differing positions between Ukraine and Russia. FINNISH PRESIDENT SAYS RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL CLOSER THAN ANY POINT DURING THE WAR Trump suggested that time could be a critical factor in negotiations, warning that delays could result in further territorial losses as fighting continues. \"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months. Are you better off making a deal now?\" Zelenskyy stressed that any final agreement would need to comply with Ukrainian law and reflect the will of the Ukrainian people, potentially requiring parliamentary approval or a national referendum. \"Our society, too, has to choose and decide who has to vote, because it’s their land – the land not of one person,\" Zelenskyy said. \"It’s the land of our nation for a lot of generations.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Trump said polling shows strong public support for ending the war and reiterated his desire to bring the conflict to a close, citing the scale of casualties on both sides. \"We want to see it ended,\" Trump said. \"I want it ended because I don’t want to see so many people dying.

But he didn’t quite close the deal.\n\n“I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,” Trump said after the meeting at a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, who was clad in a black jacket and button-down shirt.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Trump — who has been stymied in his attempts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine — acknowledged that the situation is \"pretty complex, but not that complex\" and there was no deadline for reaching a deal except \"getting the war ended.\"\n\nA few hours later, Zelenskyy said the leaders reached 100% agreement on bilateral security guarantees for Ukraine, with the current 20-point peace plan and U.S.-Europe-Ukraine security guarantees “almost” hashed out. \n\n“Some of that land has been taken,” he said, referring to Ukraine. “Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you're better off making a deal now.”\n\nAmong other unresolved issues is a potential free trade zone in the Donbas region.“That's a very tough issue, but one that I think will get resolved,” Trump said, later acknowledging Russia’s insistence on Ukraine giving up the Donbas entirely. “That's an issue to iron out, but I think it's moving in the right direction.”\n\nIt’s unclear how serious Russian President Vladimir Putin is about reaching an agreement – but Trump says he saw “a very interesting” Putin during their call today.\n\n“Russia is going to be helping,” Trump said when asked if he and Zelenskyy discussed the responsibility Russia would have for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed … President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nFollowing their first comments to the press, Trump and Zelenskyy retreated behind closed doors for a meeting including Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who Trump has praised for helping to broker other deals such as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nZelenskyy came to Florida backing a new version of the 20-point plan, which has been through many iterations as Ukraine and Russia negotiate with the U.S. serving as intermediary. Trump — who spoke with Putin before the meeting and said he would do so afterwards — was asked about heavy Russian attacks on Kyiv in the days leading up to the summit.\n\nHe responded by saying he believes \"Ukraine has made some very strong attacks too,\" suggesting, without proof, that Zelenskyy's country was involved in some explosions inside Russia.\n\nBefore Zelenskyy arrived, Trump's phone conversation with Putin lasted for one hour and 15 minutes, according to Putin aide Yury Ushakov, who described the call as “friendly, good-natured and business-like.”\n\nUshakov, in a press briefing following the call, said Putin emphasized the need to build upon understandings established during August’s bilateral summit in Anchorage and subsequent negotiations between the countries.\n\n“Most significantly, the Russian and U.S. presidents share a broadly similar view that the temporary ceasefire proposed by Ukraine and Europe – under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or other such measures – would merely prolong the conflict and risk a renewed escalation on the battlefield,” Ushakov said.\n\nTrump said he thinks the ceasefire stalemate is a problem that can get solved. “I think we’re finding ways that we can get around that,” he told reporters after the meeting.\n\nAccording to Ukraine’s constitution, any changes to the country’s territorial borders must be “resolved exclusively by an All-Ukrainian referendum.” Zelenskyy recently conceded he would be willing to hold a referendum vote on proposed territorial changes.\n\nAs Zelenskyy prepared to head to the U.S. on Saturday, he received an intelligence report alleging Russia is taking steps to undermine a potential referendum vote.\n\n“Our society has to choose, and has to vote, because it's their land, the land not of one person, it's the land of our nation,” Zelenskyy said on Sunday regarding the possibility of a referendum, adding Ukrainians who have fled abroad would have to return in order to vote. “It’s not simple.”\n\nUshakov put pressure on Ukraine to quickly decide on territorial concessions.\n\n“Given the evolving situation on the front lines, it would be in the Ukrainian regime’s interest to make such a decision regarding Donbass without further delay,” Putin’s aide said.\n\nDuring the call, Putin and Trump also agreed to establish two working groups, each focused on security and economic issues, likely in early January.\n\nTrump has been frustrated in his attempts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine after vowing to stop the war within 24 hours of returning to the White House. His allies are quick to point to the shaky truce in the Middle East as proof that the president is deserving of a Nobel prize. \n\nTrump and Zelenskyy will continue discussions over the next couple of weeks ahead of a potential visit to Washington by Zelenskyy and European leaders in January.\n\n\"We can move very rapidly,\" Trump claimed. \"They both want to see it ended.\"","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/trump-zelenskyy-mar-a-lago-ukraine-russia-peace-deal","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766955385/20251228-trumpzelensky-rvd/20251228-trumpzelensky-rvd.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:37:00","author":"Zeeshan Aleem","authors":["Zeeshan Aleem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":389709206,"title":"'Peace Talks in Final Stages but Thorny Issues Remain': Key Takeaways from Trump-Zelenskyy Mar-a-Lago Meet","text":"Donald Trump on Sunday said negotiations to end the war in Ukraine are in their \"final stages\", after holding talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida and speaking by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ,The US President met Zelenskyy at his Mar-a-Lago residence, claiming that both sides were close to an agreement. Hours earlier, Trump said he had held a lengthy call with Putin and intended to speak to him again once discussions had progressed further. ,\"The two leaders want it to end,\" Trump told reporters. \"I think we can move pretty rapidly.

We are in the final stages of talking.\" Standing alongside Trump, Mr Zelenskyy said US and Ukrainian negotiators had made significant progress on a 20-point peace plan, with about \"90%\" of the draft now agreed. ,Here are the main takeaways from the meeting: ,The 'Thorny Issues' That Remain ,President Trump said he believed a peace agreement was \"close\", but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained unresolved. ,He declined to give a precise figure for how much of the agreement had been finalised, but suggested it could be close to 95%. The future of the eastern Donbas region, which Russia has demanded Ukraine cede, remains one of the most contentious points. ,\"We're getting closer to an agreement on that. And that's a big issue,\" Trump said. \"Certainly, that's one of the big issues, and I think we're closer.\",,The US has floated the idea of a \"free economic zone\" in parts of Donbas, under which Ukraine would withdraw from areas as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. ,Russia has been fighting in Donbas — which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk regions — since 2014. Moscow is now seeking through US-mediated talks what it has not achieved on the battlefield. ,Zelenskyy said the question of territory remained particularly difficult. ,\"You know our position,\" he said. \"We have to respect our law and our people. We respect the territory which we control.\",Also Read: 'What a Dumb Question' - Trump Snaps at Reporter Ahead of Talks with Zelenskyy ,He reiterated that any decision on territory would ultimately rest with the Ukrainian people, potentially through a referendum. Parliamentary involvement was also left open. ,\"We can have referendum on any kind of points of this plan,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Of course, our society has to choose… because it's their land, the land, not of one person. It's the land of our nation for a lot of generations.\" ,Aside from territorial questions, Zelenskyy said the leaders had discussed \"all aspects\" of the 20-point plan. While overall agreement stands at around 90%, he said the US and Ukraine are fully aligned on security guarantees and military issues. ,\"We agree that security guarantees is a key milestone in achieving lasting peace,\" he said., ,Trump's Visit to Ukraine ,President Trump said he was open to visiting Ukraine and addressing its parliament if it would help secure a peace deal, though he suggested such a trip was unlikely. ,\"You know, I have no problem with\" travelling to Ukraine,\" he said. \"We don't anticipate it. I would like to get the deal done and not necessarily have to go.\" ,\"I've offered to go and speak to their parliament, and you know, if that would help, I don't know that would help … but I don't even know if that's welcome,\" he added. ,\"You are welcome,\" Zelenskyy responded., ,Rebuilding of Ukraine ,Asked whether Russia would bear responsibility for rebuilding Ukraine, Trump said Moscow would play a role. ,\"They're going to be helping,\" he said. \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed.\" ,He added that President Putin had expressed a willingness to support Ukraine's recovery, including by supplying energy and electricity at \"very low prices\". ,Trump said Putin had not agreed to a ceasefire because he did not want to halt fighting only to resume it later. \"I understand that position,\" the US president said. ,He also said he had discussed Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — which has been under Russian control since the early stages of the war — with Putin. ,\"President Putin is actually working with Ukraine on getting it open,\" Trump said. \"He's been very good in that sense. He wants to see that open.\" ,\"He hasn't hit it with missiles,\" he added. ,Trump–Putin–Zelenskyy Meeting on the Cards? ,Trump said he believed a joint meeting involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States could take place \"at the right time\".

Mr Trump said territorial issues remain but he thinks these will be resolved and there will be an outcome to the peace talks in a few weeks.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Mr Zelenskiy said he had a great discussion with the American leader, and US-Ukraine security guarantees are “100 per cent agreed to”.\n\nMr Trump said he was on the phone with Russian president ⁠Vladimir Putin for “maybe 2½ hours” on Sunday. He said he thinks the Russian and Ukrainian presidents both want to see a deal agreed. He said Mr Putin wants to see Ukraine succeed.\n\nRussia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. \n\nThe Ukrainian president called it Russia’s response to ‍the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Zelenskiy said Ukraine has a “different position” to Russia on Donbas. He said Russia had to respect Ukrainian land and “the territory which we control”. He said Ukraine’s attitude to Donbas is “very clear” and that it is “a different position to Russia”. \n\n“It is the land of our nation, for generations,” he said.\n\nMr Trump said the issue of Donbas is “unresolved but getting closer”. \n\nAsked if there was any agreement on a free trade zone on Donbas, Mr Trump said it was a “very tough issue but one I think we’ll get resolved”.\n\nMr Trump and Mr Zelenskiy spoke with the leaders of France, Finland, Poland, Norway, Italy, the UK and Germany, along with the Nato secretary general and head of the European Commission after their meeting. \n\nAfterwards Mr Trump said he believed Mr Putin was ready to make a peace deal. There were no signs, however, that Russia was willing to drop any of its demands. According to Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov, Mr Trump “listened carefully” to Russia’s assessment of the conflict. Both sides agreed that a ceasefire proposed by Ukraine and Europe would only prolong the fighting “and is fraught with renewed hostilities”, Mr Ushakov said.\n\nAsked about Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, one of the key sticking points in the talks, Trump said Mr Putin is “working with Ukraine on getting it open”. \n\n“He’s been very good in that sense. He wants to see that open,” Mr Trump added. \n\nThe US president said he had offered to address the Ukrainian parliament. “If that would help, I don’t know if that would help. I think it would probably help, but I don’t even know,” he said. \n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin said he welcomed the progress that Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskiy spoke of this evening. He said in a statement: “I firmly hope that this will be built on in the time ahead to enable a ceasefire to take place.\n\n“Russia must now demonstrate that it is committed to ending its illegal war on Ukraine.”\n\nMoscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all ‌of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Mr Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce. \n\n[ From Zelenskiy’s jaw-dropping White House meeting to Prince Andrew’s loss of royal titles: 12 history-making moments of 2025Opens in new window ]\n\nThe Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a ⁠US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Mr Zelenskiy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote. Axios said ‌US ​officials ‍viewed Mr Zelenskiy’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. \n\nA recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch ⁠out the contours of a postwar security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.\n\nKyiv and Washington had agreed on many issues, and Mr Zelenskiy said on Friday that the 20-point plan ⁠was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ⁠ceded to Russia remained unresolved. While Moscow has insisted on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.\n\nThe United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.\n\nMr Zelenskiy, whose past meetings with Mr Trump have not always gone smoothly, ‍worries along with his European allies that Mr Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 sq km of its territory per day in 2025.\n\nRussia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12 per cent of its territory, including about 90 per cent of Donbas, 75 per cent of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.\n\nMr Putin said on December 19th that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato.\n\n[ Zelenskiy ‘doesn’t have anything until I approve it’, says Trump ahead of meeting on SundayOpens in new window ]\n\nUkrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members. The 20-point ‌plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point ‌plan, which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.\n\nSubsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.\n\nSaturday’s air attacks show that Mr Putin does not want peace, Mr Zelenskiy said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, ‌Nova Scotia, where he met Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.\n\nIn a brief statement with Mr Zelenskiy by his side, Mr Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia.”\n\n“The barbarism that we saw overnight – the attack on Kyiv – shows just how important it is that we stand with ⁠Ukraine in this difficult time,” Mr Carney said, pledging 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (€1.5 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, one man died and three other people were injured in a Russian bomb attack in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, hours before Mr Trump was due to host Mr Zelenskiy.\n\nLocal officials said three guided aerial bombs launched by Russia struck private homes in Sloviansk overnight into Sunday.\n\nThat came a day after Russia attacked Ukraine’s capital with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and wounding 27.\n\nExplosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began early on Saturday and continued for hours. – Reuters/AP","summary":"Ukrainian president says US-Ukraine security guarantees are ’100% agreed to’","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/12/28/zelenskiy-to-meet-trump-in-florida-for-talks-on-ukraine-peace-plan-amid-strikes-on-kyiv/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/GJVPJLN3XTKT27A4X5FHV3SOAA.jpg?auth=30060e33a6bd265155004eece6cfe18c64375eed022712d2ea28296ba65b72da&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:33:49","author":"Sun Dec 28 2025 - 23:33","authors":["Sun Dec 28 2025 - 23:33"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":389707712,"title":"US President Trump says Russia-Ukraine truce talks in ‘final stages’  - Bahamas Spectator – Bahamas &amp;","text":"Diplomacy over the Russia-Ukraine war is in its “final stages”, said US President Donald Trump as he welcomed Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his Florida estate.\n\nThe two leaders stood outside the Mar-a-Lago resort on Sunday and addressed reporters as they prepared to discuss a new proposal to end the bloody conflict.\n\nThe US president has been working hard to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the fighting.\n\n“I think we’re … in final stages of talking and we’re going to see. Otherwise, it’s going to go on for a long time, and millions of additional people will be killed,” said Trump, adding he did not have a deadline for the process.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, good for everybody.”\n\nHe added there would be “a strong agreement” to guarantee Ukraine’s security, one that would involve European countries.\n\n“We have two willing parties. We have two willing countries … The people of Ukraine want [the war] to end, and the people of Russia want it to end, and the two leaders want it to end,” Trump said.\n\nRussia intensified its attacks on Ukraine’s capital in the days before the Florida meeting.\n\nZelenskyy, by Trump’s side, said he and the US president would discuss issues of territorial concessions, which have so far been a red line for his country. He said his negotiators and Trump’s advisers “have discussed how to move step by step and bring peace closer” and would continue to do so in Sunday’s meeting.\n\nDuring recent talks, the US agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO.\n\nThe proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country’s bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.\n\nOleksandr Kraiev, an analyst with the think-tank Ukrainian Prism, said the people of Ukraine are “quite cynical” about the talks brokered by the United States.\n\n“We tried this in 2015, 2016, 2017, and unfortunately each time the Russians broke even the ceasefire regime, not even talking about the peace process,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“So we have little faith that a proper peace process will take place. As of now we’re striving for a ceasefire as a precondition for any kind of talks… We cannot trust the Russians with a peace deal, but a ceasefire is something we’re working on.”\n\nTrump’s upbeat tone comes despite widespread scepticism in Europe about Putin’s intentions after Russia carried out another massive bombardment of the Ukrainian capital just as Zelenskyy headed to Florida.\n\nBefore Zelenskyy arrived, Trump spoke with Putin by phone for more than an hour and said he planned to speak again after the Zelenskyy meeting – catching Ukrainian leaders off guard, reported Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi.\n\n“From what we’re hearing, the Zelenskyy delegation here have been blindsided yet again by Donald Trump. And according to the Russians, it was at the Americans’ insistence there should be a call with Vladimir Putin the hour before Zelenskyy arrived,” said Rattansi, speaking from Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, while there is talk about land concessions from Ukraine’s side, they are outside the framework Zelenskyy is hoping for.\n\nThe Kremlin gave a more pointed readout of Trump’s talks with Putin, saying the US leader agreed a mere ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict” as it demanded Ukraine compromise on territory.\n\nZelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.\n\nPutin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognised as Russian territory. He also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces have not captured.\n\nKyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.\n\nTrump has been somewhat receptive to Putin’s conditions, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region, and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/us-president-trump-says-russia-ukraine-truce-talks-in-final-stages/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2025/12/afp_695183777840-1766949751-OTw4LG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:27:21","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":389714120,"title":"In Presser With Zelensky, Trump Reveals the One Issue That's Holding Up a Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal","text":"The meeting between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zalensky that took place Sunday at Mar-a-Lago – \"the White House of the South\" – has concluded, with Trump saying \"we could be very close\" to a deal ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. \n\nIn a post-meeting press conference, President Trump said he and Zelensky had \"made a lot of progress\" during the meeting and had discussed around \"95 percent\" of the issues holding up a peace plan between the two warring nations, noting it was the deadliest war since World War II. \"We'll see if it gets done, it's very close certainly,\" said the president, adding, \"Nobody would have a chance at even getting it to where it is now. Nobody would have thought that was possible.\"\n\nTrump and Zelensky also spoke by phone with European leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Finland's Alexander Stubb, Poland's Karol Nawrocki, Norway's Jonas Gahr Støre, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, United Kingdom's Keir Starmer, Germany's Friedrich Merz, NATO's Mark Rutte, and the European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen.

It may be taken over a period ... a number of months,\" said the president. \"And you're better off making a deal now.\"\n\nIt looks like a working group made up of Trump advisors Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Marco Rubio, General Dan \"Razin\" Caine, and possibly Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, plus a contingent from Ukraine, will now make a push to move the peace process along.\n\nAs for the timing of a deal, President Trump said, \"In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other... it's been a very difficult negotiation.\" And as for a visit to Ukraine, Trump said, \"I'm not sure that it would be really necessary, but if it would help save 25,000 lives a month... I would certainly be willing to do that.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, ahead of his sit-down with Zelensky, President Trump had a nearly two-and-a-half hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Trump described as \"excellent.\" President Trump quipped, \"We didn't talk about the weather.\"\n\nThe bottom line for President Trump seems to be a definitive end to the bloodshed. At Sunday's press conference, he said, \"Everybody wants [the war] ended... I want it ended because I don't want to see so many people dying.\"\n\nYou can watch the entire post-meeting press conference between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky here:\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

During a news conference following their sit-down at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida, the two leaders struck an optimistic tone while acknowledging that challenges remain. “You can say 95%, but I don’t like to say percentages. I just think we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues, but I think we’re doing very well. We made a lot of progress today.” Asked by reporters what those issues are, Trump said it was “the land,” referring to the Donbas region, which Russia has demanded Ukraine cede. Zelenskyy echoed the positive sentiments. “We had a really great discussion,” he told reporters. “We discussed all the aspects of the peace framework.” He added that the deal as a whole was 90% agreed to, saying U.S., Europe and Ukraine security guarantees are “almost agreed.” As for a timeline to finalize a potential deal, Trump said the best-case scenario is in “a few weeks.” Hours before his meeting with Zelenskyy, the U.S. president said on Truth Social that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday morning in what he characterized as a “good and very productive telephone call.” Russia has been unrelenting in its offensive. The meeting comes just over a day after it launched a massive missile attack on Ukraine’s capital, killing at least one person and injuring at least 20 other people, according to Kyiv’s mayor. Brigitte Bardot, French actor and animal rights activist, dies at 91 Screen siren Brigitte Bardot, whose portrayals of free-spirited ingenues made her an international sex symbol and the pride of France and who turned her back on movie stardom in 1973 to become an animal rights activist, has died, according to French media and The Associated Press. She was 91. Leading tributes, French President Emmanuel Macron said Bardot “embodied a life of freedom” and lived a “French existence.” Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party, which Bardot publicly supported in her later years, referred to her as a “passionate patriot” who represented “an entire era of French history.” Bardot’s foundation paid tribute to her legacy on animal rights, from traveling to Arctic ice floes to help baby seals to lobbying for animal welfare legislation and securing convictions for perpetrators of animal abuse.

In a matter of months, four astronauts are poised to fly around the moon on a roughly 10-day mission — the closest humans will have gotten in more than half a century. The flight, known as Artemis II, which could lift off as early as February, would be a long-awaited jump-start to America’s lagging return-to-the-moon program. The mission is designed to usher in a new era of space exploration, with the goal of eventually establishing bases for long-duration stays on the moon before astronauts someday venture on to Mars. The Palisades Fire destroyed senior living communities, but many are determined to return Pacific Palisades seemed like the perfect place to start over after Victoria Escalante lost everything she owned in the horrific 2018 Camp Fire in north central California. The quaint village was exactly what she wanted for her retirement: family, community and a sense of security. Escalante never imagined that she would watch another neighborhood she called home turn to ash. The Palisades Fire was one of two infernos that consumed vast swaths of Los Angeles County in January. Among the most affected places were assisted living facilities and retirement communities where older adults planned to spend their final years. Hundreds of patients and residents were separated from essential services. Rebuilding has been slow across the Pacific Palisades burn scar. But nearly a year after the tragedy, senior communities say returning to their homes has given them a renewed sense of possibility. “I believe it’s going to be good again,” Escalante said.

He described the call with Putin as “very productive” and characterized the Russian leader as “very serious” about peace. Trump also offered to speak directly to Ukraine’s parliament if Zelenskyy thought it necessary, signaling an eagerness to expand his personal involvement in negotiations.\n\n“We’re 95% there,” Trump told reporters, summarizing progress toward a tentative 20‑point peace framework. Both sides agreed that senior members of their teams — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and adviser Jared Kushner — would continue discussions. Zelenskyy declined to identify members of Ukraine’s team for those future meetings.\n\nDespite the optimism from Trump, Russia’s military operations continued. On Saturday, Ukrainian authorities reported drone and missile strikes on Kyiv and surrounding areas during the diplomatic engagement, resulting in casualties, widespread power outages and damage to infrastructure. The ongoing assaults highlighted the gap between the diplomatic narrative and the realities on the ground, underscoring that a cease-fire or concrete halt in hostilities remained far from agreed.\n\nDuring the press conference, Zelenskyy offered measured remarks but remained largely quiet as Trump expanded on his perspective. At points, Trump interspersed reflections on the war with references to his past domestic grievances, including repeated mentions of the 2020 election “hoax” and the Russia investigation, framing himself as a central figure in both past and current global affairs.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nTrump also noted that his team had coordinated with European leaders to advance the peace talks, presenting himself as an indispensable mediator between Kyiv and Moscow. When asked about a cease-fire, he deferred to Putin, emphasizing that any halt in hostilities would be a Russian decision rather than one negotiated directly with Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts noted that while the 20-point framework and Trump’s “95%” characterization sounded promising, the lack of a formal cease-fire and ongoing attacks by Russia cast significant doubt on how close the two sides truly were to an agreement. The optics — Trump as talkative mediator, Zelenskyy as largely silent observer — reinforced the perception that the president was keen to claim credit for progress, even as substantive outcomes remained uncertain.\n\nAs both teams prepare for follow-on negotiations, the prospects for peace remain tentative, shaped as much by continued violence and geopolitical realities as by the personalities in the Florida room.","summary":"The Mar-a-Lago summit ended with optimism and plans for another meeting, but no cease-fire or concrete peace deal","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/12/28/95-there-trump-frames-ukraine-talks-as-a-personal-win/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253059112-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:22:32","author":"Ck Smith","authors":["Ck Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":389708350,"title":"Trump announces US working group on Ukraine to coordinate with Russia","text":"BAKU, Azerbaijan, December 29.
