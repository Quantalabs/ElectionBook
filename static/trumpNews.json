In the two weeks since, the protests have spiralled into nationwide unrest–the largest demonstration Iran has seen since 2022–claiming more than 2,000 lives.\n\nWhile Iran has intensified its crackdown in its attempt to arrest the domestic unrest, it is also reeling under international pressure with U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to intervene and the European Parliament’s move to ban Iranian diplomats and other representatives. \n\nData shows international pressure could only deepen the crisis, as it did with years of sanctions on Iran’s economy, by contributing to and exacerbating the country’s economic woes. \n\nThese demonstrations in Iran are not out of the blue; ACLED data show that the country has witnessed at least 30,000 demonstrations in the last decade. \n\nThe latest one is fuelled by years of economic crisis and soaring prices.\n\nOne of the primary causes for the strike that triggered the unrest was the sliding value of the Iranian rial, which made it impossible for traders in Iran to import essential commodities or even sell them at unprofitable rates. The market value of the Iranian rial has devalued by more than 2,000 times in January compared to last year. The value of one Iranian rial to a dollar stood at more than a million rial in recent days. \n\nInflation has climbed to 42.5% at the end of 2025, with no relief despite prolonged highs in the previous years. In Tehran’s market, food prices surged. A comparison of food prices between November 2024 and 2025 (latest data available) shows that the price of cereals and tubers increased by more than 200%, meats, fish and eggs by 47%, and pulses by 85%. \n\nThe plunging value of the rial has only worsened things for the theocratic regime that was wearing down economically due to sanctions. While corruption and mismanagement could also be factors leading to the crisis, the impact of reimposed economic sanctions (or what is being termed “snapback” sanctions) by the UN in September has aggravated the crisis.\n\nThese sanctions froze Iranian assets abroad, penalised any development of Iran’s ballistic missile programme and also halted arms deals with Tehran. \n\nThe reimposition of sanctions came into effect after the UK, France and Germany accused Iran of “continued nuclear escalation”. The sanctions were initially lifted in the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal over its nuclear programme in 2015. It was signed by Iran with the U.S., European Union, China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK. The deal capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67%. As a result of this deal, Iran was relieved from sanctions in exchange for strict supervision of its nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nHowever, the U.S.’s withdrawal from the JCPOA during the first Trump administration in 2018 led to the reimposition of sanctions. Last year, towards the expiration of the deal, Iran had suspended inspections of its nuclear facilities after the 12-day-war in June, in which the U.S. and Israel attacked several of its nuclear bases. Tehran suspended cooperation with the IAEA, citing its failure to condemn Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities.\n\nThe reimposition of sanctions, however, came at a time when economic pressure was already building up in Tehran. The country’s GDP grew at merely 0.6%, much less than the region’s average of 2.7% and a 84% deceleration compared to last year’s growth rate. Foreign direct investment in the country, as a share of GDP, hit its lowest mark since 2001 at 0.3%. \n\nTrade has consistently formed more 40% of the country’s GDP since the 2000s. When the currency took a hit, trade tumbled consequently. Despite being a petrostate, Iran’s global share in fuels declined since 2012. Though its crude oil and condensate exports slowly recovered in 2024, China accounted for 97% of its exports. Revenue from oil exports also stagnated at 40-43 billion dollars, much less than pre-Covid period. \n\nChina is not only Iran’s major oil export destination but also accounts for more than 30% of Iran’s imports in 2023, almost six times its share in 2001. \n\nIran’s dependence on China could also be explained by the widespread sanctions on Iran from various countries. The United States has, over the years, imposed close to eighty sanctions on Iran and related entities.\n\nAccording to OpenSanctions.org, an international database of persons and companies of political, criminal, or economic interest, Iran is collectively subject to more than a thousand export-related sanctions. Several entities/persons also fall under these sanctions. \n\nWhile Iran’s unrest, though triggered by economic woes and anger among many due to the continued curtailment of civil liberties under the theocratic regime, is also mainly the result of decades-long sanctions, regional instability, exacerbated by the mismanagement of vast economic resources.\n\nData for the charts were sourced from Harvard Global Atlas, OpenSanctions.org, World Bank, IMF and ACLED","summary":"A collapsing rial, soaring inflation and years of sanctions have pushed Tehran into its largest unrest since 2022","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/data/the-economic-triggers-for-the-protests-in-iran/article70510898.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/8ys5zv/article70510895.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/AFP_92NX7A4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:30:00","author":"Sambavi Parthasarat","authors":["Sambavi Parthasarat"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":392985604,"title":"Trump Announces Decrease in Violence in Iran Amid US Troop Withdrawal from Middle East","text":"The United States is withdrawing some personnel from bases in the Middle East, a US official said, after a senior Iranian official said Iran had warned neighbours it would hit US bases if the US strikes.\n\nWith Iran’s leadership trying to quell the worst domestic unrest the Islamic Republic has ever faced, Iran is seeking to deter US President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to intervene on behalf of anti-government protesters.\n\nA US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US was pulling some personnel from key bases in the region as a precaution given heightened regional tensions.\n\nAt the White House, however, Trump suggested he was adopting a wait-and-see posture toward the crisis.\n\nTrump told reporters he has been told that reported killings in the Iranian regime’s crackdown on the protests were subsiding, and that he believes there is currently no plan for large-scale executions.\n\nTrump did not rule out potential US military action, saying “we are going to watch what the process is” before noting that his administration had received a “very good statement” from Iran.\n\nTwo European officials said US military intervention could come in the next 24 hours. An Israeli official also said it appeared Trump had decided to intervene, though the scope and timing remained unclear.\n\nQatar said drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the biggest US base in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions”.\n\n‘Most violent repression in Iran’s contemporary history’\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against the economic crisis and clerical rule.\n\nIran and its Western foes have both described the unrest — which started two weeks ago as demonstrations against dire economic conditions and rapidly escalated in recent days — as the most violent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed Iran’s system of Shi’ite clerical rule.\n\nIran has “never faced this volume of destruction”, Iranian Armed Forces chief of staff Abdolrahim Mousavi said on Wednesday, blaming foreign enemies.\n\nThe protests in Iran started in response to soaring prices that have worsened daily hardships, before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed for more than 45 years. Source: AP / .\n\nIranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting the unrest, carried out by people it calls “armed terrorists”.\n\nIran asks regional states to prevent a US attack\n\nTrump has openly threatened to intervene in Iran for days, without giving specifics. In an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, he vowed “very strong action” if Iran executes protesters. He also urged Iranians to keep protesting and take over institutions, declaring, “help is on the way”.\n\nThe senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran had asked US allies in the region to prevent the US from attacking Iran.\n\n“Tehran has told regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and UAE to Turkey, that US bases in those countries will be attacked” if the US targets Iran, the official said.\n\nDirect contacts between Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and US special envoy Steve Witkoff have been suspended, the official added.\n\nGovernment doesn’t seem near collapse: Western official\n\nThe flow of information from inside Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout.\n\nThe US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) rights group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters and 147 government-affiliated persons, dwarfing tolls from previous waves of protests crushed by the authorities in 2022 and 2009.\n\nThe government’s prestige was hammered by a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign last June — joined by the US — that followed setbacks for Iran’s regional allies in Lebanon and Syria. European powers restored United Nations sanctions over Iran’s conflicted nuclear program, compounding the economic crisis there.\n\nThe Iranian regime has always denied claims it’s pursuing nuclear weapons, saying its program is aimed at “developing civilian nuclear power”.\n\nThe unrest on such a scale caught the authorities off guard at a vulnerable time, but it doesn’t appear that the government faces imminent collapse, and its security apparatus still appears to be in control, one Western official said.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian — an elected figure whose power is subordinate to that of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei — told a cabinet meeting that as long as the government had popular support, “all the enemies’ efforts against the country will come to nothing”.\n\nState media reported the head of Iran’s top security body, Ali Larijani, had spoken to the foreign minister of Qatar, while Araghchi had spoken to his Emirati and Turkish counterparts. Araghchi told the UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, that “calm has prevailed”.\n\nHRANA reported 18,137 arrests so far.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe United States is withdrawing some personnel from bases in the Middle&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Announces Decrease in Violence in Iran Amid US Troop Withdrawal from Middle East first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/trump-announces-decrease-in-violence-in-iran-amid-us-troop-withdrawal-from-middle-east/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/98/a6/ec0895364b5face4d35c8fc27e2c/20260113175877394597-original.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:25:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.444},{"id":392977324,"title":"Trump prevails in US Senate showdown over Venezuela war powers","text":"US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign to unify his party behind his takeover of Venezuela succeeded Wednesday when all but three Senate Republicans voted to block a resolution opposing further military action in the country.\nUS Vice-President J.D.

He said he had received assurances from Rubio that the US wasn’t planning to send ground troops into Venezuela.\n\nYoung said he was satisfied by a letter from Rubio that says Trump would seek authorisation from Congress for any “major” military action in Venezuela if circumstances permit.\nCollins, who was a decisive vote to push through Trump’s massive tax and spending bill last year, faces a tough re-election in Maine this November.\nTrump has used a series of legal arguments for his campaign against Maduro.\nAs he built up a naval force in the Caribbean and destroyed vessels that were allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, the Trump administration tapped wartime powers under the global war on terror by designating drug cartels as terrorist organisations.\nThe administration has claimed the capture of Maduro himself was actually a law enforcement operation, essentially to extradite the Venezuelan president to stand trial for charges in the US that were filed in 2020.\nIn recent days, Trump has posted a meme online showing him as “Acting President of Venezuela” and told The New York Times the US involvement in the South American country would last for years as his administration eyes the country’s vast but ‌underproducing oil reserves.\nAdditional reporting by Reuters and Associated Press","summary":"US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign to unify his party behind his takeover of Venezuela succeeded Wednesday when all but three Senate Republicans voted to block a resolution opposing further military action in the country.\nUS Vice-President J.D.

The opposition argued that California’s map unfairly leveraged racial considerations to benefit Hispanic voters, thus breaching constitutional guidelines.\n\nVoters overwhelmingly passed this map, crafted to potentially enable Democrats to capture up to five additional House seats, via Proposition 50 in November. The initiative, spearheaded by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who has presidential ambitions for 2028, is designed to counteract a similar maneuver in Texas, backed by President Donald Trump to secure five Republican seats. Presently, Republicans occupy nine out of California’s 52 congressional seats.\n\nThe court’s decision marks a strategic win for Democrats in the ongoing mid-decade redistricting skirmish, which could heavily influence the partisan control of the U.S. House in 2026. This seesaw conflict between the largest U.S. states comes as Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio have also revised district lines to potentially favor partisan goals. Notably, the Justice Department’s legal challenges have only been directed at California.\n\nGovernor Newsom remarked, “Republicans’ weak attempt to silence voters failed,” celebrating the ruling.\n\nState Republicans are anticipated to challenge this decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. At this time, a response from their spokesperson is pending.\n\nCalifornia Democrats said that the new map was legal because it was drawn for partisan advantage. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that partisan gerrymandering is a political question and not one for the federal courts to decide. The court agreed, saying there was not strong evidence to support the maps were drawn based on race.\n\n“After reviewing the evidence, we conclude that it was exactly as one would think: it was partisan,” the judges wrote.\n\nThe ruling also comes after the Supreme Court ruled last December to allow Texas to use its new map for the 2026 election because it was drawn with partisan goals. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a concurring opinion that the California map was also approved for political advantage, signaling it may also stand.\n\nNew U.S. House maps are drawn across the country after the Census every 10 years. Some states like California rely on an independent commission to draw maps while others like Texas let politicians draw them. The effort to create new maps in the middle of the decade is highly unusual.\n\nHouse Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which could thwart Trump’s agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn Sacramento, California, a federal panel consisting of three judges has greenlit&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Federal Court Approves New Congressional Map for California&#8217;s 2026 Elections: Implications for Voter Representation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/federal-court-approves-new-congressional-map-for-californias-2026-elections-implications-for-voter-representation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Federal-judges-allow-California-to-use-new-US-House-map.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:15:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":392982724,"title":"FBI conducts raid on Washington Post reporter’s home, seizes electronics  - Trinidad Tribune – Latest","text":"United States news agencies and press freedom groups have expressed concern after federal agents raided the home of a reporter for The Washington Post as part of a probe into the handling of classified material.\n\nWednesday’s raid focused on the residence of journalist Hannah Natanson, who has led the Post’s coverage of efforts under President Donald Trump to slash the federal workforce.\n\nAgents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized her work and personal laptops, as well as other electronics like her phone and a Garmin watch.\n\n“According to the government warrant, the raid was in connection with an investigation into a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials.

Forced entry requires a criminal warrant signed by a judge.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. But he had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks. \n\n“He would have had another check-in in a couple of months,” Prokosch said. “So if he’s this dangerous person, then, why are they letting him walk around?\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said earlier this week that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agents’ use of force was justified.\n\nBut court records indicate Gibson’s legal history — dominated by a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare — shows only one felony, the 2008 conviction for third-degree narcotics sales that was later dismissed. \n\nProkosch said Gibson had been flown to Texas by immigration authorities in the hours after his arrest, then quickly flown back to Minnesota on a judge's order after the lawyer filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal. The courts have not yet ruled on the petition. \n\nGibson is currently being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea, Minnesota, after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas. according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email from The Associated Press with follow-up questions about Gibson's case. \n\n Guns, activists and pepper spray \n\nGibson’s wife, Teyana Gibson Brown, a nurse who was inside the home with the couple's 9-year-old child during the raid, was deeply shaken by the arrest, Prokosch said.\n\nDuring their conversations, she “was having a hard time just completing sentences because she’s just been so distraught,” he said.\n\nActivists who had been keeping watch on the immigration agents before Gibson's arrest banged on drums, blew whistles and honked car horns in attempts to disrupt the operation and warn neighbors, some of whom poured into the streets.\n\nVideo taken at the scene by the AP shows agents pushing and pepper-spraying demonstrators.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been convulsed by the killing of Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. \n\nThe Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.\n\nCity and state officials have dismissed those explanations based on videos of the confrontation.\n\nState and local authorities are urging the public to share video and any other evidence as they seek to investigate Good’s death after federal authorities insisted they would work on their own and not share information.\n\nMore than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News over the weekend that the administration would send additional federal agents to the state to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.\n\nAP correspondent Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.","summary":"The Liberian man arrested over the weekend after heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of his Minneapolis home had been checking in regularly with federal authorities for years, his attorney said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/department-of-homeland-security-minnesota-minneapolis-donald-trump-kristi-noem-b2900832.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/11/23/APTOPIX_Immigration_Enforcement_Minnesota_00995.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:07:16","author":"Tim Sullivan","authors":["Tim Sullivan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.483},{"id":392971022,"title":"Controversial duo under “Masked Singer ”Croissants masks reveal they were conflicted by song choice: 'We're not doing that'","text":"This article contains spoilers for The Masked Singer season 14 episode 2, \"Fear Night.\"\n\n The Masked Singer has bid adieu to the Croissants at long last.\n\n After a truly evil cliffhanger in the season 14 premiere, fans had to wait a whole week to learn the identity behind the flakey pastry duo. Thankfully, this week's episode wasted no time in rectifying that, and the Croissants were unmasked at the top of the evening.\n\n In the end, all of those jail and reality show-related clues helped panelist Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg correctly guess that formerly incarcerated — and eventually pardoned by President Donald Trump — stars of Chrisley Knows Best, Todd and Julie Chrisley, were under the masks.\n\n Here, Entertainment Weekly talks to the Chrisleys, who reveal all of the shows they have in the works, which one of them wanted to do The Masked Singer more, and what they really thought of performing \"Jailhouse Rock.\"\n\n ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Be honest, whose idea was it to do the show? And did one of you want to do it less?\n\n JULIE CHRISLEY: Well, the show was presented to us from our publicist actually. Todd is the singer. So he has a great voice. He has recorded a song with Sara Evans that was on the charts. Me, I am not musically inclined at all. So to say that I was nervous is an understatement. But we kind of decided together. I mean, he says I decided because I was kind of on the fence. Do we do it or do we not do it? But I'm so glad we did. \n\n When your daughter, Savannah, did this show in season 11, I asked her if you guys would be watching from prison, and she said that you would, except for maybe Todd, who she said would be the one to tell her, \"Please don't ever sing again.\" And then come to find out, you later said you didn't watch her on the show!\n\n TODD CHRISLEY: I didn't watch it [live] because I didn't want to miss those moments. And by doing that, I felt like I had missed that moment. So I watched it when I got home and I'm so glad I missed it in prison.\n\n JULIE: Oh no, I watched it. Listen, I laughed and she just embraced it. And the look on her face when she was unmasked, you could tell she was having so much fun and I love that.\n\n What will her reaction then be to your guys' performance, do you think?\n\n TODD: Well, she saw it the other night and she called and she goes, \"Oh my God, you did so good.\"\n\n JULIE: She did say that. She's like, \"You guys did good.\" So it was cute.\n\n So she didn't give you any hell for going home so fast?\n\n TODD: How could she? She went home before we did!\n\n And tell me about this song choice, \"Jailhouse Rock.\" Was that a little too on the nose? Was that your idea? Was it the show's idea? What did you think about that?\n\n TODD: The show had sent us over a list of about four or five songs. Julie was cooking. I was sitting at the kitchen counter and when it came through, I was like, \"Oh my God, we're so doing this.\" And she said, \"What is it? \" And I played it, and she goes, \"We're not doing that.\"\n\n JULIE: But also, I followed the show, and I was like, \"That is so on point. I feel like it'll be like a tell-all.\" But it was a great song, and we had so much fun doing it.\n\n Jenny did, in fact, guess you right away.\n\n TODD: I've known Jenny for so long and Jenny was always my concern. And I said that to my agent, I said, \"Jenny's going to know.\" And when I got there, they said, \"No, we're going to alter your voice.\" And I said, \"She's going to figure this out. \" And sure enough, she was the first one and the others were saying, \"Oh, it's Tim [McGraw] and Faith [Hill] and whatever.\" And so when we got back to our green room, I said, \"I told you Jenny would be the one to figure it out.\" But, we were not going there to win a Grammy. We went there to have a good time and we had a good time.\n\n Did Savannah have any advice for you guys whenever you told her that you guys were going to do the show, or did you not even tell her?\n\n JULIE: We didn't tell her. So she didn't actually know until we were there. Yeah.\n\n TODD: Someone there on the lot sent her a text message and said, \"Oh my God, I just ran into your parents. They're the loveliest people.\" And she sends me a text and she goes, \"Are you doing Masked Singer?\" And I said, \"Why are you asking me that?\" And then she called, and she said, \"Because I just had a friend text me and say they ran into you and mom and that y'all were so lovely.\" And I just said, \"Well, that happens all the time because I'm lovely to everyone.\" She goes, \"Dad, they're on the lot.\"\n\n So what was her reaction when you spilled the beans?\n\n TODD: She was excited. She said, \"You guys are going to do great. Just lean into it, have a good time.\" \n\n JULIE: She's like, \"I know I can't sing, and I did it, and I had a blast.\" So we just went with that. \n\n Would you guys do anything differently about your Masked Singer journey?\n\n TODD: If we did anything differently, I probably wouldn't have had so many clues that were so on point. But other than that, no. We had a great time. \n\n Will there be another season of Back to Reality? What's next for you two?\n\n TODD: That was a documentary that was just about what had happened. Now the family show will pick up and bring you back into our home. So, our family is coming back to television — we've got the family show that's coming — then I'm doing a show in the U.K. Julie's got her cooking show. I'm doing a traveling food show with Chase, and then [Julie] and Savannah have a show that they're doing out of the country.\n\n This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.","summary":"Plus, they open up about which one needed to be convinced to do the show, and their return to reality TV.","url":"https://ew.com/the-masked-singer-reveals-the-croissants-julie-todd-chrisley-11885593","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/9nbuTqQqSO5IYE07HzrRdJyRdfg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-masked-singer-Mrs-and-Mr-Croissant-010726-0bdd0285624d49979add7bc338fd43ea.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:05:00","author":"Lauren Huff","authors":["Lauren Huff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":392984060,"title":"Trump's beloved ballroom makeover delayed by yet another unfulfilled promise","text":"President Donald Trump's beloved ballroom project has been delayed by yet another one of the president's unfulfilled promises, according to a new report. \n\nLast year, Trump removed all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an agency that reviews ballroom plans before construction begins.

Ia sebetulnya bermula sebaik sahaja tahun baharu apabila kebanyakan peniaga bazar berasa tidak puas hati dengan penguncupan nilai mata wang Iran yang menjejaskan perniagaan mereka. Malah dalam banyak keadaan, harga barangan bertukar-tukar antara pagi dan petang. Mereka berpandangan kerajaan belum melakukan sesuatu yang berkesan. Untuk rekod Iran telah mengalami sekatan ekonomi selama berpuluh tahun di mana negara ini dilarang melakukan bermacam urusan niaga sehingga menjejaskan pembangunan negara tersebut. Sekatan ekonomi adalah salah satu cara untuk empayar Barat menekan negara yang tidak digemarinya, antara lain seperti Venezuela. Kedua-dua negara, Venezuela dan Iran memiliki takungan minyak, gas asli dan bahan mineral yang kaya dan menjadi dambaan empayar.\nProtes peniaga itu disambut positif oleh pemimpin tertinggi Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei di mana beliau menyatakan protes tersebut sesuatu yang wajar dan selayaknya dilakukan. Presiden Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian menggariskan kaedah paling segera iaitu bercadang untuk memberikan wang tunai (semacam bantuan SARA bawah kerajaan kita). Tunjuk perasaan tersebut tampak mereda.\nAkan tetapi tiba-tiba pada 7 Jan 2026, ia meledak kembali, menimbulkan tanda tanya yang sah, apakah dan siapakah yang membumbuinya?\nPertanyaan di atas bukanlah sesuatu yang sukar untuk dijawab, dan seseorang tidak perlu terlalu naif berhempas pulas menciptakan satu naratif berlapik-lapis. Di media sosial, Donald Trump, dan Benjamin Netanyahu terang-terangan mengakui mereka di belakang protes ini. Malah Israel tanpa segan silu menyatakan sokongan kepada semua ejen Mossad yang memang sudah berada di Iran. Maka diciptalah naratif dalam media sosial konon para wanita Iran yang tidak berhijab tertekan dan tertindas oleh larangan agama; atau keinginan rakyat Iran untuk bebas dan mengembalikan Reza Pahlavi yang berada di Amerika Syarikat untuk memimpin mereka; atau hujah ekonomi Iran tidak diuruskan dengan baik oleh mullah; dan kemudian dinaratifkan 12,000 penunjuk perasaan telah dibunuh oleh pihak berkuasa Iran.\nSemua itu dimudahkan oleh alasan Iran menutup dan menyekat internet, yang mana Elon Musk, penyokong kuat zionis dengan segera membekalkan starlink untuk ‘penunjuk perasaan’ ini. Makanya tiada berita dianggap sah datang dari Iran, kecuali naratif yang dibangunkan di media sosial oleh lasykar siber zionis yang diapi-apikan oleh diaspora Iran yang kebanyakannya menggilai Barat.\nMengapakah dan bagaimanakah Mossad dan CIA gagal lagi di Iran?\nPertamanya, akal waras kebanyakan rakyat Iran menghubungkan keganasan yang berlaku di Iran dengan Perang 12 Hari antara Iran dan Israel. Perang itu mengakibatkan kekalahan memalukan kuasa Zionis dan Barat. Tambahan pula ‘penunjuk perasaan’ didapati membakar beratus masjid, membunuh kanak-kanak, menyerang pengangkutan awam, dan membakar bangunan kerajaan. Betapa tinggi sekalipun rasa tidak puas hati rakyat Iran terhadap para mullah dan kerajaannya, tindakan membakar masjid adalah sesuatu yang memang tidak dapat diterima alasan kewarasannya. Maka dengan mudah belang Mossad dan CIA terbogel.\nKedua, hujah wanita Iran tidak bebas untuk tidak bertudung kini telah tidak laku. Dalam kunjungan saya ke Iran baru-baru ini, Iran sudah lebih kurang seperti Malaysia, di mana wanita berhijab dan non hijab sama banyaknya dan mereka menjalani kehidupan seperti biasa di tempat awam. Selepas insiden Mahsa Amini (wanita tidak berhijab yang meninggal dunia dalam tahanan); kerajaan tidak lagi mengambil tindakan keras terhadap wanita non hijabi. Bahkan ketika Perang 12 Hari lalu antara syuhada yang terkorban adalah wanita tidak berhijab dan mereka diberi status sakral oleh pihak berkuasa agama setara dengan mereka yang dianggap lebih beragama. Undang-undang moral untuk wanita tidak berhijab juga dikendurkan selonggarnya, cuma satu dua insiden sahaja terjadi di mana mereka dikenakan tindakan ini kerana terdapat pendedahan aurat yang berlebihan dan kelihatan sengaja dilakukan untuk tujuan provokasi. Sebarang video dan status media sosial mengenai hal ini tertolak dengan sendirinya. Apatah lagi setelah terdedah adanya beberapa video wanita penggemar Zionis yang konon mencabar mullah sebenarnya berlaku di Kanada, dan negara Barat lain. Maka dengan mudah belang Mossad dan CIA terbogel.\nKetiga, rakyat Iran tidak dapat menerima Reza Pahlavi sebagai pemimpin ganti Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Hubungan Pahlavi dengan Benjamin Netanyahu diketahui umum di Iran yang sememangnya anti-Zionis. Bukan itu sahaja, cara hidup Pahlavi juga ditolak oleh rata-rata masyarakat Iran yang beragama. Pahlavi bukan sahaja mewah, tetapi juga hidup dalam mungkar. Kisah skandal isteri beliau dengan jurulatih senamnya dijadikan bahan meme di media sosial. Ketika Perang 12 Hari antara Israel dan Iran, Pahlavi malah menyokong Israel membuatkan rakyat Iran menolak kelompok monarkis yang kebanyakannya terdiri daripada diaspora Iran. Menggunakan wajah Pahlavi sebagai lambang menolak mullah adalah satu kebodohan. Ini kerana Pahlavi dianggap sehina anjing di republik tersebut. Maka dengan mudah belang Mossad dan CIA terbogel.\nKeempat, hujah para mullah gagal menguruskan ekonomi dengan baik juga tertolak dengan sendirinya. Naratif yang dikembangkan oleh media Barat misalnya tidak diterima dengan baik oleh siapa pun yang mengenal Iran. Rakyat Iran misalnya tahu benar apa yang terjadi adalah kerana sekatan ekonomi Barat terhadap mereka. Makanya yang perlu dipersalahkan adalah Barat itu sendiri. Bukan itu sahaja, keadaan di Iran bukanlah terlalu melarat di mana rakyat mengalami kebuluran sehingga tiada makanan. Iran adalah sebuah negara besar yang mampu menampung keterjaminan makanan. Pada masa sama ditekan Barat, Iran masih berdaya membangunkan industri persenjataan yang canggih dan telah menewaskan Israel dan Barat dalam Perang 12 Hari. Maka dengan mudah belang Mossad dan CIA terbogel.\nKelima, naratif pihak berkuasa Iran membunuh 12,000 penunjuk perasaan juga tertolak sendirinya. Ini kerana dalam banyak keadaan, yang terbunuh adalah orang awam yang terperangkap ketika demonstrasi itu. Insiden juru rawat, anggota keselamatan, kanak-kanak dibunuh di dalam rusuhan membuatkan ramai marah tetapi kewarasan segera datang kembali kerana terdapat banyak insiden yang dilakukan terdiri dari ‘penunjuk perasaan’ yang membawa senjata seperti senapang, bom dan pelbagai benda tajam. Ini membuatkan rakyat Iran mempersoalkan siapa mereka, adakah mereka teroris atau Mossad dan CIA yang ditanam? Taktik membunuh orang awam, dengan harapan individu lain akan marah dan merusuh melawan anggota keselamatan telah pun dikenali di Iran. Negara ini bukan negara biasa, saban hari mereka melakukan protes; dan rakyat Iran cukup mahir sejarah dan tahu membezakan protes yang mana satu asli dan yang mana satu penipuan. Insiden campur tangan Amerika Syarikat di Venezuela juga dengan cepat membuatkan rakyat Iran sedar. Rakyat Iran sangat cekap dan celik isu geopolitik. Maka dengan mudah belang Mossad dan CIA terbogel.\nKeenam, Iran adalah sebuah negara dengan majoriti rakyatnya beragama Islam dengan mazhab Syiah. Identiti sekolah pemikiran ini amat kuat dan dihayati oleh ramai rakyat Iran. Misalnya mereka sangat jelas dalam kisah pembunuhan Saidina Hussein cucu Nabi Muhammad SAW di Karbala, terdapat syiah yang berpaling tadah yang mana mereka itu dari Kufah. Seruan kami tidak akan menjadi Syiah Kufah begitu sebati dan kuat dilaungkan di mana pengkhianatan menjadikan protes yang merugikan negara ini satu kejijikan. Untuk mereka yang sama sekali tidak arif sejarah keimanan rakyat Iran, dan begitu jahil akan susur galur sejarah kepercayaan ini, saya ingin menasihatkan mereka supaya mengkaji dan memahami subjek ini dengan sesungguhnya sebelum mengulas darihal Iran. Kepercayaan ini membantu dengan mudah menelanjangkan belang Mossad dan CIA yang kian terbogel.\nKebanyakan golongan liberalis yang kononnya menyokong ‘kebangkitan rakyat Iran’ sukar menerima hakikat bahawa dalam demokrasi di Iran, majoriti yang menginginkan para ulama memimpin lebih ramai berbanding yang menolak mereka. Semua faktor yang saya sebutkan di atas bergumpal menjadi sebab-musabab mengapa Iran masih di tangan para ulama, atau mullah. Atau mengapa Mossad dan CIA masih gagal menawan Iran.\n\nArtikel ini adalah pandangan penulis dan tidak semestinya mewakili FMT.","summary":"Kebanyakan liberalis yang konon sokong ‘kebangkitan rakyat Iran’ sukar terima hakikat dalam demokrasi di Iran majoriti menginginkan ulama memimpin lebih ramai berbanding menolak.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2026/01/15/mengapa-mossad-dan-cia-gagal-lagi-di-iran","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/67a7206b-iran-protest-los-angeles-afp-12_01_26.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:00:47","author":"Faisal Tehrani","authors":["Faisal Tehrani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":1},{"id":392965718,"title":"The U.S. withdraws some military personnel from Middle East bases amid Iranian threats","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report January 14, 2026 03:10 \n\n The U.S. withdraws some military personnel from Middle East bases amid Iranian threats \n Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on 'mixed messages' sent from Iran as President Donald Trump considers possible measures over protester crackdowns on ‘Special Report.’\n Tags SPECIAL REPORTSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRPOLITICSV-VIDEOIRANMILITARYDEFENSE TRIALSCONFLICTSCONFLICTS DEFENSEU.S. DEFENSE & MILITARY POLITICS","summary":"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on &apos;mixed messages&apos; sent from Iran as President Donald Trump considers possible measures over protester crackdowns on ‘Special Report.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387733270112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/ae89557a-b1ec-4ab9-a11d-75286799068e/cea2fd3b-ae5f-460d-9a15-faf0d8432938/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:56:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":392969690,"title":"House GOP revisits Biden handling of Jan. 6 with new panel","text":"“My objective in this committee is to get the truth, without political bias, of what happened,” Loudermilk said during the hearing.\n\nThe stated focus of Wednesday’s hearing was the FBI’s handling of the pipe bombs placed outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 6, devices discovered near then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s route and rendered safe by Capitol Police. Federal authorities arrested 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr. in December, accusing him of planting the explosives.\n\nRepublicans have long argued that the pipe bomb investigation was sidelined while Democrats focused their attention on President Donald Trump and his supporters. More than 1,500 arrests of protesters were made during the four years of former President Joe Biden‘s term, including two federal criminal cases levied against Trump, all while the pipe bomber case remained unsolved.\n\n“The obsession with persecuting Trump supporters left no institutional impetus to get to the bottom of the pipe bomber mystery,” said witness John Nantz, a retired FBI special agent who now appears frequently in conservative media. \n\nDuring questioning by Loudermilk, Nantz went as far as to claim it was “likely” that the FBI knew Cole’s identity far earlier than the December arrest, pointing to cellphone data, license plate reader information, and financial records. He argued that leadership under then-Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray may have influenced investigative priorities.\n\nWatch as a 20 year veteran of the @FBI with a background in counter intelligence gives his opinion on whether or not he believes Wray's FBI identified the suspected pipe bomber. pic.twitter.com/roWkDTvfTB— Select Subcommittee on January 6th (@J6Select) January 14, 2026\n\n“I don’t think it’s just plausible,” Nantz said. “I think it’s likely.”\n\nSeveral Democrats on the committee countered that the hearing was premature, given the ongoing prosecution.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the ranking member of the eight-member panel and a former member of the original Jan. 6 select committee, called Cole’s arrest a “rare bright spot for federal law enforcement” under the Trump administration but said the GOP-led hearing risked interfering with an active criminal case.\n\nDespite the narrow topic, much of the hearing was devoted to a broader relitigation of Jan. 6 itself, including the legitimacy of the previous select committee, the conduct of federal agencies, and the delayed deployment of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nRep. Raskin: “There are some lingering questions. Most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on January 6th, other than sit on his hands…while he watched the whole scene unfold on TV.” pic.twitter.com/c8U6yglXs1— The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) January 14, 2026\n\n“There are some lingering questions — most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on Jan. 6,” Raskin said. “The truth is a resilient thing. We’re not going to put up with a pack of lies in this subcommittee and a bunch of conspiracy theories.”\n\nFormer DOJ attorney Michael Romano, who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioter cases, testified that some protesters had planned in advance to disrupt Congress, citing evidence such as an “Occupy Congress” image circulating before the attack. Romano also criticized claims promoted by the White House and conservative outlets that Capitol Police instigated the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) attacked the legitimacy of the original Jan. 6 select committee, noting that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s Republican appointees — a move that led McCarthy to withdraw all GOP selections and left the panel without any Republican-appointed members.\n\n“The previous select committee established by Speaker Pelosi was a sham from the start,” Nehls said. “It was a total sham.”\n\nThe hearing drew an audience deeply tied to Jan. 6 controversies. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence was commuted by Trump, sat in a reserved front-row section alongside Ivan Raiklin, a right-wing activist who supports Jan. 6 defendants. \n\nAt one point, Raiklin held up a piece of paper bearing the name of a Capitol Police officer previously accused by a conservative outlet of planting the pipe bombs.\n\nLegally, morally, and ethically.tune into https://t.co/ISoQ7doJ0Z now! pic.twitter.com/kxz8PZDbJc— Ivan Raiklin (@IvanRaiklin) January 14, 2026\n\nAlso present was Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer while attempting to enter the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who is not a member of the subcommittee, observed the hearing and later said he remained unconvinced that the FBI had arrested the correct suspect in the pipe bomb case.\n\n“I was hoping to learn more details about the pipe bomb,” Massie said. “I think they’re going to just try to sweep this under the rug and say we got our guy and move on.”\n\nRaskin, meanwhile, raised the political implications of Cole’s prosecution, repeatedly highlighting Cole’s support for Trump and questioning whether Trump’s sweeping pardon for Jan. 6-related offenses could apply to the pipe bomb defendant if he is convicted.\n\n“Is it their position that the pardon extends to Mr. Cole?” Raskin asked, calling the possibility “unprecedented” and “corrupt.”\n\nDC PIPE BOMB SUSPECT SAYS HE SHOULD BE COVERED BY TRUMP JAN. 6 PARDON\n\nRaskin’s remarks come just days after Cole’s attorneys spoke to Fox 5 DC, indicating they plan to challenge the indictment against their client in novel ways, including by arguing that Trump’s broad pardon of the Jan. 6 protesters should apply to him.\n\nCole is still in the early stages of his criminal case and is fighting to obtain pretrial supervised release with his grandmother after a magistrate judge sided with prosecutors over their effort to keep him behind bars pending the trial.

No such order has been issued so far, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be insisting on the return of Gvili, which is why the directive to open the crossing has not yet been given. The assessment within the Israel Defense Forces is that Hamas will not give up its weapons of its own accord. If Israel does not see progress in that direction, the military is preparing for an operation, likely coordinated with the United States. A senior security official said the planned technocratic administration would handle civilian affairs in Gaza and would have no connection to Israel, stressing that Hamas must be disarmed under US conditions and that Israel would carry out that task itself if necessary. After the US announcement, Netanyahu spoke with Talik Gvili, Ran’s mother, and said phase two focuses on dismantling Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, without an IDF withdrawal. “The prime minister made clear that bringing Ran home is at the top of our priorities, and that the declarative move to establish a technocratic committee will not affect efforts to return Ran to burial in Israel,” his office said. “He stressed that information conveyed to the mediators by the coordinator for hostages and missing persons, Gal Hirsch, and his team must immediately be translated into effective action on the ground.” Netanyahu told Gvili’s mother that the Rafah crossing has not been opened because of Israel’s insistence on Ran’s return, and that Israel’s efforts include intelligence and operational activity as well as contacts with mediators. “Hamas is required to meet the agreement’s demands and make a 100 percent effort to return all slain hostages, to the last of them, Ran Gvili, a hero of Israel,” Netanyahu said. Talik Gvili said after the call that the transition to phase two does not mean an end to the struggle to bring her son home. Gvili, a fighter in the Border Police special patrol unit, was killed on October 7 while defending Kibbutz Alumim. Phase two includes the establishment of a Palestinian technocratic administration in Gaza, to be run by Palestinians whom Israel does not view as affiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. However, despite Netanyahu’s assurances that the Palestinian Authority will have no role in the “day after” the war, former senior PA officials and former officers in its security services are expected to serve on the committee that will run the strip. It is to be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy Palestinian planning minister. At the same time, Trump is continuing preparations to establish a “Peace Council” that he will head, with former UN Middle East envoy and former Bulgarian foreign and defense minister Nickolay Mladenov set to manage it in practice. Mladenov is expected to oversee the implementation of Trump’s plan and serve as a conduit between the Palestinian technocratic administration and the Peace Council. He visited Israel last week and met with Netanyahu and senior Palestinian officials. The Peace Council is to be unveiled Jan. 23 in Davos, Switzerland. Phase two is also expected to include the creation of an international stabilization force for Gaza, known as the ISF. During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, ministers were told the United States is close to announcing its establishment. Officials said Washington has at least three countries ready to send troops. Past reports named Italy, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Azerbaijan among them. Security officials assessed the force would not confront Hamas. Witkoff warned: 'Failure will bring serious consequences' “We are announcing the launch of Phase Two of the President’s 20-Point Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction,” Witkoff wrote earlier on X. He said the United States expects Hamas to “comply fully with its obligations,” including the return of the last hostage, Gvili. “Failure to do so will bring serious consequences,” he warned. Witkoff said the announcement was made on Trump’s behalf and that phase two includes establishing a transitional Palestinian technocratic administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, or NCAG. Demilitarization and full reconstruction of the strip would begin in phase two, “primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel,” he said. “Phase One delivered historic humanitarian aid, maintained the ceasefire, returned all living hostages and the remains of twenty-seven of the twenty-eight deceased hostages,” Witkoff added, thanking Egypt, Turkey and Qatar for their mediation efforts. Israeli security officials said the figures slated to run Gaza under Trump’s plan are familiar and acceptable to Israel. “These are Fatah figures who are not extremists and are similar to Palestinian Authority officials Israel works with,” one official said. “The test will be implemented, beginning with a pilot neighborhood in Rafah. There is no expectation of a withdrawal from the ‘yellow line’ in the near future, and conditions on the ground are not expected to change anytime soon.” Ben Gvir-Zini exchange and the figures set to run Gaza During a cabinet meeting earlier this week, Shin Bet chief David Zini said Israel had approved the names of 15 members of the NCAG technocratic committee. The final list was approved after some candidates were rejected, and Zini said none of the 15 are affiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. Still, most have clear ties to the PA. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir objected to the inclusion of Shaath, who served as a Palestinian deputy planning minister under former PA leader Yasser Arafat, arguing he is a PA figure. Zini countered that Shaath met the criteria set by the political leadership. “What is this supposed to be?” Ben Gvir said. “He went from a senior PA official to a human rights activist?” Ben Gvir later said the exchange was not a confrontation. “A minister is allowed to ask questions and even object to a decision, especially when the decision is not the Shin Bet chief’s,” he said, adding that he holds Zini in high regard. Members of the Palestinian committee were selected from professional figures with institutional and security experience. They are expected to hold their first meeting at the US Embassy offices in Cairo after members from Gaza join those arriving from PA-controlled areas. In addition to committee chairman Ali Shaath, who previously held senior posts within the Palestinian Authority and served as a deputy planning minister, earlier reports identified several members: Abdul Karim Ashour, head of an agricultural aid organization in Gaza and a social activist Aed Yaghi, director of a medical aid organization in Gaza Ayed Abu Ramadan, head of Gaza’s Chamber of Commerce Jaber al-Daour, president of the University of Palestine in Gaza Bashir al-Rais, an engineering consultant engineer Omar Shamali, who oversaw Palestinian telecommunications in Gaza Ali Barhoum, an engineer and adviser to the Rafah municipality and attorney Hana Tarzi, the first Christian woman lawyer in Gaza. The remaining committee members are Mohammad Bseiso, owner of one of Gaza’s largest law firms, who will oversee judicial affairs Sami Nasman, a retired senior officer from Palestinian Authority security forces, responsible for internal affairs Arabi Abu Shaaban, in charge of the Land Authority Osama al-Saadawi, an engineer and entrepreneur who previously served as a minister in the Palestinian government in Ramallah and will oversee housing Husni al-Mughni, responsible for tribal affairs and Bashir al-Rais, who will handle finance. Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Al Jazeera the group welcomes the establishment of the technocratic committee. He said efforts are underway with mediators to open crossings, allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and secure an Israeli troop withdrawal. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the group demands that the US administration compel Israel to complete its phase one commitments, calling the move to phase two “a positive and important development.” He added Hamas is “ready to transfer administration of the strip to an independent technocratic committee and facilitate its work.” The article was prepared with the participation of Einav Halabi.","summary":"The announcement of phase two of Trump’s plan offered no clarity on the Rafah crossing, a key lever for securing hostage Ran Gvili; Israel is preparing, with US consent, to resume fighting Hamas, as Zini and Ben Gvir clash over who will rebuild Gaza","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1sbssshzl","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/24/H1GCM6bZWx/H1GCM6bZWx_0_0_850_479_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:54:34","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":392966240,"title":"Is Hannah Natanson The 'Venezuela Leaker'?

His successor, Prime Minister Mark Carney, is in Beijing this week in an attempt to rebuild relations after several years of frosty ties.\n\nHere is a look at the evolution of the relationship:\n\n1970: Canada recognizes communist China. Canada establishes ties with Beijing and ends diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The switch takes place more than a year before U.S. President Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China, which eventually leads to American recognition of the communist government in 1979, when the two nations established relations.\n\n1973: Trudeau meets Mao. Pierre Trudeau, who championed establishing diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China, meets Mao Zedong, the founder of the communist state. It is the first trip by a Canadian leader to the country since the Communist Party took power in 1949.\n\n1984: China’s premier visits Canada. Zhao Ziyang holds talks with Trudeau in the first visit by a Chinese premier to Canada since the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two governments sign an investment agreement. Zhao meets U.S. President Ronald Reagan in Washington on the same trip.\n\n1994: Boosting trade. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien brings business leaders to China to expand trade, despite criticism of the government’s bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. A backer of improved ties, Chrétien was in Beijing earlier this month to meet Chinese officials ahead of Carney’s trip.\n\n2006: Criticizing human rights. New Canadian leader Stephen Harper initially takes a tough line on China over its human rights records. He angers the Beijing government in 2007 by meeting the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who has fled China. Harper later shifts to a more moderate approach, visiting China several times to promote trade.\n\n2016: A second Trudeau visits. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Pierre’s son, declares a new era in relations with China on a visit to Beijing. He says ties have been somewhat lacking in stability and regularity. Trudeau meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a return visit in 2017.\n\n2018: Relations crash. Canada detains Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of China’s Huawei Technologies Co., at the request of the United States. The move sparks a downward spiral in relations that lasts for the rest of Trudeau’s term. China retaliates by detaining two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on spy charges. All three are released in 2021 under a three-way deal with the U.S.\n\n2022: Huawei banned. Canada bans Huawei equipment from Canada’s 5G networks. Canada also bars Chinese tech company ZTE Corp. from the country’s telecommunication systems. The U.S. had lobbied allies to exclude Huawei over cyberespionage concerns. China says Canada’s move was carried out with the U.S. to suppress Chinese companies in violation of free-market principles.\n\n2023: Diplomats expelled. Canada expels a Chinese diplomat in Toronto whom it accuses of involvement in a plot to intimidate Canadian lawmaker Michael Chong and his relatives in Hong Kong after Chong criticized Beijing’s human rights record. China responds by expelling a Canadian diplomat in Shanghai. Canada also launches an inquiry into whether China interfered in Canadian elections in 2019 and 2021.\n\n2024: A tariff war erupts. Canada says it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of China-made electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum, matching U.S. tariff hikes under the Biden administration. China retaliates in March 2025 with a 100% tariff on canola products and a 25% tariff on Canadian seafood and pork exports.\n\n2025: Carney takes office, meets Xi.

Betting on events such as elections was illegal until 2024, when a U.S. federal court dismissed a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ‍rule ​that prohibited betting on elections in the U.S.\n\nMIDTERM BOOST\n\nSince the regulatory rollback, prediction markets have grown at a breakneck speed.In October, Intercontinental Exchange, which owns and operates the New York Stock Exchange, invested up to $2 billion in Polymarket. Kalshi, another fast-growing predictions market player, was valued at $11 billion in its latest fundraising round.\n\nInteractive Brokers has a market value of about $120 billion. It is one of the ⁠largest U.S. trading platforms with about 4.13 million customer accounts at the end of September, up 32% from ‌a year earlier.\n\nThe company expects customer accounts to grow at a similarly torrid pace in 2026, Peterffy said, as betting on the upcoming midterm elections to drive growth. He is optimistic about ForecastEx even as he expects many more rivals ⁠to enter the business.\n\nHe noted that \"more and ‍more prospective participants are trying to enter this market and there doesn't seem to be any barrier. The applications are practically limitless, in the sense that we're full of questions about the future all the time. I'm incredibly bullish on this space, especially with elections coming this year.\"\n\nSome recent wagers on platforms like Polymarket have fueled suspicions of insider trading and drawn scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers, who are pushing to prohibit federal officials and government employees from betting ‍in prediction markets. Some U.S. states also have recently raised questions about whether sports-prediction platforms like Kalshi violate ‌state gaming regulations.\n\nInteractive Brokers is also expanding in the cryptocurrency arena. Last year, as part of a phased rollout, the firm launched a service for some U.S. retail customers that allows them to use stablecoins to fund their brokerage accounts.\n\nThe company also has a partnership with crypto platform Paxos and is an investor in crypto exchange Zero Hash. Through these tie-ups, the brokerage firm offers trading in various cryptocurrencies to customers.\n\nInteractive Brokers also runs a prime brokerage unit that caters to several hedge funds. The company said its hedge fundclients witnessed returns of about 28.91% last year, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index that grew 16.4% during the same period.\n\nFED INDEPENDENCE\n\nLike everyone in the financial sector, Peterffy has been keeping an eye on the U.S. Justice Department's threat to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony he gave last summer about a Fed building project. Other leading global central banks and several Wall Street leaders, including Jamie Dimon, have lined up in support of Powell.\n\n\"I'm in favor of the independence of the Fed,\" Peterffy said, adding ‌that \"if they find any wrongdoing, whether it's the Fed chair or anybody else, that person should be prosecuted.\"\n\nPeterffy cautioned against the Fed cutting interest rates quickly this year, saying that he \"wouldn't want inflation to run away.\"\n\n\"I would not be pushing for lower rates as fast as some folks in the administration are.\"\n\nCREDIT CARD RATE CAPS\n\nTrumpon Friday said he was calling for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10% starting on January 20. The move has raised broader questions ​about potential interference from the administration in the private sector, something that leaders in the financial industry have highlighted as a major area of concern.\n\nPeterffy said he was \"not in favor of the government interfering with private enterprise.\"\n\n\"To the extent there is legislation that empowers the government to do that, then they should be free to do that. But if there isn't, they shouldn't be doing it,\" said Peterffy.\n\n (Reporting by Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2026/01/15/interactive-brokers-says-betting-on-us-midterm-elections-should-juice-growth-of-its-platform","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/15/3720808.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:43:00","author":"Anirban Sen","authors":["Anirban Sen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.08},{"id":392983804,"title":"US sets tariff on certain chips as part of Nvidia-China deal","text":"The tariff will permit Nvidia to sell its powerful H200 chip to Chinese buyers if certain conditions are met.

Families are mourning their children and burying their loved ones, yet they have not abandoned the streets. In the midst of grief, these people have stayed their course and, with remarkable courage, have conveyed their demands clearly and openly to the world.\n\nThey are not merely protesters; they have a clear demand. They want regime change. With one unified voice they have shouted “Death to Khamenei,” and at the same time, with the chant “Javid Shah,” they have declared not only the name of a future leader but also the form of the national government they seek. This chant is a conscious choice: both a rejection of four decades of ideological religious rule and a clear vision for Iran’s future.\n\nAfter 47 years of enduring executions, rape, hunger, mass killings, and repression, the people have reached a collective understanding that the only path to Iran’s liberation is a return to a national monarchy.\n\nDespite this, it is striking that parts of the global media initially attempted to censor these voices or reduce them to merely economic protests. There was an effort to silence the will of a nation that has risen up through headlines and framing. This is a nation that has paid the price of censorship with its lives for 47 years, both inside the country and in exile. The fundamental question remains: how can those who have spoken for years about human rights remain silent in the face of such a catastrophe?\n\nAt the same time, regional developments have affected the internal balance. During the twelve-day conflict involving Israel and Ali Khamenei, the regime’s focus on external threats inadvertently reduced the intensity of domestic repression. This time, the Islamic Republic was unable to bring in suppressive forces from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen as it had done in the past when it was able, I emphasise, in a single day, to kill more than 1500 people.\n\nOn the international level, as protests and strikes expanded, the position of the United States government became more explicit. Support for the Iranian people and warnings to the ruling regime in Tehran carried a clear message: the world cannot ignore the will of a nation demanding freedom. In this context, the statement by US President Donald Trump, urging Iranians to continue protesting and emphasising that those responsible for crimes would be held accountable, had significant political and psychological importance for the protesters.\n\nAt the same time, Reza Shah II, the leader of Iran’s national movement, through repeated calls and clear guidance on sustaining protests and holding the streets, injected new energy into the movement. He released a transition plan a detailed program developed over many years which also made it clear to foreign observers why a large part of the Iranian nation considers him its leader and is paying the price of that choice with blood in the streets.\n\nThe turning point of these days, however, was January 12, when Iran experienced one of the darkest chapters of its modern history. The nationwide shutdown of the internet and electricity in many cities was not a technical or security measure, but a cover to hide the truth. A truth that, two days later, was revealed in a stark and horrifying way through videos and reports: the massacre of people in the streets.\n\nAccording to figures now released, around twelve thousand Iranian citizens were killed during this short two-day period. By any human standard, this is a full-scale catastrophe. Streets turned into bloodbaths. Unarmed civilians, whose only demand was to reclaim their dignity, identity, and future, were targeted. This was neither a “clash” nor “crowd control,” but an open and unprecedented crackdown on a nation that no longer accepts hiding its Iranian identity inside their homes just to survive.\n\nDespite this massacre, on January 14 the streets once again filled. People exposed their chests to bullets and, with clenched fists, shouted “Javid Shah.” This was not a cry of surrender, but the voice of a nation that has decided to stand, even if the price is life.\n\nIn a world with 57 Muslim-majority countries, where many who claim to defend human rights feminists and left-wing groups included, have remained silent, the world must know that the Iranian nation stands proud.\n\nAfter decades of identity distortion and imposed fear, people have returned to their true essence: being Iranian. What is happening in Iran today is a test for the world’s conscience. History will remember not only the perpetrators of these crimes, the Islamic Republic regime, leftist groups, and the Mujahideen, but also those who chose silence.\n\nLeila Naseri is an author, composer, and social cultural activist.","summary":"'How can those who have spoken for years about human rights remain silent in the face of such a catastrophe?'","url":"https://www.australianjewishnews.com/this-is-the-final-battle-pahlavi-will-return/","image":"https://static.timesofisrael.com/ajn/uploads/2026/01/AP26009070267364-copy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:42:15","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":392975876,"title":"Republicans defeat Senate resolution to stop Trump’s strikes in Venezuela after frantic White House lobbying","text":"Two Republicans rejoined the ranks of the GOP Senate caucus on Wednesday and voted to defeat a Democratic resolution aimed at constricting President Donald Trump from carrying out further military strikes within Venezuela.\n\nJosh Hawley and Todd Young were two of five senators who broke with their party last week to support the resolution, but switched back on Wednesday after several days of intense lobbying that, according to multiple reports, lasted up until the very minute of the vote Wednesday evening.\n\nYoung and Hawley both told reporters that the keys to their votes being won by the White House were assurances from top officials that, despite the president’s threats to send in ground troops or carry out further strikes, the administration had no plans to do so. Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote after the chamber was deadlocked at 50-50.\n\nHe added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, one of the top Trump officials involved in the discussions related to Venezuela, would appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to testify on the matter.\n\nThe Senate delivered Donald Trump a symbolic defeat last week when he suffered a major defection on the initial vote to advance the War Powers resolution submitted by Sen. Tim Kaine out of committee, while Democrats voted in unison to support the measure. \n\nWhile the actual consequences of the vote were minimal, it served as a shot across the bow for the president, who has spent weeks alarming the Hill with suggestions about future strikes in Venezuela or other countries and even possibly a military effort to seize Greenland.\n\nTrump himself reacted with fury after the votes were cast, labeling the five Republican senators (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Todd Young, Rand Paul and Josh Hawley) disloyal and demanding that voters hand them defeats at the ballot box in the future. One of those senators, Collins, is facing a tight reelection battle this year in a crucial state for the Republican Senate majority.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nHawley responded, according to Huffpost: “I like the president. I feel like we've had a good relationship, and I support him. I take no offense to that.”\n\nOn Wednesday, he spoke on Fox News about his changing vote.\n\n“Well, for me...this has always been about ground troops,” said Hawley. “Occupying Venezuela, that’s not something I think I would want to do.”\n\n“I talked to the president, I talked to the Secretary of State, I talked to the Department of Justice,” Hawley said. “And what the Secretary of State said to me very clearly is, ‘We’re not doing that.’ We don’t have ground troops in Venezuela; this is not another Iraq, we’re not going to occupy Venezuela, and you know what? That’s good enough for me.”\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump and his allies worked down to the wire to win those same senators back into the fold, according to several. They were successful after Rubio guaranteed in a letter to Hawley and Young that the White House would seek congressional authorization before deploying troops to the region.\n\n“I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela. I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,” Young said in a statement.\n\nSenators defeated the resolution on a point of order that questioned whether the situation in Venezuela amounted to ongoing hostilities with the United States. The president claimed on Wednesday that Nicolas Maduro’s number two, Delcy Rodriguez, was cooperating and said that he’d spoken with her on a phone call. Semafor reported on Wednesday that sales of Venezuelan oil by the U.S. government have officially begun.\n\nStill, more than 200 people are dead between the stunning raid on Caracas, which led to Maduro’s capture two weeks ago and the months-long campaign of deadly airstrikes targeting small vessels in the Caribbean, the U.S. government says are ferrying drug traffickers. Maduro is now in New York along with his wife, where the pair is facing drug trafficking charges.\n\nThe DNC trashed the vote in a statement, writing: “Just last week, a handful of Senate Republicans were clear about putting guardrails on Trump. But after a few calls from their Dear Leader, Republicans folded — killing a bipartisan resolution to rein in Trump’s unconstitutional power grab. Americans have been unequivocal in their opposition to the U.S. indefinitely running a foreign country. Republicans had a chance to stand up for the American people, and instead they chose to cower to Trump.”\n\nWednesday’s vote could embolden the president, who saw representatives from Greenland and Denmark arrive at the White House earlier in the day to confront Rubio and Vice President JD Vance — Trump didn’t bother to attend.\n\nThe president has only somewhat backed off his assertion that the U.S. would be directly running Venezuela’s government and continues to insist that the U.S. “needs” Greenland. On Wednesday, he said that Rodriguez, Venezuela’s acting president and former vice president to Maduro, was a “terrific person”.\n\n“We just had a great conversation today, and she's a terrific person. I think we’re getting along very well with Venezuela,” said the president.","summary":"Trump flips Josh Hawley, Todd Young back to his side after telling voters to never support them again","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-venezuela-senate-vote-war-b2900798.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/26/21/01/GettyImages-2222132956.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/osDTbWge-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:42:07","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":392976470,"title":"Trump imposes 25% tariff on imports of some advanced computing chips","text":"Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald ‌Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain advanced computing chips, ‌such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor and a similar semiconductor ‌from AMD called the MI325X, according to a fact sheet released by the White House.\n\nThe proclamation, which cited national security as a justification, is part of a broader effort to create incentives for ‍chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the U.S. ‍and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers ‌in places like Taiwan.\n\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent ‍of ​the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains.This dependence on foreign supply chains is asignificant economic and national security risk,” ⁠the proclamation said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has deployed an ‌array of tariffs aimed at bolstering American manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping new import tariffs, including ⁠100% duties on ‍branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and ‍semiconductors as part of a bid to impose ‌tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.\n\nWhile U.S. companies like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

The president's announcement came after he warned Tehran that his administration would take 'very strong action' if the Iranian regime began hanging anti-government protesters.\n\nAccording to Trump, Iranian officials communicated through intermediaries that they would halt planned executions. 'We have been informed by very important sources on the other side and they've said the killings have stopped and the executions won't take place', he stated. 'There was supposed to a lot of executions today.'\n\nProtests Erupt Amid Economic Collapse and Soaring Death Toll\n\nIranians took to the streets in late December as the rial suddenly crashed and inflation surged past 40 per cent. The economic crisis reignited longstanding grievances with the Islamic Republic's clerical establishment, sparking the most extensive civil unrest in years. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people have been killed in nationwide protests, a senior U.S. official told USA TODAY.\n\nHuman rights organisations condemned the escalating violence against demonstrators. The United Nations' independent fact-finding mission in Iran reported on 10 January that security forces received orders to carry out a 'decisive' response without restraint on protesters. Iranian Kurdish rights group Hengaw had reported that 26-year-old Erfan Soltani, arrested during protests, was scheduled for execution on 14 January.\n\nEscalating Threats Between Washington and Tehran Raise Military Concerns\n\nTrump's intervention began on 2 January when he warned the U.S. would come to the rescue 'if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom'. A week later, he warned Tehran, 'You better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too'. On 10 January, the president posted on social media: 'Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!'\n\nIranian leaders accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the demonstrations. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf issued a stark warning: 'Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target', according to Reuters.\n\nTrump Refuses to Rule Out Military Action Against Iran\n\nWhen asked whether military action remains an option, Trump declined to commit either way. 'We're going to watch it and see what the process is', he said. The president emphasised he would be 'very upset' if any executions occur.\n\nThe Trump administration urged U.S. citizens to leave Iran immediately amid threats of military force.

Trump has threatened with action against Tehran if it continues down the current road, but officials are also hoping to prevent the region from destabilization should the regime end up collapsing.\n\nThe Iranian regime may have killed as many as 20,000 people in its crackdown of the protests that have roiled the country for days, according to a different report.\n\nCiting two sources, including one inside the country, CBS News detailed that at least 12,000 people have been killed in the country, meaning that the toll is far higher than activists outside the country have been reporting.\n\nDetermining the scale of the crackdown has been difficult given the fact that the Tehran regime has implemented a complete internet shutdown in the country.\n\nElsewhere in the report, the source told CBS News that security forces are going to private hospitals across Tehran and threatening staff to hand over the names and addresses of those who sustained injuries during the protests.\n\nIranian officials have not provided data of the crackdown, largely because they have downplayed their extent.

His bombastic style and zero-sum worldview have made him a lightning rod within the administration. Critics argue that Miller’s rhetoric about foreign nations and immigrants echoes racist and imperialist ideas that have undergirded military actions by the U.S. and other nations for centuries.\n\nA joint statement from the governments of Spain and five Latin American countries following the Venezuela operation called for countries in the region to engage in “mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and nonintervention,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the administration’s Venezuela policy “old-fashioned imperialism.”\n\n“Advocating for policies that put American citizens first isn’t racist. Anyone who says so is either intentionally lying or just plain stupid,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.\n\nHere’s a look at how Miller laid the rhetorical groundwork for this month’s attack on Venezuela and what his comments say about the administration’s broader worldview. \n\nMiller argues that Western nations’ aid to developing world was ‘reverse colonization’\n\nShortly after the U.S. operation that captured Maduro, Miller wrote on social media: “Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful). The West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry. The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.”\n\nMiller argues that Venezuelan oil was stolen from US oil industry\n\nTwo weeks before Maduro’s arrest, Miller in December echoed arguments by Trump that the Venezuelan oil industry was stolen from American oil companies:\n\n“American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs,” Miller wrote on social media.\n\nMiller says Venezuelan government is in service to US \n\nMiller in January claimed to reporters that U.S. military power had ensured compliance from the Caracas government. \n\n“We have an oil embargo in Venezuela for them to do any kind of commerce. They need our permission. We have our massive fleet or armada still present there. This is an active and ongoing U.S. government military operation, and so, of course, we set the terms and conditions,” Miller said.\n\nHe added: “Our conversations are that we are very much getting full, complete and total cooperation from the government of Venezuela, and as a result of that cooperation, the people of Venezuela are going to become richer than they ever have before. And of course, the United States is going to benefit from this massively in terms of economic, security and military cooperation, counter-narcotics, counterterrorism and every other dimension of our security.”\n\nMiller calls for a world order based on strength, says US military occupation of Greenland would not be opposed\n\nDuring a wide-ranging January interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Miller repeatedly argued for the primacy of American power and criticized the international order the U.S. once led. \n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world,” said Miller.\n\nMiller also dismissed concerns that Trump’s vows to take Greenland from Denmark, a fellow member of the NATO military alliance, may trigger a military conflict with Europe.\n\n“Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” said Miller.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations engaged in ‘groveling’ to former colonies\n\nIn the same interview, Miller said it would be “absurd and preposterous” and “not even a serious question” to propose the administration support Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s bid to lead the country because the military would not back her. \n\nTapper then asked whether the South American country should hold elections.\n\nMiller replied: “The United States is using its military to secure our interests unapologetically in our hemisphere. We’re a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower. It is absurd that we would allow a nation in our own backyard to become the supplier of resources to our adversaries, but not to us, to hoard weapons from our adversaries, to be able to be positioned as an asset against the United States, rather than on behalf of the United States.”\n\nThe anchor pressed Miller on whether sovereign countries had the right to conduct their own affairs.\n\nMiller explained the administration’s stance: “The Monroe Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine is all about securing the national interest of America. For years, we sent our soldiers to die in deserts in the Middle East to try to build them parliaments, to try to build them democracies, to try to give them more oil, try to give them more resources. The future of the free world, Jake, depends on America being able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology.” He called for an end to “This whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and engaging in these massive reparations schemes.” \n\nHe also defended the administration’s operation and echoed his past claims that Maduro had sent criminals into the U.S.: “We’re not going to let tinpot communist dictators send rapists into our country, send drugs into our country, send weapons into our country.”\n\nMiller criticizes anti-ICE protests following immigration crackdown in Minneapolis\n\nMiller has returned to promoting the administration’s stance on domestic issues like immigration and partisan politics.\n\nOn Tuesday, following nationwide protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota, Miller wrote on social media: “Americans voting overwhelmingly for mass deportation. Congress passed laws requiring it and then passed new legislation to fully fund it. The response of the Democrat Party and its activists has been to support and orchestrate violent resistance against federal law enforcement.”\n\nHe later added in a separate post, “In case it isn’t clear by now, if Democrats won they would have made every city into Mogadishu or Kabul or Port-au-Prince.”","url":"https://apnews.com/article/stephen-miller-venezuela-greenland-minneapolis-ba175d90c0d34730cafd2a64df70be82","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/c69cfdb/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6307x4205+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb4%2Fa4%2F259310cd2b7067bb2014f5f55ad8%2F5f9e988dcc4c470ea1d29ea7c1342bff","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:38:18","author":"Matt Brown","authors":["Matt Brown"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":392969554,"title":"Secret DOJ Memo Concluded Trump Had Constitutional Authority To Send Troops Into Venezuela Without Approval From Congress","text":"A secret memo from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel determined that President Donald Trump had the constitutional authority to send troops into Venezuela without approval from Congress, according to a new report.\n\nThe New York Times detailed that the document, which has been shown to some members of Congress, covers three areas: international law, when and whether the U.S. military can be used to assist in a law enforcement issue and whether Trump needed authorization from Congress to do so.\n\nThe outlet noted that experts noted that the operation could have violated international law, considering that under the UN Charter, which has been ratified by the U.S. Senate, a nation can't use force in another country without its consent, self-defense rationale or permission of the UN Security Council.\n\nElsewhere in the report, the document notes as precedent a memo from 1989 claiming that then-President George H.W. Bush had inherent constitutional power to override international law by sending the FBI to conduct arrests abroad. Bush then relied on that claim to arrest Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.\n\nWhen addressing the need to go through Congress, the memo claimed that as commander in chief a president has the constitutional power to order a military operation if it's in the national interest and its nature, scope and duration won't amount to a war in the constitutional sense.

Critics say the exits reflect deeper unease about independence at the justice department, though officials in Washington reject that view.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump Rages At Republican Senators As Experts Warn Of Dangerous New White House Delusion\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump Rages At Republican Senators As Experts Warn Of Dangerous New White House Delusion\n\nTrump Blamed for Resignations in DOJ\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was among the most senior officials to point the finger at Donald Trump following the resignations. Walz reacted to the departure of Joseph H. Thompson, the acting US attorney and first assistant US attorney for the District of Minnesota. He described Thompson as a long-serving prosecutor whose exit sent a troubling signal.\n\nIn a statement, Walz praised Thompson's record and linked his resignation directly to political pressure from the White House.\n\n'Joe Thompson is a principled public servant who spent more than a decade achieving justice for Minnesotans. This is a huge loss for our state,' Walz said.\n\nHe added that the resignation was 'the latest sign that President Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the Department of Justice and replacing them with his sycophants.'\n\nWalz also highlighted Thompson's role in major investigations, including the case into the murders of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. The governor said that experience underscored why the resignation had sparked alarm among state leaders and legal figures.\n\nWave of Prosecutors Resigned\n\nThompson's resignation was confirmed on 13 January 2026. He had served as the lead prosecutor on a large social services fraud investigation and was one of the most senior figures in the Minnesota office. His departure did not happen in isolation.\n\nFive other federal prosecutors from the same office resigned on the same day, bringing the total to six. Their exits drew national attention and prompted questions inside the DOJ. Separately, four senior leaders from the department's Civil Rights Division in Washington also stepped down.\n\nThose lawyers were involved in criminal investigations into police and federal use-of-force cases. A DOJ spokesperson later confirmed the departures but denied they were connected to the Minneapolis shooting.\n\n'Any suggestion to the contrary is false,' the spokesperson said, adding that the officials had requested early retirement before events in Minnesota unfolded.\n\nThe resignations follow a broader pattern. Since Trump began his second term, more than 250 attorneys have reportedly left or been reassigned within the Civil Rights Division, resulting in a significant staffing reduction.\n\nProtest for Renee Good's Case\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman shot during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis on 7 January 2026. The ICE agent involved, Jonathan Ross, was said by Department of Homeland Security officials to have acted in self-defence. Local officials and several Democrats strongly disagreed, saying Good posed no threat.\n\nThe resigning prosecutors objected to what they saw as a lack of interest in investigating the agent. They were also angered by pressure to examine alleged links between Good and her widow, Becca Good, and activist groups.\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, decided not to open a civil rights investigation into the shooting. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche later said, 'There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation,' without detailing how that conclusion was reached.\n\nBecca Good, speaking on Minnesota Public Radio, focused on her family's loss. 'Renee lived by an overarching belief: there is kindness in the world,' she said, asking for privacy as the debate over the DOJ's handling of the case continues.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

The regime has responded with its customary ruthlessness, shutting down the internet and killing an estimated 12,000 protesters. \n\nThe regime has successfully quelled protests in previous years, from the 2009 Green Movement (sparked by a disputed presidential election) to the 2019-2020 protests (also triggered by economic conditions) to the 2022-2023 protests after Mahsa Amini died in morality police custody after she refused to wear a hijab. \n\nWhat’s different this time? The economic conditions are even worse, and the regime has lost its moral and military credibility.\n\nIran’s currency—the rial—lost nearly all its value. Last week, one U.S. dollar traded for 1.47 million rials. The economic crisis comes after President Trump re-imposed maximum pressure on Iran last February, after he announced an all-of-the-above energy strategy that does not move away from oil, and after a series of devastating military defeats for the Mullahs.\n\nIran’s theocratic regime rests its legitimacy on its ability to fight the “little Satan,” Israel, and the “great Satan,” the United States of America. The Islamic Republic came to power after the revolution ousted the U.S.-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Iran has declared its intention to wipe Israel off the map. Its harsh enforcement of the Shia version of Sharia law is only possible because the regime unites its people against common enemies. \n\nTrump’s Role\n\nFormer President Barack Obama thought the regime would soften if he offered compromise, and he hoped to create regional stability in the Middle East by pitting a stronger, more moderate Iran against Saudi Arabia. President Trump rightly threw out this flaccid approach, using maximum pressure sanctions in his first term and showing an even more aggressive support for Israel in his second.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden loosened the sanctions on Iran, leading the regime to gain approximately $71.02 billion more than it otherwise would have ahead of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nThis extra cash likely enabled Iran to provide more support to its proxies in the region, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and Iran-backed militias in Iraq. Iran uses these proxies, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, to project power against Israel and America outside its borders.\n\nYet Oct. 7 set in motion a chain of events that crippled Iran’s power in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael responded with force, dismantling Hamas. In September 2024, Israel effectively eviscerated Hezbollah by rigging the terrorist group’s pagers to explode. \n\nPresident Biden pledged to support Israel, but his support proved tepid at best. By contrast, Trump stood by America’s ally, providing the cover Israel needed to carry out its mission. Trump also bombed the Houthis in Yemen last year after the Iranian proxy repeatedly attacked international shipping. \n\nLast June, Israel directly attacked Iranian nuclear sites, and U.S. forces under Trump provided crucial assistance in destroying the key nuclear sites of Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow.\n\nRather than engage in regime change or a protracted war, President Trump urged Iran to make peace, ending the Twelve Day War with a massive victory for America and Israel.\n\nIn a masterstroke, Israel and the U.S. had dismantled Iran’s proxies and the rogue regime’s nuclear program—the Mullahs’ greatest hope for a decisive victory against Israel.\n\nYes, the Protests Really Are Different This Time\n\nIran’s crippled role in the Middle East doesn’t just make Israel and America’s allies in the region safer—it also undermines the Islamic Republic’s reason for existence. Whatever Iran’s troops believe, the clerical authorities aim to spread their version of Islam across the globe, and if they can’t fight the two regimes they consider the most evil—America and Israel—they lose their key justification for rule.\n\nThe protests may not succeed, and even if they do, it is possible the resulting regime will not represent much of an improvement. \n\nHowever, Trump and Israel have done the people of Iran a great service by eviscerating the Mullahs’ military might, and it just might be enough to end the Islamic Republic’s despotic rule, once and for all. Even if it survives, the crippled regime will remain a pale shadow of its former self.\n\nAs an admirer of ancient Persia, I can’t help but hope that Iran’s best days are ahead—and if they are, the Persian people will have Trump to thank for it.","summary":"As Iranians take to the streets amid persistent inflation and a regime crackdown, President Donald Trump told protesters that &#8220;help is on its way&#8220;—but he...

What’s taking the House so long?","text":"On Tuesday, the Senate did something it rarely does: it passed legislation by unanimous consent. The DEFIANCE Act was inoffensive enough: a bill to ban nonconsensual deepfake sexually explicit images. \n\nMoreover, the bill was introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It’s the latest sign that the lawmaker has grown her influence in a legislative body that once dismissed her as a firebrand but in which she’s now a power broker. \n\nThe idea of banning sexually explicit deepfake images without a person’s consent gained massive steam amid the proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and even underage girls on X via Grok, its in-house AI tool. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer warned its owner, Elon Musk, that it would take “fast action” to deal with the nonconsensual images. Indonesia and Malaysia become the first two countries to block Grok. \n\nAnd Ocasio-Cortez has some ostensible support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voiced some support for the bill. \n\n“I'm certainly in favor of it,” Johnson told The Independent. “We've got to find the vote tally, but that should be a big bipartisan concern. We need to protect children online, and we need to stop these abuses. Is terrible. It's horrible.”\n\nAll of this would seem encouraging if the Senate had not passed the DEFIANCE Act during the last Congress, before it died in the House of Representatives. \n\n“I've spoken with Speaker Johnson. At that point, it's just about having those conversations to ensure that the legislation moves,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Independent. \n\nMusk remains an influential money man despite his rapid fall from grace in Trump world last year after running the Department of Government Efficiency and his venom toward President Donald Trump. \n\nThe two seem to have patched things up and Musk pledged to throw his support behind Republicans on New Year’s Day because “America is toast if the radical left wins.”\n\nAnd in December, the Pentagon announced that it would add Grok to its “AI arsenal.” \n\nOcasio-Cortez said she was not surprised by this.\n\n“I mean, they’re in business together,” she told The Independent. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean the legislation doesn’t have allies in the House, even from unexpected places. Rep. Nancy Mace, the anti-trans MAGA Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, told The Independent she supports the bill.\n\n“I just had to have a Grok AI-generated image taken down,” she said. “It was sexually explicit, in my opinion, and disgusting.”\n\nAt the same time, Mace said that the problem did not stem from the technology. \n\n“It's the human who's prompting the technology to make these types of deep fakes,” she told The Independent. \n\n“I mean, I'm all over this sort of thing,” she said. “I've sponsored my own bills. I'm co sponsor of other bills. Like, we need to be moving fast on this.”\n\nThe legislation is a sign of how Ocasio-Cortez, who came to Washington after she knocked off House Democratic Chairman Joe Crowley in a surprise primary victory in 2018, has become a power broker and a leading messenger. \n\nDespite her ability to generate media headlines and earn the moniker “AOC,” she faced significant opposition from Democratic leadership. \n\nToward the end of Joe Biden’s presidency, she attempted to run for the ranking member spot on the House Oversight Committee, only to get bumped for a more senior member who ended up dying months into his tenure. \n\nBut she might have won the long-term war, given she joined the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which regulates two policies that matter to her: health care and renewable energy. Her endorsement of Zohran Mamdani played a major role in his victory in the New York mayoral primary last year. \n\nAnd it’s no longer just progressives who see her prowess. Kamala Harris praised Ocasio-Cortez in her memoir 107 Days and Ocasio-Cortez now sends out fundraisers for moderate Democratic campaigns like Abigail Spanberger’s run for governor of Virginia and Mary Peltola’s run for Alaska’s Senate seat, who might have shied away from her in the past.\n\nShe’s also become one of the most influential Democrats in terms of responding to Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\n“I want everyone to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this,” she told The Independent on Monday. “Understand how these dots connect. You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.”\n\nBy Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee’s X account blasted out her response.","summary":"The bill is a sign of Ocasio-Cortez’s growing influence within the Democratic caucus that once shunned her, writes Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/aoc-deepfake-ai-porn-house-b2900788.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/22/34/GettyImages-2213616598.jpg?crop=6091,4060.7,x0,y1.2&trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KPYamWej-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:28:38","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":392964760,"title":"Iran closes airspace to ALL flights as alarming map shows scores of planes scrambling","text":"This striking map shows scores of planes scrambling around Iran this morning — following the closure of the country's airspace. Iran issued a notice to ban pilots using its airspace, unless granted special permission, amid the tensions in the nation. Thousands of protesters have reportedly been killed in the country in recent weeks, and Iranian officials have signalled that executions lie ahead for detained suspects. And now travel to and from the country is limited, with no explanation, leaving commercial pilots scrambling. Images from Flightradar 24, which monitors live aviation, show a vast gap across the nation — which spans some 1,648,195 km 2 (636,372 sq mi) — and queues of planes above the borders. Pilots have instead had to follow a narrow corridor above Iraq , Kuwait, Bahrain and other countries to the east and south of Iran, which is home to more than 92 million people. Speaking last night, US President Donald Trump said he has been told \"on good authority\" plans for executions in Iran have stopped, even as Tehran has signalled fast trials and executions ahead in its crackdown on protesters. The US president's claims, which were made with few details, come as he’s told protesting Iranians in recent days that \"help is on the way\" and that his administration would \"act accordingly\" to respond to the Iranian government. However, Mr Trump has not offered any details about how the US might respond and it wasn’t clear if his comments Wednesday indicated he would hold off on action. Earlier Wednesday, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, Iran’s judiciary chief, said the government must act quickly to punish more than 18,000 people who have been detained through rapid trials and executions. The security force crackdown on the demonstrations has killed at least 2,586, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported. The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the country’s Islamic Revolution. The UK and US have begun evacuating key personnel from key Middle East bases amid expectations of strikes in a possible war with Iran. Air raid sirens at the main al-Udeid base in Qatar – used by British and American forces – were tested and essential personnel moved to “hard protection sites”. It comes amid fear of retaliation after President Donald Trump’s veiled threat to act “very strongly” if Tehran executes protesters who took to the streets.

Tim Kaine (D-VA), was on track to make it to a final vote until Sen. James Risch (R-ID) raised a point of order challenging the premise of Kaine's resolution. Then, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Todd Young (R-IN) voted to support said point of order after coming under intense pressure from Trump - who earlier called for their ouster from the Senate last week. \n\nVice President JD Vance then stepped in with a tie-breaking vote to break the 50-50 deadlock, handing Democrats a loss. \n\nNOW: U.S. Senate votes 51–50 against effort to block Trump from further Venezuela military action without Congress’ authorization, Vance breaks the tie. pic.twitter.com/GAiB2xTjrN\n— Clash Report (@clashreport) January 14, 2026\n\nDemocrats forced the debate after US troops captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a nighttime raid a few weeks ago.\n\n\"Here we have one of the most successful attacks ever and they find a way to be against it. It’s pretty amazing. And it’s a shame,\" said Trump on Tuesday during a speech in Michigan, slamming several Republicans who advanced the legislation including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (a 'stone cold loser'), and Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine ('Disasters'). Those three Republicans stuck to their guns in support of the Democrat legislation. \n\nTrump’s latest comments followed earlier phone calls with the senators, which they described as terse. The president’s fury underscored how the war powers vote had taken on new political significance as Trump also threatens military action to accomplish his goal of possessing Greenland.The legislation, even if it had cleared the Senate, had virtually no chance of becoming law because it would eventually need to be signed by Trump himself. But it represented both a test of GOP loyalty to the president and a marker for how much leeway the Republican-controlled Senate is willing to give Trump to use the military abroad. Republican angst over his recent foreign policy moves — especially threats of using military force to seize Greenland from a NATO ally — is still running high in Congress. -AP\n\nHawley - who initially helped advance the resolution last week - said Trump's message during a phone call was that the legislation \"really ties my hands,\" and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio promised him \"point blank, we’re not going to do ground troops.\"\n\nYoung, meanwhile, pointed to a letter from Rubio which stated that Trump will \"seek congressional authorization in advance (circumstances permitting)\" if he engaged in \"major military operations\" in Venezuela. \n\nThe Senators also said Rubio's efforts were instrumental in the administration releasing a 22-page DOJ memo which laid out the legal justification for snatching Maduro - which suggested that the administration has no current plans to ramp up military action in the country.\n\n\"We were assured that there is no contingency plan to engage in any substantial and sustained operation that would amount to a constitutional war,\" reads the memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Elliot Gaiser.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/senate-defeats-bill-block-military-action-venezuela-after-two-rs-flip-vance-breaks-tie","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/vance%20vote.jpg?itok=4nzuEbhO","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:27:06","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026},{"id":392947432,"title":"FBI raids journalist's home in 'extraordinary, aggressive' move","text":"The FBI has raided the home of a prominent journalist as part of an investigation into the illegal retention of classified government materials.\n\nA search warrant was carried out on the Virginia home of Washington Post journalist Hannah Natanson on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEDT), with FBI agents seizing several devices, including phones and laptops.\n\nNatanson is based in Washington, D.C. and is covering President Donald Trump's reshaping of the government and its effects on the United States.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Donald Trump loses the support of his most influential backer\n\nShe has not been accused of any wrongdoing and was not the focus of the probe, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIn an email to staff, executive editor Matt Murray said the actions were an \"extraordinary, aggressive action\".\n\n\"[It is] deeply concerning and raises profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work,\" he said.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi claimed Natanson had received classified information leaked by a Pentagon insider, and said the raid was requested by the Department of War, headed by Pete Hegseth.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Donors give hundreds of thousands to Trump heckler suspended by Ford\n\n\"The leaker is currently behind bars,\" she said in a statement on social media. \n\n\"I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort.\n\n\"The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.\"\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the alleged leaker is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator who has a top-secret security clearance.\n\nAn FBI affidavit accuses him of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports from secure government facilities that were later found in his lunch box and his basement.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Trump claims Iran has 'no plans' for executing protesters as US weighs strikes\n\nTrump appeared to address Perez-Lugones' arrest in an Oval Office meeting, calling him a \"very bad leaker\" and they would be in prison for an extended period of time.\n\n\"The leaker has been found, and is in jail right now,\" he said.\n\n\"There could be some others that we are looking at, and we are hot on their trail.\"\n\nThe Washington Post claims it was issued with a subpoena seeking information surrounding Perez-Lugones and asked the company to hand over communications between him and other employees.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:09 GMT, 14 January 2026 |Updated:00:25 GMT, 15 January 2026 \n\nAdam Peaty's family have reportedly told friends they have 'given up hope' of reconciling with their son after Gordon Ramsay's latest comment.\nThe celebrity chef, 59, referred to himself as 'dad' in a comment on Adam's wedding video where the Olympian said he would 'always choose' his new wife Holly. \nIt came after Adam was said to have uninvited his parents Caroline and Mark to his wedding day. \nAn insider told The Sun: 'It's been a really emotional time for them as a family. They're coming to terms with what has happened and that Adam has picked his side.\n'It's dashed any hope of reconciliation in the near future. They're keeping their heads down and trying to move on quietly. It's clear Adam's made his choice.' \nOn Adam's wedding video, which he shared on Instagram, Gordon wrote: 'Beautiful words @adamramsaypeaty True Love ❤️ congratulations love you both so much Dad ❤️'. \n\nAdam Peaty's family have reportedly told friends they have 'given up hope' of reconciling with their son after Gordon Ramsay's latest comment\n\nIt came after Adam was said to have uninvited his parents Caroline and Mark to his wedding day (pictured with his parents in 2016)\n\nOn Adam's wedding video, which he shared on Instagram, Gordon wrote: 'Beautiful words @adamramsaypeaty True Love ❤️ congratulations love you both so much Dad ❤️'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Adam's reps for comment. \nThe couple's big day was overshadowed by an ugly family dispute that led to Adam's own mother being barred from the service, with his sister Bethany the only loved one from his side to attend the day. \nThe Sun reported that in his father of the bride speech Gordon commented on how beautiful Holly looked and told Adam he was a 'lucky man', adding: 'Look at Tana and that's what you have to look forward to.'\nThe publication went on to claim that Gordon couldn't resist a sly dig at Adam's absent parents he told his daughter Holly: 'Shame you don't have the same.'\nIt was later revealed that swimmer Adam's estranged mother had been left 'outraged' and 'hurt' that Gordon referred to their bitter family feud in his speech.\nA family source told the Daily Mail she was left horrified by the moment in the speech and believed the celebrity chef had 'pre planned' the cruel swipe against her, calling it 'cruel' and 'very hurtful'.\nGordon doubled down on his speech as he appeared on This Morning last week, insisting that what he had to say at the wedding reception was 'perfect and warm'.\nHe said: 'It's tough, honestly. Being the dad with three daughters, you dream of that moment and that moment arrives and you're just like a hot mess.\n\nThe celebrity chef (right) referred to himself as 'dad' in a comment on Adam's wedding video where the Olympian said he would 'always choose' his new wife Holly\n\nA source said: 'It's been a really emotional time for them as a family. They're coming to terms with what has happened and that Adam has picked his side'\n'But, the speech was perfect, it went well and you've got to find that… You've got to be warm, emotional… It's a tough gig.'\nDaughter Tilly admitted that she had listened to the speech ahead of the big day, chiming in: 'I think it was Christmas Eve, I was sat in his room for an hour as he was just reading through it.\n'Going through everything but no tweaks were needed, it was perfect. It made everybody cry.'\nHolly defended her father's speech despite Caroline's outrage, saying she felt 'overwhelmed with happiness' during it.\nIn an interview with British Vogue, Holly shared a photo of herself and Adam smiling and laughing during Gordon's speech.\n'Listening to dad's speech, looking around the room and feeling overwhelmed with the love and the happiness on our guests' faces,' she said.\nIn another jibe at the estranged Peaty family, Holly revealed that her parents paid for her and Adam's luxurious honeymoon to Mauritius, saying it was their 'wedding present'.\nShe added: 'We're going to Mauritius to just lie by the sea – that was our wedding present from my parents. I had to tell Adam we weren't basing our honeymoon around a 25-metre pool…'\n\nThe couple's big day was overshadowed by an ugly family dispute that led to Adam's own mother being barred from the service\n\nHolly shared numerous snaps of the wedding with the fashion publication, including a rather awkward one of Holly and Adam posing with her parents and David and Victoria Beckham.\nWith Adam's parents not in attendance at the wedding, they stood alongside the groom in the photo with Gordon and Tana alongside Holly.\nAdam is thought to have not mentioned his family or parents in his speech, instead praising his swim coach Mel Marshall for being his 'everything', and for 'grounding and inspiring' him.\nHolly divulged several details about the wedding, revealing she and Adam had their first dance to George Michael's A Different Corner, saying they had the song picked when they first began dating.\n\n The surprising details from Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty's wedding: DOLLY BUSBY \nShe also described her father-daughter dance with Gordon as 'so special'.\nSitting at home more than 130 miles away in Staffordshire, Adam's broken–hearted mother Caroline was said to be 'beside herself' with grief at missing what should have been one of the happiest days of her life.\nSpeaking from the council house where Adam grew up, the 59–year–old told The Mail On Sunday: 'I'm not going to be hurt like this again.'\nShe had told Daily Mail that she felt as if Holly and Adam 'have cut my heart out'.\nIt was also revealed that moments before he walked into the abbey clutching the hand of his five–year–old son George, Adam was sent a devastating text message by his aunt Louise, who was also not invited to the wedding. \nIn it, she wrote: 'I hope you never suffer the depth of pain you have put your mother through and despite it all she loves you still. Shame on you both. Shame.\n'Remember on this, your happiest day, and on each anniversary of your happiest day, that you hurt your mum so deeply her soul screams.'\nThe roots of the family conflict go back to September 2024, when Adam and Holly snubbed wider members of the Peaty family by not inviting them to their engagement party.\nCaroline, who spent years ferrying her son to early–morning training sessions, was also not invited to Holly's glamorous hen do at Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds, even though the bride's mother, Tana, and friends including Victoria Beckham, were at the extravagant bash. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAdam Peaty's family 'have given up hope of reconciling with their son after his new father-in-law Gordon Ramsay's latest dig'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Trump went on to question Denmark's capability of defending the overseas territory from countries like China and Russia.\nThe remarks from the American leader reflected that fundamental differences remain between the three sides even after the meeting. “Greenland is very important for the national security, including that of Denmark,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the problem is there’s not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there’s everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela,” he added.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Danish foreign minister said that Trump remains intent on “conquering” Greenland as the talks with US officials failed to solve a “fundamental disagreement” that has led to unprecedented tensions between Washington and a Nato ally. It was “absolutely not necessary” for the US to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of the Danish kingdom, the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said late on Wednesday.\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland. And we made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the kingdom,\" he added. Rasmussen went on to urge Washington to engage in \"respectful\" cooperation over the Arctic island that is controlled by Copenhagen.\nEurope comes in Denmark's support\nMeanwhile, in a signal of European support, France, Germany and Norway have all said that they would contribute troops to a multinational force led by Denmark that would lead to “an increased military presence in and around Greenland, comprising aircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from Nato allies”, the Danish defence ministry has said in a statement.\nThe two sides did agree to create a working group to discuss ways to work through differences as Trump continues to call for a US takeover of the semi-autonomous territory of Nato ally Denmark. “The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Rasmussen told reporters after joining Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, for the talks.\nThe closely watched talks on Trump's demands to take over Greenland concluded after nearly an hour. US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday in what observers worried could be an ambush meant to pressure the Danes into ceding the territory.\nBefore the meeting, Trump said it would be “unacceptable” for Greenland to be “in the hands” of any country other than the US, reiterating his demand to take over the island hours before the high-stakes talks on its future.\n“The US needs Greenland for national security. Nato should be leading the way for us to get it,” the US president said on social media. The alliance would become “far more formidable and effective” with the territory under US control, he claimed. “It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” he said, referring to a proposed missile defence system. Overall, the issue continues to remain unresolved.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/trump-reaction-us-denmark-meeting-on-greenland-takeover-national-security-russia-china-nato-rubio-13968795.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/download-17-2026-01-a00b4ca2d9f71c8cbeb5d8a0203d9c3b.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:23:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":392964102,"title":"Capture of Maduro Wildly Popular in Latin America","text":"The transnationalists in the Democratic Party and at the United Nations and EU may be mad as hornets that Donald Trump ordered the arrest of Nicholas Maduro, but it turns out that Latin Americans, including Venezuelans, are thrilled that he did. \n\nThat, according to Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster in recent years. \n\nNet approval for the U.S. military operation to arrest Nicolás Maduro by AtlasIntel (A+)• Carribean (+67)• Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia (+57)• Paraguay and Uruguay (+55)• Colombia (+39)• Argentina (+27)• Central America (+35)• Venezuela (+22)• Brazil (+17)•… pic.twitter.com/T5VGs495iV— InteractivePolls (@IAPolls2022) January 14, 2026\n\nNet approval for the U.S. military operation to arrest Nicolás Maduro by AtlasIntel (A+)• Carribean (+67)• Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia (+57)• Paraguay and Uruguay (+55)• Colombia (+39)• Argentina (+27)• Central America (+35)• Venezuela (+22)• Brazil (+17)• Latinos in US and Canada (+18)• Chilie (+17)• Mexico (+12)1/5-11 | 11,285 Latin American Adults http://t.co/mlxC4S4Ecs \n\nIf you were to only listen to political elites around the world, you might get the impression that Trump acted as a bully, trampling all over the rights of Venezuelans and Latin Americans in general by kidnapping a democratically elected leader who was legitimately representing his people. \n\nThe reality on the ground, outside elite circles, is that Venezuelans in particular and Latin Americans in general are happy to be rid of this tyrant, and are looking forward to seeing him spend the rest of his life in a Supermax prison. \n\nTrump's move is popular across Latin America, with Mexico, not Venezuela, the least inclined to approve. This is mildly surprising because one would expect that even Venezuelans who dislike Maduro might disapprove of a military action within their country. Yet, even so, the raid has a net positive approval of +22 in Venezuela and only +12 in Mexico. \n\nStill, Trump doesn't get +12 on any issue in the United States, which tells you something about how polarized politics are here. \n\nEven within Venezuela proper, excluding Venezuelans who have fled (which is about 25% of the country!), only 25% disapprove of the military operation. About half the people there outright approve of the capture or are indifferent enough to have no opinion. \n\nLet that sink in. Only 25% say that Maduro should have been left alone. One really has to doubt that he won the election, huh?\n\nNow look at those other numbers. The popularity of Trump's move is off the charts in the Caribbean and in neighboring countries of Venezuela. All of these countries have been dealing with a refugee crisis, and have seen China, Russia, and Iran building up on their borders. Terrorist training camps have been springing up in Venezuela, and sane people do not want Hezbollah training in their backyards. \n\nAs usual, elite opinion is wildly divorced from popular opinion on such matters because elites do not have to suffer the consequences of their decisions. \n\nWhich is a shame. In a well-functioning country, elite opinion serves as a positive corrective to moderate the more volatile swings of popular opinion, which is why the Founders created a system that balanced the more democratic House with the more aristocratic Senate. But over the years, elites have come to see their interests as so fundamentally at odds with the hoi polloi that they seem indifferent to the needs and desires of ordinary folks. \n\nCases like this one are perfect examples. The reality on the ground is that Venezuela has been dragged down from being one of the wealthiest countries in the hemisphere to a desperately poor narco-state that has driven 25% of its population abroad. My wife has relatives in Venezuela who almost died of starvation after seeing their pensions and life savings inflated away. All her younger relatives escaped to Europe. \n\nYet when push comes to shove, Democrats and Western elites sided with the man most responsible for causing this crisis and for importing terrorists into his country. \n\nWhen there is such a large disconnect between elite opinion and that of the man on the street, elites have lost all their legitimacy. For all the discomfort people rightly have with populism, and I share some of that discomfort, because public opinion tends to be volatile and short-sighted, the reason why populist movements flourish is that elites stopped paying attention to the reality that people live. \n\nWhen the man on the street knows that his \"betters\" disdain him and his opinion, the favor is returned.

Did Tehran close airspace as unrest continues? Top 10 updates","text":"Iran has escalated its rhetoric against the United States by airing footage of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on state television, alongside a chilling warning that “this time, the bullet won’t miss”, even as Tehran partially shut its airspace amid mounting domestic unrest and regional tensions. The developments come at a volatile moment in US–Iran relations, with nationwide protests inside Iran, international travel disruptions, and renewed speculation over possible American military action.Below are the ten key developments shaping the fast-moving crisis.1. Iran airs Trump assassination footage with direct threatIran’s state broadcaster aired footage from the Butler, Pennsylvania rally showing a bloodied then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, accompanied by the message: “This time, the bullet won’t miss.”The message was widely interpreted as a reference to the Butler rally shooting, in which Trump was wounded during a pre-election speech. Iranian television paired the warning with a photograph from that event.2. Revolutionary Guards vow retaliationThe head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the regime would respond “at an appropriate time” to the United States and Israel, which Tehran accused of fomenting the unrest gripping the country.3. Trump signals support for Iranian protestersPresident Trump has repeatedly posted “HELP IS ON ITS WAY” and “MIGA” (Make Iran Great Again) on social media, signalling overt political support for demonstrators challenging Iran’s clerical leadership.4. US military posture tightens in the GulfEarlier, some US personnel were urged to leave a US military base in Qatar as a “precaution,” people in the know told CNN, underscoring growing concern about retaliation or escalation linked to the protests and rhetoric.5. Death toll mounts amid internet blackoutAt least 2,400 demonstrators have been killed since the crackdown began last month, according to a US-based rights group. An internet blackout remains in force, while one Tehran resident described the atmosphere as “extremely heavy and tense”.6. Iran denies plans for executionsIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi sought to allay international fears, telling Fox News: “There is no plan for hanging.”“Hanging is out of the question,” he said, according to Reuters—despite hanging being a historically common method of execution in Iran.7. Tehran partially closes airspaceAviation tracker Flightradar24 reported that Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international services operating with specific permission. The advisory was issued for a little over two hours, with live data showing airlines actively avoiding Iranian skies.8. Airlines reroute around Iran and IraqGermany’s Lufthansa said it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace “until further notice”, Agence France-Presse reported. The decision applies across the Lufthansa Group, including Austrian, Brussels Airlines, Discover, Eurowings, Swiss and ITA Airways, citing “the current situation in the Middle East.”9. Execution of Erfan Soltani reportedly postponedA cousin of Erfan Soltani told The Guardian that prison authorities had informed the family his execution had been postponed, without providing further details. The family has not seen or heard from him to independently verify the claim.10. Trump keeps military option openSpeaking at an Oval Office event, President Trump said killings in the Iranian crackdown appeared to be subsiding and that he believed there was “no plan for large-scale executions”, while stopping short of ruling out US military action.“We’re going to watch and see what the process is,” he told reporters, adding that he had received “a very good statement by people that are aware of what’s going on.”Regional fallout widensBeyond Iran, the diplomatic and travel impact is spreading. The UK Foreign Office has warned against all but essential travel to parts of Israel and the occupied West Bank, citing “heightened regional tensions”, and has reiterated its warning against all travel to Iran, alongside the temporary closure of Britain’s embassy in Tehran.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/did-iran-issue-bullet-wont-miss-warning-for-trump-did-tehran-close-airspace-as-unrest-continues-top-10-updates-11768435023359.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/15/1600x900/logo/AP01-14-2026-000679B-0_1768436061811_1768436081452.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:19:21","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":392931952,"title":"Newsom Diagnoses Trump, 79, as ‘Patient Zero’ of New Illness","text":"Gavin Newsom has branded Donald Trump “patient zero” of a new illness.\n\nThe 58-year-old California governor flipped one of the 79-year-old president’s favorite attack lines against him Wednesday, declaring in an X post that Trump suffers from “California Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nTrump routinely diagnoses anyone who criticizes him or his policies with the made-up condition “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nThe president was condemned by both sides of the aisle last month for saying that Rob Reiner was killed due to the “anger he caused others” through his “affliction” with “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nNewsom, who has repurposed Trump’s own social media antics to become the president’s biggest online troll, has begun using “California Derangement Syndrome” to hit back at critics who he says irrationally criticize the Golden State.\n\nThe likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender argued Wednesday that despite Trump’s supposed affliction with the illness, he “copies our policies on the regular to bring the riches of California to all the American people.”\n\nIn subsequent X posts, Newsom pointed to at least nine Trump policies he said were copied from California. \n\nHe called DOGE a “cheap imitation” of California’s Office of Data and Innovation, writing, “While Trump and Elon’s DOGE cut essential jobs and services, released loads of fake numbers, and then fizzled out, ODI continues finding real results that build value for Californians rather than making arbitrary, dangerous cuts.”\n\nNewsom also said the “Make America Healthy Again” initiatives led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were actually “born in California,” citing a law he signed in 2024 that banned certain artificial food dyes from K-12 campuses.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nBeyond the “patient zero” insult from Newsom, Trump’s health has been in the spotlight for months. He has been repeatedly photographed sporting dark bruises on both of his hands and has suffered from swollen ankles.\n\nHe was diagnosed in July with “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal interview about his medical treatments earlier this month, Trump said that the large daily dose of aspirin he takes to thin his blood causes his hands to bruise easily. \n\nHis doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella said Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—a much larger dose than the usual 81 milligrams—for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” Trump said. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years, and what it does do is it causes bruising.”","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/Michael Buckner/Getty ImagesGavin Newsom has branded Donald Trump “patient zero” of a new illness.\n\nThe 58-year-old California governor flipped one of the 79-year-old president’s favorite attack lines against him Wednesday, declaring in an X post that Trump suffers from “California Derangement Syndrome.”\n\n“Everyone knows that the President has spread California Derangement Syndrome (CDS) for many years — some say he was even patient zero — but in reality he loves California, @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom, and our world-leading policies!” Newsom’s press office wrote.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsom-diagnoses-trump-79-as-patient-zero-of-new-illness/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/TDTE3SOYLFATVPM6IFO7UZR25A.png?smart=true&auth=c07aed3b7827abc7278b41bbc54931e8c1ec78a76f8a5e64664f1100be41e710&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:19:16","author":"Erkki Forster","authors":["Erkki Forster"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":392979620,"title":"Senate blocks Venezuela war powers bill after Vance breaks deadlock","text":"The Senate on Wednesday blocked a bipartisan measure that aimed to prevent President Donald Trump from taking further military action in Venezuela, after two Republicans withdrew their support under pressure from the administration.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/senate-venezuela-war-powers/","image":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CLVYSND5WZKV3F4C3XJBQVSP2I.JPG&w=1600&h=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:18:36","author":"Noah Robertson,Theodoric Meyer","authors":["Noah Robertson","Theodoric Meyer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":392947444,"title":"'Tripwires' passed - is this the fall of the Islamic Republic in Iran?","text":"T﻿he reign of 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran as teetering on the edge, expert observers say, amid a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nBut it may be premature to say the regime is doomed – and even if it does fall, there is no indication of what would replace it.\n\nIranian authorities have responded with unprecedented force against the huge protests, with conservative estimates that more than 2400 people have been killed, and thousands more detained, amid an ongoing internet blackout.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump loses the support of his most influential backer﻿\n\nThe protests have been driven by an economic crisis triggered by international sanctions that have broken the infrastructure of Iranian society.\n\nAustralian political scientist Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who was imprisoned in Iran from 2018 to 2020 on espionage charges after visiting the country for a conference, said the Islamic Republic's rule, which began with a revolution in 1979, was now \"terminal\".\n\nWriting in Nine newspapers today, she said the protesters, who were gathering and marching nationwide, were \"desperate\".﻿\n\nREAD MORE: Trump claims Iran has 'no plans' for executing protesters as US weighs strikes﻿\n\n\"But the regime itself, and its shrinking cadre of loyal supporters, are desperate too.

Company at Centre of YouTuber Nick Shirley's New Video on Minnesota Daycare Fraud","text":"A popular YouTuber who rose to prominence after accusing members of Minnesota's Somali diaspora of operating fraudulent daycare centres has released a follow-up video expanding on his investigation. ,Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old independent journalist, became an online sensation after posting a video shortly before Christmas alleging widespread abuse of Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program. In his latest video, Shirley is seen continuing his inquiry alongside whistleblower David Hoch. ,The footage shows the pair attempting to locate a business called Advanced Mobility, which is listed on state records as a transportation company. Shirley is later confronted by a group of people at a Minneapolis location where the company was supposedly based. ,In the video, Shirley asks: \"Do you guys know where Advanced Mobility is?\" A man responds: \"Never heard of it…\" ,Hoch later says: \"On the State's website, it says it's in Suite 224, but it's a one-story building. None of the suites had the number 2 on them. It doesn't exist.\",,Shirley is shown being forced to leave the area by an angry crowd. ,Ahead of the video's release, Shirley shared a photograph of himself and Hoch outside the Quality Learning Center, one of the daycares featured prominently in his investigation. The centre had previously drawn attention online for a misspelling of the word \"learning\" as \"learing\" on its signage, an error that has since been corrected. ,In the photo, the two men are wearing sweatshirts displaying the daycare's former spelling alongside the words \"1-800-FRAUD\". ,In his original 42-minute video, Shirley and Hoch visited multiple daycare centres that had received millions of dollars in public funding. They allege that the centres did not provide childcare services to the number of children reported to the state. ,The video shows Shirley attempting to enrol a fictitious child at several facilities. In many cases, he is turned away without being given enrolment information. At other locations, the buildings appear unstaffed during stated operating hours. ,The owner of the Quality Learning Center disputed Shirley's claims, saying he visited outside the centre's operating hours, which were listed as 2pm to 10pm, Monday through Thursday. ,Shirley has alleged that as much as $110m in state and federal funding was fraudulently distributed through Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program. His claims have drawn attention from figures including Elon Musk, President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. ,Following the allegations, the Trump administration paused childcare payments to Minnesota and several other states while investigations were launched. The Department of Homeland Security also announced what it described as its \"largest immigration operation ever\" in Minneapolis. ,Minnesota Governor Tim Walz later ended his re-election campaign, saying he needed to focus on \"defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.\",Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old independent journalist, became an online sensation after posting a video shortly before Christmas alleging widespread abuse of Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/what-is-advanced-mobility-nick-shirley-new-video-minnesota-daycare-fraud-article-153449219","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153449221,thumbsize-103804,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153449221.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:15:13","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.36}]}
