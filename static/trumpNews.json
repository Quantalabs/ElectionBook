Trump announced Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon on Truth Social as MAGA fans gathered in a packed Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. To much applause, blaring country music and flashing lights, the 39-year-old Marine Corps veteran, ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ author and lawmaker entered the convention and accepted his official VP nomination. It appeared the entire room had been Vance fans for years once the news came across the loudspeakers, given how loud the roar of approval was. But when DailyMail.com pressed the MAGA fans on what they admire most about the Ohioan, his youth and good looks and military service were top of mind. But some revealed they did not know much about him at all. ‘I don’t know the gentleman,’ Tina, a delegate from American Samoa, told DailyMail.com. ”But by looking and hearing that he is a senator from Ohio, I am at peace with that.’ ‘He’s a handsome guy, he looks humble,’ she said of her first impressions of Ohio’s junior Senator. ‘That tells me that Donald Trump and the whole RNC leadership have committed to pick the right candidate for vice president.’ She said she took the 24 hour trip to Milwaukee to see former President Donald Trump and experience the festivities first-hand. Dale from Washington said ‘I don’t think we can do better’ than Vance. ‘I am thrilled to see JD Vance be the nominee for vice president. I think he is ideologically well aligned with Donald Trump.’ Dale added that Vance’s youth could mean he picks up the MAGA mantle. ‘I think he has a high potential to be our standard bearer four year from now and I am delighted with that,’ he said. ‘I know that he came from a pretty humble beginnings and that he has excelled in life,’ Dale continued. ‘He’s represented himself incredibly well in a variety of ways educationally, militarily and politically.’ A pair from ladies from Tennessee – Terry and Tess – also expressed their excitement about Vance’s potential new job. ‘We are so excited,’ the giddy pair proclaimed. ‘Especially I love the fact that he served in the Marine Corps,’ Terry said. ‘So we have a VP who understands and respects how important it is, our military, and it is a wonderful day for the Republican party.’ Tess, while still enthusiastic, may have not been as excited for the candidate as she was for the moment. She admitted she did not know who Vance was before he was announced as Trump’s running mate. But, she added, ‘President Trump, if he’s for someone, I am for him.’ Terry told DailyMail.com she knew the Ohio Republican, saying: ‘He is a familiar name and face’ from Newsmax and other conservative news outlets. Vance was joined at the RNC festivities Monday by his wife Usha Chilukuri Vance, who, like the senator, graduated from Yale Law School. The pair have been married for years and have three children together. Bill from South Carolina pointed to Vance’s classic conservatism and family image as a positive for the Republican presidential ticket. Though, he said, Vance getting the VP nod did come as a shock. ‘It was quite a surprise, but quite a pleasant surprise.’ ‘We’ve got a sharp young man, we’ve got a Marine, I’m proud military,’ Bill told DailyMail.com. ‘I am retired Air Force and to have a fellow serviceperson that could be vice president is fantastic news.’ Another South Carolinian, Jerry, agreed, calling Vance’s nomination ‘absolutely great.’ ‘I love the balancing the ticket,’ he said, and ‘I love a hard fighting young man to balance it out.’ Importantly, he noted, ‘I think it will attract a lot of younger voters.’ ‘I knew he was a very good senator, believes in conservative principles and he was a fighter. Not somebody to be put in a corner, which I like, and he’s a go getter.’ Ann, dressed in MAGA gear head-to-toe, said Vance is a thrilling ‘America first’ candidate. ‘Im excited about it I am looking forward to seeing what he plans to do,’ she said gleefully. ‘I believe he is going to support trump fully.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublican National Convention attendees and delegates say they love JD Vance as Donald Trump&#8217;s vice&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Opinions from Republican National Convention guests on Marine veteran JD Vance as Trump&#8217;s choice for Vice President first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/opinions-from-republican-national-convention-guests-on-marine-veteran-jd-vance-as-trumps-choice-for-vice-president/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Republican-National-Convention-attendees-weigh-in-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:09:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.352},{"id":251843860,"title":"Recap: Exciting Start to the Republican National Convention","text":"The first night of the Republican National Convention begins in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with an emphasis on “unity” in the aftermath of Saturday’s assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. This afternoon, Trump announced Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate. The 39-year-old senator from the Rust Belt—whose bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy was viewed by many as a chronicle of the forgotten men and women that Trump’s 2016 campaign and MAGA movement championed—is tied as the youngest Republican nominee for vice president in history with Richard Nixon, who was also a 39-year-old first term U.S. senator when President Dwight Eisenhower picked him as his running mate in 1952. Vance has been a rising star in the populist conservative movement and has shown himself to be a passionate advocate in the Senate for the working-class Americans who have been ignored by both parties. In 2021, – Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow interviewed Vance at his home in Cincinnati: This is my 75-minute interview with @JDVance1 from 2021 from his historic home in Cincinnati.If you would like to get to know him, how he thinks, and what matters to him, I think you’ll appreciate this ==— Alex Marlow (@AlexMarlow) July 15, 2024 In the roll call vote today, Republican delegates gave Trump the GOP’s nomination for an historic third time, making him one of only six Americans to receive a major party’s nomination more than twice. The five others are Thomas Jefferson, Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan, Franklin Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon. Among tonight’s scheduled speakers are reportedly: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI)Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA)Gov. Mark Robinson (R-NC)Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX)Rep. John James (R-MI)Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL)Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC)Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA)Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD)Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL)Charlie Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USASen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)Sean O’Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Saturday’s assassination attempt has shaken an already unprecedented campaign pitting a sitting and former president against each other in a repeat of the last election. It also follows weeks of drama within the Democratic Party about replacing President Joe Biden as the nominee after his disastrous debate performance last month. And it comes after months—and years—of what Trump and Republicans have characterized as lawfare tactics waged against Trump by his political opponents, including Special Counsel Jack Smith’s classified documents case which was dismissed by a federal judge just this morning. In what looks unfortunately like an effort to big-foot the RNC coverage, Biden is scheduled to do a prime-time sit-down interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt at 9 p.m. Eastern this evening. If it proceeds like his interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, his declining poll numbers are unlikely to improve. NBC News posted a preview clip of it: In an exclusive interview with Lester Holt, President Biden said it was a mistake to use the word “bullseye” while discussing former President Trump, but said to “focus on what [Trump is] doing”. pic.twitter.com/TufdyiZq8v— NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt (@NBCNightlyNews) July 15, 2024 Since Saturday, Biden has attempted to re-orient his campaign messaging after an assassin’s bullet left Trump one inch away and one head turn away from death. The assassination attempt has left Democrats and their establishment media allies with no message to convey to a country exhausted by years of divisive rhetoric smearing Trump and the Americans who voted for him as deplorables, extremists, insurrectionists, racists, religious fanatics, traitors, and even terrorists. This demonizing rhetoric was ratcheted up exponentially by Biden, who centered his re-election bid on the message that Donald Trump is a Hitlerian existential threat to democracy and to the whole world—a characterization that by implication makes Trump a target for any would-be assassin incited to take out a dictator. After defiantly raising his fist in the face of death, Trump now has the ability to be something no one expected him to be—a uniter. Trump told the Washington Examiner that he re-wrote his convention speech to focus on unity after the assassination attempt. “It is a chance to bring the country together,” Trump said. “I was given that chance.” One thing seems certain: Trump has unified the Republican Party. -’s Joel Pollak, reporting from Milwaukee, notes that the mood inside the convention center is “jubilant,” but it’s “somewhat subdued among the anti-Trump protesters outside.” Follow – News for live updates below, all times Pacific. *** 4:56 p.m. PT Next up, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson takes the stage who says, “I am the first black lt. governor of North Carolina, and I intend to be the first black governor of North Carolina in November.” He gives his background, explaining how he lost two manufacturing jobs in North Carolina due to NAFTA, which he reminds people that Joe Biden voted for. “As governor, I will not forget where I came from.” He hails Trump’s record of protecting manufacturing jobs and fighting for American workers. This is a strong speech from a conservative star we will no doubt be seeing a lot of in the future. 4:47 p.m. PT MAGA favorite Rep. Marjorie “MTG” Taylor-Greene takes the stage and heralds Corey Comperatore, the firefighter and Trump supporter who died at the rally on Saturday while protecting his wife and children. She says “we will honor Corey’s memory” by building the country he wanted. She then throws down some red meat for the base, calling out the Democrats for celebrating Transgender Awareness Day on Easter Sunday and for having an economy calls out Democrats’ economy as “of, by, and for illegal aliens.” 4:27 p.m. PT Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson reminds the delegates that the Republican Party was started in the Badger State. Then he takes apart the Democratic Party’s policies: “Those forgotten Americans are forgotten no more.

Bearded Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who was announced Monday as the ex-president’s running mate, is one of the few modern-day politicians who doesn’t favor the baby-faced look. When Vance emerged in the public eye with his best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” in 2016, he fell in line with norms and rocked the clean look. But his beard was in full force when he was elected to the Senate in 2022, becoming one of the few politicians on Capitol Hill with facial hair. Facial hair seemingly went out of favor for politicians in the mid-20th century. Charles Curtis was the last mustachioed vice president in 1933 during his time under Herbert Hoover. The last veep to sport a beard as hefty as Vance’s was Charles Fairbanks, who was Teddy Roosevelt’s second-in-command from 1905 through 1909. There were rumors that Vance’s uncommon beard could have cost him his new title as Trump’s vice presidential pick — with GOP campaign insiders telling The Bulwark that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee “just doesn’t like facial hair.” But Trump shot down the speculation last week, assurming Fox News Radio host Brian Kilmeade that the beard was fashionable on his running mate. “He looks good,” Trump said. “Looks like a young Abraham Lincoln.” Some research suggests that voters equate facial hair with personality traits that politicians want to steer clear of: aggressive, traditional and anti-feminist. According to a 2015 survey by the Oklahoma State University, voters see men with beards and mustaches as being opposed to reproductive choice and “more supportive of gun rights, military spending, and the deployment of force” — all of which rings true for Vance.","summary":"If Donald Trump wins in November, his veep pick could become the first vice president in nearly a century to wear facial hair.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/jd-vance-would-become-first-vp-with-facial-hair-in-nearly-century/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85513297.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2gzD1BJy-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:05:55","author":"Katherine Donlevy","authors":["Katherine Donlevy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":251844008,"title":"President Biden says it was a ‘mistake’ to say he wanted to put a ‘bull’s-eye’ on Trump","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden told NBC News in an interview Monday that it was a “mistake” to say he wanted to put a “bull’s-eye” on Republican nominee Donald Trump, but argued that the rhetoric from his opponent was more incendiary while warning that Trump remained a threat to democratic institutions. Those remarks from Biden came during a private call with donors last week as the Democrat had been scrambling to shore up his imperiled candidacy with key party constituencies. During that conversation, Biden declared that he was “done” talking about his poor debate performance and that it was “time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye,” saying Trump has gotten far too little scrutiny on his stances, rhetoric and lack of campaigning. The NBC interview came as Biden and his reelection team prepared to resume full-throttle campaigning after a brief pause following the weekend assassination attempt on Trump. The president and his campaign let loose a flurry of criticism after the GOP nominee announced freshman Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate. “He’s a clone of Trump on the issues,” Biden told reporters as he headed to Nevada for a series of speeches and campaign events. “I don’t see any difference.” Once Vance was tapped as Trump’s vice-presidential pick, the Biden campaign hit send on a fundraising solicitation signed by the president, and his team issued a blistering statement, saying he picked the freshman senator because he would “bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda.” For her part, Vice President Kamala Harris phoned Vance to congratulate him and left him a voicemail message, according to a person familiar with the matter. And to NBC anchor Lester Holt, Biden made it clear that he would keep up his focus on Trump. While he acknowledged his “mistake,” Biden nonetheless said he is “not the guy who said I wanted to be a dictator on day one” and that he wanted the focus to be on what Trump was saying. It’s Trump, not Biden, who engages in that kind of rhetoric, Biden said, referring to Trump’s past comments about a “bloodbath” if the Republican loses to Biden in November. “Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?” Biden said. “Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?” The NBC interview, scheduled before the attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Pennsylvania, had been part of Biden’s broader strategy to prove his fitness for office after angst grew among Democrats because of his disastrous June 27 debate performance. The Biden campaign recalibrated some of its political plans in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on Saturday, pulling advertising off the air and hitting pause on messaging. The White House also scrapped Biden’s planned Monday visit to the Lyndon B. Johnson library, where he had been slated to deliver remarks on civil rights. Biden also spoke privately to Trump after the assassination attempt, a call that the president described in the NBC interview as “very cordial.” “I told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing,” Biden said. “He sounded good. He said he was fine and he thanked me for calling. I told him it was literally in the prayers of Jill and me, and I hoped his whole family was weathering this.” It’s still not finalized when Biden’s campaign ads will resume airing. But Biden is pressing on with the Nevada portion of his previously scheduled western swing, which will include remarks to the NAACP and UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights and advocacy group. He’ll also headline what’s been billed as a “campaign community event” on Wednesday in Las Vegas. Biden has acknowledged that his candidacy and agenda will be under attack at the Republican National Convention this week, and aides had felt no need to halt their campaign completely, particularly while Biden comes under scrutiny in Milwaukee. Asked whether Biden would adjust his messaging this week in light of the assassination attempt, O’Malley Dillon pointed to his Oval Office address as a “roadmap for the whole country,” which she said was no different than Biden’s broader message from the start of his candidacy. “You’re going to hear the president continue to make his affirmative agenda clear,” she said. “Not just in abstract terms, but very specifically on how it continues to help the American people versus this very negative point of view and extreme agenda that the American people have already said that they don’t want.” Biden’s renewed campaigning this week comes as Democrats have been at an impasse over whether the incumbent president should continue in the race even as he was defiant that he would stay in. Biden has made it clear in no uncertain terms that he remains in the race, and aides have been operating as such. It was unclear if the attempt on Trump’s life would blunt Democratic efforts to urge Biden to step aside, but it appears to have stalled some of the momentum, for now. No Democrats have called for him to exit the race since the shooting Saturday night. In the hours before the shooting, Biden was still being confronted by frustration and skepticism from Democratic lawmakers. Rep. Jared Huffman of California said he asked the president during his meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus about objectively assessing the trajectory of the race, and if the Lord almighty doesn’t intervene would Biden consider “the best earthly alternative”: meeting with former Presidents Obama and Clinton, Democratic leadership including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi “to seek their advice.” Huffman said on a social media post that Biden “disagreed with the notion that we are on a losing trajectory.” And while Biden expressed a “willingness to listen” to other voices, Huffman said he doubted any would be persuasive. “I continue to believe a major course correction is needed, and that the President and his team have yet to fully acknowledge the problem, much less correct it,” he said. But now, several Democrats who requested anonymity were skeptical that there would be enough drive among lawmakers to successfully try to pressure Biden not to run, especially because they are scattered and away from Washington until next week and because Biden has said he won’t step aside and seized the opportunity to quickly respond to the shooting over the weekend. The people requested anonymity to characterize private conversations. Asked by Holt if he has weathered the worst of it from his own party, Biden responded that 14 million Democratic voters selected him through the primaries and added, “I listen to them.” His mental acuity is “pretty damn good,” Biden added, but he said the question of his age was “legitimate” to ask. Many in the Democratic Party had been looking to congressional leaders Jeffries and Schumer to voice concerns directly to the president. Jeffries met with Biden at the White House on Thursday night, while Schumer went to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday for his visit with Biden, which occurred just before the assassination attempt on Trump. There were still deep concerns that Biden is not up to the job and a sense that pressure to try and find another candidate could ramp up again when lawmakers return to Washington. Congressional Democrats were watching the Republican National Convention and Biden’s appearances this week with awareness that the dynamics could change — again. ___ By Seung Min Kim, Aamer Madhani and Mary Clare Jalonick Associated Press AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.","summary":"President Joe Biden told NBC News in an interview airing Monday that it was a “mistake” to say he wanted to put a “bull’s-eye” on Republican nominee Donald Trump, but argued that the rhetoric coming from his opponent was more incendiary.","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2024/07/president-biden-says-it-was-a-mistake-to-say-he-wanted-to-put-a-bulls-eye-on-trump.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/5UAFDP3HVVDANFAMTDIJCRIEVY.jpg?auth=9f21550fd54956cadab87383c6860a00a2a4caac10d847370649a819718fd815&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:05:04","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.593},{"id":251844014,"title":"MSNBC says network won’t tone down coverage of Donald Trump  after pulling ‘Morning Joe,’ staffers were peeved at decision","text":"After pulling “Morning Joe” from the air on Monday following an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life, MSNBC says it’s going back to business as usual. Staffers were peeved at the decision to yank hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough off the air, according to sources. One told us it was directive from the top for hosts to “tone down” coverage on Trump in wake of the shocking shooting at Saturday’s Pennsylvania rally. A spokesperson for the network, however, denied to Page Six that there’s any top down directive to tone down coverage on the Republican nominee and former president. We’re told that network hosts Joy Reid, Rachel Maddow and Nicole Wallace — some of Trump’s most vocal critics on the network — will be in their anchor chairs hosting special coverage on the Republican National Convention throughout the week. Brzezinski and Scarborough will return to their show on Tuesday morning. An MSNBC insider told us Brzezinski and Scarborough’s absence on Monday was “overblown,” and that the duo were simply yanked for breaking news coverage led by MSNBC anchors Katy Tur and veteran Andrea Mitchell. “Morning Joe” was sidelined because, “This was a moment to cover [the incident] as facts only. It was 24 hours a day and the network pulled all the resources in one big feed. Programming will continue as it is,” the insider said. A NBCUniversal spokesperson on Monday denied a CNN report that the liberal network replaced “Morning Joe” with breaking news to avoid embarrassment from hosts and pundits saying anything inappropriate about Trump. “Given the gravity and complexity of this unfolding story, NBC News, NBC News NOW and MSNBC have remained in rolling breaking news coverage since Saturday evening,” the rep told The Post.

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have implored the country to bring down the political temperature since the shooting, but scores of protesters Monday weren’t keen on pulling their punches. “Turn it up. Let’s do it,” Richard Danc, 20, from Waukesha told The Post. “I’m very sad — I’m very disappointed in both of the candidates. I’m going to hell. We’re already in hell. So just crank it up because clearly whatever we’re doing right now isn’t working.” Danc stressed that he wants protests to remain peaceful – but also more ambitious. He was demonstrating in defense of democracy. “If Trump were to be taken out on that day, it might not have been the worst thing,” he boldly told The Post. “I can’t say that it would have been good.” Waving around signs reading “Lock him up” and “Stop Trump and Racist Republicans,” scores of protesters converged at the Red Arrow Park, just outside of the security perimeter Monday. The Coalition to March on the RNC organized the Monday Milwaukee demonstration, backed by a slew of left-wing organizations. Most of the political signs and t-shirts were directed at specific causes rather than Trump, such as the Israel-Hamas war, immigration, ending the blockade on Cuba, fighting for poor people, and abortion. “What happened on Saturday has no impact on our plan at all,” one of the protest leaders stressed to reporters. “I think Republicans are experts on political violence,” another leader said during the presser. One protester, who would not provide his name, carried around a sign that said “Ballots not bullets,” switching from hiding the sign behind a garbage bag and flaunting it with pride. He told The Post that he wants the animosity in the public discourse to cool down and fretted that political violence could spiral out of control. Despite harboring bitter frustrations with Trump, many protesters expressed their sympathies for him weathering that attack. “I really regret that the president was injured. I’m glad that he’s fine,” Peggy Haas, who was with the Wisconsin Cuba Coalition, told The Post. “But that doesn’t stop the fact that he’s not the right man for the job.” She also said other friends and acquaintances of hers intended to join in the protests but opted against it “because they were afraid of gun violence especially after Saturday.” “I’ve had so many texts saying ‘be safe, be safe,'” Haas added. In one unique form of protest, the Democratic Messaging Project doled out condoms as part of its push for abortion rights. “We believe that not only is abortion getting restricted and going away if we have Trump and MAGA Republicans in charges again,” Lisa Liddle, a project director at the group told The Post. “We believe that birth control is going away,” “We are making sure that kids and people know by distributing these condoms on campuses,” she added, explaining that the group will distribute those out on campuses in battleground states. Some of the condoms had messages such as “Protect your f—ing freedom” and “Protect yourself from Republicans” with a barcode that would direct user’s to the group’s website. The ploy is partly aimed at rallying men in the abortion fight. Liddle contended that the assassination attempt against Trump was “very unfortunate” but means the left needs to “fight even harder to make sure that he doesn’t get elected” again. “That heinous act of violence was basically witnessed as a symptom of the politics of one man, and that’s Donald Trump,” she added. Tony Srok, 62, from Milwaukee paraded around a sign that said “Lock him up,” turning a rallying cry at Trump rallies about Hillary Clinton against the GOP presidential nominee himself. “He tried to overthrow the election on January 6th by having that protest, by having an insurrection. And I think he should be held accountable for the actions he took that day,” Srok told The Post. Srok denounced the shooting against Trump over the weekend and expressed fears that Republicans may want to pursue “revenge” on Democrats over that attack. “This isn’t what America looks like, it would’ve been a stain on America if we lost another president to an assassin,” Srok said. Srok bemoaned that he believes the political discourse will return to “the same old, same old” after uproar over the assassination attempt settles down. Some conservative protesters also crashed the Red Arrow Park. One of them was heard screaming profanities at a protester chanting against Trump. Another demonstrator wore a shirt that said “Homo sex is sin” and flashed a sign that said “BLM are racist thugs.” Activists purporting to be from a group, the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, had signs pegging Trump as a “baby killer” for backing softern language on abortion in the planned changes for the new GOP platform. At the march got underway, demonstrators were heard chanting “No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA!” Protests are expected to continue throughout the week during the convention. Top security officials previously suggested to reporters that they are not planning to drastically retool their plans. “We are confident in the plans that we have and are moving forward with those plans,” Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the Secret Service’s RNC convention coordinator, told reporters Sunday.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump's brush with death over the weekend didn't persuade the storm of protesters who assembled outside the Republican National Convention from tempering their rhetoric on him.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/protesters-at-rnc-keep-up-hot-rhetoric-against-trump-after-assassination-scare/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85512974.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UGv0NjS6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:03:19","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.574},{"id":251844006,"title":"JD Vance nominated as Trump’s VP running mate (Photo gallery)","text":"MILWAUKEE -- Donald Trump on Monday announced Ohio Sen.

Follow the Daily Excelsior channel on WhatsApp The gunman has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks (20). “At this point in the investigation, it appears that he was a lone actor, but we still have more investigation to go,” said Robert Wells, the executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch. The FBI, he said, is investigating this as an assassination attempt,” and also as a “potential domestic terrorism act.” The counterterrorism division and criminal divisions are working jointly together to determine the motive, he added. The FBI is leading the investigation into the assassination attempt of Trump at an election rally in Pennsylvania. Trump was hit with a bullet that pierced the upper part of his right ear. He is now safe and is continuing with his schedule that includes travelling to Milwaukee to attend the Republican National Convention, which would formally nominate him as the party’s Presidential nominee against incumbent Joe Biden. “The shooter may be deceased, but the investigation is very much ongoing. And, because of that, we are limited in what we say at this point,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said. “What we witnessed yesterday was nothing short of an attack on democracy and our democratic process,” he told reporters at a news conference in Washington DC. According to an FBI official, the investigation into the gunman at Donald Trump’s rally Saturday has not yet turned up any mental health issues, threatening posts or other motives, but cautioned it was still early. The shooter, as per FBI, used an AR-style rifle chambered in 5.56mm, a common calibre for such weapons. The New York Times said authorities were scouring the gunman’s social media and other property as they sought to determine a motive for the attack. Biden is likely to address the nation at 8 pm from the Oval Office. He will give “a forceful and needed address to update the nation on the horrifying attack on Donald Trump and the need for every American to come together to not just condemn, but put to an end political violence in this country once and for all,” a campaign official told the daily. Crooks graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, earning an associate degree in engineering science, school officials said in a statement, adding that they were “shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events.” Kimberly Cheatle, director of the Secret Service, in a memo to her agents said “the attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, is a moment that will forever be remembered in history.” (PTI)","summary":"MILWAUKEE, July 15: The gunman who shot at former President Donald Trump during an election rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday appears to have acted alone, according to the FBI, which is investigating it as a potential &#8220;domestic terrorism&#8221; act.

The Secret Service also did not sweep the roof where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at the former president. The horrifying new developments reported by CNN come as the Secret Service faces mounting questions over how the 20-year-old managed to get just 130 yards from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday. Crooks shot Trump in the ear with an AR-style rifle his father purchased legally. A new video emerged on Monday shows Trump fans looking, pointing and questioning why Crooks was on the roof . Multiple witnesses have said they warned law enforcement that a gunman was crawling on the building, but didn’t respond before he started shooting. ‘Look, they’re all pointing,’ the man behind the camera is heard saying as it pans from the stage to the roof of an industrial building where a figure is seen crawling. ‘Yeah someone’s on top of the roof – look.’ The roof where Crooks lay down with his weapon was flagged as a security concern, and was swept by local law enforcement not the Secret Service. One bullet clipped the former president’s ear, but his campaign says he is otherwise ‘fine.’ A turn of his head to look at the jumbotron where charts of immigration statistics were on screen may have saved his life, according to his aides and analyses of the bullet’s path. Former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the crosshairs of the attack as he protected his wife and two daughters. David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, sustained critical injuries but are now listed as ‘stable.’ All three are Pennsylvania natives. The video showing a new angle of the shooter moments before he opened fire reads on screen, ‘Plenty of time and opportunity to eliminate the threat,’ as questions circulate over where the security failure was that allowed for the assassination attempt. ‘There he is, right there. See him?’ the camera man says as he points to the figure of Crooks laying on his side atop the building in the video obtained by deaf North Carolina-based journalist Annie Dance.

The shooting of Trump at a rally in the rural town of Butler in west Pennsylvania echoed a chilling incident in Japan two years ago, when a lone gunman shot and killed former prime minister Shinzo Abe as he addressed a crowd in Nara ahead of nationwide elections. While Trump and Abe represent the conservative parties in their respective countries and were reported to be close political allies, analysts suggest it is too soon to reach conclusions on the parallels between the two attacks. “We should not try to compare the two incidents, at least until we find out the motive of the US attacker,” said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. “The man who shot and killed Abe had complex reasons and it was less of a political attack than personal,” he told This Week in Asia. “With the Trump shooting, we just do not know enough yet. His motivation might have been political, it might have been personal, it could have been the result of mental illness. “We should not speculate until the dust settles, although I am sure that politicians around the world are going to be paying more attention to their personal security from now on.” The suspect in the Trump attack has been identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was from Bethel Park, an hour south of Butler, and worked in a care home. Police told US media that he was registered as a Republican but had made a donation of US$15 in the past to a Democratic Party support group. The weapon used in the attack had been legally purchased by his father. As well as injuring Trump with the volley of shots, Crooks killed an onlooker at the rally and injured two other people. Secret Service snipers shot him dead on the roof of a building overlooking the rally site. An investigation is expected to determine why Crooks did not raise any red flags with law enforcement agencies and how he was able to get close enough to the Republican Party’s likely presidential candidate to come so close to killing him. The incident has clearly shaken authorities in Japan, with the national police agency instructing prefectural police to ensure safety within and outside venues that are being used by speakers. Local headquarters were also told to make sure that countermeasures announced after the killing of Abe on July 8, 2022, have been implemented. Plainclothes officers protecting the prime minister as he spoke on a street corner in Nara were widely criticised after the attack for failing to stop the shooter, Tetsuya Yamagami, from approaching from the rear. A former member of the Self-Defence Forces, 41-year-old Yamagami had constructed a rudimentary firearm that he used to shoot Abe with. Psychologists in June declared that Yamagami was mentally competent to stand trial. He has reportedly told police that he decided to shoot Abe as he believed he supported the Unification Church. Yamagami said the religious organisation, originally from South Korea, had bankrupted his family after convincing his mother to make huge donations. Despite heightened security around politicians in the immediate aftermath of Abe’s death, a man was able to get close to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as he campaigned in Wakayama prefecture, central Japan, in April last year to hurl an explosive device. One police officer sustained minor injuries. The assailant was arrested but has refused to answer questions from the police. “I think we can say that we are seeing more and more of those sorts of political violence cases involving individuals acting on their own rather than as an organised group,” Hinata-Yamaguchi said. “Before the killing of Abe, we seem to have had quite a long time of relative peace, but now the authorities have to adapt to new types of political violence.” A solo actor who does not hint at his plans or communicate electronically with fellow conspirators is extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify and track, Hinata-Yamaguchi emphasised. “It is hard to say if an attack like this might inspire copycat attacks elsewhere, but it is certainly possible. On the other hand, it will also raise security levels around anyone who is seen as a potential target,” he said. “But whatever happens now, politicians everywhere are going to be much more alert to the threats they face, and the authorities are going to be looking to devise new solutions based on everything they learn from this attack.” On Sunday, Kishida said in a post on X that he was praying for Trump’s well-being. “We must stand firmly against violence that challenges democracy,” he said. “I wish for Mr Trump’s speedy recovery.”","summary":"Incident has echoes of Shinzo Abe’s killing by a lone gunman two years ago, although analysts say it is too soon to compare the attacks.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3270508/japan-steps-security-politicians-foreign-dignitaries-after-trump-rally-shooting","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/15/59a00051-00dd-404f-a393-bcac83b24a1a_55d8cbc6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:00:14","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":251844070,"title":"Unsinkable: Trump Riding Wave Of Wins","text":"After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case. As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat. His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants. But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high. On Thursday the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden. Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable. \"It sure seems he's on a roll,\" Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP. The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, \"and he is coming out of all this justified.\" As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention. \"I personally think it was the hand of God,\" Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention. Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything. \"He's never going to stop being a fighter,\" he said. \"And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people.\" - 'A lot of obstacles' - Trump earned the nickname \"Teflon Don\" for weathering a multitude of storms. The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels. After an explosive \"Access Hollywood\" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote. That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later. Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election. \"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country,\" businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention. \"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/unsinkable-trump-riding-wave-of-wins-270891.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/trbnmngo_donald-trump_625x300_02_June_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 00:00:10","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":251843900,"title":"The day the leftist lie died","text":"The leftist claim to moral authority drew its last breath on Saturday night. As the country continues to process the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the left loses the moral high ground from which it condemned Trump’s rhetoric. The image of President Trump’s blood-stained face with fist raised in defiance following the assassination attempt will be a historic image for generations to come. The progressive left has been an insurgent force in culture for decades and now dominates the realms of journalism, education, and law. But this power will not hold. After years of straining to connect Trump to the events of January 6, 2021, it will be impossible to convince the public that leftist rhetoric played no role in Saturday’s assassination attempt. Following the shots fired in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Democratic Party lost its argument alleging a commitment to “people over politics.” Cries of compassion ring hollow For decades, those on the left have sold the public on an image of progressive politics and philosophy rooted in love and compassion. This has been juxtaposed against the supposed bigotry, hatred, and intolerance of their opposition. This messaging increased with the rise of Donald Trump, a man the left targeted as the epitome of hatred. In one of the most memorable tweets of the 2020 election cycle, Jill Biden tweeted “decency is on the ballot” as a succinct, pithy way of contrasting the character of the two candidates. Since the 2020 election, however, leftist rhetoric and discourse surrounding Trump has become increasingly unhinged. He has been the subject of endless, ill-conceived critiques portraying the 45th president as a wannabe dictator. Such libel has been a staple in media profiles from the New York Times to the Washington Post. Tenuous, often out-of-context connections between Trump and the Nazi Party have become so normalized that they no longer raise an eyebrow. Crying wolf will have consequences Hypocrisy has a way of killing power. The left is about to meet the consequences of its actions. The progressive left has been an insurgent force in culture for decades and now dominates the realms of journalism, education, and law. But this power will not hold. The homogeneous echo chambers, thoroughly controlled by various forms of left-wing thought, already appeared increasingly absurd in a world where politicized criminal charges are brought against the Democratic Party’s only serious political threat. The fact that the spiral of leftist hatred has culminated in an attempt on Trump’s life shatters whatever illusion of “decency” remained attached to the Democratic Party’s public brand. No one aside from the most zealous partisan can pretend as if the progressive left lives in a world where love is its highest value. Constant apocalyptic predictions and hysterical accusations of bigotry, hatred, intolerance, and misogyny come at a price. And today, the left’s bill came due. Gone are the days of calling for compassion over hatred. The hypocrisy can no longer hold. Neither angels nor demons As we collectively process the violence of the weekend, now, more than ever, it is essential to begin to understand hatred as a phenomenon from which no political party or philosophy is immune. The left is not a beacon of tolerance. Claiming compassion or love for the downtrodden means little if this belief is not paired with consistent behavior. For the sake of our country, Americans must demand the left live up to its ethic of compassion. The consequences of giving a free pass to progressives as “well-intentioned” are now abundantly clear.","summary":"The leftist claim to moral authority drew its last breath on Saturday night.\n\nAs the country continues to process the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the left loses the moral high ground from which it condemned Trump’s rhetoric.

Harris, 59, made the call after former President Donald Trump announced Vance, 39, as his VP pick on Truth Social. The vice president also said in her voicemail that “she hoped to see [Vance] at the CBS News debate,” the campaign official added. The Biden campaign has accepted a veep debate hosted by CBS News, but the Trump camp has been pushing for a Fox News debate instead. The conversation about a vice presidential debate has been stalled since May, when the two 2024 campaigns first laid out their terms for the head-to-head match-up. Republican National Committee delegates unanimously nominated Vance as the GOP’s official vice presidential candidate during their convention in Milwaukee. Harris congratulated him on his selection and “welcomed him to the race,” CNN reported. If elected with Trump, Vance would be the second youngest vice president in American history. “After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D.

Monday's buyers seemed to agree with this assessment, with many betting on stocks poised to do well under a Republican administration. Trump will likely be more lenient when it comes to mergers and acquisitions than Biden, according to Cramer. Big investment banks can be levered to the success of mergers, Cramer said, so investors should pay attention to outfits like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, all of which saw gains Monday. He also suggested that the Trump administration would let Kroger acquire Albertsons and Tapestry snap up Capri, deals the Biden administration has tried to block. According to Cramer, investors may want to avoid stocks related to saving the environment. During the first Trump administration, the government rolled back more than 100 environmental policies, according to The New York Times. If government subsidies get taken away, Cramer said companies like Enphase, SolarEdge, Sunrun and Sunnova — all of which were down by Monday's close — could see earnings take a hit. \"Eight years ago, in a moment gripped by political fever, I put a button on my sound board that said 'Trump stock, Trump stock,' he said. \"After this weekend's events, it looks like I have to bring it back.\"","summary":"CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors which stocks could stand to see gains if Donald Trump returns to the White House, as well as ones that may notch losses.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/15/cramer-names-stocks-that-could-rally-or-fall-if-trump-wins-in-2024.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107083445-1656625558127-IMG_1723b.jpg?v=1695682524","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2024/M07D15/7000345762/MM-A-071524-short_L.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:55:06","author":"Julie Coleman","authors":["Julie Coleman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":251843950,"title":"Attacker stabs and wounds soldier patrolling Paris ahead of Olympics","text":"A French soldier was stabbed outside a big train station in Paris and the attacker was arrested, officials said, while the city was under a high security alert 11 days before the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics.

The term “Secret Service” also achieved its highest spike in interest for the past five years by far Saturday. The terms “long distance shooting” and “gun store near me” both saw significant interest booms, reaching new 12-month highs the day after the attack. “How do I move to Canada” also reached a new 12-month peak then. Google Analytics measures overall interest in a given search term rather than each individual usage — meaning the top of the chart represents the most the term has ever been searched in a given time period (100 points) and the bottom represents the least (0 points). The ghoulish “How do you miss” was trending on Twitter just moments after the attack, and “Civil War” quickly became the site’s most popular keyword. The surge of interest in these terms highlights the extreme political stress Americans have been living under — a factor some experts believe contributed to the weekend attack. The Internet has played the parts of villain and savior in the assassination attempt against Trump and the troubled man who carried it out, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks. Crooks has been identified as an avid consumer of firearm-related content online — he was even killed by Secret Service while wearing a T-shirt from a popular gun-tutorial YouTube channel. Online radicalization — defined as adopting extreme political, social or religious beliefs or committing acts of violence after engaging with online content — has become a growing epidemic in the United States for decades. One study found social media played a role in the radicalization of 27% of individuals between 2005 and 2010. In the five years following, that figure skyrocketed to 73%, per University of Pennsylvania. More recently, surveys show that nearly one-third of Internet users have encountered hate speech online, with the figure rising to 50% among online gamers. YouTube’s algorithm specifically has been found to inadvertently promote extremist content. Trump himself seems interested in combating these trends following the attempt on his life, telling reporters he has “thrown out” his original, hyper-aggressive Republican National Convention speech for this week in favor of a new draft that will attempt to unite and heal the wounded nation instead.","summary":"The day of and after the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump saw major usage spikes on Google for search terms such as “Civil War 2” and “American Civil War.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/panicked-search-terms-spike-online-after-trump-rally-shooting-civil-war-2/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/searchresultscivilwar.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721070834&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wUYtyZeY-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:52:13","author":"Joe Durbin","authors":["Joe Durbin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.171},{"id":251843376,"title":"T-shirts with image of Trump raising his fist after assassination attempt are for sale in China","text":"BANGKOK, Jul 15 : Images of the moment have already been splashed across the world’s front pages and papered many corners of the internet — former President Donald Trump, ear bleeding, with his right hand clenched in a fist above the Secret Service agents surrounding him after he was shot. And now they’re available on T-shirts for as little as USD 4 on China’s e-commerce platforms. Over the weekend, Chinese retailers leapt into action on Taobao and JD.Com, the country’s two biggest e-commerce platforms, to profit from the images after an assassination attempt on Trump at a rally on Saturday. “Make America Great Again,” read one T-shirt, according to screenshots that circulated online. “Shooting Makes Me Stronger,” read another. The shirts used a variety of photos that captured the moment, including one of the most indelible made by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci. While people around the world may have recognised the power of the images, Chinese manufacturers are particularly well positioned to quickly jump on something trending and make it into a product. It is the world’s factory floor and its highly competitive domestic e-commerce industry means its small retailers are poised to exploit all sorts of consumer product trends. By Monday, many of the T-shirts were no longer easily found, with a search for “Trump T-shirt” on JD showing no results and on Taobao showing other Trump T-shirts. When asked, however, some shops were able to provide hidden links to the merchandise — and other shirts could be found by searching for a Chinese nickname for Trump for a time. It’s not clear why the shirts were hidden, but China’s domestic internet, which is largely isolated from the global internet, is controlled by an extensive censorship system that also monitors its online commerce sites. The use of the images could raise copyright concerns. “The Associated Press is proud of Evan Vucci’s photo and recognizes its impact,” said Lauren Easton, AP’s vice president of corporate communications. “In addition, we reserve our rights to this powerful image.” An AP journalist was able to order a shirt with an image of the moment for 61 yuan (USD 8), even though the original link said the shirt was no longer available. A customer service representative said it violated regulations, without elaborating, but then provided a link to order the shirt. Another shop on Taobao offered five different T-shirts, all based on photos from Saturday’s rally, when asked whether it had any showing Trump being shot at. They were selling for 34.9 yuan (USD 4). For a time on Monday, searches that included “Trump Jianguo” turned up shops selling T-shirts with images from the rally — though that worked less well as the day went on. Trump Jianguo began being used as a nickname on the Chinese internet when Trump was in office. Jianguo — which means “build a country” — was a popular patriotic name for men in the 1950s and 60s when China’s Communist People’s Republic was young. The nickname is a jibe from people who felt some of Trump’s policies actually helped China, despite his sometimes fiery rhetoric. Chinese entrepreneurs have long done brisk business on Trump’s name, as much of the candidate’s merchandise was made in the Chinese wholesale centre Yiwu during the 2020 election. Alibaba, which owns Taobao, and JD.Com did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

That’s a sharp break from Sunday, when the party and the nation were reeling from the assassination attempt made against the 45th President and Republican nominee. MassGOP Executive Director John Milligan told the Herald that delegates were “very excited” to be at the convention, despite the weekend’s events. MassGOP Chairwoman Amy Carnevale said the “mood in Milwaukee is one of perseverance.” “The fact that there was an assassination attempt of our nominee just ahead of the nominating convention is certainly unnerving to all Americans,” the Carnevale told the Herald through a spokesperson. “However, President Trump has signaled to Republicans that we must push forward stronger than ever.” Monday’s session was taken up with the business of nominating Trump along with his newly named running mate, Ohio’s U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance. The convention runs for four days, and Trump is scheduled to speak Thursday. Trump has apparently re-written his address following Saturday’s shooting to soften the tone, but according to Carnevale the party’s message is unchanged. “Republicans are united and resolute in our determination to defeat Joe Biden in November,” she said. Trump Campaign Senior Advisors Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a joint statement that Monday’s nomination of Trump and Vance represents the “most unifying and competitive ticket in political history.” “After President Trump secured the Republican nomination in record time, enthusiasm continues to grow for his movement to Make America Great Again, and we will deliver a sweeping victory for the Trump-Vance ticket on November 5,” they said.","summary":"\"Republicans are united and resolute in our determination to defeat Joe Biden in November,\" MassGOP Chair Amy Carnevale said.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/15/massgop-reports-mood-of-perseverance-at-convention/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162158932.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:48:35","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.121},{"id":251843352,"title":"Social media posts after Trump's attempted assassination lead to firings, resignations locally","text":"The aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania on Saturday was a reminder of how ugly social media can be and that thoughts posted online for the world to see can have real-life consequences — like costing people their jobs. Three people in public positions in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and leader of a nonpartisan voting-rights organization in Atlantic County, New Jersey, are among those out of work, either by firing or resigning, since the shootings at Trump's rally in Butler Township. The former president was struck in the ear by a bullet that 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired from a nearby rooftop. Another man in the crowd, Corey Comperatore, was shot and killed and two others, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, were injured by gunfire. A Secret Service sniper stationed on another roof shot and killed Crooks before Trump was led off the stage and the shocking news began to spread around the world. MORE: Mike Jerrick says recent absence from 'Good Day Philadelphia' was to recover from prostate cancer surgery About an hour after the shooting, Upper Darby council member Jess Branas, posted on her personal Facebook page, \"A for effort.\" Branas' post was picked up by Libs of TikTok on X, formerly Twitter, an influential conservative account whose posts are \"designed to generate outrage\" on the right. Branas, a Democrat who also worked as an aide for state Rep. Heather Boyd, lost her Harrisburg job in the fallout of her Facebook post, she told the Delaware County Daily Times. She claimed the post was not in reference to the assassination attempt but about burning steaks she had been grilling with friends. \"It was taken out of context,\" said Branas, who said she received hundreds of comments harassing her after her post went viral. Boyd didn't mention Branas by name, but wrote on X that the matter had been \"dealt with swiftly.\" In Prospect Park, Jim Simmonds, the borough's fire chief and fire marshal resigned Sunday night amid backlash to his Facebook post that read, \"A little to the right next time please.\" The post has since been deleted. The fire company accepted Simmonds resignation and shared a link to a GoFundMe page to support the family of Comperatore, who was a former volunteer fire chief in Buffalo Township, Butler County. \"The Prospect Park Fire Company does not condone this type of behavior by our members or our leadership\" chairman Joe Magee said. \"We are deeply saddened by Chief Simmonds comments and agreed that it would be best if he stepped down in his role as Chief.\" In Radnor, Sierra Clark, secretary of the board of the Wayne Business Association, resigned after commenting, \"I hope he dies,\" on a post about the shooting. \"We were made aware last night that one of our board members expressed troubling thoughts through her social media posts,\" WBA leaders said. \"We sincerely apologize for any harm or offense caused by these posts. We have no tolerance for this type of messaging, and it in no way represents what the Wayne Business Association stands for, nor the views of our board and membership.\" And in New Jersey, the Globe reported Sunday that Victoria Druding from the Atlantic County chapter of the League of Women Voters resigned after writing to social media: \"Trump was shot!!! Unfortunately, he was only grazed.\" Druding initially said she would resign, but then tried to walk it back. She deleted the post on Sunday and called it a \"stupid error in judgment,\" but by then a number of local leaders had seen and shared what she wrote. \"This lady is the head of Atlantic County League of Women Voters! And people question why no one wants to get involved with them. She should be ashamed of her comments,\" said Don Purdy, the Atlantic County chair of the Republican Party and he shared a screen shot of Druding's deleted post In a statement, the executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey condemned Druding's post calling it \"inexcusable\" and not representative of the values of the voting organization. Political leaders have spent the last two days urging Americans to tone down their partisan language. \"There is no place in America for this kind of violence or for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can't allow this violence to be normalized,\" President Joe Biden said during a televised address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. \"You know, the political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated.

Cops at the scene noticed Crooks, 20, on top of the building just 130 yards away from the rally stage and took two photos of him because he was acting suspiciously, sources told WPXI. It’s not clear if he had the AR-style rifle on him when he was first seen scaling the AGR International Inc. factory or if he stayed on the roof for the whole time. Local police used the building as a ‘staging area’, leading to questions on Monday night over whether officers were inside when Crooks pulled the trigger at least eight times. The shocking new allegations surfaced as authorities and the U.S. Secret Service face mounting questions over how Crooks was able to shoot the former president and kill a member of the rally crowd. A horrifying video shows witnesses pointing at the roof and shouting at officers trying to warn them. MAGA fans also say they alerted law enforcement to Crooks as he crawled to his shooting position, but he was still able to shoot. Law enforcement at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania are facing intense scrutiny after it was revealed the roof was flagged as a security ‘vulnerability’. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said on Monday night that she would not resign despite mounting calls for her to step aside over the huge lapses that led to one of the most horrific acts of political violence in history. The local Pennsylvania sheriff defended the police officer who confronted Crooks on the roof moments before the shooting. Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe confirmed on Monday that one of his armed officers encountered the gunman seconds before he unleashed carnage on the former president’s rally. The cop, who has not been named, retreated when Crooks pointed his AR-style rifle at him. Slupe defended the decision and told KDKA he would ‘have done the same thing.’ ‘All I know is the officer had both hands on the roof to get up on the roof, never made it because the shooter had turned towards the officer, and rightfully and smartly, the officer let go. ‘I mean, people think the officers are supermen like you hold on the roof with one hand while you are hanging on for dear life and pull a gun out. It doesn’t work that way. Slupe also said that members of his department were alerted to Crooks’ suspicious behavior before the rally began and started searching for him right away. Local police, not the Secret Service, swept the building, but Crooks was still able to climb to the top and take aim at the former president. Slupe acknowledged that Crooks was in the ‘secondary ring’ of protection when he opened fire. He said the Secret Service is responsible for the ring immediately around the president, but local police take control of the outer ring. The former president, 78, survived the horrifying assassination attempt when the bullet missed him by less than an inch on Saturday afternoon. It came eight minutes after he took the stage at 6:03pm ET, where Trump began his remarks and pointed to a large graphic in the same direction where the shooter was perched atop an AGR International building. Even before he took the stage, Trump supporters said they spotted the gunman ‘bear-crawling’ across the roof with a rifle, but claimed their warnings to Secret Service were ignored. ‘I’m thinking to myself “Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage,”’ one witness told the BBC. ‘The next thing you know, five shots ring out.’ With the sun still high on a bright day, Trump emerged to ‘God Bless the USA’ playing over the loudspeakers at 6:03pm, and remained waving and shaking his fist at the crowd for several minutes. Trump brought out a large graphic with statistics on the migrant crisis at the southern border, and told the crowd at 6:11pm: ‘That chart’s a couple of months old…’ ‘If you want to really see something that’s sad, take a look at what happened,’ Trump continued – before he abruptly grabbed the side of his head as several ‘pops’ filled the event space. The 78-year-old dropped to the floor in an instant as five more shots rang overhead in quick succession, before four Secret Service agents raced to the stage and dove on top of the former president. Stunning images showed Trump cowered on the floor as agents protected him, with blood dripping down his cheek. Several more Secret Service agents continued to flood the stage, while four heavily armed officers lined the perimeter ordering attendees to ‘get down.’ The sniper, sat 400ft across from the rally on an exposed rooftop, fired another shot at the stage a second later while Trump fans streamed out of the bleachers. Secret Service scrambled to take control of the pandemonium where three attendees were hit, one fatally, within a matter of seconds. An emergency room doctor with blood spattered on his shirt later said he sprang into action to perform emergency CPR on one victim. ‘The guy had spun around was jammed between the benches and a head shot here. There’s lots of blood and he had brain matter,’ he told CBS News. ‘So I got him together so I got people there really helpful. I did CPR chest compressions as well.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks was spotted on the roof&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Thomas Matthew Crooks Seen on Roof 26 Minutes Before Attempted Assassination against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/thomas-matthew-crooks-seen-on-roof-26-minutes-before-attempted-assassination-against-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/15/22/87304819-13637439-Shortly_after_Trump_was_raced_away_the_lifeless_body_of_Thomas_M-a-2_1721080264100.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:47:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.56},{"id":251843894,"title":"Widow of firefighter killed at Trump rally shooting refuses to take Biden call: 'He would not have wanted me to talk to him'","text":"The widow of the firefighter who was shot and killed during the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump said she rejected a phone call from President Joe Biden because that's what her husband would have wanted.

Holt interviewed the president at the White House on Monday afternoon. The network aired excerpts on NBC and MSNBC with the full interview to be broadcast at 9 p.m. Biden isn't backing down despite some Democrats, including members of Congress, governors, donors and media commentators, saying he should step down in the race against former President Don Trump. \"I listen to them,\" he said about the voters who selected him to be their nominee during the primaries and caucuses. Pressed on whether he has the stamina and cognition to be president for another four years, he said: \"I'm old. But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good. I've gotten more done than any president has in a long time in three-and-a-half years. I'm willing to be judged on that. \"I understand why people say, 'God, he's 81 years old. Whoa. What's he gonna be when he's 83 years old, 84 years?' It's a legitimate question to ask.\" When asked whom he consults when deciding to stay in the race or dropping out, he responded: \"Me. I've been doing this a long time.\" Biden was interviewed by ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos on July 5 in Madison, Wis., hours after a campaign stop there and one week after his poor debate performance with Trump. Biden also has appeared at a rally in Michigan. The interview was Biden's first since his rival, former President Donald Trump, was wounded Saturday night during a campaign rally in Butler, Pa. Biden was asked about telling donors: \"We're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye.\" \"Look, the truth of the matter was, what I guess I was talking about at the time was there was very little focus on Trump's agenda.\" Holt said: \"Yeah, the term was 'bulls-eye'.\" \"It was a mistake to use the word -- I didn't say crosshairs, I meant bulls-eye, I meant focus on him, focus on what he's doing,\" Biden said. The president then mentioned Trump's comments and actions. \"I'm not the guy that said, 'I want to be a dictator on day one.' I'm not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. ... You can't only love your country when you win. And so the focus was on what he's saying,\" he said. And he said: \"I am not engaged in that rhetoric. Now my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric: He talks about it'll be a bloodbath if he loses, talking about how he's going to forgive all the actions, I guess suspend the sentences of all those who were arrested and sentenced to go to jail because of what happened in the Capitol.

In a wide-ranging on stage interview in Deer Valley, Utah, Daly said that the tech sector is still in the midst of an upward trajectory “because it’s bringing us all kinds of new things. It helps us do better business, better at how we live, making the world a better place.” The U.S. labor market, which has been tight since 2021, is now softening, Daly said. The U.S. unemployment rate reached 4.1% in June, a two-and-a-half year high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Firms are looking for ways to meet demand and do things more quickly. She spoke of Honeywell which had a labor shortage and used AI to augment its workforce as opposed to replacing its workers. “They were replacing tasks not people and people were getting oriented to do other things,” Daly said to an audience filled with venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs. “No tech in the history of all technology has reduced employment, not net,” she added. The Federal Reserve has also been expected to cut interest rates this year at least once but has yet to do it. Inflation has remained stubborn which has made the Fed leery of cutting rates, according to CBS News. Daly said she expects a “policy adjustment over next coming terms,” but wouldn’t give a hint on how many rate cuts might come or when. Daly was also questioned on how rate cuts might impact the valuations of booming technology companies like Nvidia. The chip company currently has a market cap of $3.16 trillion. Valuations of tech companies move around in ways that are not always tied to the economy, she said. “How a change in interest rates will affect valuations isn’t clear,” Daly said. When asked about Donald Trump’s anticipated return to the White House, Daly was also circumspect. The Fed is charged by Congress to remain independent even if it is faced with a presidential administration that is hostile, Daly said. The Fed’s most important asset is its integrity, while its most important tool is the trust of the people, she said. “The American people are our shareholders. We have to earn their trust and respect by [doing] great work,” she said.","summary":"SF Fed Reserve Chief Daly says she expects a policy adjustment to come but no hint on a rate cut","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/15/sf-federal-reserve-chief-artificial-intelligence-impact-benefits-jobs-brainstorm-tech/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/53859561893_132968e3ab_o-e1721086607617.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:41:26","author":"Luisa Beltran","authors":["Luisa Beltran"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.033},{"id":251843754,"title":"How JD Vance and Trump compare on policy issues","text":"How JD Vance and Trump compare on policy issues Former President Donald Trump selected Ohio Sen.

The event comes just days after Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Even before Saturday’s deadly shooting, the RNC was set to be a major event in the campaign. Trump will unveil his pick for running mate, the person who will be his vice president if he wins the election in November. And party members will likely be trying to put their best foot forward through speeches and presentations as possible future leaders of the GOP conference. If Trump wins in November, he will be term-limited out from running again, meaning a new Republican candidate will have to emerge for 2028. But before that, Trump is expected to take the stage and address the Republican party. The RNC will livestream proceedings across a number of online platforms, including YouTube and X. A number of networks have announced special programming for the prime-time portions of the convention, where Trump and others will give speeches from the hall where delegates are convening. Other media outlets, both local and national, will stream whatever is happening on the floor. The actual space itself is closed to the public, behind several layers of security accessible only to delegates, officials, volunteers and credential media. Trump is the headliner for the event, and is expected to address delegates on Thursday evening, the last day of the convention. His remarks will come as those delegates cast their votes for him as the party’s nominee. In a joint statement released Saturday evening, the Trump campaign and RNC said Trump “looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States.” After the assassination attempt on Trump, anger and anxiety are coursing through the party, even as many top Republicans call for calm and a lowering of tensions. As elected officials, politicians and a few regular Americans address the conference, the question is which tone will prevail in the aftermath of the attack: Will it make speeches even more fiery or will calls for calm prevail? Trump, for his part, has reportedly been changing his speech in response to the shooting. Much of the speech was originally focused on the Biden administration’s policies, and likely wouldn’t have sounded much different from his usual campaign rally stump speeches — tangential, off the cuff and undeniably Trumpian. But in the wake of the shooting, the former president has reportedly sought a softer message. He has been calling for national unity, as members of his party and Democrats, including President Joe Biden, call for cooler heads to prevail and for political violence to be avoided. Trump has said he will carry that message into the convention. He told The Washington Examiner that he has rewritten his speech after being the target of an attempted assassination. “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” he told the news outlet in an article posted Sunday evening. In the interview, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee says he will now call for a new effort at national unity, noting that people from different political views have called him after the attack. Republicans are convening at the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee, home to the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks. Other facilities such as University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center are hosting event spaces, including a filing center for the hundreds of reporters from around the world who are in town to cover the convention. Wisconsin is among the handful of states expected to be battlegrounds in this year’s general election, with an anticipated close finish between Biden and Trump. Biden won the state by the slimmest of margins over Trump in 2020; last week, it was among the three “blue wall states” that Biden’s campaign said in a memo present his “clearest pathway” to victory in November. Trump is expected to give his nomination acceptance speech Thursday, although there’s another speaker who might be just as highly anticipated. Trump waited until Monday to announce Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate in a post on his Truth Social platform, building anticipation as convention plans came together and delegates arrived in town without knowing who would be atop the ticket with their nominee. As is tradition for vice presidential picks, Vance is expected to take the stage on Wednesday night. There are themes for each night’s speeches, from economics to immigration to crime to national security. The campaign hasn’t released a full slate of speakers, and it’s possible we won’t know who is taking the stage each night until hours before. Democrats are set to gather next month in Chicago for their own convention. And in September, there’s another debate scheduled between Biden and Trump.

The “360 With Speedy” interview was taped prior to the attempted assassination of Trump, but was released Monday. Early in the interview, Speedy noted that they didn’t have a lot of time, though the edited clip ran nearly 20 minutes. One of his first questions for Biden was about his age and his decision to stay in the race. Biden reiterated that he had “to finish the job.” Speedy asked Biden about Trump’s appeal to hip-hop artists, citing Lil Wayne and Kodak Black showing him their support. The president responded, “Well, I’m not sure he has that allegiance, number one. Number two, if you look at his record in terms of African Americans and minorities, it’s abysmal the way he handles everything.” Biden added that he got started in politics because of the Black community, citing his state being segregated when he was growing up. Biden also talked about Trump’s comments about “Black jobs,” noting, “He means menial labor. That’s what he thinks. You know, he thinks he’s going to sell golden shoes or sneakers.” The president took the attack to Trump throughout the pre-shooting interview, telling Speedy, “Donald Trump, I think — as I said from the beginning when I ran in 2020 — that he’s a real danger to the country, to a democracy.” Biden said that he hadn’t planned to run in 2020, but made the decision after seeing what happened with the infamous Charlottesville protests and Trump responding to the death of a young woman by saying there were “good people on both sides.” As is often the case when Biden speaks recently, his voice was hoarse and he regularly cleared his throat as he sipped what he said was tea. He also misspoke at times, including talking about becoming vice president in “2020.” When asked what one thing he thought Trump would do well is, Biden responded, “I’m not being facetious — I can’t think of a single thing.” He added, “Look what his objective is. It is totally anti-democratic. He says that he wants to be a dictator on day one. He means it. He says he will not recognize the outcome of the next election.” Biden continued, noting that when the election didn’t go his way last time, Jan. 6 happened. “He encouraged people to go up and riot. Police were killed. People were wounded. People were hurt. The place was smashed up. They were hanging… anyway, what did he do? He sat there in the dining room off of the Oval Office, watched it for three hours, didn’t say a damn thing. And now he says if he loses there’ll be a bloodbath?” The president drew contrast with Trump on immigration and said, “We’re the only nation in the world that isn’t xenophobic.” He said there is xenophobia here, but that it isn’t our policy, and pointed to Trump trying to stop a border deal from going through under Biden because it would make him look bad. Biden on the War in Gaza Biden also defended his support for Israel during the ongoing controversy over the war in Gaza. “If there weren’t an Israel, every Jew in the world would be at risk,” Biden said. “So there’s a need for it to be strong and a need for Israel to be able to have, after World War II, the ability for Jews to have a place that was their own. You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. A Zionist is about whether or not Israel is a safe haven for Jews because of their history of how they’ve been persecuted.” Knowing how his words could come off given the sensitivity around the issue, Biden added, “Now, you’ll be able to make a lot out of that, because people don’t know what a Zionist is.” But he also pointed to his support for the Palestinian people. “I’m the guy that did more for the Palestinian community than anybody,” Biden said, also pointing to opening up the border to food and medicine coming into Gaza. “I mean, I’ve been very supportive of the Palestinians, but Hamas, they’re a bunch of thugs,” Biden said. “I was over there about eight days after the massacre, saw photographs of mothers and daughters being tied in a rope together, kerosene pouring on their heads and leaving them to burn to death. Nothing’s happened like that since the Holocaust.” Asked about why Muslims and Arab Americans would vote for Biden given his stances, he noted the work he’d done with numerous Middle Eastern nations and said, “I don’t have a prejudiced bone in my body. The Arabs are good people. They need help now.” When asked whether Vice President Kamala Harris was up to being president, Biden said, “I think she is. She’s first-rate. I wouldn’t have picked her otherwise. She was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a great senator. She’s first-rate, and I think she’s qualified.” Appealing to Young People He also teased doing more to help people with rent and said, “I think you’re going to see the idea that we’re going to be able to deal with rent. We’re going to be able to deal with housing costs.” Biden is reportedly set to call for a cap of 5% on annual rent increases, according to the Associated Press. The president used the interview to point to efforts he’s made to help young people, including forgiving college debt, and calling out Trump for not doing more to deal with racism or to improve the way minority groups are treated. “I mean, what has he done?” Biden asked incredulously. The interview opened with Speedy playfully offering the president what he said was vodka, before playing it off. “I may be Irish, but I’m the only Irish you’ve ever met that’s never had a drink,” Biden quipped. Biden ended the interview by stating that he’ll be on the ballot this November, “Unless I get hit by a train.” During the interview, Biden also defended himself against concern about inflation under his presidency, talked corporate greed and addressed other issues.

One has been convicted of 34 felony counts, staged a coup to overturn the 2020 election, and openly states he will be a dictator on Day One when elected. The other is a public servant who has honorably served America for decades, secured our democracy in 2020, and whose health appears to be failing. The Republicans did not do right by the American public to find another nominee for president. The Democrats in power need to do the right thing for the American public to secure our democracy with an immediate transition plan for a new Democratic nominee. Democracy is on the ballot and we can’t let Joe Biden “dictate” that he will remain in the race unless the “Lord Almighty” tells him so. We must rise up together to preserve America. Andrea Bloom Pleasanton Kinzinger is creative answer for Democrats Then my brother suggested a running mate for Kamala Harris (should Biden quit the race) that made perfect sense: Adam Kinzinger. We would get the solid Democrats voting for Kamala and the swing voters who do not like Trump would vote for Adam. He is young, a veteran, a hero and has a backbone as demonstrated when he parted ways with the MAGA Republicans to disavow the Jan. 6 coup. Let’s ask Adam. It’s the best of both worlds, We have to be creative, folks.

J. D. Vance (R-Ohio). In the hours following the shooting at Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Democrats and their media allies called for toning down the political rhetoric. In an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night, Joe Biden encouraged everyone to \"lower the temperature in our politics.\" 'If the GOP under Trump has indeed evolved into an authoritarian party, then Vance hails from its authoritarian wing.' \"While we may disagree, we are not enemies,\" Biden said, according to a White House transcript. \"We’re neighbors. We’re friends, coworkers, citizens. And, most importantly, we are fellow Americans. And we must stand together.\" \"We all have a responsibility to do that.\" The Biden campaign even suspended all its public communications — including attack ads that present Trump as \"an existential threat to our democracy.\" 'Divisive, MAGA-aligned': Leftist outlets weigh in on Vance Those calls for unity seem to have been short-lived. After Trump announced Vance as his vice presidential candidate, leftist outlets Vox, Mother Jones, and MeidasTouch and even the \"Biden-Harris\" campaign resorted to the same incendiary language Biden had seemingly put on hiatus. Vox editor in chief Swati Sharma wrung her hands that Vance had dared challenge the 2020 presidential election, advocated on behalf of J6 defendants, expressed support for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and crossed the aisle to try and advance policies that benefit the working class. \"If the GOP under Trump has indeed evolved into an authoritarian party, then Vance hails from its authoritarian wing,\" Sharma wrote. \"His worldview is fundamentally incompatible with the basic principles of American democracy.\" Sharma tiptoed up to the line of calling Vance a threat to democracy without ever crossing it, though she came close, insisting that Vance has occasionally evinced deeper \"anti-democratic fervor\" than Trump. Inae Oh, a senior news and engagement editor at Mother Jones, was similarly careful. Oh described Vance as having \"a deeply MAGA persona\" and as using \"divisive, MAGA-aligned rhetoric.\" With Trump and Vance together, Oh claimed the top of the Republican ticket is \"steeped in election lies.\" By contrast, MeidasTouch author Aaron Parnas seemingly made no attempt at subtlety or circumspection and openly called Vance \"one of the most extreme VP picks in recent memory.\" Biden does about-face on lowering the temperature While Parnas' words may seem inflammatory, he seems to be echoing the sentiments of the Biden-Harris campaign, which claimed Vance would help advance Trump's \"extreme MAGA agenda,\" according to a statement shared by MeidasTouch. \"Over the next three and a half months, we will spend every single day making the case between the two starkly contrasting visions Americans will choose between at the ballot box this November: the Biden-Harris ticket who's focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone, and lowering costs; or Trump-Vance — whose harmful agenda will take away Americans' rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations,\" the statement apparently concluded (emphasis added). In an interview on Monday with Lester Holt of NBC News, Biden expressed few regrets about his language regarding Trump. \"How do you talk about the threat to democracy — which is real — when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything — because it may incite somebody?\" Biden asked. Though Biden did admit that calling to put Trump \"in a bullseye\" — as Biden did last week — was \"a mistake,\" he indicated his overall point was obvious. \"I meant focus on him. Focus on what he’s doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told at the debate,\" he explained. \"I’m not the guy that said, 'I want to be a dictator on day one.' I'm not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I'm not the guy who said he won't accept the outcome of this election automatically,\" Biden continued. Biden insisted that while Trump has continued to unleash vitriol about a possible \"bloodbath\" if he loses, he has remained above the fray. \"I am not engaged in that rhetoric,\" he said.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) just hours after the Ohio senator was tapped as former President Donald Trump’s running mate and nominated as the party’s vice presidential nominee during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Harris called Vance shortly after Trump tapped him as his running mate, but the two did not speak, according to a source familiar. Rather, Harris left a message to “congratulate him on his selection, welcome him to the race, and express her hope that the two can meet” in the debate. Harris and the Biden campaign previously accepted a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News earlier this year, which is expected to take place later this summer. Several Democratic lawmakers close to the Biden campaign expressed confidence in Harris’s ability to face Vance onstage, lauding the vice president’s experience in the Senate and White House as she prepares to debate policy. “The VP will take it to J.D. Vance,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told reporters on a campaign call shortly after Vance’s nomination was announced. “I’m looking forward to this debate.” Vance has not yet publicly accepted an invite to debate Harris, but the Ohio Republican indicated to the Washington Examiner in May he would not hesitate to meet with her. “You know, I’ll do whatever I need to to serve, but I’m very nervous about debating the vice president,” Vance quipped in a sarcastic tone. “She’s very eloquent.” Republicans were quick to praise Trump’s decision to tap Vance as his No. 2, lauding the junior senator from Ohio as a step into the party’s future. Several RNC delegates at the convention celebrated Vance as the mark of a “new generation of leadership for the Republican Party,” with one Republican consultant noting that Vance, as the “heir apparent,” will strengthen the GOP presidential ticket in 2028. Meanwhile, Harris must grapple with questions about her own ticket as Democratic lawmakers have considered whether President Joe Biden should be removed from the ticket. Harris sits with an average approval rating of 38.5%, which could also hurt her if she goes head to head against Vance.","summary":"MILWAUKEE — Vice President Kamala Harris has already accepted a debate against Sen.

She revealed to the news outlet: \"I didn't talk to Biden. I didn't want to talk to him. My husband was a devout Republican and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\" Helen confirmed that her family has not yet heard from Donald Trump. During the interview, Helen shared her and Corey's sweet love story revealing that they've been together ever since they were kids and were about to celebrate their 29th wedding anniversary together. As Trump supporters themselves, the long-time couple took a family trip to the Pennsylvania rally to hear his message ahead of the upcoming election. Helen explained: \"Me and the kids were all there as a family. He was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\" She went on to add: \"It was a bad day. He was a very loving husband. He was a simple man but he put his wife and kids first all the time. I did nothing here. I didn't lift a finger. He did everything.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. During the rally, 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the crowd murdering Corey and injuring two others. After Corey was struck by one of the bullets, a doctor in the crowd rushed to perform CPR on him in an attempt to save his life. Speaking on the harrowing moment as he spoke a blood-soaked shirt, doctor Jake Rosen explained: \"I heard the shots. I thought it was firecrackers to begin with. Somebody over there was screaming, 'he's been shot, he's been shot.' So, I made my way over. I said I'm an emergency department physician. Let me help you,\" and added: \"There's lots of blood and he had brain matter.\" After the horrific tragedy, Helen has been overwhelmed by the love and support she's received in memory of her husband. Since their loss, Corey's family has stated a GoFundMe in his honor that has already raised a whopping $990,000. Speaking on the nation's generosity, Helen said: \"The donations that are coming in across the community and across the country, it's more than I can even imagine. It's more than I can fathom, but he deserves it all. He deserves everything.\"","summary":"Volunteer firefighter and father-of-two Corey Comperatore, aged 50, was killed after getting caught in the crossfire of an assassination attempt on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/widow-husband-shot-killed-trump-33251963","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33251962.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_trump-victim-main.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:27:29","author":"Abigail O'Leary,Abigail-Oleary,Caroline Gaspich","authors":["Abigail O'Leary","Abigail-Oleary","Caroline Gaspich"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":251842688,"title":"Daniel Craig debuts new ‘fashion’ look as James Bond star features in Loewe campaign","text":"The West Australian Perth Now Click to open navigation ‌‌ News Chevron Down Icon Breaking News Western Australia National World Technology Opinion Weather Sport Chevron Down Icon AFL Cricket Soccer Basketball Tennis NRL Rugby Motor Racing MMA Golf Netball Cycling Entertainment Chevron Down Icon Confidential Movies Best Short Film Television Music Reviews Books Competitions Business Chevron Down Icon Breaking News Economy Markets Property Commercial Property Workplace Matters Lifestyle Chevron Down Icon Food Personal Finance Health Parenting Fashion Travel Home & Garden Relationships Stars Real Estate HUH?

Will it sway these Wisconsin voters?","text":"MILWAUKEE -- As the Republican National Convention kicked off Monday, thousands of outsiders descended on downtown Milwaukee for a week of intense politicking that will culminate in Donald Trump accepting the party's nomination for president. A few miles away, in a diner tucked away off Wisconsin Veterans Memorial Highway, ABC News asked local voters what they thought of the GOP gathering that's captured the attention of not only their home state but of the nation. The four Wisconsinites at Miss Katie's Diner, a local staple whose past clientele included Trump, Bill Clinton and Michelle Obama, disagreed on politics but largely saw eye-to-eye on the event being a boon for their home state -- one that's seen as critical in the 2024 election. \"I think we're going to get some nice national recognition, finally,\" said Gary Berns, a Democrat. \"I think it's a good thing. I don't care who the convention is as long as they come spend their money, it's fine for the city.\" Charlene Abughrin, a Republican voter, agreed: \"I absolutely think it's a good thing for the city and it shows the support of the Republican Party as well, that they actually wanted to have it here in Milwaukee.\" Julie Buckholt, a Democrat, also said the recognition and boost to the local economy were pluses but she had concerns about possible protests. \"The only thing is, I fear for, you know, the protesting and the crime that could come with that,\" Buckholt said. \"That's kind of what I fear for. But bringing recognition to this city, I think that's a good thing.\" Valori Schmidt, a Republican, agreed and told about hearing Newt Gingrich speak at the convention early Monday and about the Republican Party stars she wanted to see. \"Of course, I'm very much looking forward to hearing the, former president, Donald Trump,\" Schmidt said. \"I'm looking forward to hearing Nikki Haley, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Ben Carson.\" \"I want to listen to what everybody says,\" she said. \"And, again, where I am most assured of what I think to be truth, I listen to people and I just, I love hearing what they have to say.\" But will having a big national party convention in their Midwestern city change the way they and other residents vote? Abughrin said she believes it will. \"Historically, in the Black community, we often feel that we are looked over by the Republican Party and so them bringing it here, and those businesses owners getting to utilize the services and just being a part of something, would definitely have an impact on the vote,\" she said. But the others said they were firmly set on who they plan to vote for in November, and believed most other people were, too. \"For me, not at all,\" Berns said. \"It's great for the city, I hope, you know, great for the whole thing for the businesses downtown. But it's not going to sway me any better.\" \"I would say no, but as I indicated earlier, I listen to what people say,\" said Schmidt. \"And certainly if there was something that really caused me to have a red flag, then I would ask about it. I would check it out. But I feel that prior to the convention that I have checked out the issues, that I have gone to try to find out the truth.\" \"I think that people have basically made their decision at this point as to whether or not they're going to vote for President Biden or Donald Trump,\" said Buckholt. \"And so I don't think that the RNC is going to sway them.\"","summary":"Four Wisconsin residents sat down with ABC News as the Republican National Convention kicked off Monday about the impact it will have on their state and on voters.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/good-thing-wisconsin-voters-weigh-rnc-held-home/story?id=111966352","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3a116224-2c80-49cb-a847-4d3d2cded38a/rnc-1-ap-gmh-240712_1720797576486_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:26:07","author":"Alexandra Hutzler","authors":["Alexandra Hutzler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":251842630,"title":"The Trump Shooting Screwed News Networks’ RNC Coverage Plans","text":"Being a journalist at the Republican National Convention just days after an assassination attempt on Donald Trump is “like drinking out of a firehouse every day,” Geoff Bennett said of the chaos of newsgathering at a truly unprecedented time. Bennett and Amna Nawaz are co-anchors of PBS News Hour. They and their team had just arrived in Milwaukee, where the RNC is taking place, when the news broke on Saturday of a shooting while Trump was speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania. “Not exactly the way we thought we’d be kicking off coverage at the RNC,” Nawaz told journalists at the Television Critics Association conference. Like every news network, carefully laid coverage plans were scrapped and angles were redrafted following the weekend’s breaking news. “We’re not afraid to change plans,” Nawaz said. “There were plans for taped pieces, for example, coming into the RNC about the kinds of narratives and stories we could be telling on the sidelines. Those plans were all in place. Those plans went out the window when the assassination attempt on former president Trump.” The biggest shift she said is, obviously, the kinds of questions that will be asked of RNC attendees: “So one of the questions is how does this assassination attempt change the approach of this convention? The former president had said that he wanted to focus on unity. Well, what does that look like this week and beyond? That, of course, will be the real test.” Bennett gave an overview of the extensive safety precautions and security that is in place in Milwaukee. He tried to go for a walk beyond what he called “the hardened security perimeter” surrounding the convention center and his hotel, but was unable to reach the edges of the fortified area. “I remember in a previous professional life, the first time I had private security covering a presidential rally—this is, of course, for President Trump—and that was a fairly heady experience,” he said. “I will tell you presently, right now at the RNC, I feel safe.” A growing concern both among audiences and in newsrooms is how to, as a matter of journalism, broadcast and give space to speeches, particularly from Trump, that peddle falsehoods, lies, and made up facts. Should networks fact-check these speeches in real time? And, if so, how would they go about doing that? Nawaz pointed to PBS News Hour’s recent partnership with Politifact. “We as journalists always do the best that we can in the moment, particularly in live events which are the most challenging to fact-check in real-time,” she said. “What we did recently, not just with the presidential debate, what we'll be doing with future simulcasts of those debates and also as part of our coverage is continuously point people towards the real-time fact checking of the team over at Politifact as well.” The network will, however, air all the speeches live, without interruption for fact-checking on air, in real time. “We will be covering the speeches here as they unfold in the same way we'll be covering the speeches at the DNC as they unfold, without having to interrupt every few minutes to do any potential real-time fact-checking,” Nawaz said. “I think we owe our audience the ability to just watch the speeches as they unfold, to take in the information, to seek out additional facts as they're able to and then embed it in all our reporting.”","summary":"ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty ImagesBeing a journalist at the Republican National Convention just days after an assassination attempt on Donald Trump is “like drinking out of a firehouse every day,” Geoff Bennett said of the chaos of newsgathering at a truly unprecedented time.\n\nBennett and Amna Nawaz are co-anchors of PBS News Hour.

The bureau has not disclosed how it broke into the phone — or what has been found on it — but the speed with which it did so is significant, and security experts say it points to the increased efficacy of phone-hacking tools. In a call with reporters on Sunday, the bureau said field agents in Pennsylvania had tried and failed to break into Thomas Matthew Crooks’ phone. The device was then sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. \"“Almost every police department in the nation has a device called the Cellebrite”\" Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that law enforcement agencies have several tools at their disposal to extract data from phones. “Almost every police department in the nation has a device called the Cellebrite, which is a device built for extracting data from phones, and it also has some capability to unlock phones,” Quintin said. Cellebrite, which is based in Israel, is one of several companies that provides mobile device extraction tools (MDTFs) to law enforcement. Third-party MDTFs vary in efficacy and cost, and the likely FBI has its own in-house tools as well. Last year, TechCrunch reported that Cellebrite asked users to keep use of its technology “hush hush.” “It seems reasonable to me that the field office there [in Pennsylvania] wouldn’t have some of the more advanced techniques for breaking into modern phones that they have at Quantico,” Quintin told The Verge hours before the FBI announced it had successfully gained access to Crooks’ phone. “I have little doubt that Quantico will be able to break into this phone, whether that’s in-house or whether that’s through using outside help — like from Cellebrite, for example. A 2020 investigation by the Washington, DC-based nonprofit organization Upturn found that more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia had access to MDTFs. GrayKey — among the most expensive and advanced of these tools — costs between $15,000 and $30,000, according to Upturn’s report. Grayshift, the company behind GrayKey, announced in March that its Magnet GrayKey device has “full support” for Apple iOS 17, Samsung Galaxy S24 Devices, and Pixel 6 and 7 devices.” For law enforcement, third-party MDTFs are an effective way to get around tech companies’ hesitance to help break into customers’ phones. In previous instances of mass shootings or domestic terrorism, the FBI has spent weeks or months trying to break into suspects’ phones. The bureau famously butted heads with Apple in late 2015 after the company refused to help law enforcement get around the encryption on the San Bernardino, California shooter’s iPhone. Early in the following year, Apple refused a federal court order to help the FBI access the shooter’s phone, which the company said would effectively require it to build a backdoor for the iPhone’s encryption software. “The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a February 2016 open letter. The FBI did have access to the a backup of the shooter’s phone that had been uploaded to his iCloud account — but the last backup appeared to have occurred six weeks before the shooting, hence the FBI’s desire to unlock the phone. In his letter, Cook claimed that the FBI had asked Apple to modify its iOS so passcodes could be input electronically in what he called a “brute force” attack. “The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor,” Cook wrote. “While we believe the FBI’s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.” \"Trump — at the time one of several candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination — was among those who demanded that Apple cave to the FBI\" Trump — at the time one of several candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination — was among those who demanded that Apple cave to the FBI. “First of all, Apple ought to give the security for that phone,” he told the crowd during one of his rallies. “What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number.” The FBI dropped its case against Apple in March 2016, three months after the shooting — not because Apple decided to comply with the FBI’s request, but because the bureau had obtained a break-in method from an “outside source” and no longer needed Apple’s assistance. Reuters initially reported that the Cellebrite had helped the FBI break into the device, which the bureau never confirmed, though then-director James Comey and Senator Dianne Feinstein did disclose that the FBI spent around $1 million to unlock the phone. In 2021, the Washington Post reported that the Australian security firm Azimuth Security unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s phone. The San Bernardino shooting was not the only instance in which the FBI tried to compel Apple to break into an iPhone on its behalf. After a shooter opened fire at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida on December 2019, the FBI asked Apple to unlock two iPhones linked to the shooter. After Apple refused, Attorney General William Barr said the company had failed to provide “substantive assistance” in the case. Apple, for its part, maintained that it “produced a wide variety of information associated with the investigation,” and turned over “gigabytes of information” to the FBI, including “iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts” related to the shooter. But Apple once again refused to unlock the shooter’s phones. The FBI said it was able to break into the shooter’s phones in March 2020, after several months of trying — and the bureau lambasted Apple in its announcement. “Thanks to the great work of the FBI — and no thanks to Apple — we were able to unlock Alshamrani’s phones,” Barr said at the time. FBI director Christopher Wray said this was done with “effectively no help from Apple.” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the Pensacola shooting was one of the last times federal law enforcement agencies loudly denounced encryption. \"“There are serious human rights risks when technology for breaking into people’s phones gets leveraged by undemocratic governments”\" “That was over four years ago, and the technology on both sides of the equation has only evolved since then,” Pfefferkorn said in an email to The Verge. Pfefferkorn said vendors and law enforcement agencies often gain access to phones by exploiting “a vulnerability in the software that’s running on the phone” or by guessing the password through brute force. “It takes a matter of minutes to brute-force a 4-digit passcode and a matter of hours for a 6-digit one,” Pfefferkorn said. “In addition to the FBI’s own in-house tools, there are tools available from third-party vendors (as with the San Bernardino shooter’s phone), some of which are more scrupulous than others about who their customers are. There are serious human rights risks when technology for breaking into people’s phones gets leveraged by undemocratic governments, yet those tools are widely available for the right price.”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24199357/fbi-trump-rally-shooter-phone-thomas-matthew-crooks-quantico-mdtf","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cah7nVuvNvHTlhBb6RJQP_mphlA=/0x0:2500x1667/1200x628/filters:focal(1250x834:1251x835)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25532320/Phone_Cracking_FBI_2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-15 23:25:00","author":"Gaby Del Valle","authors":["Gaby Del Valle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.613},{"id":251842628,"title":"History doesn’t happen like it used to. The attempt on Trump’s life proves it","text":"Donald Trump was winning the election before 20-year-old Thomas Crooks took his shot at that most American of habits — an assassination attempt — and missed. That event, a “historic moment” for 24 hours, has now been moved on by the selection of JD Vance as Trump’s vice-presidential candidate. Now Trump’s campaign is surely strengthened substantially, most particularly by his quick thinking in making a show of physical defiance when he realised he wasn’t badly hurt. One of the defining images of the 2016 campaign was Hillary, collapsed from pneumonia, being bundled into the back of a limo, all very Hunger Games/ruled by space lizards vibe. It could have been made into a testament to her commitment. Instead, it helped to sink her. How much Trump will be helped by this event remains to be seen. Obviously I’m not saying he’ll be harmed by it. But the assumption that this is a defining moment in the campaign is part of a different agenda. Trump’s core supporters will be doubly enthused, will revel in notions of conspiracy and the deep state, but they were always on side. Trump’s wider support, the margins of 3-5% he is consistently winning in the rust-belt states, seem to me to be the same people he got in 2016, but all the more so. These voters have no love for Trump, and don’t particularly respond to the heroic narratives around him. Some voted for him twice and will do so a third time. Those who went from Trump to Biden, and are now thinking of trying Trump again — or didn’t vote previously — are doing it for three reasons. First they feel the Democrats lied to them about illegal immigration, saying they would control it, and then letting it expand to unheard-of levels. Second, they want system interruption to respond to the relentless rise in the cost of living, and against the blithe repetitions by the Democrats that things are getting better. Those two factors were both in place before Biden’s infirmity from age made itself known in the presidential debate, and that adds a percentage point or two. But the repudiation of the Democrats comes from a sense among sections of the electorate that the Democrats repudiated them, as soon as they got into power. Biden’s most obvious recourse would have been to do what Woodrow Wilson did in 1912: steal the other side’s populist policies and reorganise the party around them. Thus, leaving aside things he should do but never would — like pull back the US empire, and devalue the dollar to reduce debt — Biden should have shamelessly taken Trump’s tariffs, his border policies, made them his own in a modified form, strengthened union power, and glued all this to a new industrial reinvestment program, getting the working- and middle-classes on side with green tech. This would have left the Republicans as a squabbling outfit of free marketeers and goldbugs, without a program. It would have driven the cultural progressive left of the party wild, which would have allowed Biden to de facto run against them. There would have been no split, no third party, if the Democratic program was sufficiently economically left. Biden would have sailed home, until his debilitation became obvious, at which point someone else could have taken up the program. In that case, Trump might never have jumped in. That’s how things have been for a while, and with a sense of grinding invariance, which is why there’s a curious lack of intensity to this assassination attempt. Can you feel it slipping away into the background? Weird isn’t it? It’s got all the elements of a great assassination, it’s a lot like the JFK shooting, and yet it feels like it has little real impact. Everyone’s talking about the Evan Vucci photo as one of the great photos of the century blah blah. Does it feel that way? Not at all. It has about the same impact as any one of a half a dozen shots on your phone. But the media and political establishment desperately want it to be a moment, an event. They want Trump either to be vengeful, or to come to the centre and bring everyone together, for something to happen. But things don’t happen like that anymore. The relationship between politics, media and events is moving beneath the surface. Hence the grasping at that image, as if it was a Life magazine classic — because there is a desire for the historical moment such as existed back in the day, when one magazine carried the world to us in photos. There is a powerful nostalgia at work — especially among an increasingly irrelevant media — for the time when events would happen in a way predictable within the media-life nexus. The current disconnection is not merely a matter of structures; it is the breach between a mass no longer connected to the elite — a mass from which the shooter himself came — and unwilling to be guided by the elite’s political imperatives. Thomas Crooks sought to make history erupt again. We don’t know the fullness of his motives yet. They are already being psychologised because he was scruffy, and a bit of a loner. There is surely something paradoxical about sending a relentless volley of warnings about what a unique danger that Donald Trump is, and then treating someone who came to the same conclusion — and acted on it — as crazy. He must have known that his death would soon follow his act. Assassination is wrong, morally, politically and legally, but it’s also strange to damn as uncourageous someone many may, in years to come, whether they would admit it or not, wish had succeeded. That doesn’t mean that nothing “happeny” will happen in the coming months. But it does mean that whatever could throw this contest in another direction is not of an older order of events, such as is making this bloody and lethal incident seem like a TikTok version of past crises. In 2016, Trump himself was the irruption of the new into the real, the man who could survive the Access Hollywood scandal and become president of the United States without a program or an incoming administration to speak of, the first gonzo presidency. Quite possibly there is nothing that will get in the way of his return. The dismissal of the classified documents case by a Trump-appointed judge is yet another boost. But whatever might change the race, none of us outside of the deep heartland have any way of knowing what it will be. But in the US, in 2024? It’s gotta be more than, of all things, an assassination attempt. Is a second Trump presidency inevitable? Let us know your thoughts by writing to letters@crikey.com.au.

Hours later, special counsel Jack Smith’s office said it would appeal the order, which could result in it eventually being overturned by a higher court. But for now at least, the dismissal by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon brings a stunning and abrupt halt to a criminal case that at the time it was filed was widely regarded as the most perilous of all the legal threats the Republican former president confronted. Though the case had long been stalled, and the prospect of a trial before the November election already nonexistent, the judge’s order is a significant legal and political victory for Trump as he recovers from a weekend assassination attempt and prepares to accept the Republican nomination in Milwaukee this week. It’s the latest stroke of good fortune in the four criminal cases Trump has faced. He was convicted in May in his New York hush money trial, but the sentencing has been postponed after a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents. That opinion will cause major delays in a separate case charging Trump with plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Another election subversion case filed in Atlanta has been delayed by revelations of a romantic relationship between the district attorney and a special prosecutor she hired for the case. In a statement on his social media platform, Trump said the dismissal “should be just the first step” and the three other cases, which he called “Witch Hunts,” should also be thrown out. The classified documents case had been seen as the most legally clear-cut of the four given the breadth of evidence that prosecutors say they had accumulated, including the testimony of close aides and former lawyers, and because the conduct at issue occurred after Trump left the White House in 2021 and lost the powers of the presidency. The indictment included dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified records from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back. He had pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Defense lawyers filed multiple challenges to the case, including legally technical ones that asserted that special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment by Attorney General Merrick Garland violated the Constitution’s Appointments Clause because it did not go through Congress and that Smith’s office was improperly funded by the Justice Department. She said Garland had exceeded his bounds by appointing a prosecutor without Senate approval and confirmation and had undermined the authority of Congress. “The Special Counsel’s position effectively usurps that important legislative authority, transferring it to a Head of Department, and in the process threatening the structural liberty inherent in the separation of powers,” Cannon wrote in a 93-page order that granted the defense team’s request to dismiss the case but did not dissect the substance of the allegations against Trump. “If the political branches wish to grant the Attorney General power to appoint Special Counsel Smith to investigate and prosecute this action with the full powers of a United States Attorney, there is a valid means by which to do so,” she added. That mechanism is through congressional approval, she said. A spokesman for Smith, Peter Carr, said the Justice Department had authorized an appeal. “The dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the Attorney General is statutorily authorized to appoint a special counsel,” Carr said in a statement. The order is the latest example of the Trump-appointed judge handling the case in ways that have benefited the ex-president. She generated intense scrutiny during the FBI’s investigation when she appointed an independent arbiter to inspect the classified documents recovered during the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, a decision that was overturned months later by a unanimous federal appeals panel. Since the charges were filed, she has been slow to issue rulings — favoring Trump’s strategy of securing delays in all his criminal cases — and has entertained defense motions and arguments that experts said other judges would have dispensed with without hearings. In May, she indefinitely canceled the trial date amid a series of unresolved legal issues.","summary":"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Florida dismissed the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump on Monday, siding with defense lawyers who said the special counsel who filed the charges was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.

Vance as running mate is a 'good thing' for Canada","text":"Canada's ambassador to the United States says \"we're very happy\" that Ohio Senator J.D. Vance is Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate because of the senator's connections to Canada. In an interview with CBC's Power & Politics on Monday, Kirsten Hillman said Vance is \"someone we know well at the embassy\" who has been seen at \"many events supporting the Canada-U.S. relationship.\" \"That's a good thing for us, that he has this high level of knowledge,\" Hillman added. Vance, a staunch conservative and author of the bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, was praised by Trump for his military service and for graduating from Yale Law School. \"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Ohio's economy is deeply intertwined with that of Canada. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, in 2023 the state exported $21.4 billion in goods to Canada, representing 38 per cent of Ohio's total goods exports. But Vance is linking himself to Trump, who has promised a worldwide tariff on imports if he wins — a measure which would be stricter than any trade policy during his first term. Trump has offered few details about his trade policy in his campaign literature and in media interviews. He has said he envisions a 10 per cent global tax. It's not clear if that policy would apply to Canada — but officials here are taking precautions. The federal government staged a large-scale diplomatic deployment in March when it sent more than dozen diplomats in various U.S. cities to meet American lawmakers on Capitol Hill. On Monday, Hillman said that when talking to Democrats and Republicans, what works well for Canada is to not \"question their motive of wanting to bring back jobs to America…. but to point out to them that those jobs depend on having good customers.\" \"If you really want to secure a safe, prosperous, resilient United States, then free trade with Canada is essential,\" she added. \"I'm quite sure that someone from the state of Ohio doesn't want to see a tariff war with its biggest customer.\" Hillman said in May that Ottawa isn't worried about the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House. \"But what matters here is that we are ready and prepared and able, as we've demonstrated, to work with both of the candidates that are up for election in the fall,\" Hillman said at the time. Assassination attempt looms large Trump's announcement of Vance as his running mate came just days after the former president survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally. The gunman's motives remain unknown. Since then, Canadian and American leaders have urged voters to tone down their rhetoric about their political opponents and look toward national unity. In the wake of the assassination attempt on Saturday, Trump said he would be revising his acceptance speech to emphasize national unity, rather than highlight his differences with Biden. Hillman said the attempted assassination was a \"horrific event\" that put the United States in \"a bit of shock.\" \"I think the vast majority of Americans, if not almost all Americans, abhor this kind of violence,\" she said. When asked whether she thinks Americans are listening to the calls to calm down extreme rhetoric, Hillman said she hopes the message is resonating. \"It's definitely a complicated moment with a lot of turmoil, but it's not the first time,\" she said. \"I think that we're going to have to see how these next months develop.\"","summary":"Canada’s ambassador to the United States says “we’re very happy” that Ohio Senator J.D.

Here’s a look at the facts. ___ Online posts falsely claim sharpshooter was told not to fire on suspect in Trump shooting CLAIM: A law enforcement sniper assigned to Trump’s rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, says the head of the Secret Service ordered him not to shoot the suspect accused of attempting to assassinate Trump. THE FACTS: No such order was made. Snipers killed the suspected shooter moments after he opened fire on the former president, bloodying Trump’s ear, killing one rally attendee and injuring two. The Secret Service and the Butler Police Department say they have no agents, officers or employees with the name of the person claiming to be the sharpshooter. Following Saturday’s attempt on Trump’s life, a poster on the online message board 4chan wrote that they were a sniper assigned to the rally, and that they can be seen in a photo of two law enforcement officers on the roof at the rally. “My name is Jonathan Willis,” the poster wrote. “I came here to inform the public that I had the assassin in my sights for at least 3 minutes, but the head of the secret service refused to give the order to take out the perp. 100% the top brass prevented me from killing the assassin before he took the shots at president Trump,” the post claimed. But there is no agent or officer by the name of Jonathan Willis working for the Secret Service or the Butler police, and no internet records of such an officer could be located. A spokesman for the Secret Service said snipers are trained and instructed to act whenever they see a threat, and do not await instructions before taking a shot to neutralize a suspect. He said he couldn’t discuss the specifics of agency communication or the details of the ongoing investigation, but said the post was false. Witnesses at the rally alerted law enforcement to the suspect, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, after they saw him perched atop a nearby roof. A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, officials have said. Crooks, a nursing-home employee from suburban Pittsburgh, fired multiple shots at Trump with an AR-style rifle. A spectator was killed and two others were critically injured. Authorities said the shooting was an attempted assassination, but haven’t yet determined what motivated Crooks to try to kill Trump, the AP has reported. ___ Posts misrepresent photo to claim Trump was shot in the chest and saved by a bulletproof vest CLAIM: A photo shows a bullet hole in Trump’s suit jacket, proving that he was shot in the chest during the attempted assassination. THE FACTS: The photo actually shows a fold in the suit jacket of a Secret Service agent protecting Trump. Another Associated Press image taken moments before clearly shows there is no hole in Trump’s jacket. What appears to be a hole can be seen diminishing as the agent moves in video of the shooting’s aftermath. Social media users are sharing the photo from the assassination attempt to claim that the former president was shot in the chest. Some posts suggest he survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest. In the image, what seems to be a small hole appears inches below Trump’s right underarm. Many posts use a zoomed-in version of the photo that has a circle around the supposed hole to emphasize the hard-to-notice detail. “#Trump was also shot in the chest,” reads one X post. “The bulletproof vest saved him #We support Trump. Another X post similarly reads, “It appears that Trump was shot in the chest, as the bullet seem to have pierced his suit; he was wearing a bulletproof vest.” But the apparent hole is actually a fold in the sleeve of the Secret Service agent’s jacket, not the aftermath of a bullet. The photo taken by an AP photographer shows the agent bending over as she protects Trump, her jacket appearing slightly darker than the former president’s. The fold can be seen by following the edge of the agent’s jacket from her neck to just below her left shoulder. Moreover, another AP image taken moments before the one with the supposed hole clearly shows the right side of Trump’s jacket as he raises his fist. No hole can be seen in the jacket. Trump wrote on his social media platform that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” Photos and video from the rally show blood on his right ear and on the right side of his face. The Secret Service declined to comment on details of the shooting, including where the bullets hit, and did not respond to a follow-up inquiry about whether Trump was wearing a bulletproof vest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. ___ Photo edited to make it appear Secret Service agents were smiling after attempt on Trump’s life CLAIM: A photo from the attempted assassination of Trump shows Secret Service agents smiling as they surround him after the shooting. THE FACTS: The photo was edited to make it appear the agents were smiling. In the original, taken by an Associated Press photographer, the same agents can be seen with neutral expressions. After the shooting, social media users shared the altered image, with some suggesting it was evidence that the assassination attempt had been staged. The photo shows Trump with blood on his face and ear, pumping his fist in front of an American flag while Secret Service agents surround him. Three agents whose faces are visible seem to be grinning as they protect the former president. “Why are all 3 Secret Service agents smiling, at least that is how it appears to me,” reads one post on X. “Do to the seriousness of the situation, I would think their expressions would be grim + determined. Now, if it was a staged event, these expressions would make more sense.” But the agents were not smiling at that moment. The photo was edited to make it appear otherwise. The original image shows the same three agents with neutral expressions. One man is positioned behind Trump, a second man stands by his left shoulder and a woman is bent over on his right side, beneath his raised arm. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.

Here’s a look at the facts. ___ Online posts falsely claim sharpshooter was told not to fire on suspect in Trump shooting CLAIM: A law enforcement sniper assigned to Trump’s rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, says the head of the Secret Service ordered him not to shoot the suspect accused of attempting to assassinate Trump. THE FACTS: No such order was made. Snipers killed the suspected shooter moments after he opened fire on the former president, bloodying Trump’s ear, killing one rally attendee and injuring two. The Secret Service and the Butler Police Department say they have no agents, officers or employees with the name of the person claiming to be the sharpshooter. Following Saturday’s attempt on Trump’s life, a poster on the online message board 4chan wrote that they were a sniper assigned to the rally, and that they can be seen in a photo of two law enforcement officers on the roof at the rally. “My name is Jonathan Willis,” the poster wrote. “I came here to inform the public that I had the assassin in my sights for at least 3 minutes, but the head of the secret service refused to give the order to take out the perp. 100% the top brass prevented me from killing the assassin before he took the shots at president Trump,” the post claimed. But there is no agent or officer by the name of Jonathan Willis working for the Secret Service or the Butler police, and no internet records of such an officer could be located. A spokesman for the Secret Service said snipers are trained and instructed to act whenever they see a threat, and do not await instructions before taking a shot to neutralize a suspect. He said he couldn’t discuss the specifics of agency communication or the details of the ongoing investigation, but said the post was false. Witnesses at the rally alerted law enforcement to the suspect, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, after they saw him perched atop a nearby roof. A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, officials have said. Crooks, a nursing-home employee from suburban Pittsburgh, fired multiple shots at Trump with an AR-style rifle. A spectator was killed and two others were critically injured. Authorities said the shooting was an attempted assassination, but haven’t yet determined what motivated Crooks to try to kill Trump, the AP has reported. ___ Posts misrepresent photo to claim Trump was shot in the chest and saved by a bulletproof vest CLAIM: A photo shows a bullet hole in Trump’s suit jacket, proving that he was shot in the chest during the attempted assassination. THE FACTS: The photo actually shows a fold in the suit jacket of a Secret Service agent protecting Trump. Another Associated Press image taken moments before clearly shows there is no hole in Trump’s jacket. What appears to be a hole can be seen diminishing as the agent moves in video of the shooting’s aftermath. Social media users are sharing the photo from the assassination attempt to claim that the former president was shot in the chest. Some posts suggest he survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest. In the image, what seems to be a small hole appears inches below Trump’s right underarm. Many posts use a zoomed-in version of the photo that has a circle around the supposed hole to emphasize the hard-to-notice detail. “#Trump was also shot in the chest,” reads one X post. “The bulletproof vest saved him #We support Trump. Another X post similarly reads, “It appears that Trump was shot in the chest, as the bullet seem to have pierced his suit; he was wearing a bulletproof vest.” But the apparent hole is actually a fold in the sleeve of the Secret Service agent’s jacket, not the aftermath of a bullet. The photo taken by an AP photographer shows the agent bending over as she protects Trump, her jacket appearing slightly darker than the former president’s. The fold can be seen by following the edge of the agent’s jacket from her neck to just below her left shoulder. Moreover, another AP image taken moments before the one with the supposed hole clearly shows the right side of Trump’s jacket as he raises his fist. No hole can be seen in the jacket. Trump wrote on his social media platform that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” Photos and video from the rally show blood on his right ear and on the right side of his face. The Secret Service declined to comment on details of the shooting, including where the bullets hit, and did not respond to a follow-up inquiry about whether Trump was wearing a bulletproof vest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. ___ Photo edited to make it appear Secret Service agents were smiling after attempt on Trump’s life CLAIM: A photo from the attempted assassination of Trump shows Secret Service agents smiling as they surround him after the shooting. THE FACTS: The photo was edited to make it appear the agents were smiling. In the original, taken by an Associated Press photographer, the same agents can be seen with neutral expressions. After the shooting, social media users shared the altered image, with some suggesting it was evidence that the assassination attempt had been staged. The photo shows Trump with blood on his face and ear, pumping his fist in front of an American flag while Secret Service agents surround him.
