Paddy the Baddy.\n\n'We started with Paddy. I'm still with Paddy. Paddy the Baddy, that's why we're here tonight.'\n\nPortnoy sat in close vicinity to President Trump, who he has largely supported since the election but also took aim at this week over the ongoing tariff chaos wreaking havoc on the stock markets. \n\nPortnoy has been vocal about his financial hits due to the stock market dips brought about by Trump's controversial tariffs, and this week even revealed he'd consider ditching Trump for the Democrats if America's economy doesn't show major improvements soon.\n\nDave Portnoy sat cageside with Barstool Sports colleague Robbie Fox in Miami on Saturday\n\nStill in Paddy's corner 🫡 @PaddyTheBaddy | @StoolPresidente | #UFC314 pic.twitter.com/7gtTwoNvyF\n— UFC (@ufc) April 13, 2025\n\nHe admitted last week that he 'didn't understand' them, but was down a staggering $7million as a result. On Monday morning, Portnoy revealed he'd actually lost close to $20m.\n\nHe went on to say that he lost 20 percent of his net worth and slammed Trump for going golfing last weekend in Florida while the country's economy was in turmoil.\n\nAsked if he'd be willing to abandon Trump and the GOP, Portnoy responded: 'Yeah, absolutely. \n\n'I was never some crazy MAGA guy. It's uncomfortable anytime the stock market is like this and you're invested in it, it's certainly uncomfortable. But I stand with it.\n\n'You know, he ran on tariffs. He said he was a tariff fan. And I don't pretend to be an economist. I don't think I realized that we'd have this market crash. I don't think most people did.'\n\nPortnoy continued: 'I think he believes in what he's doing and trying to basically strong-arm China and get better deals for the US. I'm willing to still give him time.\n\nDonald Trump speaks to reporters on board Air Force One en route to Miami for UFC 314\n\n'I think the big date is the midterms, which is a long time out. But I do think that in this country, the number one issue, no matter what is going on, is the economy. And if the stock market doesn't show some signs of rebound or rebounding by then, I think people will speak with their vote.'\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the pair will meet at Kaseya Center on Saturday night, but it is the first time they have been in the same room since the tariff war began.\n\nTrump brought Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Elon Musk, Kash Patel, Tulsi Gabbard and granddaughter Kai Trump with him, among others.\n\nIt is the first time the president has been in attendance at a UFC event since last November, when he took his place at Madison Square Garden for UFC 309. \n\nUFC Fighting\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDave Portnoy hugs Donald Trump at UFC 314... days after slamming president over ongoing tariff chaos\n\nAdd comment","summary":"In a video posted by the UFC's official channels, Portnoy showed off a 'Paddy the Baddy' t-shirt, and when asked who he was there to support, he said: 'Alright, UFC, we're here in Miami.

SIGN UP for The Daily OutKick. New Look, Same Attitude. The Commander in Chief is not a stranger to the UFC event and usually gets a massive reception from the crowd. UFC 314 marked the first event that Trump has attended since being sworn in for his second term. He was asked before arriving in Miami who he thought would come out of the night the big winner. \"You have a lot of good fights,\" Trump said. \"Who's going to win? Dana White. Dana White is going to win.\" I mean, he's probably right about that one. After hopping on Air Force One for a quick flight to Miami, Trump entered the arena a little after 10 pm ET accompanied by UFC boss Dana White and was also joined by DOGE policy advisor Elon Musk, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and FBI Director Kash Patel. Upon arriving at the arena, Trump was greeted with a massive ovation. Back in November, he attended UFC 309, which was held in New York City at Madison Square Garden, a little over a week after the 2024 presidential election. That time, he was flanked by Kennedy (who famously indulged on some McD's afterward) and Musk as well. The event is being headlined by a bout between Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes for the currently vacant UFC Featherweight Championship, and is the fourth time that UFC has held an event in Miami, with the last time being just last year for UFC 298. The night is also slated to include a co-main event featuring Michael Chandler and Paddy Pimblett.","summary":"President Donald Trump made an appearance at UFC 314 in Miami.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/president-donald-trump-attends-ufc-314-miami","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2209365375.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 02:13:46","author":null},{"id":310564520,"title":"Morning Digest: Three killed in Bengal clashes over Waqf, CAPF deployed; Russian missile strikes warehouse of Indian pharma firm in Ukraine, and more","text":"MHA likely to file review petition against SC verdict on Governor, President role in assenting to State laws \n\nThe Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is likely to file a review petition against the Supreme Court’s April 8 judgement allowing judicial intervention if Governors withhold assent to legislative Bills for too long.

A message posted late Friday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection included a long list of products that would not face the reciprocal tariffs President Donald Trump imposed in recent days on Chinese goods as part of a worsening trade war. The exclusions would also apply to modems, routers, flash drives and other technology goods, which are largely not made in the United States. The exemptions are not a full reprieve. Other tariffs will still apply to electronics and smartphones. The Trump administration had applied a tariff of 20% on Chinese goods earlier this year for what the administration said was the country's role in the fentanyl trade. And the administration could still end up increasing tariffs for semiconductors, a vital component of smartphones and other electronics. The moves were the first major exemptions for Chinese goods, which would have wide-ranging implications for the U.S. economy if they persist. Tech giants such as Apple and Nvidia would largely sidestep punitive taxes that could slash their profits. Consumers -- some of whom rushed to buy iPhones this past week -- would avoid major potential price increases on smartphones, computers and other gadgets. And the exemptions could dampen additional inflation and calm the turmoil that many economists feared might lead to a recession. The tariff relief was also the latest flip-flop in Trump's effort to rewrite global trade in a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing. The factories that churn out iPhones, laptops and other electronics are deeply entrenched in Asia -- especially in China -- and are unlikely to move without a galvanizing force such as the steep taxes that the Trump administration had proposed. It's difficult to know if there's a realization within the administration that reworking the American economy is a gargantuan effort, said Matthew Slaughter, the dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. The electronics exemptions apply to all countries, not just China. Still, any relief for the electronics industry may be short-lived, since the Trump administration is preparing another national security-related trade investigation into semiconductors. That will also apply to some downstream products including electronics, since many semiconductors come into the United States inside other devices, a person familiar with the matter said. These investigations have previously resulted in additional tariffs. Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, said in a statement Saturday that Trump was still committed to seeing more of these products and components made domestically. President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies and that at his direction, tech companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible, she said. A senior administration official, speaking on background because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that Friday's exemptions were aimed at maintaining the U.S. supply of semiconductors, a foundational technology used in smartphones, cars, toasters and dozens of other products. Many cutting-edge semiconductors are manufactured overseas, such as in Taiwan. Paul Ashworth, the chief North America economist for Capital Economics, said the move represents a partial de-escalation of President Trump's trade war with China. He said the 20 product types that were exempted on Friday account for nearly a quarter of U.S. imports from China. Other countries in Asia would be even bigger winners, he said. Should the tariffs on those countries kick in again, the exemption would cover 64% of U.S. imports from Taiwan, 44% of imports from Malaysia and nearly a third of imports from both Vietnam and Thailand, he said. The changes punctuated a wild week in which Trump backtracked from many tariffs he introduced on April 2, which he had called liberation day. His so-called reciprocal tariffs had introduced taxes that would reach up to 40% on products imported from some countries. After the stock and bond markets plunged, Trump reversed course and said he would pause levies for 90 days. China was the one exception to Trump's relief because Beijing chose to retaliate against U.S. tariffs with levies of its own. Instead of pausing tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump increased them to 145% and showed no willingness to spare any companies from those fees. In return, China on Friday said it was raising its tariffs on American goods to 125%. That sent shares of many technology companies into free fall. Over four days of trading, the valuation of Apple, which makes about 80% of its iPhones in China, fell by $773 billion. (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) For now, Trump's moderation is a major relief for a tech industry that has spent months cozying up to the president. Meta, Amazon and several tech leaders donated millions to Trump's inauguration, stood behind him as he was sworn into office in January and promised to invest billions of dollars in the United States to support him. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, has been at the forefront of the industry's courtship of Trump. He donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and later visited the White House to pledge that Apple would spend $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The strategy repeated Cook's tactics during Trump's first term. To head off requests that Apple begin manufacturing its products in the United States rather than China, Cook cultivated a personal relationship with the president that helped Apple win exemptions on tariffs for its iPhones, smartwatches and laptops. It had been unclear whether Cook could obtain a similar break this time, and the tariffs Trump proposed were more severe. As the Trump administration increased its taxes on Chinese goods, Wall Street analysts said Apple might have to increase the price of its iPhones from $1,000 to more than $1,600. The threat of higher iPhone prices caused some Americans to rush to Apple stores to buy new phones. Others raced to buy computers and tablets that were made in China. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple's iPhone quickly became a symbol of the tit-for-tat over tariffs with China. Last Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and said the tariffs would result in an army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones in the United States. Leavitt said later in the week that Trump believed that the United States had the resources to make iPhones for Apple. Apple has invested $500 billion here in the United States, she said. So if Apple didn't think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change. Apple has faced questions about moving some iPhone manufacturing to the United States for more than a decade. In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, what it would take to make the company's bestselling product in the United States rather than China. In 2016, Trump also pressured Apple to change its position. Cook has remained steadfast in his commitment to China and has said the United States doesn't have enough skilled manufacturing workers to compete with China. In the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room, he said at a conference in late 2017. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. Additional tariffs on semiconductors and other electronics could come in the next few weeks or months. The administration has signaled it is considering such tariffs under a legal statute known as Section 232, alongside other tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The president has already used the statute to put a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum and automobiles, and is weighing similar steps for imported lumber and copper. All of those sectors were given exemptions from the so-called reciprocal tariffs that the president announced April 2. Speaking to reporters the next day, the president said that other tariffs on chips would be starting very soon, adding that the administration was also looking at tariffs on pharmaceuticals. We'll be announcing that sometime in the near future, he said. It's under review right now. The other tariffs that the Trump administration has applied through Section 232 investigations have been set at 25% -- much lower than the 145% tariff currently in place for many products from China.

Iran, Kissinger famously said, had to decide whether it is “a country or a cause.”\n\nHis challenge revolved around the question of whether the ayatollah and his government were pragmatic in dealing with other nations, or militarily fanatical in a quest to spread their Islamic revolution. \n\nThe ensuing years of regional terrorism, threats of war against America, Israel and Arab nations and oppression at home provide mountains of evidence that Iran is not interested in normal statecraft. \n\nIndeed, the history is so one-sided that the current despot, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, doesn’t even pretend to be concerned about anything other than Islamic supremacy. \n\nYet much of the world, including recent American presidents and the usual suspects in Europe and the United Nations, have found it convenient to assert that the answer to Kissinger’s challenge remains elusive.\n\nNuclear option\n\nFortunately, America now has a president who is calling B.S. on claims that Iran is anything but a terror state. \n\nMost important, Donald Trump is prepared to end the charade once and for all. \n\nHis public position is that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nThat’s dramatic in itself, but his private bottom line is even more so. \n\nRevealed here for the first time, Trump’s position is that Iran’s leaders either destroy their nuclear facilities, or the US, likely with Israel’s help, will do it for them by taking military action. \n\nThat’s his offer, and no other options are on the table, the president tells confidants. Certainly there will be no more agreements requiring international inspections that rely on Iranian honesty and compliance.\n\nNor will there be any tolerance for Iran’s enriching uranium at levels that have no use other than nuclear bombs.\n\nThe unicorn fantasy that Iran would use its enriched uranium for domestic energy only is a dead letter to this president. \n\nHis approach dramatically heightens the stakes for the talks that began Saturday in Oman. \n\nThat Iran was even willing to engage the US is a testament to the clarity of Trump’s resolve and willingness to use force if necessary.\n\nAs he said in late March about Iran’s leaders, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing . . . the likes of which they have never seen before.”\n\nTo underscore the point, the US is using B-2 stealth bombers to attack Iran’s terror proxy in Yemen, the Houthis. The weapons of choice are 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs, the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal. \n\nThose bombers and weapons already are within reach of Iran and likely would be used in any military action against its nuke facilities, the most important of which are embedded in mountains.\n\nThe contrast with Trump’s immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, is striking. They begged and pleaded with Iran for peace, offered obscene treaty terms, lifted oil and banking sanctions, ransomed hostages and further sweetened their offers with pallets of cash. \n\nFor the Iranian people suffering under a corrupt, despotic theocracy, they offered pity but no help.\n\nTheir efforts fell flat. Even worse, Washington was forced to admit that Iran actually used some of the freed money to sponsor regional terrorists against Israel and our Arab allies. \n\nForced to negotiate\n\nThe good news so far is that Iran’s recent behavior reflects that it remembers Trump’s first term and realizes he’s cut from a different cloth than Obama and Biden. \n\nHe famously withdrew from the flimsy Obama accord, which Tehran had refused even to sign as a show of disdain for America. \n\nMore important to the mullahs, Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, which spearheads the Iranian terror network. \n\nThat led the government to put out assassination contracts on Trump and others in his first-term Cabinet who were involved in the planning and execution of the Soleimani strike. \n\nFortunately, none has succeeded.\n\nStill, the lingering hostility led Iran to initially scoff at the idea of new negotiations, saying there was nothing to discuss. Practically overnight, however, it flip-flopped and agreed to meet. \n\nAt first, it insisted on indirect talks, meaning each side would speak through a mediator. \n\nTrump said that was not how it was going to work, and Saturday’s session ended with his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, talking directly with Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. \n\nThey agreed to meet again next week, with Araghchi telling Iranian media the talks were “productive” and the atmosphere “positive.” \n\nWhether the tone holds depends on whether Iranian leaders take seriously Trump’s threat to use force.\n\nThey would be suicidal not to. \n\nOne fact in the president’s favor is that the Ayatollah and his government are at one of their weakest points in decades and cannot afford to expand their Islamic revolution. \n\nThanks largely to Israel, they don’t have the sacrificial stooges of the kind who made up Hezbollah, Hamas and other goon squads. \n\nIndeed, Iran’s web of terror armies is in tatters, and the long goal of eliminating Israel first and moving on to America looks more and more like an expired fantasy. \n\nAlthough the government still has a brutal, suffocating hold on the Iranian people, there are reports that officials realize they could be toppled.\n\nA provocative piece in Foreign Policy magazine asks whether Iran’s regime is “About to Go the Way of Syria’s?” because many former core supporters no longer trust it to provide economic and national security.\n\nDeal’s make or break\n\nSimilarly, The New York Times reports that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was persuaded to accept Trump’s invitation for talks because he was told by advisers that, otherwise, the regime could fall.\n\nThe Times cited a crashing economy, a sinking currency and shortages of gas, electricity and water as causes of growing public discontent. \n\nWar with the US and Israel could be the final nail in the coffin, the officials supposedly warned the Supreme Leader. \n\nThe Times said Iranian officials also told him that if Iran refused talks or if the negotiations failed, Trump was sure to deliver military strikes against the main nuclear sites.\n\nThe Times, of course, couldn’t bring itself to admit that Trump’s hard line was already bearing more fruit than anything Obama and Biden tried. \n\nNor could it admit that Israel’s war against Hamas and Hezbollah was a major factor in Iran’s weakness. To do so would undercut its drumbeat of criticism of the Jewish state for its military actions in Gaza.\n\nInstead, the paper quotes Iran’s former nuclear negotiator as declaring that Khamenei would never agree to dismantling its nuclear program and that such a demand would be a “deal breaker.”\n\nPerhaps, but because Trump is making precisely that demand, one side or the other has to blink. \n\nMy bet is that it won’t be the man in the White House.","summary":"The ensuing years of regional terrorism, threats of war against America, Israel and Arab nations and oppression at home provide mountains of evidence that Iran is not interested in normal statecraft. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/12/opinion/trump-israel-have-iran-leaders-shaking-in-their-boots/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/speaking-members-iranian-delegation-meeting-102517203.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 02:06:46","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":310561770,"title":"US, Iran Hold 'Positive And Constructive' Nuclear Talks, Set For Further Dialogue Next Week","text":"The United States and Iran engaged in high-level discussions on Saturday (local time) over Tehran’s fast-developing nuclear program, which the White House described as “positive and constructive.”\nThe US and Iranian delegates will meet again in Oman on April 19, said Iran’s Foreign Minister, adding that they came close to a negotiation framework during Saturday’s meeting.\n“The discussions were very positive and constructive, and the US deeply thanks Sultanate of Oman for supporting this initiative.

domestic market","text":"After a week of global financial turmoil following Donald Trump's shifting tariff policy, the only economic certainty is further uncertainty.\n\nStock markets plummeted and rebounded before falling again after the US president's decision to impose tariffs, which he then walked back for a 90-day pause.\n\nAs the US and China engage in tit-for-tat tariffs, the fallout from the economic measures will continue to cast a shadow over movements in the domestic economy.\n\nWhile the risk of a US recession is put at almost 50-50, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said Australia would be likely to avoid a similar situation.,,\n\n\"For Australia, the direct hit to our industries that have tariffs on them will likely be a less than 0.2 per cent drag on GDP,\" he said.\n\n\"Only five per cent of our exports go to the US (and) a lower Australian dollar is acting as a shock absorber to the hit from the tariffs.\"\n\nFurther insight is expected on Tuesday into why the Reserve Bank decided to hold interest rates at 4.1 per cent, when the minutes for the central bank's last meeting are released.\n\nThe meeting was held just days before Mr Trump unveiled the extent of his tariff agenda, but it is expected risks from the global economy could feature in the board's discussions.\n\nGovernor Michele Bullock sought to allay concerns stemming from the tariffs in a speech on Thursday night, but said it was too early for the Reserve Bank to determine its response on interest rates.\n\nWhile a 25 basis point cut is predicted at the bank's next meeting on May 20, the tariff uncertainty had led to some forecasts of a 50 basis point drop.\n\nEach 25 basis point cut would shave about $90 off monthly repayments on a typical, $600,000 mortgage.\n\nDespite some suggestions the Reserve Bank could call an emergency meeting, Dr Oliver said the situation had not become so bad it was warranted.\n\n\"The local financial markets are functioning well and the banking system is well capitalised with no signs of unusual stress,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, an emergency meeting may just create a sense of panic. but we are of the view that the RBA will cut in May by 0.25 per cent.\"\n\nEmployment figures for March are set to be released on Thursday, with economists forecasting a slight uptick in the jobless rate.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank says the unemployment rate is expected to rise from 4.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent, also predicting a further 45,000 jobs to have been created in March.\n\nHowever, data from the March figures is set to be affected by the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Alfred, with the natural disaster having hit southeast Queensland and northern NSW during the survey period.\n\nWall Street investors have meanwhile closed the book on a turbulent week of wild swings driven by the chaos of Mr Trump's multi-front trade war, with the major indices posting solid gains on Friday as big banks kicked off first-quarter earnings season.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 619.05 points, or 1.56 per cent, to 40,212.71, the S&P 500 gained 95.31 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 5,363.36 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 337.15 points, or 2.06 per

He has until April 23 to file for relief. At the same time, he’s challenging the basis of his arrest in federal court in New Jersey.\n\nThough the government’s arguments against Khalil’s presence have expanded to include reasons not initially given, including alleged failure to disclose material information on his residency application, White House has increasingly targeted foreign-born students whose main transgression seems to be activism.\n\n“Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” he said in Guyana last month.\n\nSome university representatives said the institutions found out they were teaching students whose visas had been revoked by checking the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, which can signal a student’s presence, legal or otherwise.\n\nBennett, the Texas A&M

shockwaves to pulse through the automotive industry due to the president’s 25 percent taxes on imported vehicles, meaning increased costs of more than $100 billion for manufacturers and higher price tags on vehicles.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said he expects the tariffs, imposed in April, will raise the cost of vehicle import and manufacture by ‘at least a low to mid single digit thousand level on average’. \n\n‘We believe it will be hard for the auto industry to fully pass this on, especially with softening consumer demand more generally,’ he said in a Thursday investor note. \n\nThis means cuts will have to be made elsewhere, such as in auto job wages and redundancies, as is already being seen at America’s top carmaker, General Motors. \n\nGoldman Sachs has predicted that new vehicle net prices in the US will increase by around $2,000 to $4,000 over the next six to 12 months due to tariffs. \n\n‘What we’re seeing now is a structural shift, driven by policy, that’s likely to be long-lasting,’ Felix Stellmaszek, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead of automotive and mobility, told CNBC. \n\n‘This may well be the most consequential year for the auto industry in history — not just because of immediate cost pressures, but because it’s forcing fundamental change in how and where the industry builds.’\n\nAnalysis by the Center for Automotive Research also found that the 25 percent tariffs will likely increase costs by about $108 billion for American automakers in 2025.\n\nThe study, released on Thursday by the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based organization, found Detroit automakers Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N), and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), maker of Jeeps and Ram trucks, specifically will see increased costs of $42 billion. \n\nThe study found the Detroit Three could see tariffs of nearly $5,000 for the parts they import on average for each car produced in the US, and about $8,600 on average for each car they import.\n\nTrump’s 25 percent automotive import tariffs took effect April 3, causing shock waves across the global industry since supplies come from all over the world. \n\nVehicles made in Mexico and Canada face the levy, but automakers compliant with the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement can deduct the value of US content.\n\nThe tariffs have pushed automakers to make production changes, with GM increasing truck output at an Indiana plant and Stellantis temporarily shutting down production at a plant in Mexico and one in Canada. \n\nThese moves affected five U.S. facilities that are connected to them.\n\nThe study estimates the Detroit Three automakers will see an average cost of the tariff per vehicle for imported vehicle parts of $4,911, higher than the overall industry’s average of $4,239 per vehicle.\n\nFor imported vehicles, the study found the average tariff cost per vehicle to be $8,722 for the overall industry and $8,641 for the Detroit Three.\n\nMatt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, representing the Detroit Three automakers, said in a statement that the study ‘demonstrates the significant cost a 25 percent tariff will have on the automotive industry. \n\nAmerican Automakers Ford, GM, and Stellantis intend to maintain our ongoing dialogue with the administration to achieve our shared goal of increased US automotive production.’\n\nGM and Stellantis deferred to the trade group’s comment and Ford was not immediately available.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHigh-earning professionals in the auto industry, including car

the front-row seat alongside Trump. \n\nIn the main fight of the evening, Australian Alexander Volkanovski is set to take on Brazil's Diego Lopes in the featherweight title fight.\n\nIt is the penultimate fight the president will perhaps be most interested in though, with staunch Trump supporter Chandler taking on England's Pimblett.\n\nChandler backed the MAGA movement throughout the election cycle and this week reiterated his fandom of the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n'You're talking about a couple months of a presidency,' Chandler told Sporting News when asked to reflect on the tariff

For example, LA Times writer David Horsey was forced to apologize after he criticized her looks in a column. “Sarah Huckabee Sanders does not look like the kind of woman Donald Trump would choose as his chief spokesperson,” he wrote in 2017 (via The Washington Post).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders has undergone an undeniably stunning transformation. And while there’s no way to know if her current style was impacted by previous commentary, it’s very possible. In addition to Sanders showing off her weight loss at the RNC (and sparking rumors of Ozempic use) back in July 2024, she’s also made considerable changes to her wardrobe. While the former Trump employee was often made fun of for her makeup choices — particularly her well-documented love of a smokey eye — 2025 saw her experiment with trendier aesthetics, along with slightly flashier accessories. However, the governor’s style and fashion sense have continued to spur strong opinions across social media.\n\nStill, Sanders doesn’t always dress for the public. Sometimes, she gives the makeup a break, presenting a different side of herself to the world.\n\nAdvertisement","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; Chip Somodevilla/Getty&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Stunning Makeup-Free Photo of Sarah Huckabee Sanders Grabs Attention first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/stunning-makeup-free-photo-of-sarah-huckabee-sanders-grabs-attention/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/sarah-huckabee-sanders-without-makeup-is-seriously-head-turning/intro-1743540460.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 01:41:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.393},{"id":310562430,"title":"‘Greed, greed, and more greed’: AOC and Bernie Sanders blast Trump and Musk at largest anti-oligarchy rally yet","text":"A staggering 36,000 people protested Donald Trump’s administration in Los Angeles Saturday, at the largest rally to date of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Fighting Oligarchy” tour \n\nIn fiery remarks, the New Yorker laid into the president, accusing him of “manipulating the markets” for his billionaire friends with his “tariff shuffle” this week, in which Trump pulled a dramatic U-turn on the implementation of his trade war against U.S. commercial partners and allies.\n\nTaking to the stage at Gloria Molina Grand Park in Downtown Los Angeles, Sanders noted that the crowd went back half a mile, before saying that Musk had said most of the people attending these rallies were paid organizers. He asked the crowd: “Anybody here get paid to come today?”\n\nThe question was met with a resounding: “No!”\n\nSanders said that Trump was often “very envious of sizes” and claimed that only two or three thousand people show up to his rallies and that, speaking in the third person, Bernie “can’t compete with Trump.”\n\n“He lied,” said the senator. “I invite him to come to LA, tell the people here why you think it’s a great idea to cut Medicaid and nutrition and healthcare so you can give tax breaks to billionaires.”\n\nContinuing, Sanders said: “Our good friend Elon Musk sent out a tweet and in essence, he said, you know, Bernie Sanders has been talking about the growth of oligarchy year after year after year.”\n\n“Well, Elon, you're damn right. That's what I've been talking about. The difference is I'm no longer talking about how we're moving to oligarchy. I'm talking about how we are living today in an oligarchic form of society.”\n\nHe added: “Let me tell you something about the oligarchs. They're very, very religious people. But their religion isn’t based on doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. Their religion is based on greed — greed, and more greed.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez called the current moment “terrifying,” saying: “We are watching our neighbors, students, and friends being fired, targeted, and disappeared.”\n\nAfter decrying that activists are being detained without charge for exercising their First Amendment rights — specifically highlighting the cases of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk — the New York progressive Democrat railed against stock trading by elected representatives in Congress, before turning specifically to this week’s market turbulence and Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“Let’s be clear: the White House’s tariff shuffle had nothing to do with manufacturing, despite what they claimed. It was about manipulating the markets. It was about hurting retirees and everyday people in the sell-off — so Trump could quietly enrich his friends, who he tipped off to ‘buy the dip’ before reversing it all in the morning,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n“Donald Trump is a criminal — convicted on 34 felony counts of fraud. He is lying, and he is manipulating the stock market too. At his best, he enriches himself, the billionaires who back him, and the members of Congress who trade with him. Not you. Not me. Not the people.”\n\n“Oligarchy or Democracy,” she said. “But, we cannot have both.”\n\nConcluding his remarks, Senator Sanders said: “When Trump looks out at this crowd… they pay attention to this stuff, Elon Musk does. You are scaring the hell out of them. Because they know what we know: They are the 1 percent and we are the 99 percent.”\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez were joined by fellow Democrat representatives Reps. Ro Khanna, Jimmy Gomez, Pramila Jayapal, and Maxwell Frost, among other elected officials. There were also performances by Neil Young, Maggie Rogers, and Joan Baez. \n\nOn a spin through the western states, the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour next travels to Salt Lake City, Utah; Nampa, Idaho; Bakersfield, California; Folsom, California; and Missoula, Montana.","summary":"New York Democrat says Trump's 'tariff shuffle' was market manipulation for billionaire friends","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-aoc-sanders-oligarchy-b2732318.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/13/1/31/AP25102810905715.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mg2sPpq5-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-13 01:39:41","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.171},{"id":310561202,"title":"Teen 'killed parents to raise funds for Trump assassination'","text":"A 17 year old lad from Wisconsin is accused of killing his parents as part of a grand scheme to assassinate President Donald Trump and topple the U.S. government, according to federal authorities. Nikita Casap has been charged by Waukesha County authorities with the murder of his mother and stepfather at their Wisconsin home in February. The alleged motive was to \"obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary\" to carry out his plot against President Trump and the American government. In March, it was reported that Casap had been arrested and faced two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of concealing a corpse. He also faces charges of theft of property over £7600 ($10,000) and misappropriating ID to obtain money. Court documents indicate that investigators are considering federal charges, including conspiracy, presidential assassination, and use of weapons of mass destruction, according to ABC News. A press release from the Waukesha County Sheriff's Department revealed that Donald Mayer, 51, Nikita's stepfather, and Tatiana Casap, 35, Nikita's mother, were found dead at their home on March 1, reports the Mirror US . Upon executing a search warrant, the sheriff's department reportedly discovered evidence on Casap's phone linked to \"The Order of Nine Angles,\" described as \"a network of individuals holding new-Nazi racially motivated extremist views.\" The FBI has analysed documents allegedly penned by the teenager, which reportedly include a call for the assassination of President Trump and the initiation of a revolution to \"save the white race.\" Court documents reveal that Casap's alleged writings feature images of Adolf Hitler accompanied by the words \"HAIL HITLER HAIL THE WHITE RACE HAIL VICTORY.\" Investigators stated in the federal affidavit: \"He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States.

On Friday night, the US president handed Apple a major victory, exempting many popular consumer electronics. That includes iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and AirTags. Another win: The 10% tariff on goods imported from other countries has been dropped for those products. While a new, lower so-called sectoral tariff may still come on goods that have semiconductors — and a 20% tariff on China remains — the change marks a win for Apple and a consumer electronics industry that still heavily relies on the Asian nation for manufacturing.“This is a major relief for Apple,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a note on Saturday. “The tariffs would have driven material cost inflation.”He expects the shares to rally Monday following an 11% rout this month.Before the latest exemption, the iPhone maker had a plan: adjust its supply chain to make more US-bound iPhones in India, which would have been subject to far lower levies. That, Apple executives believed, would be a near-term solution to avoid the eye-watering China tariff and stave off hefty price hikes.Given that the iPhone facilities in India are on pace to produce more than 30 million iPhones per year, manufacturing from that country alone could have fulfilled a fair chunk of American demand. Apple, these days, sells about 220 million to 230 million iPhones annually, with about a third of those going to the US.Such a shift would be difficult to pull off without a hitch, especially because the company is already nearing production of the iPhone 17, which will be made primarily in China. Within Apple’s operations, finance and marketing departments, fears had grown about the impact on the fall launch of new phones — and fueled a sense of dread.The company, in just a few months, would have needed to pull off the herculean task of moving more iPhone 17 production to India or elsewhere. It likely would have had to increase prices — something that’s still possible — and fought with suppliers for better margins. And Apple’s famous marketing engine would have had to convince consumers it was all worth it.120245807But the feeling of uncertainty remains. White House policies are likely to shift again, and Apple may need to pursue more dramatic changes. At least for now, though, management is breathing a sigh of relief. Another concern: If Apple moves even more production from China at a rapid pace, how would the country retaliate? Apple generates about 17% of its revenue from the country and operates dozens of stores, making it an outlier among US-based companies. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.China has launched competition inquiries into US companies and could create issues for Apple through its own customs process. In recent years, it has also banned iPhones, among other US-designed devices, from its legion of government workers. That followed a US crackdown on Chinese tech champion Huawei Technologies Co.The iPhone is Apple’s biggest moneymaker, and about 87% of them are produced in China, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley. About four in five iPads also are made in the country, along with 60% of Macs.All together, those products are responsible for about 75% of Apple’s annual revenue. Still, the company now builds nearly all of its Apple Watches and AirPods in Vietnam. Some iPads and Macs are also manufactured in that country, and Mac production is expanding in Malaysia and Thailand.The company generates about 38% of its iPad sales in the US, as well as about half its Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods revenue, Morgan Stanley estimates.A complete split with China — Apple’s manufacturing hub for decades — would be unlikely. Though Trump has pushed Apple to make iPhones in the US, the lack of domestic engineering and manufacturing talent will make that nearly impossible in the short run.The size and scale of the facilities in China makes it unmatched in speed and efficiency. The China production also is crucial for Apple’s sales in the world beyond the US. The Cupertino, California-based company gets nearly 60% of its revenue outside of the Americas.Since a wave of tariffs were announced on April 2, lobbyists from Apple and other technology companies have been pushing the White House for exemptions. But the discussions took on extra urgency in recent days after a series of tit-for-tat retaliations between Washington and Beijing led to what amounted to 145% duties on imports from China.The potential impact was even more stark after Trump paused higher tariffs on other countries. That meant Apple rival Samsung Electronics Co., which makes its phones outside China, would have had an edge.Apple and other companies have been stressing to the Trump administration that — while they are willing to increase investment in the US — there’s little benefit in moving final assembly to the country. Instead, they have argued, the US should be focusing on bringing back higher-value jobs and encouraging investment in things like semiconductor production.","summary":"Apple dodged a major crisis as the US president exempted popular consumer electronics like iPhones and Macs from tariffs, a significant relief after fears of cost inflation.

On March 18, Israeli air force jets attacked military sites, killing more than 400 Palestinians, including over 300 women and children, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health—a devastating toll even by the war’s earlier standards. The short-lived truce had allowed for the release of 30 hostages Hamas took during its shock attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, as well as the repa-triation of eight deceased captives. Last week, the Israeli government proposed resuming a cease-fire in exchange for the return of 11 more hostages and 16 more bodies.\n\nBut even if Hamas and Israel hammer out a new, short-term agreement to halt hostilities, Gaza is unlikely to see real peace any time soon. Since the horrific October 7 massacre, which claimed the lives of around 1,250 Israelis, Netanyahu has pursued two goals with his mil-itary operations in the strip—free all the hostages and destroy Hamas. But these goals cannot be achieved at the same time: Hamas refuses to subscribe to a peace process that in-volves its own annihilation, and as long as Israel is committed to that outcome, Hamas’s surviving leaders have a powerful incentive to hold on to hostages to deter Israeli attacks that might kill them.\n\nThis means that even if a cease-fire resumes, Hamas is likely to delay releasing every last hostage, Israel is likely to find ways to avoid proceeding through phases that al-low Hamas to retain power, and any deal may again fall apart at its final stages. Netanyahu increasingly be-lieves that ordering military action pays off. Projecting strength, after all, weakened Iran and hobbled its Leb-anese proxy militia, Hezbollah. And whereas former U.S. President Joe Biden’s team tried to contain Israeli escalations, Netanyahu has a more permissive ally in President Donald Trump. In a sign of the two leaders’ intimacy—and the importance, for Netanyahu, of keeping Trump onside—the Israeli prime minister rushed to Washington on Sunday to see Trump for the second time in three months. Feeling emboldened, the Israeli military has also proposed a far-reaching plan to reoccupy Gaza, and Netanyahu’s ultra-right-wing partners are more brazenly advanc-ing a proposal to expel most of Gaza’s inhabitants.\n\nIt remains somewhat unclear, however, whether Netanyahu is prepared to implement his political partners’ biggest dreams. He has to consider Trump’s position, change-able as it is, and whether Israel’s military is capable of embarking on a costly, long-term operation in Gaza. For the time being, his best option is probably to pursue a mid-dle path that keeps his options open and maintains his allies’ belief that he is on their side—and that middle path involves continued operations in Gaza.\n\nCONFIDENCE GAME\n\nWhen Israel went to war in Gaza 18 months ago, there was almost unanimous agreement among Israe-lis that Hamas must be eliminated. But it soon became clear that Israel’s two military objectives—secure the release of the hostages and destroy Hamas—could not be accomplished in the same time frame. Even assum-ing that it is possible to eradicate Hamas, a terrorist guerrilla organi-zation that still commands substan-tial grassroots support in Gaza, do-ing so would take years. The Israeli hostages, however, do not have that kind of time. According to an analy-sis by The New York Times, between October 2023 and early March 2025, 41 hostages died in captivity. Some died from starvation, disease, and murder, and others perished acci-dentally as a result of Israeli military operations. Those hostages who have returned to Israel from Gaza in re-cent months described being held in extremely harsh conditions: many were kept chained in tunnels with little food and no medical care and some reported experiencing torture.\n\nBecause Israel did not clearly pri-oritize one goal over the other, it has yet to achieve either one. Since the war began, Israel has killed most of Hamas’s top leaders, including the group’s Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar. But the organization still has a gov-ernance structure, and to discour-age Israeli attempts to assassinate them, its remaining leaders seek to maintain a human shield—a kind of insurance policy—in the form of a small number of hostages, mostly soldiers. Such an arrangement is un-acceptable to Netanyahu. For him, only two options are on the table: Hamas’s total surrender and the ex-pulsion of its leadership from Gaza, or the continuation of the war until the Israeli military achieves that same outcome. In the second sce-nario, he would likely blame Hamas for the deaths of additional hostages.\n\nAny hope that the United States would push Israel to stick to a last-ing cease-fire faded with Trump’s inauguration. Although Trump did pressure Netanyahu to agree to the January cease-fire, since then his ad-ministration’s approach has become more muddled. Every few days, the American team presents new pro-posals, but the discussions remain deadlocked; Trump now toggles be-tween disinterest in the conflict and fantastical ideas, such as his propo-sition in February that the United States could take ownership of Gaza and turn it into a tourist “Riviera.”\n\nThe Trump administration has not really faced or sought to resolve the fundamental contradiction delaying serious peace talks: Net-anyahu insists that any cease-fire process must end in the disman-tling of Hamas. But this is a redline that Hamas is unwilling to cross, al-though it reportedly may consider abdicating its political power while maintaining its military strength, a kind of compromise being tested in Lebanon with Hezbollah’s con-sent. Neither the Americans nor the Arab mediators from Egypt and Qatar, however, have so far managed to persuade Hamas’s leaders to sign an agreement that would end their ultimate political mission: to take control of the Palestinian struggle against Israel.\n\nOther developments have made it less urgent for Netanyahu to seek a settlement. By now, Israel’s mili-tary has partially recovered from the shock of October 7. Hamas’s abili-ties to organize another large-scale attack or launch significant rocket barrages into Israeli territory have been degraded. On other fronts, Is-rael now holds the upper hand. Last November, Hezbollah was forced to agree to a humiliating cease-fire, and although the Israeli air force contin-ues to strike the group’s targets in southern Lebanon (and, last week, in Beirut), the battered organization has yet to respond. Israel’s exchanges of fire with Iran last October were an embarrassment for Tehran. And following the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Is-rael took control of parts of south-ern Syria. On the back of these wins, Netanyahu seems emboldened, responding with military force to enemy provocations he would pre-viously have preferred to contain or ignore. In mid-March, for instance, after six rockets landed in its ter-ritory, Israel bombed a Hezbollah drone warehouse in southern Bei-rut, even though it remains unclear who launched the rockets.\n\nAlthough the Biden administra-tion stood by Israel after October 7 and helped prevent further regional escalation, it also sought to contain Israeli military actions. For instance, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded the southern Gazan city of Rafah last May—an act Biden’s team had cautioned against—Biden delayed sending heavy precision munitions and bulldozers to Isra-el. Trump’s accession to the White House has removed this counter-balance. Publicly, at least, Trump supports all of Israel’s actions. And more broadly, the way that he flirts with ideas such as absorbing Canada and annexing Greenland legitimiz-es the notion that strong countries can simply seize territory from their neighbors. When Netanyahu visited Trump in Washington in February, the U.S. president wondered aloud why Israel did not take advantage of Assad’s ouster to claim even more Syrian land. Netanyahu subsequent-ly discussed such an idea with his cabinet, although it has not gained traction.\n\nHIDDEN FISSURES\n\nIsrael appears to be in a com-manding position. Indeed, in mid- March, the military presented an ambitious plan to the government to redeploy several divisions into Gaza, conduct a new reserve mo-bilization, evict northern Gazans back to a shelter zone in the south, and complete a military occupation of the entire strip—all in the space of a few months. The IDF’s former chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, had fiercely opposed the creation of any Israeli military government in Gaza. But he resigned in early March. His successor, Eyal Zamir—who enjoys warmer relations with Israel’s politi-cal leaders and thus more freedom to pursue his plans—has indicated he is open to governing the strip.\n\nThe Trump administration may have ceased talking about a plan to clear Gaza of its inhabitants, but right-wing Israeli politicians have taken up the cause, interpreting Trump’s proposal as a permission slip to more openly discuss encour-aging Gazans to emigrate voluntari-ly. In practice, any such “voluntary emigration” project would involve the use of significant military force to persuade residents to leave. Israe-li Defense Minister Israel Katz, who is essentially Netanyahu’s puppet, has established a new administra-tive body in his ministry to promote emigration.\n\nBut deeper weaknesses and do-mestic tensions constrain the Israeli government. Despite the blows it has suffered, Hamas remains far from de-feated. Two surviving military com-manders, Izz al-Din al-Haddad and Mohammed Sinwar (Yahya Sinwar’s brother), are leading its efforts to re-cover. The multiweek cease-fire that began in January, which facilitated the delivery of more humanitarian aid into Gaza, also allowed Hamas to replenish funds by seizing some of that aid and selling it to Gazan civil-ians for profit. Israel has estimated that, in recent months, Hamas has recruited about 20,000 new fighters, and the group’s leaders are moving to suppress protests against its rule in northern Gaza. Hamas is repur-posing Israeli bombs that failed to detonate to booby-trap buildings and roads in preparation for another Is-raeli invasion.\n\nReoccupying Gaza would result in additional military casualties and, quite possibly, the deaths of more hostages. According to myriad pub-lic opinion polls, about 70 percent of Israelis support a deal with Hamas to release all the remaining hostages, even if it comes with very high costs, such as ending Israel’s military operations in Gaza and releasing thousands of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. But it is not certain whether this public sentiment will translate to the kind of protest that could constrain Netanyahu’s op-tions. Many Israelis still find it ex-tremely hard to demonstrate against their government while Israeli sol-diers are fighting and dying in Gaza.\n\nBut implementing either the military plan to occupy Gaza or the “voluntary emigration” project will carry serious political risk. Tens of thousands of military reservists have already served hundreds of days each during the war, which has taken a heavy toll on their careers and families. Israel has, in fact, nev-er faced so much ambivalence about military service on the part of its reservists—not even during its po-litically controversial 1982 war in Lebanon or during the second inti-fada, which lasted from 2000 to 2006. Some are threatening to refuse a call-up because they fear that a sweeping new military campaign could result in the deaths of more hostages.\n\nContinues in FOREIGN AFFAIRS (www.foreignaffairs.com), April 7, 2025.","summary":"&#8230; Leaders on Both Sides—and in America—Have Little Incentive to End It Less than two months after he committed to a phased cease-fire with Hamas, Israe­li Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resumed his country’s war in the Gaza Strip.

Tehran's declaration that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the White House described the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” while conceding the issues that need to be resolved “are very complicated.” Also Read | Sudan: At Least 100 People Killed After Rapid Support Forces Attacked Famine-Hit Camps in Darfur, Says UN Official. “Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the White House said. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday while flying to Miami for a UFC event that the talks are “going okay.” “I can't tell you because nothing matters until you get it done so I don't like talking about it but it's going ok. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,\" he said. The next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements. This first round of talks began at around 3:30 pm local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman's capital, ending the talks around 5:50 pm local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighbourhood that is home to the US Embassy. The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear programme if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman Associated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the “indirect talks” had begun. Afterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion. “Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called talks for the sake of talks, wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,” he said. \"Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.” That the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being “direct”. “I think our position begins with dismantlement of your programme. That is our position today,” Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. “That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.” He added: “Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponisation of your nuclear capability.” Araghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as “a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges” — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran. Badr al-Busaidi, Oman's foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a “shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement”. “I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,” al-Busaidi wrote on X. “We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.” Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues While the US side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%. One thing it won't do is give up its programme entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — “you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution” — unworkable. Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.

Military members would be able to stop anyone crossing into the “military installation” but would not have the power to make immigration arrests, according to the military official.

There is also the question of where to position military patrols along hundreds of miles of rugged land along the border, and what additional training those troops might need.\n\nAdam Isacson, who focuses on border security and human rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the memorandum appeared to create a path for using quasimilitary personnel to detain migrants.\n\nA section of the memorandum calls for the authorization of state National Guard members to work on the military-controlled strip.

The 37-year-old president narrowly won February's first round, but not by enough to avoid another duel against a resurgent Luisa Gonzalez, who is bidding to become Ecuador's first woman president. The election has been dominated by anger over cartel violence that has transformed Ecuador from one of the safest countries in Latin America to the most deadly. On the eve of the vote, Noboa declared a 60-day state of emergency in the capital Quito and several provinces, underscoring the tense state of affairs. This once-peaceful Andean nation averaged a killing every hour at the start of the year, as cartels vied for control over cocaine routes that pass through Ecuador's ports.Noboa, the guitar-strumming son of a billionaire banana magnate, has staked his political fortunes on \"iron fist\" security policies and snuffing out the gangs. He has deployed military to the streets, captured drug capos and invited the United States to send special forces. He frequently dons a bulletproof vest to lead audacious security raids. In stark contrast, 47-year-old single mother Gonzalez has pitched herself as a political everywoman, born to a humble family and transfixed with improving the lot of poor Ecuadorans. She may have a growing constituency. Rampant bloodshed has spooked investors and tourists alike, fueling economic malaise and swelling the ranks of Ecuador's poor to 28 percent of the population. \"We hope that this Sunday, at last things will get better, that they leave us to work in peace and that calm returns,\" 61-year cafeteria manager Marcelo Salgado told AFP. Polls have the race in a statistical tie. But Ecuador faces two very different paths depending on which candidate wins. A Noboa win would likely see him double down on hardline security policies and nurturing a budding bromance with US President Donald Trump. If Gonzalez wins, it would signal a sharp shift to the left and a likely cooling of Ecuador's relations with the United States. Gonzalez is closely allied with ex-president Rafael Correa, who delighted in lobbing barbs at Washington during his decade in office. He now lives in exile in Belgium, avoiding a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated. He remains a deeply polarizing figure in his homeland. In February's first round of voting less than a percentage point, or 17,000 votes, separated Noboa and Gonzalez. On Sunday, with more than a dozen also-ran candidates shorn from the ballot, hundreds of thousands of votes are up for grabs. Gonzalez has the backing of powerful indigenous leader Leonidas Iza, who won half a million votes in the first round. But it is unclear if his voters will remain united. About 13.7 million Ecuadorans are obliged to vote, with ballots being cast between 7 am and 5 pm (1200 and 2200 GMT). Both candidates on Thursday held final campaign events in Guayaquil, the country's largest city, economic capital and the epicenter of drug violence. Gonzalez made a late play for women voters, proposing low-interest loans of up to $40,000 for single mothers. During Noboa's time in power, she said, \"violence, poverty and unemployment has hit us women hardest.\" Noboa presented himself as an outsider and the candidate of change. \"The country does not deserve to be mistreated by the same old politicians,\" he said, targeting his rival's ties with former president Correa. Some analysts fear a tight result could spark claims of fraud and lead to a government with a weak mandate. \"If the difference is very small, the government will be born with a problem: It has almost half the country against it, and that weighs heavily, making it more difficult to govern,\" said Simon Pachano of the social sciences institute FLASCO.","summary":"Ecuadorans vote Sunday in a too-close-to-call presidential election pitting the incumbent, security hawk Daniel Noboa, against a charismatic leftist challenger.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/ecuador-votes-razor-close-presidential-runoff-3769854","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4593498/soldier-stands-guard-member-national-electoral-council-prepares-voting-material-distributed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 01:15:12","author":"Lina Vanegas","authors":["Lina Vanegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.14},{"id":310561374,"title":"Iran and US envoys hold 1st negotiation over Tehran's nuclear program, and talk face-to-face","text":"Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Rampant bloodshed has spooked investors and tourists alike, fueling economic malaise and swelling the ranks of Ecuador's poor to 28 percent of the population.\n\n\"We hope that this Sunday, at last things will get better, that they leave us to work in peace and that calm returns,\" 61-year cafeteria manager Marcelo Salgado told AFP.\n\n- 'Born with a problem' -\n\nPolls have the race in a statistical tie. But Ecuador faces two very different paths depending on which candidate wins.\n\nA Noboa win would likely see him double down on hardline security policies and nurturing a budding bromance with US President Donald Trump.\n\nIf Gonzalez wins, it would signal a sharp shift to the left and a likely cooling of Ecuador's relations with the United States.\n\nGonzalez is closely allied with ex-president Rafael Correa, who delighted in lobbing barbs at Washington during his decade in office.\n\nHe now lives in exile in Belgium, avoiding a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated. He remains a deeply polarizing figure in his homeland.\n\nIn February's first round of voting less than a percentage point, or 17,000 votes, separated Noboa and Gonzalez.\n\nOn Sunday, with more than a dozen also-ran candidates shorn from the ballot, hundreds of thousands of votes are up for grabs.\n\nGonzalez has the backing of powerful indigenous leader Leonidas Iza, who won half a million votes in the first round. But it is unclear if his voters will remain united.\n\nAbout 13.7 million Ecuadorans are obliged to vote, with ballots being cast between 7 am and 5 pm (1200 and 2200 GMT).\n\nBoth candidates on Thursday held final campaign events in Guayaquil, the country's largest city, economic capital and the epicenter of drug violence.\n\nGonzalez made a late play for women voters, proposing low-interest loans of up to $40,000 for single mothers.\n\nDuring Noboa's time in power, she said, \"violence, poverty and unemployment has hit us women hardest.\"\n\nNoboa presented himself as an outsider and the candidate of change.\n\n\"The country does not deserve to be mistreated by the same old politicians,\" he said, targeting his rival's ties with former president Correa.\n\nSome analysts fear a tight result could spark claims of fraud and lead to a government with a weak mandate.\n\n\"If the difference is very small, the government will be born with a problem: It has almost half the country against it, and that weighs heavily, making it more difficult to govern,\" said Simon Pachano of the social sciences institute FLASCO.\n\nbur-arb/acb","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ecuador-votes-razor-close-presidential-011250699.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/1935d39173f7e6469b9fd3189e9805b4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 01:12:50","author":"Lina Vanegas","authors":["Lina Vanegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":310558386,"title":"Rubio and Musk back Witkoff’s peace efforts","text":"The US leader’s confidant spent over four hours behind closed doors discussing aspects of a potential settlement of the Ukraine conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, before heading to Oman for high-level talks on Iran’s nuclear program on Saturday.\n\nWhite House special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, reportedly managed to convince Israel to agree to a Gaza truce in just one meeting – even before President Donald Trump took office – and has since become one of the key US negotiators on Ukraine.\n\nWhen he traveled to Russia for the third time in two months – and a video of Witkoff smiling and shaking hands with Putin emerged on Friday – critics rushed to accuse him of everything from acting too cozy and perpetuating “Russian propaganda,” to being too “inexperienced” to conduct negotiations and effectively “taking over” the role of US Secretary of State.\n\n“People love attacking Steve Witkoff, but he has done more to advance peace negotiations & hostage releases than any of his career bureaucrat critics have done during their entire careers in the Swamp,” conservative activist Laura Loomer wrote on X, adding that “Steve Witkoff is busting his ass for President Trump.”\n\n“Witkoff is great,” agreed billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, another of Trump’s closest allies, who leads his government waste-cutting task force known as DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio also “100%” agreed with Loomer’s post.\n\nWitkoff’s first visit to Russia in February resulted in a high-profile prisoner exchange and paved the way for a phone call between the countries’ leaders, kickstarting the resumption of diplomatic relations.

Eisgruber recently told a New York Times reporter he identified \"serious problems\" with antisemitism on Columbia University's campus and even his own. But he noted it is \"not appropriate\" for the government to use its funding power to change the way universities conduct their research, teaching or admissions. Eisgruber sat down Wednesday with \"The Daily\" podcast host Rachel Abrams to discuss research funding freezes and antisemitism on university campuses. Colleges and universities nationwide have expressed concern about President Donald Trump investigating schools for alleged antisemitic discrimination and harassment, slashing federal funding for those that seemingly allowed on-campus anti-Israel protests since the Hamas-led attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023. One of those schools was Columbia University, which changed its protest policies, expanded its Jewish studies program, placed the school's Middle Eastern studies program under new supervision and altered student disciplinary procedures to avoid losing $400 million in federal funding. PRINCETON EVENT WITH FORMER ISRAELI PM NAFTALI BENNETT DISRUPTED BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS \"We began to see precipitous threats to funding streams early on in the new presidential administration,\" Eisgruber told Abrams. \"Then a couple of weeks ago, something happened at Columbia that introduced a new, and, in my view, very dangerous element to this, which is that the government came in, and without any due process or any apparent investigation, said … ‘We’re going to take away a bunch of your grants … and we’re not going to restore them to you unless you do things like admissions reform.'\" TRUMP ADMIN CUTS $4M IN PRINCETON FUNDING RELATED TO CLIMATE RESEARCH Eisgruber discussed the importance of \"academic freedom\" before Abrams asked about the validity of the administration's concerns about antisemitism on college campuses. Eisgruber acknowledged there \"were some serious problems with antisemitism on that campus\" and said standing against antisemitism is \"a fundamental responsibility for any university president and for any university,\" but he accused the government of neglecting due process. \"They should be allowing universities to respond and offer their side of the story,\" he said. \"And then they should be putting in place, if they find that there are violations, appropriate remedies that are tailored to the violations and to the law.\" They had the discussion as rumors swirled about the Trump administration pursuing a legal arrangement, or consent decree, that would order Columbia University to comply with executive directives on antisemitism from Trump. Under former President Joe Biden, multiple universities, including Brown and Rutgers, signed similar decrees over antisemitism concerns after the Hamas terrorist attack in Israeli, The Wall Street Journal reported. IVY LEAGUE ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL DENIES ALLEGATIONS AS JUDGE AWAITS DEPORTATION EVIDENCE Yet, when Abrams asked if Eisgruber would cave if Trump said he would cut funding unless a specific department was placed under academic receivership, he said he would not make concessions. \"We would not do that,\" he said. \"We believe that would be unlawful, and we would contest that in court. … I really think we all need to be speaking up right now.\" VIDEO SHOWS ARREST OF COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL The episode was released one day after news broke that the Trump administration had cut $4 million in funding related to climate research for Princeton University. Princeton received $455 million in federal funding during fiscal year 2024, which includes funding for the Department of Energy national laboratory, which it operates for the government.

Devaluation will significantly impact China’s efforts, including its goal of internationalising the yuan and making it a reserve currency,” Lee said.\n\nHe added that a weaker yuan would give Hongkongers more incentive to seek out cheaper goods in mainland China, increasing the likelihood of more cross-border shopping.\n“Hong Kong’s retail performance, especially that of non-luxury goods, has weakened since the final quarter of 2024. This coincided with mainland China’s roll-out of expanded consumption [subsidy] measures, which may have cannibalised mainland tourists’ consumption in Hong Kong,” Lee said.\nChina and the United States are locking horns in a trade war after US President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on its trade partners.\nOn April 2, Trump issued an executive order to impose an additional 34 per cent tariff on China that also applied to Hong Kong. But following tit-for-tat increases between Beijing and Washington, the tariff level is now 145 per cent.\n“As Hong Kong exports to the US are also subject to the same tariffs as those from mainland China, this will be a drag and exert downside risks on the government’s GDP growth forecast,” Carlos Casanova, a senior economist for Asia at Swiss-based private bank Union Bancaire Privee, said.\nOn Saturday, COCO Park shopping centre in Shenzhen’s Futian district was bustling with shoppers, including those from Hong Kong.\n\nGigi Au was among the Hongkongers. She came to Shenzhen to get her glasses changed and to grab a meal with her boyfriend Tony So.\nThe couple, who visit the mainland up to two times each month, usually spend about HK$100 (US$12.90) to HK$200 each trip on food and drinks.\n“The reason we spend our money on the mainland is because the prices are cheaper compared with Hong Kong, and there are also more options,” So said.\nAu said she would shop for bigger ticket items if the yuan depreciated further and made a bigger difference in prices.\nOthers visiting the Shenzhen shopping centre on Saturday included 37-year-old salesman Marco Hung and his wife.\nHung said the devaluation of the yuan had made him more eager to shop on online mainland platforms as he could compare prices easily and make greater savings without the need to cross the border.\nA retailer at the shopping centre also felt upbeat about the effects of a weaker currency and expected to see more Hong Kong shoppers.\n“I think there would be more Hongkongers coming to the mainland with the yuan getting even cheaper,” said Yu Wei, the owner of a record store. “Compared with Hong Kong, the cost of goods on the mainland is lower.”\n\nAccording to Yu, one-third of his customers were from Hong Kong, while the rest were from the mainland.\nYuen Chun-kit, 38, an engineer who visits Shenzhen from Friday to Sunday every weekend for dining, nightlife and entertainment, said an even weaker yuan was more favourable to him.\n“If I buy a mobile phone case, it might cost HK$60 in Hong Kong, but it costs as low as HK$20 or even less on mainland online shopping platforms,” Yuen said.\n“A devalued yuan might not be significant for cheaper items, but it will be more significant on big-ticket items and services,” Yuen said.\n“An even more devalued yuan means I can shop for more with the Hong Kong dollars I have.”\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has lowered its 2025 gross domestic product growth forecast for Hong Kong to 1.3 per cent, which is lower than the city government’s forecast of 2 to 3 per cent.\nHong Kong’s retail sales contracted for 12 months in a row in February, down by 13 per cent year on year to HK$29.4 billion (US$3.8 billion).","summary":"Beijing’s stimulus roll-out may also trigger more mainland consumption at the expense of Hong Kong’s retail, dining scene.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3306309/weaker-yuan-boon-hong-kong-shoppers-bane-citys-retail-analysts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/12/cda4eb96-fb3a-404a-98f9-078c9434ed64_96f9c816.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 01:00:21","author":"Denise Tsang,Harvey Kong,Oscar Liu","authors":["Denise Tsang","Harvey Kong","Oscar Liu"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.111},{"id":310557092,"title":"Democrats dislike the ‘chaos’ of Trump’s trade war but are OK with some tariffs","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats are quick to say that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are horrible, awful, terrible. But Democrats are also stressing that they are not inherently anti-tariff.\n\nWhat Trump’s political opponents say they really dislike is the “chaos” he has unleashed.\n\n“Tariffs are an important tool in our economic toolbox,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. “Trump is creating chaos, and that chaos undercuts our economy and our families, both in the short term and the long term. … He’s just created a worldwide hurricane, and that’s not good for anyone.”\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Democrats have a consensus around “a unified concept, which is targeted tariffs can work, across the board tariffs are bad.”\n\n“The right targeting is in the eye of the beholder, but nobody on our side thinks zero tariffs ever,” Kaine said.\n\nThe Democrats’ message is meant to convey that they are reasonable, focused on capable governance and attuned to financial market distress. It’s a pitch toward swing voters who would like to see more manufacturing yet are uncomfortable with the consequences of Trump’s approach to tariffs. The risk is that it also is a nuanced argument at a time when pithy critiques travel faster and spread wider on social media than do measured policy analyses.\n\nTo the Trump White House, that message is nothing but hypocrisy.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday noted that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who would later become House speaker, was warning in June 1996 that trade with China meant higher trade deficits and job losses.\n\n“It is about nothing less than our economic future, our national security and our democratic principles,” said Pelosi before the House voted to not overturn then Democratic President Bill Clinton’s decision to extend most-favored-nation trade status for China for another year.\n\nThe Trump administration views those remarks as evidence that Democrats actually back what Trump is doing, despite their stated opposition.\n\n“Everyone in Washington, whether they want to admit it or not, knows that this president is right when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to trade,” Leavitt told reporters. “Nancy Pelosi can thank President Trump today.”\n\nNot all Democrats have threaded the needle cleanly.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer gave a speech in Washington on Wednesday calling for tariffs to be used like a “scalpel.” Hours later, she was in the Oval Office with Trump — in a moment caught on video — as the president signed directives for the Justice Department to investigate two of his public critics and gave noncommittal musings on tariff negotiations.\n\nWhitmer’s office later said in a statement that she was “surprised” that she was brought in for the event after a meeting with Trump and that “her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”\n\nTrump this month unilaterally imposed sweeping tariffs on China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea, among dozens of other nations.\n\nBut on Wednesday, he suspended most of the tariffs for 90 days while applying a baseline import tax of 10% to most nations, a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a tariff of as much as 25% on Mexico and Canada. There are also tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more planned on specific products.\n\nThe tariffs are expected to generate hundreds of billions of dollars annually in new revenues, but an average U.S. household could see disposable income fall by more than $4,000 as importers and companies pass along the costs of the levies.\n\nInterest rates on the U.S. debt are rising as investors worry about the soundness of Trump’s policies. Major stock indexes are down and consumer sentiment is at its second lowest level in the history of the University of Michigan survey.\n\nSome Democrats are trying to keep the focus on their constituents, resurrecting talking points from Trump’s tariff battles during his first term.\n\n“Farmers, in particular, who were hit very hard by Trump’s last trade wars, are terrified that this may be existential to their businesses,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. “These are mostly small and medium-sized family farms. Their input costs are going to go up and their export markets are going to close down.”\n\nRep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., said the tariffs would be “catastrophic” for urban and rural communities alike in her state. But Moore added that Democrats should still advocate for raising labor and product standards to keep American goods and services competitive in global markets.\n\n“I know that many of our autoworkers were lured into voting for Donald Trump because they thought perhaps he was going to give them some relief,” said Moore. “But the prices of cars are going to go up because the component parts are everywhere. There’s no strategy for it.”\n\nBut not all Democrats want to hedge their response to Trump’s trade tools.\n\n“I’m a little uninterested in what the Democratic response should be like,” said Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii. “Trump is intentionally destroying the American economy, and I think we should just say that and not make it very complicated.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

According to a statement from the White House, further discussions are scheduled for next weekend. \n\nThe meeting between U.S. Special Envoy Steven Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was the initial face-to-face encounter since President Donald Trump returned to office, amid Iran’s continued expansion of its nuclear program.\n\nThe White House characterized the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” and expressed “deep thanks to the Sultanate of Oman for its support of this initiative.”\n\nWitkoff, joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima, told Araghchi Trump had personally instructed him to try to resolve differences through diplomacy, if possible. \n\n“All the options are not only on the table. They’re all deployed to the Middle East,” Grant said. “Somewhere between four and six B-2 stealth bombers [are] forward in Diego Garcia, [along with] two aircraft carriers. That has really gotten Iran’s attention.”\n\nGrant said Iran now faces a choice. \n\n“Iran either has to talk or get their nuclear facilities bombed,” she said.\n\nTensions between the two countries have been high since 2018, when Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal. \n\nThat agreement placed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, Iran has been enriching uranium at much higher levels. The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is enriching uranium to 60% purity, just below weapons-grade, and has stockpiled over 18,000 pounds of it. Under the original deal, Iran was limited to 3.67% purity and a much smaller stockpile.\n\nWhile U.S. intelligence agencies do not believe Iran has started building a nuclear weapon, they warn the country is getting closer to being able to do so if it decides to.\n\nGen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, said Iran’s leaders now believe Trump is serious about using military force if they don’t agree to limit Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“They’ve come to the conclusion that the president is dead serious about supporting an Israeli-led, U.S.-supported strike on Iran to take down their nuclear enterprise,” Keane said.\n\nGrant explained that the U.S. and its allies are ready for such a strike if talks fail. \n\n“Israel took out a lot of Iran’s air defenses last year,” she said. “Then you have two [U.S.] carriers, land-based fighters in the region and B-2 bombers with bunker-busting bombs. That’s the threat display.”\n\nShe added that Iran has no real need to enrich uranium since it can buy nuclear fuel on the open market. \n\n“It is time for them to start to make a deal,” she said. “And I think, maybe, due to our military pressure and Trump’s resolve, they’re beginning to realize it.”\n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has said he’s not open to direct negotiations on the nuclear program but has also blamed the United States for breaking past promises. \n\n“They must prove that they can build trust,” Pezeshkian said in a recent Cabinet meeting.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei warned of consequences if threats continue. \n\n“Violence breeds violence, peace begets peace,” he wrote on social media. “The US can choose the course… and concede to consequences.”\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News no deal can happen unless Iran gives up its nuclear weapons plans. \n\n“We have to fully, verifiably eliminate their nuclear weapons program for there to be any agreement,” he said. “All we ask is that they behave like a normal nation.”\n\nGrant said any future deal will need strict terms. \n\n“It’s going to have to include real inspections,” she said. “It’s going to have to include them giving up, frankly, some of that enriched uranium. There will have to be some limits on their ballistic missile development.”\n\nThe two nations are scheduled to meet again April 19 in Oman, according to the White House statement.\n\nFox News Digital’s Bradford Betz and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmerican and Iranian officials convened for a first round of direct talks&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s team engages in productive in-person nuclear discussions with Iran, plans to reconvene next weekend. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trumps-team-engages-in-productive-in-person-nuclear-discussions-with-iran-plans-to-reconvene-next-weekend/","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/1200/675/khamenei-trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 00:54:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":310556876,"title":"RUTH SUNDERLAND: Proud steelmen like generations of my family boast they built the world.

The fortunes of the industry have played out in our family and shaped all our lives.\n\nDad was one of the last people to leave Head Wrightson, which made bridges found around the world, when it closed in the late 1980s.\n\nMy cousin Andrew followed his father Malcolm into the Redcar steelworks when he left school and lost his job there a decade ago when the Thai owners shut it down.\n\nThe threat of that fate is now looming over the 2,700 workers at Scunthorpe and, sadly, I am not surprised.\n\nAt the time of the 2019 sale of British Steel to Jingye, a Chinese conglomerate, I warned that the deal offered only false hope.\n\nThere is zero pleasure in seeing my prophecies of disaster come true.\n\nThe takeover was waved through in the middle of Boris Johnson's 2019 election campaign. \n\nHelpfully to the Conservatives, it averted the loss of thousands of jobs in a Red Wall constituency.\n\nThen, I advocated the government should at least try to protect UK interests by keeping a golden share and taking a seat on the board. The predatory deal was given a green light with no such safeguards.\n\nJohnson's government appeared to take it at face value when Li Ganpo, the former Communist Party official turned chairman of Jingye, turned on the treacle hose.\n\nHe promised to 'create a splendid future' with an open chequebook for investment – words that now sound as cold as the blast furnaces without a bailout.\n\nPoliticians turned a blind eye to the fact the Chinese had helped eviscerate our industry by dumping cheap steel on world markets.\n\nNor would they admit what was staring them in the face: that British Steel would be a Trojan horse for China, allowing it access to our know-how and skills, with the option of discarding the plant and workers down the line.\n\nAnd so it has proved, leaving the Government with little choice but to nationalise British Steel, which is no doubt the last thing Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to do at this juncture.\n\nThe country's finances are on a knife-edge and the tax burden is already at its highest since the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nLoading the national balance sheet with an open-ended liability to keep the steel industry going is an unappetising prospect.\n\nSaving Scunthorpe, however, goes beyond questions of profitability. It is too important to fail – just as the banks were in the financial crisis. \n\nBritain cannot leave itself the only member of the G7 unable to produce its own steel.\n\nSadly, our industry has been the victim of poor and unscrupulous ownership for decades.\n\nPrior to Jingye, British Steel had been owned by private equity firm Greybull Capital, which bought the business in 2016 for £1 and whose stewardship was widely criticised.\n\nProducers have also been hobbled by Net Zero mania. Steel-makers here pay nearly 50 per cent more for electricity than those in France and Germany and are calling on the Government to set a price cap.\n\nSteel has also been stigmatised by a cultural contempt for industry. \n\nIt has been fashionable among the bien-pensant elite to brand steel as dirty, basic and unnecessary in a modern, high-tech economy – they see it as a rather regrettable activity that takes place in poorer towns far from their bijoux London haunts.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was interviewed for a job where two of the men on the panel sneered at the idea that the steel industry was worth saving, and at me for daring to argue otherwise.\n\nThis is not about sentimentality or harking back to a mythical lost industrial past.\n\nIf we don't have the ability to make our own steel, we cannot hope to keep this country secure, let alone prosperous, in an increasingly threatening world.\n\nNationalisation is not a route I would normally advocate but when there is a national emergency, which this is, then it is the sensible option.\n\nLabour will no doubt hope this is a short-term solution and may wish to find a buyer or at least a commercial partner.\n\nMinisters should be cognisant, though, that the worst possible outcome at this point is yet another awful owner. \n\nAny new scavengers who come knocking at the door must be given short shrift.\n\nNaturally at this point the focus is on the financial downside. But that is not the whole story.\n\nIt is not all cost – there is also a huge opportunity.\n\nThe Government does recognise this and published a steel strategy earlier this year. We need steel for our defence industry, green energy infrastructure, for new rail lines – and we can make it here, instead of importing it from abroad.\n\nEd Miliband, in his zeal for Net Zero, ought to take note that enormous amounts of steel will be needed if we are to move to environmentally friendly energy sources including new nuclear.\n\nOffshore wind alone will need 25 million tonnes of steel between now and 2050, which is a potential £21 billion market for UK producers. Government, now and in the future, can play a big role in this by adopting a 'Buy British' approach to procurement.\n\nThe industry itself is becoming greener with the use of new steel-making techniques. The UK has a chance to take the lead on this – but that will not happen if we lose our capacity.\n\nIt will probably surprise many to learn that the steel industry still employs 34,000 people and supports another 40,000 in the supply chain.\n\nTrue, this is a fraction of the numbers working in steel in the glory years, but these are well-paid jobs in relatively poor communities.\n\nThere is a very heavy human and economic toll – as my family knows all too well – when they are lost.\n\nIf we can make UK steel great again, it will give the country a cadre of highly skilled and valuable workers, not just operating furnaces but in advanced research and development.\n\nTeessiders like to boast that we built the world with our steel, from the girders in Churchill's War Rooms to Canary Wharf and Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nIt's just possible, if we learn the right lessons from this debacle, that we could do so again.","summary":"RUTH SUNDERLAND: The US President has an idiosyncratic grasp of economics, to put it tactfully, but when he declared in, 'If you don't have steel, you don't have a country', he was correct.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14603565/RUTH-SUNDERLAND-Proud-steelmen-boast-built-world-learn-right-lessons.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/13/01/97198961-0-British_Steel_plans_to_close_its_two_blast_furnaces_and_steelmak-a-67_1744504970407.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 00:53:10","author":"Editor,Ruth Sunderland","authors":["Editor","Ruth Sunderland"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":310555724,"title":"Gretchen Whitmer’s Awkward White House Photo Becomes Internet Sensation","text":"Michigan Gov.

Now, all the focus is on her bad reaction. If you’re going to meet Trump, own it, and say what you are doing is worthwhile. \n\nPolitics is about talking with the other side. If he’s actually acknowledging her, she should have doubled down on how that makes her more worthy than the other likely candidates for 2028. That would have been the way to approach it. But she didn’t, she put folders in front of her face; she looks silly to people on all sides of the aisle now, and she may have just done in her 2028 hopes with that picture. \n\nThe story was she thought it was going to be a one-on-one meeting, and didn’t realize the press might be there; she also didn’t want anyone to think she was endorsing the executive orders that he signed while she was there. But the press is always all over Trump and if she’s going to the White House, she can expect it’s going to be reported on. If you don’t agree with what he signed, you can say that without hiding. \n\nIf she’s too afraid to let her Democrat base know she is meeting with Trump, how cowardly is she?The problem is that the Democrats have painted themselves into such a corner with Trump, declaring him “Hitler,” that they can’t even do normal things like talk to him about business matters.\n\nOne Democratic operative who generally supports her termed her presence a “disaster.”\n\nCNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere called the moment a “huge embarrassment,” while CNN host Audie Cornish said bluntly, “This does not look like the politics of resistance.” \n\nAnd they weren’t even talking about the “hiding” picture.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., wrote about his experience with Mounjaro (tirzepatide).\n\nThe injectable prescription medicine is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes. \n\nFetterman was prescribed the medication in July 2024.\n\n“As a stroke survivor, I was interested in studies showing [Mounjaro] could significantly reduce the risk of major cardiac events,” the senator wrote.\n\n“Even though I started taking it for my heart health, I’ve been struck by how much better it has made me feel across the board. It’s made a significant impact on my overall health,” he continued. \n\n“Aches, pains and stiffness have vanished. Physically, I feel a decade younger, as well as clearer-headed and more optimistic than I’d been in years. As far as side effects, I’ve also lost around 20 pounds.”\n\nBeyond lowering blood sugar, GLP-1 medications have also been linked to a range of other benefits, including improved heart health, neurological function and metabolic health, as Fox News Digital has reported.\n\nEli Lilly, maker of Mounjaro, also offers another version of the drug called Zepbound, which is the same medication approved for weight loss, chronic weight management and sleep apnea. \n\nOther GLP-1 medications include Ozempic, Wegovy, Victoza, Saxenda, all made by Novo Nordisk.\n\nFetterman noted that GLP-1 drugs have been found to have beneficial effects on cholesterol, heart rate and heart inflammation. \n\n“Some recent studies suggest they might even help curb alcohol addiction and support cognitive function, potentially slowing or preventing conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s,” he wrote in the Times op-ed.\n\n“Physically, I feel a decade younger, as well as clearer-headed and more optimistic than I’d been in years.”\n\nIn the op-ed, Fetterman called for expanded access to these medications, which can cost up to $1,000 out of pocket if not covered by insurance.\n\n“Currently, Medicare covers these drugs only under specific circumstances, such as for diabetes or heightened heart risk,” he wrote. “And Medicaid coverage is even more limited.”\n\nFetterman added that he was not compensated for sharing his experience.\n\n“I’m just a guy who has benefited from these medications and wants to make sure that anyone else who could benefit from them can have access to them, too,” he wrote.\n\nWhile Fetterman shares HHS Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s views of prioritizing nutrition and healthy living, he said he believes the medications are necessary for some.\n\n“I fully agree that diet and lifestyle matter — a lot. But diet alone isn’t enough,” he wrote. \n\n“For the millions of Americans struggling with serious health issues, medication can be a crucial first step to regaining enough control of their health to begin making meaningful lifestyle changes.”\n\nDoctors discuss benefits and access\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News’ senior medical analyst, noted that semaglutides, including Ozempic and Wegovy, are “very important drugs” for type 2 diabetes, with increasing use for obesity. \n\n“Though these drugs appear to have beneficial uses for the heart and lipid profile — and also the brain and decreasing dementia risk — studies are ongoing and more data is still needed,” he told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe first approach to obesity is lifestyle changes, including exercise, improved diet and optimal sleep, Siegel said.\n\n“Having said that, these weight-loss drugs (including Zepbound) are also good tools when lifestyle is not enough,” he noted. \n\n“They help prevent down-the-line diseases such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and sleep apnea, which tend to come from obesity.”\n\nHe added, “Overall, we are saving the healthcare system money, so I would like to see Medicare and Medicaid approve them for diabetes and weight loss.”\n\nDr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurologist and longevity expert, said he’s been prescribing GLP-1s to his patients since 2019.\n\n“Mounjaro and its cousins aren’t just weight-loss tools — they’re metabolic reset buttons,” he told Fox News Digital.\n\n“People with metabolic syndrome don’t need lectures on kale and the importance of exercise. They need help.” \n\nOsborn agreed that lifestyle is essential, but is “rarely sufficient.”\n\n“GLP-1s give patients momentum by getting the ball rolling,” he said. “And when that happens, health habits are formed. Diet improves. Movement improves. People start to feel the benefits of healthy living.”\n\nOsborn noted that these medications aren’t cosmetic, but therapeutic. \n\n“I’ve seen what they can do firsthand: reductions in body fat, inflammation, glucose, triglycerides and insulin resistance — and with those, significant reductions in the incidence of stroke and heart attack.”\n\n“I believe this is a signal aimed squarely at Big Pharma.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration recently announced that Medicare and Medicaid would not cover the medications, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said late Friday.\n\nOsborn said the move to block coverage likely doesn’t have to do with efficacy.\n\n“Trump knows these medications work,” Osborn said. “I believe this is a signal aimed squarely at Big Pharma: ‘Lower the price, or Medicare, the biggest buyer on the block, is out.’”\n\n“This isn’t a dismissal — it’s leverage,” Osborn said, stating his opinion on the matter. “President Trump will likely negotiate until the ‘price is right,’ disempowering Big Pharma while concomitantly bettering the health of Americans.”","summary":"A U.S. senator said a GLP-1 drug changed his life — and now he's calling for widespread access to anti-obesity medications.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/12/us-news/senator-john-fetterman-says-mounjaro-makes-him-feel-a-decade-younger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102553896.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gdsFwgmf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-13 00:52:34","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":310563412,"title":"Trump mocks world leaders cowering to him to make trade deal","text":"1.

Hill said on her podcast she was \"disappointed\" with the Dodgers for heading to our nation’s capital, and she brought up recent news of Jackie Robinson’s military service being briefly taken down from the Department of Defense’s website. \"I’m not surprised the Dodgers went to the White House, but I’m still disappointed they chose to [mingle] with the president, whose administration just recently tried to literally erase Jackie Robinson’s [legacy],\" Hill explained. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"The people who are dedicated to erasing history do so because they actually want to repeat it. So, the Trump administration’s efforts to erase Jackie Robinson is on brand. When they did that, you would think you would have heard a loud and angry response from the Dodgers. Instead, you heard [crickets].\" While Hill implies the Trump administration deliberately tried to erase Robinson’s military record from the site, the Department of Defense told OutKick the department had instructed employees to flag all DEI content for removal through artificial intelligence, though staffers were given just one week to complete the task. EAGLES' CELEBRATION AT TRUMP WHITE HOUSE A ‘GOOD THING,’ TEAM OWNER SAYS Because of the short timeline, mistakes were made throughout the process, which includes the Robinson article, which had \"DEI\" in its URL. Sean Parnell, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, confirmed the OutKick report with a statement. \"Without question, this task was an arduous but incredibly important undertaking. We enforced an aggressive timeline for our DOD services and agencies to comb through a vast array of content, while ensuring that our force remains ready and lethal,\" Parnell said. \"Every now and then, because of the reality of AI tools and other software, some important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed.\" ESPN was first to report Robinson’s military service was removed from the DOD's website. The department restored the article shortly after the report surfaced. Later this month, the Philadelphia Eagles are heading to the White House to visit Trump. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, who has donated to Democrats in the past, called it a \"time-honored tradition\" to be invited to the White House, via Pro Football Talk. \"So, there was no reticence whatsoever,\" Lurie added. \"To be celebrated at the White House is a good thing. There were special circumstances (in 2018) that were very different, and so this was kind of an obvious choice and look forward to it.

And, so, we didn’t have that opportunity and now we do.

ZELLER and JAMES VITUSCKA FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:34 BST, 13 April 2025 |Updated:01:41 BST, 13 April 2025 \n\nBen Affleck’s daughter Violet was all smiles as she reunited with mom Jennifer Garner in New York City on Saturday, looking every bit the beaming college kid enjoying a break from campus life.\nThe 19-year-old Yale student lit up the Manhattan streets, towering over her mom in a cream puffer jacket and flared jeans, while Garner, 52, bundled up in a classic navy trench coat against the brisk spring chill. \nWhile Violet and Jen enjoyed their time together in the busy streets of New York, Ben was spotted back on the West Coast bonding with son Samuel during a low-key shopping trip in Santa Monica.\nDressed casually in a plaid shirt and cargo pants, the 52-year-old Accountant star grabbed coffee with his 12-year-old son Samuel, whom he shares with ex wife Garner—along with Violet and 16-year-old Fin. \nThe bonding sessions come on the heels of DailyMail.com's bombshell report that Violet has intentionally distanced herself from former stepmom Jennifer Lopez, after allegedly feeling like a 'pawn' in the unraveling of Lopez’s marriage to Affleck.\nWhen J.Lo and Affleck quietly split last summer, people were surprised to see Violet still hanging out with the singer—joining her in the Hamptons and even posting about a visit from J.Lo’s sister at Yale. \n\nBen Affleck ’s daughter Violet was all smiles as she reunited with mom Jennifer Garner in New York City on Saturday, looking every bit the beaming college kid enjoying a break from campus life\n\nThe 19-year-old Yale student lit up the Manhattan streets, towering over her mom in a cream puffer jacket and flared jeans, while Garner bundled up in a classic navy trench coat against the brisk spring chill\n\nWhile Violet and Jen enjoyed their time together in the busy streets of New York, Ben was spotted back on the West Coast bonding with son Samuel during a low-key shopping trip in Santa Monica\nBut sources say that by the time the divorce was finalized in January, Violet had started questioning whether those connections were ever really genuine. \n 'Violet felt like she was used as a pawn so to speak during her dad’s split from JLo,' an insider exclusively told DailyMail.com. \nThe source shared that Garner made a conscious effort not to interfere with Violet’s relationship with Lopez’s family, explaining, 'Jen supported her daughter getting close to the singer because she always puts her children first.'\n'But as the divorce loomed, the fact that Violet was hanging out with JLo and wearing her clothes was odd to the family. So too was Lynda Lopez visiting Violet at college.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE Ben Affleck's daughter Violet cuts contact with Jennifer Lopez after discovering 'ulterior motive' \nThe source continued: 'But Jen even let this slide, because she wants Violet to be happy and respects that, as an adult, she can choose who to spend her time with even if Jen does not necessarily agree.'\nViolet has intentionally distanced herself from Lopez after sensing how deeply the divorce affected her father, with a source noting she remains a 'daddy’s girl' at heart. \nBennifer 2.0 made headlines when they gave their love story a second shot in 2021, nearly two decades after calling off their first engagement.\nDespite two lavish weddings in 2022, the rekindled romance fizzled fast, with the pair now officially divorced.\nBefore things fell apart, Affleck was frequently seen with ex-wife Garner, who insiders say had stepped in as an unofficial 'marriage counselor' during the couple’s rocky final chapter.\n\nBen shares Samuel with ex wife Garner—along with Violet and 16-year-old Fin\n\nThe actor held a tense look on his face\n\nThe star made a pit stop at the Paper Source retailer\n\nThe bonding sessions come on the heels of DailyMail.com's bombshell report that Violet has intentionally distanced herself from former stepmom Jennifer Lopez , after allegedly feeling like a 'pawn' in the unraveling of Lopez’s marriage to Affleck\n\nViolet took a step back from her former stepmom Jennifer Lopez after being left feeling like she had been a 'pawn' (seen in July 2022)\n\nShe the raised eyebrows last fall after Jlo's sister Lynda Lopez shared a selfie with the Yale student after paying her a visit at the prestigious university \n\nJen and Ben share Violet, 19, Fin, 16, and Samuel, 12, with Affleck; (pictured 2018)\nSources close to Garner had been left feeling like she was forced to 'play mediator' to help the pair work through their issues in a way that would not impact Affleck's sobriety.\n'Jen feels slightly used as a pawn in JLo's bid to repair her marriage,' a source told DailyMail.com at the time. 'She doesn't believe it was intentional. But when Jen realized her ex-husband's marriage was past the point of salvation, her only concern was Ben's well-being and sobriety.'\nMeanwhile, Violet was seen showing support to Lopez during that time period, choosing to wear a Dolce and Gabbana dress that The Wedding Planner star wore on a Valentine's Day date with Affleck in 2023.\nViolet reportedly wore the dress as a statement to show how close she was to Lopez after being left ‘heartbroken’ at the split.\nBen AffleckJennifer Garner\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBen Affleck's daughter Violet, 19, towers over mom Jennifer Garner in NYC after 'distancing herself' from JLo\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:24 BST, 13 April 2025 |Updated:01:39 BST, 13 April 2025 \n\nNicola Adams has revealed the real reason she has split from her OnlyFans star girlfriend Ella Baig. \nThe boxer, 42, and model, 27, ended their romance last month despite attempting to resolve any potential differences via couples' therapy. \nAnd now the sports star has confirmed it was Ella's career as an OnlyFans model, which included posing nude snaps and engaging in explicit chat, which took its toll on the relationship. \nNicola explained: 'I have always been incredibly supportive of Ella's career and the choices she has made, including her work on OnlyFans.' \nShe added: 'However, as much as I respect what she does, I can't deny that it has had an impact on our relationship.'\nNicola admitted there have been challenging times as they navigate the break up, especially when co-parenting their son. \n\nNicola Adams, 42, has revealed the reason she split from her OnlyFans model girlfriend Ella Baig, 27, of seven years following months of therapy\n\nThe sports star explained her OnlyFans career was the problem: 'However, as much as I respect what she does, I can't deny that it has had an impact on our relationship'\nThe couple began dating in 2018 after meeting each other on a night out - and they subsequently opted to use fertility treatments in order to have their first and only child with the egg fertilised by a sperm donor who resembled Ella.\nElla carried the baby and gave birth a month early via caesarean section - with their son Taylor being born in July 2022.\nConfessing they have both been to therapy she added: 'Right now, we're navigating this as openly and honestly as possible, with the priority being our little boy.' \nNicola also explained the split has been a gradual process and they tried months of therapy before calling it quits. \nShe explained that after the therapy sessions, both separately and together, they tried to heal their trauma but then decided it would be easier to split. \nYet the star made it clear that future dating isn't on her mind right now and she isn't looking for a rebound but would rather just focus on her work and being a mum. \nSpeaking at the time of their split a spokesman for Nicola said: 'Nicola and Ella have shared an incredible journey together, full of love, growth, and resilience.\n'After much thoughtful reflection and important therapy work, they have made the difficult decision to separate.\n\nThe boxer, 42, and model, 27, ended their romance last month despite attempting to resolve any potential differences via couples' therapy\n\nThe couple opted to use fertility treatments in order to have their first and only child with the egg fertilised by a sperm donor who resembled Ella (pictured October 2022) \n'Their priority remains their son, Taylor, and they are committed to co-parenting with love and respect.'\nAccording to a report from The Sun, a source close to Nicola and Ella said: 'They really tried to make it work, especially for the sake of their son, and even went to couples' therapy, but came to the conclusion that they were better off separating.\n'They still have a lot of love for each other, and great memories, but are focused on being brilliant co-parents.'\nAdams shot to fame in 2012 after winning gold at her home Olympics, becoming the first female boxer to ever win a medal at the Games, before going on to defend her title at Rio 2016. \nAfter winning the WBO flyweight title in 2019, she retired later that year but returned to the public eye with an appearance in the 18th series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2020. \nFeaturing as part of the programme's first same-sex couple alongside professional Katya Jones - the pair were forced to withdraw from the show in its fourth week after Jones tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicola Adams, 42, reveals the reason she split from OnlyFans model girlfriend, 27, of seven years following months of therapy\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

As per a CNN report, around 50 Department of Homeland Security employees have been subjected to lie detector examinations, including a FEMA administrator and approximately a dozen officials from the emergency management agency, in efforts to put an end to the spillage of consequential national security details. Insiders briefed on the matter revealed that at least one individual has been placed on administrative leave and was escorted from the agency's premises this week post-polygraph testing. \"We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment, or status as a career civil servant,\" commented DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in an email communication to the news outlet. \"We will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,\" McLaughlin asserted with assurance. There is rising apprehension that these lie detector tests might target federal personnel even for disclosing unclassified information to the press – concerns intensified by the fact that, according to insiders, FEMA deals with classified intelligence quite infrequently. Whistleblower advocacy groups conversing with journalists have expressed their misgivings, terming the polygraph usage as out of the ordinary, disconcerting, and possibly against the law. All this scrutiny falls on the backdrop of reports stating that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had pledged to \"eliminate FEMA\" as the hurricane season looms on the horizon. CNN has also dropped a bombshell report revealing that top dogs from FEMA and Homeland Security huddled together last month to chew over the fate of the disaster relief agency, including how they might go about shutting it down. The high-stakes meeting saw the likes of Noem, FEMA's Acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton, and Corey Lewandowski – a staunch Donald Trump confidant – mull over scrapping the executive order that breathed life into a FEMA Review Council, reports the Mirror US . Insiders are whispering that if this order gets axed, it could spell a swift end for the agency. This potential move is just the latest in a series of jabs and uppercuts that have put FEMA on the ropes, sparking worry about whether it can duke it out with the upcoming hurricane season. \"March is typically when we're finalising hurricane plans. A lot of that got paused,\" spilled a FEMA official who's in the trenches of disaster response. \"So, it's already having an impact, which is that we're not preparing.\" In a previous scoop, the outlet revealed that FEMA's workforce was hit with an email dubbed \"Hiring Update,\" laying down the law that new hires would now need a thumbs-up from Secretary Noem's squad to stay on board beyond their current 2- to 4-year stints. A leaked memo also revealed that the majority of public-facing jobs at FEMA that are critical for disaster response aid to communities are currently under scrutiny. These roles, known for their hands-on approach in times of crisis, encompass a wide array of duties from assessing damage post-disaster to managing recovery hubs and aiding victims in the registration process for assistance. According to one FEMA insider: \"It's practically everybody that goes out in the field,\" and \"They are the backbone of the response, particularly in sustaining operations.\" The review majorly affects those in positions such as the Cadre of On-Call Response Employees (CORE), Reservists, Local Hires, and Temporary Full-time Employees. The Government Accountability Office released figures that highlight CORE and Reservists forming about 74% of FEMA's workforce. Another official at FEMA disclosed: \"I think their terms will be allowed to expire, and they won't be renewed,\" Furthermore, the official voiced a deep concern: \"I don't know that it will really be felt until something big and bad happens. And I think the really scary thing is that states are now afraid to complain, because they're afraid of what the fallout will be.\" One worker expressed their frustration, saying that rather than gearing up for the hurricane season, they've been bogged down with administrative tasks. \"It's now a fear of, what else?\" they lamented. \"Are we able to get back to work and focus? Our feeling is, no, there will be something else that will pop up that's going to require a lot of our attention.\"","summary":"At least one top FEMA agent is among dozens of federal employees who were forced to undergo a lie detector test after allegedly leaking several DHS plans, according to reports","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/government-administers-lie-detector-tests-35046117","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35046115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 00:34:40","author":"Jack Hobbs,Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Jack Hobbs","Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":310555730,"title":"Major Funding Cuts Lead to Staff Layoffs at American TV Channel Broadcasting to the Middle East","text":"CAIRO – The head of a U.S.-funded Arabic-language television and online news outlet that claims a 30 million-strong audience in the Middle East and North Africa terminated most staff and curtailed TV programming Saturday, accusing the Trump administration and Elon Musk of having “irresponsibly and unlawfully” cut off funding.\n\nIn notices to Al Hurra news staffers about their dismissals, chief Jeffrey Gedmin said he had given up on the U.S. administration’s freeze lifting anytime soon for the congressionally approved money for Al Hurra and its U.S.-funded Arabic language sister organizations.\n\nGedmin accused Kari Lake, President Donald Trump’s appointee to the American government agency overseeing Al Hurra, Voice of America and other U.S.-funded news programming abroad, of dodging his efforts to speak with her about the funding cutoff.\n\n“I’m left to conclude that she is deliberately starving us of the money we need to pay you, our dedicated and hard-working staff,” Gedmin said in severance letters obtained by The Associated Press and excerpted on the website of Al Hurra’s parent company, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\n\nMohamed al-Sabagh, an Egyptian journalist working at the Al Hurra news website in Dubai, told the AP that all the staff in the website and the television channel received emails terminating their contracts.\n\nAl-Hurra is the latest U.S. government-funded news outlet — after Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and others — to cut staff and services amid what the outlets say is the move by the Trump administration and Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to withhold their congressional appropriations.\n\nLake, appointed to oversee the U.S. Agency for Global Media, describes her agency as being consumed by a “giant rot” that requires the agency’s destruction and rebuilding.\n\nThe U.S.-backed news organizations were set up starting in the Cold War between the West and Soviet Union. Their designated goal was to provide objective news about the United States and other subjects overseas, often to people under authoritarian governments without access to a free press.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration created Al Hurra in 2003, the same year his administration’s invasion of Iraq overthrew that country’s leader. Al Hurra’s journalists covered the U.S. occupation and sectarian and extremist violence that followed, with some them dying on the job during the 2011 Arab Spring, and other political changes across the Middle East.\n\nWhile Al Hurra over the years faced charges of bias from both conservatives and liberals in the United States, it was one of the few outlets in its region providing space for freedom of the press and speech.\n\nIn his note to staffers, Getmin said his organization would retain a couple of dozen staffers and a “presence” online as court battles over the cuts play out in U.S. courts.\n\n“It makes no sense,” Gedmin wrote, “to silence America’s voice in the Middle East.”\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the news outlet is not off the air entirely.

It attracted 64 million people, a record until Shanghai in 2010.But 55 years on Japan is less of a trendsetter and opinion polls show low levels of enthusiasm among the public for the Expo, particularly after it went 27 percent over budget.So far 8.7 million advance tickets have been shifted, below the pre-sales target of 14 million.Japan is also experiencing a record tourism boom, meaning accommodation in Osaka -- near hotspot Kyoto -- is often fully booked with prices sky-high.Local resident Hirofumi Hayashi, 65, told AFP he hoped to visit the Expo \"if my schedule allows\".\"To be honest, I don't think it's worth spending so much money on. There are many other things that deserve to be prioritised,\" he told AFP.","summary":"World Expo opened on Sunday with 160 countries and regions showcasing their technology, culture and food, with host Japan hoping to provide the world with some much-needed hope.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/world-expo-opens-japan-rocky-times-3769852","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4593478/switzerland-pavilion-2025-osaka-expo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 00:30:25","author":"Natsuko Fukue And Caroline Gardin","authors":["Natsuko Fukue And Caroline Gardin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.443},{"id":310554968,"title":"Wisconsin teen allegedly killed parents in extremist plot to assassinate Trump, FBI says","text":"WAUKESHA, Wisc. -- A Wisconsin teen allegedly killed his parents to \"obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary\" to kill President Donald Trump and overthrow the U.S. government, federal authorities said in court documents.\n\nNikita Casap, 17, was arrested in March and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of hiding a corpse, according to Waukesha County authorities.

The meeting between U.S. Special Envoy Steven Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was the first face-to-face exchange since President Donald Trump returned to office as Iran continues to expand its nuclear program. The White House described the discussions as \"very positive and constructive,\" adding, \"the United States deeply thanks the Sultanate of Oman for its support of this initiative.\" Witkoff, joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima, told Araghchi Trump had personally instructed him to try to resolve differences through diplomacy, if possible. DELEGATES FROM IRAN, US HOLDING TALKS IN OMAN AMID ONGOING TENSIONS: WHAT TO KNOW The talks took place on the outskirts of Oman’s capital, Muscat, and lasted just over two hours. Omani Foreign Minister Said Badr hosted the meeting. Iranian state TV later confirmed the sides exchanged several rounds of messages, and there was a short, direct conversation between the American and Iranian diplomats. Military pressure appears to be a big reason Iran came to the table. Rebecca Grant, a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, told the \"Fox Report\" Saturday the U.S. has sent a clear signal by moving powerful military assets into the region. TRUMP DEMANDS DO-OR-DIE NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN. WHO HAS THE LEVERAGE? \"All the options are not only on the table. They're all deployed to the Middle East,\" Grant said. \"Somewhere between four and six B-2 stealth bombers [are] forward in Diego Garcia, [along with] two aircraft carriers. That has really gotten Iran’s attention.\" Grant said Iran now faces a choice. \"Iran either has to talk or get their nuclear facilities bombed,\" she said. Tensions between the two countries have been high since 2018, when Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal. That agreement placed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, Iran has been enriching uranium at much higher levels. The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is enriching uranium to 60% purity, just below weapons-grade, and has stockpiled over 18,000 pounds of it. Under the original deal, Iran was limited to 3.67% purity and a much smaller stockpile. While U.S. intelligence agencies do not believe Iran has started building a nuclear weapon, they warn the country is getting closer to being able to do so if it decides to. Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News military analyst, said Iran’s leaders now believe Trump is serious about using military force if they don’t agree to limit Iran's nuclear program. \"They’ve come to the conclusion that the president is dead serious about supporting an Israeli-led, U.S.-supported strike on Iran to take down their nuclear enterprise,\" Keane said. Grant explained that the U.S. and its allies are ready for such a strike if talks fail. \"Israel took out a lot of Iran’s air defenses last year,\" she said. \"Then you have two [U.S.] carriers, land-based fighters in the region and B-2 bombers with bunker-busting bombs. That’s the threat display.\" She added that Iran has no real need to enrich uranium since it can buy nuclear fuel on the open market. \"It is time for them to start to make a deal,\" she said. \"And I think, maybe, due to our military pressure and Trump’s resolve, they’re beginning to realize it.\" Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has said he’s not open to direct negotiations on the nuclear program but has also blamed the United States for breaking past promises. \"They must prove that they can build trust,\" Pezeshkian said in a recent Cabinet meeting. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei warned of consequences if threats continue. \"Violence breeds violence, peace begets peace,\" he wrote on social media. \"The US can choose the course... and concede to consequences.\" Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News no deal can happen unless Iran gives up its nuclear weapons plans. \"We have to fully, verifiably eliminate their nuclear weapons program for there to be any agreement,\" he said. \"All we ask is that they behave like a normal nation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Grant said any future deal will need strict terms. \"It’s going to have to include real inspections,\" she said. \"It’s going to have to include them giving up, frankly, some of that enriched uranium. There will have to be some limits on their ballistic missile development.\" The two nations are scheduled to meet again April 19 in Oman, according to the White House statement.
