It came after Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 world championships amid disputed claims that she failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nShe went on to claim gold in the welterweight division in Paris and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is now facing legal action for allowing Khelif to compete.\n\nTrump signed an executive order entitled ‘Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports’. The president recently referred to Khelif as a ‘male boxer’ who had ‘transitioned’ and ‘stole the women’s gold medal after brutalizing his female opponent.’\n\nNow, though, the Algerian has hit back at Trump, insisting she will not be ‘intimidated’.\n\n‘The US President issued a decision related to transgender policies in America. I am not transgender. This does not concern me, and it does not intimidate me,’ she told ITV.\n\n‘I have learned so much from this campaign against me, and what happened at the Paris Olympics was an eye-opening experience. \n\n‘I feel even stronger now than I was before…. if the old Imane operated at 50 percent of her potential, then the Imane Khalif of today is even more motivated and determined.’\n\nShe claimed winning gold was ‘the best response after all the bullying’, claiming: ‘I believe the gold medal at the Paris Olympics was the best medal of the entire Games. \n\n‘It was a victory that held significance on every level—ethical, athletic, and even in terms of sportsmanship.’ \n\nBut Khelif has claimed the alleged ‘bullying’ by big names such as Musk and Rowling left her mother ‘going to the hospital almost every day’ and almost saw her ‘fall into a spiral of depression’.\n\n‘When I saw that even heads of state, famous figures, and former athletes were speaking about me without having verified facts, it shocked me,’ Khelif said.\n\n‘It affected me mentally, as well as my family. Even my mother was deeply affected —she was going to the hospital almost every day. \n\nShe added: ‘This went beyond just a sporting issue or a game… I was deeply affected mentally and felt discouraged, but I remained aware of what was happening.\n\n‘Even during the Paris Olympics, I had a team of specialist doctors who provided me with support and assistance. Without their support, I might have fallen into a spiral of depression.’\n\nKhelif last year filed a criminal complaint over alleged cyberbullying during the Paris Olympics, which reportedly named Harry Potter author Rowling and Musk, the owner of X. \n\nTaiwan’s Lin Yu-ting was also disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) before winning gold in Paris.\n\nBack in November, Khelif faced renewed calls for her to be stripped of her Olympic title after a ‘leaked’ report claimed she is a biological man.\n\nThe report was initially put together in 2023, in a collaboration between French and Algerian expert endocrinologists working at the Kremlin-Bicetre hospital in Paris and the Mohamed Lamine Debaghine hospital in Algiers. The unverified report alleged that Khelif has male characteristics. \n\nKhelif threatened to sue the French journalist who published the report. The boxer has always insisted she is a woman and her father even produced her birth certificate which said she was born female.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nImane Khelif, the Algerian boxer who won gold at the Paris Olympics&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Boxer Imane Khelif issues strong warning to Donald Trump regarding LA Olympics following gender controversy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/boxer-imane-khelif-issues-strong-warning-to-donald-trump-regarding-la-olympics-following-gender-controversy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Controversial-boxer-Imane-Khelif-sends-fierce-warning.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 01:06:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":301658042,"title":"Donald Trump's 13-word retort to reporters as US President releases JFK files","text":"Donald Trump swaggered to journalists today as he released more than 1,000 files related to the assassination of John F Kennedy . The US President, 78, remarked: \"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You’ve got a lot of reading\" as he teased the disclosure of the material, which includes records, photographs, motion pictures and sound recordings. The files have been posted on the website of the US National Archives and Records Administration , and journalists and historical experts continue to trawl through the documents today to assess their significance. But it is understood some of the files may have already been made public through the archive's existing extensive database of material, such as artifacts. Larry J Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Centre for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century\", said his team has started going through the documents but it may be some time before their full importance becomes clear. Following Mr Trump's announcement at the John F Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts in Washington DC on Tuesday, Mr Sabato said: \"We have a lot of work to do for a long time to come, and people just have to accept that.\" The US National Archives and Records Administration already has more than six million pages of files, such as documents and records, relating to the assassination of the former president. Many who have studied what’s been released so far by the government say the public shouldn’t anticipate any earth-shattering revelations from the newly released documents, but there is still intense interest in details related to the assassination and the events surrounding it. Mr Trump's January order directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release the records. Previously, these documents have been classified - unless the archive already had access to them, which is thought to be the case in some instances. Mr Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963, on a visit to Dallas. As his motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer. A year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B Johnson established to investigate, concluded that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that didn’t quell a web of alternative theories over the decades. In the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president.","summary":"The JFK files have been posted on the website of the US National Archives and Records Administration - but experts say it may be some time before their full significance becomes clear","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-13-word-retort-34888021","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34888028.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 01:05:26","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":301658308,"title":"Conor Mcgregor enters the political ring: How shamed UFC fighter teased Irish presidential bid backed by Elon Musk months before launching anti-migrant rant in White House meeting with Trump ","text":"Conor McGregor used his podium at the White House on Monday to rally against what he called an 'illegal immigration racket ravaging our country' - his latest foray into the world of politics.\n\nThe Irish mixed martial arts fighter spoke at a press conference ahead of a meeting with Donald Trump, telling reporters that he would voice concerns about immigration issues in Ireland when speaking to the U.S. President.\n\nDonning a green three piece suit, McGregor told an audience that Ireland was close to 'potentially losing its Irishness', laying into the Irish government as an administration of 'zero action with zero accountability'.\n\n'Out money is being spent on overseas issues that is nothing to do with the Irish people [sic],' he said.\n\n'There are rural towns in Ireland that have been overrun in one swoop, that have become a minority in one swoop, so issues need to be addressed and the 40 million Irish Americans, as I said, need to hear this because if not there will be no place to come home and visit.'\n\nMcGregor's invitation to the White House came after Donald Trump last week singled out the sportsman, who was found liable for sexual assault after a civil trial last year, as one of his favourite Irish people.\n\nThe strong rhetoric on display in Monday's speech aligned with Trump's own rallies against illegal immigration. But it is not the first time the 36-year-old has ventured into politics.\n\nConor McGregor praised Donald Trump's 'work ethic' as 'inspiring' when they finally met on Monday.\n\nThe pair posed for photos, clasping hands, and shared light comments in front of a map of the Gulf of Mexico, labelled as the Gulf of America, in the Oval Office.\n\nAhead of the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in the briefing room: 'We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on St Patrick's Day.'\n\nThe pairing was not always on the cards. A decade ago, when Trump was merely a candidate for office, McGregor launched into a tirade when pressed to comment on Trump's trash-talking of fellow wrestler Ronda Rousey.\n\n'It means nothing, so Donald can shut his big fat mouth,' he said at the time. 'I don't give a f*** about Donald Trump.'\n\nTen years later, Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and McGregor was happy to accept his invitation to the White House.\n\nIt was a rare opportunity for the athlete to have the world's eyes on him, having been out of the octagon for almost four years.\n\nMcGregor was last in focus in November, when he was seen leaving the High Court in Dublin in silence after being found liable for assaulting Nikita Hand in December 2018 and ordered to pay €250,000.\n\nMonday's press conference took a different tone, with an animated McGregor given a platform to speak on what he called the issue of an 'illegal immigration racket' in Ireland, and the U.S.-Irish relationship.\n\nMcGregor's rant was loud enough to stir a response from politicians in Ireland, who found themselves within the MMA fighter's sights.\n\nIrish leader Micheál Martin said the comments 'did not reflect the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland'. \n\nMartin wrote on X that the holiday was 'a day rooted in community, humanity, friendship and fellowship.'\n\nSimon Harris, now deputy prime minister, said in a video published to social media while visiting New York: 'It's for President Trump to decide to invite whoever he wants to his home and he's perfectly entitled to do whatever he wishes in relation to who he decides to invite to the White House.\n\n'But let me be very clear: Conor McGregor is not here in the United States representing Ireland or the people of Ireland. He's here in a personal capacity. He doesn't speak for Ireland. He doesn't speak for the people of Ireland. He has no mandate to do such and my views on him are very clear.'\n\nMcGregor has not held a role in office before. But he has asserted that he would be the 'only logical choice' for president of Ireland.\n\nIreland is headed by an elected president, though most real political power lies with the Taoiseach, nominated by the Dáil, the lower house.\n\nIn comments in December 2023, amid turbulent discourse around the Dublin riots triggered by the stabbings of three children and a carer in the city, McGregor made a case for himself as president.\n\n'Potential competition if I run. Gerry [Adams], 78. Bertie [Ahern]. 75. Enda [Kenny], 74. Each with unbreakable ties to their individual parties politics,' he wrote online.\n\n'Regardless of what the public outside of their parties feel. These parties govern themselves vs govern the people.\n\n'Or me, 35. Young, active, passionate, fresh skin in the game. I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling. I'd even put it all to vote.'\n\nHis bid received support from Elon Musk, now Trump's cost-cutting tsar, who replied: 'I think you could take them all single-handed. Not even fair.'\n\nMcGregor aired his promise to be a 'voice of the people that deserve to be heard' following his criticism of how the government had handled the stabbings of four in Dublin.\n\nHe had laid into the government after a 49-year-old Irish citizen, of Algerian origin, was detained in connection to the attacks, sparking riots across the city.\n\nHundreds of rioters took to the streets, setting police cars, buses and trams on fire.\n\nSome threw fireworks and flares, and injured police officers. Looting cost local shops 'tens of millions' of euros in damages. \n\nMcGregor later wrote that he did not condone the riots.\n\nHe told the Guardian: 'We Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.'\n\nBut McGregor was sharp in his response to the attacks. \n\n'Innocent children ruthlessly stabbed by a mentally deranged non-national in Dublin, Ireland today,' he said at the time.\n\n'There is grave danger among us in Ireland that should never be here in the first place, and there has been zero action done to support the public in any way, shape or form with this frightening fact. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.'\n\nMisinformation had circled claiming the alleged assailant was a foreign national, driving anti-immigration discourse online.\n\nThe suspect had moved from Algeria in 2003 and was a naturalised Irish citizen.\n\nMcGregor's rhetoric was similar following the sentencing of Jozef Puska, a 33-year-old Slovakian man jailed for life for the murder of Irish schoolteacher Ashling Murphy.\n\n'Ireland, we are at war,' he wrote in a post viewed more than 19 million times on X.\n\nMcGregor renewed his political ambitions months later, in September 2024, when he claimed to have 'all the answers the people of Ireland seek'.\n\nStaking his bid for presidency, McGregor said: 'As President I hold the power to summon the Dáil [Ireland's government] as well as dissolve it.\n\n'So as I said before, I would have all the answers the people of Ireland seek from these thieves of the working man, these disrupters of the family unit, these destructors of small businesses, and on and on and on!\n\n'These charlatans in their positions of power would be summoned to answer to the people of Ireland and I would have it done by day end. Or I would be left with no choice but to dissolve the Dáil entirely.\n\n'Stop the train until. The people of Ireland deserve the answers they seek. Point blank. This would be my power as President [sic].\n\n'I know very well. Ireland needs an active President employed wholly by the people of Ireland. It is me. I am the only logical choice. 2025 is upcoming…' he added.\n\nAndrew Tate, who faces rape and human-trafficking charges in Romania, which he denies, replied to McGregor's post.\n\n'My grandfather is from Limerick. I have the Irish passport. I will vote for you. We must do something before it's too late,' said Tate in his reply.\n\nMcGregor's views have attracted the attention of the far-right, according to Ciarán O'Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which researches online hate and disinformation.\n\nHe told CNN last year: 'The far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology.'\n\nHe said he believed that McGregor's 'tweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.'\n\nThe November 2024 Irish election came and went. Fianna Fáil remained the largest party, increasing its number of seats to 48 under Micheál Martin.\n\nAsked at Trump's inauguration in January 2025 whether he would one day run for office, McGregor said only: 'We will see. We will see. We will see.'\n\nIf he does want to run, he only has a few months to decide.\n\nTo receive a nomination to contest October's presidential election, he would need to be nominated by at least 20 members of the Oireachtas, or at least four local authorities.\n\nThis would be an uphill battle, with centrist and centre-right parties still leading in the political sphere.\n\nConor McGregor rose from humble beginnings in Ireland to become the first fighter to simultaneously hold two UFC belts.\n\nDuring his rise, he wooed a global audience with his achievements. \n\nToday, his views are seen by millions online, and have the power to reverberate around the world in minutes.\n\nHis appearance at the White House on Monday is the latest in a string of events highlighting wider political ambitions, having found support among a growing faction on the Right espousing pro-nationalist and anti-immigration views.","summary":"Conor McGregor used his podium at the White House on Monday to rally against what he called an 'illegal immigration racket ravaging our country' in a fiery rant","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14510237/Conor-Mcgregor-enters-political-ring-shamed-UFC-fighter-teased-Irish-presidential-bid-backed-Elon-Musk-months-launching-anti-migrant-rant-White-House-meeting-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/18/10/96307525-0-image-a-37_1742295081221.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/17/1099012316332901170/1024x576_MP4_1099012316332901170.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-19 01:04:17","author":"Editor,James Reynolds","authors":["Editor","James Reynolds"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":301658310,"title":"'Real King of the Cross' dies as tributes pour in for nightlife identity","text":"Black Friday\n\nBreaking News\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Mar 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrail astronauts go through barrage of health tests after brutal nine months in space as NASA makes stunning admission about Trump\n\nPrince Harry's US immigration documents are unsealed after two-year court battle\n\nJFK files RELEASED after Trump pledged to reveal the truth behind the infamous assassination\n\nANDREW NEIL: Is that it?

His infectious laughter and cutting asides will linger on as long as that building is standing. He's as much a part of that place as the walls and ceiling.\n'Unsurprisingly, he had a lot to say, about being an Italian immigrant and coming to Australia at the age of 14 knowing no English, about the good and bad old days of the Cross, about being a gay man at that time, about his hatred of gentrification and what it was doing to inner-city Sydney, about his adoration for the theatre and his admiration for actors and performers.'\nPiccolo Bar opened in 1952 and has been a magnet for coffee lovers who want their favourite drink strong, black and bittersweet.\n\nVittorio Bianchi migrated to Australia in the 1940s and became one of the most popular figures in Sydney's Kings Cross\n\nVittorio Bianchi posing with performers later in life\nMr Bianchi ran it 24 hours a day and it was open to everyone from actors to strippers and drag queens.\nDavid and Amy Spanton run Piccolo Bar these days as an aperitivo bar and diner and they paid tribute to the man who made the place famous.\n'If you have a chance to pop by this week, come and check out some of the photos and raise a glass to Vittorio and his life,' David Spanton said.\n'He truly is part of the fabric of the Cross, and his memory will live on.'\nOthers paid tribute online to a man described as an 'outstanding individual'.\n'He hired my father as a barista way back when Australians weren't aware of what espresso was. Vale Vito,' one person wrote.\n'I feel completely blessed to have known this wonderful man. I have some very cool stories that I'll keep close to my heart and always remember him as an outstanding individual with a magnetic personality. RIP legend,' another said.\nLocal writer, actor and performer Vashti Hughes said Mr Bianchi was a 'colourful man' and one of the first people to undergo training as an actor at Sydney's Ensemble Theatre.\n\nPiccolo Bar has been a magnet for coffee lovers over many decades in Kings Cross\nA GoFundMe page has been made to give Mr Bianchi a fitting farewell.\nIt's aiming to raise $17,500 to cover costs including crematorium fees, a memorial service at the Wayside Chapel, a cabaret show and food and drinks.\n'It was his wish that a cabaret show be held to farewell him and pay artists. We want to send him into the next life to join loved ones who have already passed,' page organiser Tina Newton-Cara said.\n'It is our responsibility now to fulfil Vittorio's wishes and to host a fitting tribute and memorial that includes paying and feeding the performers - causes close to Vittorio's heart.'\nMel GibsonSydney\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Real King of the Cross' dies as tributes pour in for nightlife identity\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

She added in her order that the government “could have crafted a policy that balances the Nation’s need for a prepared military and Americans’ right to equal protection.”\n\n“They still can,” she said. “The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The Court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.”\n\nThe White House and Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nShannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, which is representing several trans service members and trans people who want to enlist in a lawsuit, said Reyes acted quickly “to shield our troops from the harmful effects of this irrational ban.” \n\n“The ban’s harmful impact and rushed implementation show that it was motivated by prejudice,” Minter said. “Our plaintiffs include lifelong military personnel who served in combat in Afghanistan, come from multi-generation military families, and have received honors like the Bronze Star. This ban is unjustifiable and attacks brave servicemembers, recruits, and families who sacrifice so much for our country.” \n\nTrump’s order goes much further than a similar policy he issued during his first term, which prohibited trans people from enlisting and allowed those already serving to continue doing so in a manner consistent with their gender identity and receiving transition-related medical care if they came out prior to the ban. Service members who came out after were not allowed to receive such medical care and had to continue serving in a manner consistent with their assigned sex at birth. \n\nThe new policy prohibits trans people from enlisting and also requires the military to identify all trans service members who have “a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,” which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one’s gender identity and birth sex, according to a memo the Pentagon filed in the lawsuit last week. \n\nThose identified by the Pentagon will be disqualified from service and must be removed from their jobs. They will receive an honorable separation unless their record reflects otherwise, according to the memo.\n\nIn January, two national LGBTQ legal organizations, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law) and NCLR, filed suit against Trump’s executive order on behalf of six active-duty trans service members and two trans people seeking to enlist. They argued that the ban discriminates against trans people and also “reflects animosity toward transgender people because of their transgender status.”\n\nThe order, the lawsuit stated, declared that being trans fundamentally “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”\n\n“A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,” the order states. \n\nReyes pushed Justice Department attorney Jason C. Lynch on that language during preliminary hearings last month, asking repeatedly whether he believed it showed animus against the trans community. \n\n“Would it be fair to say that excluding a group of people from military service based on unsupported assertions that they are liars, immodest, lack integrity, are undisciplined and are dishonorable, would you agree with me that — particularly where there’s no support for any of those assertions — that that is animated by animus?” Reyes asked Lynch, who declined to answer. \n\nMultiple Defense Department memos also state that enlisted service members will be required to use pronouns and salutations, such as sir and ma’am, that align with their birth sex. Reyes pressed Lynch on how pronoun usage affects military readiness. \n\n“I don’t—” Lynch said, before the judge interrupted him.\n\n“Because it doesn’t,” Reyes said. “Because any common sense rational human being understands that it doesn’t.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA federal judge Tuesday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order banning&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court temporarily stops Trump&#8217;s ban on transgender individuals in the military first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/court-temporarily-stops-trumps-ban-on-transgender-individuals-in-the-military/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Judge-temporarily-blocks-Trumps-transgender-military-ban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:58:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":301657588,"title":"US chief justice pushes back on Trump's call to impeach federal judge","text":"US Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked President Donald Trump for urging the impeachment of a federal judge.\n\nIn a rare statement, Judge Roberts wrote: \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"\n\nHe wrote the correct response was to file an appeal.\n\nWashington-based US District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration on Saturday to halt the removal of alleged Venezuelan gang members, which Mr Trump has argued is authorised by an 18th-century law historically used only in wartime.\n\nTensions have been rising in the eight weeks since Mr Trump returned to the White House, and the president and his allies have publicly criticised courts for blocking aspects of the Trump administration's agenda.\n\nAt a hearing, Judge Boasberg had ordered a suspension of all deportations carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, including turning around any planes already in transit.\n\nTwo planes carrying at least 238 alleged gang members were already in the air and did not return, prompting accusations that Mr Trump's administration defied the court order.\n\nThe Trump administration wrote that two flights had departed before the judge's written order was issued and that spoken orders the judge had issued in court before the written notice hit the docket were not enforceable.\n\n\"I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\" Mr Trump wrote on social media on Tuesday.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress but do not have a two-thirds majority in the Senate.\n\n'We do not have Obama judges'\n\nThe statement by Judge Roberts, a conservative who former Republican president George W Bush appointed, echoes one from 2018 when the judge defended the judiciary's independence after persistent attacks by Mr Trump during his first term in office.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Judge Roberts said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nMr Trump appointed three of the justices to the nine-member Supreme Court himself.\n\nHe once called a judge who ruled against his policy barring asylum for certain immigrants an \"Obama judge\".\n\nA narrow majority of Supreme Court justices, including Judge Roberts, has pushed back against Mr Trump in a pair of procedural rulings issued since the president took office on January 20.\n\nOn February 21, the court declined to let Mr Trump immediately fire the head of a federal watchdog agency after a judge's order temporarily blocked the dismissal.\n\nOn March 5, the court declined to let the Trump administration withhold payment to foreign aid organisations for work they already performed for the government.\n\nThe court is weighing Mr Trump's March 13 request asking it to intervene in his bid to curb automatic US birthright citizenship.","summary":"US Chief Justice John Roberts rebukes President Donald Trump for calling for the impeachment of a federal judge, saying it is \"not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision\".","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-19/us-chief-justice-clashes-with-donald-trump/105069748","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4892e8b2920a048b82b84eba4537a1dd?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1046&cropW=1868&xPos=694&yPos=394&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:54:40","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.439},{"id":301656068,"title":"Rep.

But the real closer for Wiz and Google executives was the change at the White House that brought with it the prospect of a friendlier antitrust review under Trump, these people said. \n\nGoogle made another pass last fall while Wiz considered a potential IPO, these people said. While negotiations continued sporadically over several months, executives started meeting regularly to hammer out details of a deal after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration and appointment of key antitrust officials in his administration, these people said. \n\nFazal Merchant also joined Wiz as its new Chief Financial Officer in January, while the company was still weighing a potential initial public offering. Merchant played a major role in shaping the deal, along with CEO Assaf Rappaport, helping to get it across the finish line, one of the people said. Google's cloud chief Thomas Kurian was also a key architect of the agreement, two people said. \n\nSWEETENED DEAL\n\nWiz executives found it hard to turn down Google's revised offer, which valued the cybersecurity startup 39 per cent higher than the earlier bid, and also included a higher reverse breakup fee of more than $3.2 billion, or over 10 per cent of the deal value, payable to Wiz if the deal falls through, the sources said.\n\nGoogle sees the premium as justified given Wiz's 70 per cent annual revenue growth and over $700 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the discussions. \n\nReverse termination fees, more commonly referred to as breakup fees, are paid by buyers to compensate target companies when deals fall apart due to regulatory reasons. \n\nSuch a high breakup fee is not common in corporate dealmaking in the United States, even though such fees have been on the rise in recent years as regulatory threats to large deals have increased globally. According to a study by law firm Fenwick & West, which reviewed deals worth at least $1 billion that were signed in 2023, breakup fees on an average ranged between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of the overall transaction value.\n\nIt is not clear if Google and Wiz approached U.S. antitrust authorities prior to the signing of the deal. \n\nSome companies have preemptively briefed U.S. antitrust watchdogs to warm them up before signing a deal. For instance, in 2023, Tempur Sealy sought the blessing of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission before signing a $4 billion deal to acquire Mattress Firm. \n\nWiz executives were wary after seeing Adobe's attempted $20 billion takeover of Figma fall apart due to antitrust scrutiny in late 2023, two people said. Google is also currently battling two U.S. Department of Justice lawsuits over its domination of online search and another about ad technology.\n\nGoogle had offered to pay Wiz a breakup fee of about $2 billion at the time - a sum that Wiz felt was not high enough for them to undertake the risk of signing the deal, the sources said. \n\nSome of Wiz's largest venture-capital backers were worried that then-Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan would tank the deal, the sources said. \n\nTrump's appointment of Andrew Ferguson to chair the FTC and Gail Slater to helm antitrust reviews at Justice also gave executives at both companies more confidence in a smoother regulatory review, people familiar with the deal said. \n\nGoogle, Wiz, the White House, and Justice officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\nBank of America advised Google on the deal, while Goldman Sachs advised Wiz. \n\n (Additional reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and Steven Scheer in Tel Aviv.

The extended mission, which faced challenges due to issues with the Boeing Starliner, came to an end with Williams emerging from SpaceX's Dragon capsule and stepping onto the recovery ship. A video of the moment captures her beaming smile as she came back to Earth, providing a moment of relief and celebration for both NASA and the public. Williams's return was highlighted by a smooth splashdown off the Florida coast, with fellow astronauts Butch Wilmore Nick Hague, and Aleksandr Gorbunov The occasion was further made special when a pod of dolphins were spotted gliding around the floating spacecraft. This surprise visit by the marine creatures added an extra touch to their triumphant return to Earth after a long space mission. The White House took to X to celebrate the safe return of Williams and Wilmore, crediting President Donald Trump for expediting their rescue. PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT, read the statement, acknowledging Trump's intervention along with efforts from Elon Musk, SpaceX, and NASA. The spacecraft's journey through space ended with a parachute-assisted splashdown off the Florida coast at 3:27am IST. Williams and Wilmore had initially planned to spend eight days in space, but their stay was extended to over nine months due to a propulsion system issue with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. NASA decided in August that they would return on a SpaceX capsule instead of their original spacecraft. This decision led to an international media frenzy, dubbing them as stranded astronauts.","summary":"NASA astronaut Sunita Williams has successfully and safely returned to Earth today, concluding her 286-day-long mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS).","url":"https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/nasa-astronaut-sunita-williams-returns-from-record-breaking-286-day-iss-mission/story","image":"https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l38120250319053214.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:51:10","author":"Mudit Dube","authors":["Mudit Dube"],"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":301654760,"title":"Victory of common sense in Washington made Russia-US dialogue possible — diplomat","text":"LONDON, March 19. /TASS/.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:00:05 GMT, 19 March 2025 |Updated:00:46 GMT, 19 March 2025 \n\nGino D'Acampo is set to make his return to TV screens as a mechanic in a new series, he has announced. \nIn recent months the TV chef, 48, has faced a string of accusations of inappropriate behaviour towards women - which he has denied.\nITV subsequently pulled all of Gino's shows from its upcoming schedules after the accusations were revealed in an investigation.\n'He’s in a lot of trouble and ITV don’t want to be in a BBC situation [with Gregg Wallace] or have a repeat of Schofield so they are covering all their bases', an insider told MailOnline at the time.\nBut now the chef is set to return to TV, after he revealed he has been filming a new series in Ireland. \nGino shared a collection of snaps where he could be seen working as a mechanic with his face covered in grime as he filmed scenes for the mystery series. \n\nGino D'ACampo is set to make his return to TV screens as a mechanic in a new series, he announced on Instagram on Tuesday\n\nBut now the chef is set to return to TV, after he revealed he has been filming a new series in Ireland\n'What a fantastic experience in Ireland working on a new series…' he captioned the snaps shared on Instagram on Tuesday. \n'I can't wait for you guys to see it… p.s Happy St Patrick's Day! GDx.'\nMailOnline has approached representatives for Gino for comment. \nLast month it was claimed Gino drew an explicit picture of a female TV producer during live filming, an ITV probe into the TV chef has been told. \nThe Italian star, known for his cheeky on-screen persona, is at the centre of claims from dozens of people who described his alleged conduct over the past 12 years as 'distressing,' 'unacceptable,' and even 'horrendous'. \nThe female producer's claims against Gino are now being investigated by ITV bosses, The Sun first reported. \nThe woman claimed her 'unsettling encounter' with the chef happened during live filming of Saturday Cooks! \nShe claimed that he sketched a naked woman with her legs spread open after asking to draw a portrait picture of her. \n\nGino shared a collection of snaps where he could be seen working as a mechanic with his face covered in grime as he filmed scenes for the mystery series\n\n'What a fantastic experience in Ireland working on a new series…' he captioned the snaps shared on Instagram on Tuesday\n\nIn recent months the TV chef, 48, has faced a string of accusations of inappropriate behaviour towards women - which he has denied \nThe producer is said to have told a friend of the alleged sketch: 'I thought it was going to be a harmless caricature. But when he showed me the finished drawing I felt shocked and humiliated.' \nShe also alleged that Gino made a sexual comment about leather boots she was wearing. \nGino has 'firmly denied' all allegations so far, saying they were 'simply not in my nature' and describing them as 'deeply upsetting'. \nGino's former host Melanie Sykes slammed the chef and television bosses earlier this month, saying the industry needs to 'clean out' the 'monsters' among its talent.\nShe presented ITV's cookery and chat show Let's Do Lunch for three years alongside Gino, but quit television in 2021 after what she claims was an inappropriate remark from MasterChef host Gregg Wallace.\nReflecting on her turbulent time in the industry, Melanie, 55, said: 'I've been watching what's happening with all these misogynists on telly and I'm supporting anybody who's experienced anything that's beyond pale. \n'There is no protection. Some of it's being done behind closed doors, but it's happening on set. When channels say, \"It's not our problem because it's with a production company\", it's just appalling.' \n\nGino, pictured with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, honours his promise to cook naked on This Morning if they won at the 2011 NTA Awards\nMelanie continued: 'I remember once when Gino said to me he can just go up to the powers that be and knock on the door and go in. He doesn't need a meeting. He was quite pleased with himself he could do that.\n'I feel like I was in a war zone in that industry – 24 years of battling through an industry that didn't feel right to me anyway. If you're spending all your time cleaning up people's s***, just clean the house, clean out the house and start again, that's all I'm saying.'\nAmong the allegations against Gino include that he performatively kissed a footballer's wife on the lips when he was presented as the start turn at a charity event - and then bragged that he did it 'because I f****** can'.\nThe once popular TV chef kissed the astonished famous WAG without warning in front of dozens of guests. \nBBCITVGregg WallaceGino D'AcampoInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGino D'Acampo set to make his return to TV after being axed by ITV following accusations of inappropriate behaviour towards women\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Part of that bump reflected efforts to frontload exports to get ahead of new tariffs in the US.\n\n“I think that some of the growth in exports may be due to a rush of orders before the Trump tariffs came,” said Yuichi Kodama, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. “But it’s not clear to what extent this was the case. It’s worth noting that exports to the US fell in terms of volume.”\n\nBy region, shipments to the US rose 10.5% by value and slipped by 3.3% in terms of volume. Those to China increased 14.1%, likely boosted by the Lunar New Year effect, while exports to Europe fell 7.7%.\n\nGlobal trade flows now face potential major disruptions as US President Donald Trump continues to escalate his tariff campaign, targeting nations including Canada and Mexico, where Japanese carmakers have major manufacturing bases. The renewed trade war between Washington and Beijing also risks having a ripple effect on Japan, which counts on the two nations as its biggest trading partners.","summary":"Japan’s exports rose at a faster pace as businesses increased orders ahead of the rollout of higher tariffs in the US.","url":"https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japans-exports-rise-at-faster-clip-before-trump-tariffs-hit","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stronger-exports-japans-exports-rose-at-a-faster-pace-in-fe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:46:47","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":301657726,"title":"Oil Holds Drop With US Stockpile Climb and Geopolitics in Focus","text":"Geopolitical concerns over Russia and Iran remained in focus.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON and RUSS WEAKLAND FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:27 GMT, 19 March 2025 |Updated:00:43 GMT, 19 March 2025 \n\nGwyneth Paltrow has finally addressed the rumors Derek Blasberg lost control of his bowels at a bed in her Hamptons home last summer. \nPaltrow, 52, didn't rush to deny the anecdote when it came up during her interview with Vanity Fair, and was described as appearing 'pained' and communicating with 'existential cringe' as she addressed it.\nPaltrow kept her comments brief, and Blasberg was not named in the article, with the media personality referred to as a 'socialite houseguest' in the story. \n'I understand,' Paltrow, who was said to have appeared 'pained', began once the rumor came up. 'And I also, like, am just not going to…'\nVanity Fair reporter Michelle Ruiz astutely observed of the exchange: 'She trails off with an existential cringe, saying nothing more but, I note, not leaping to denying it.'\nThe internet was whipped into a frenzy last year when a blind item in a popular gossip newsletter claimed that Goop founder Paltrow had been faced with cleaning up someone's 'Ozempic-induced diarrhea' at her home. \n\nGwyneth Paltrow has finally addressed her pal Derek Blasberg's unfortunate diarrhea incident at her Hamptons home last year; pictured 2024\n\n Paltrow, pictured with Blasberg, didn't rush to deny the anecdote when it came up during her interview\nInsiders later told DailyMail.com Blasberg - once described as 'one of showbiz’s most well-connected men' - was the culprit and that he had conveniently blamed the incident on the popular weight loss wonder drug Ozempic before allegedly fleeing the property. \n\nEXCLUSIVE How Gwyneth Paltrow REALLY feels about Derek Blasberg fleeing her home after diarrhea ordeal \n'It’s not Ozempic, that’s just what he told everyone,' the insider said, before revealing how the secret made its way through the Hamptons set.\n'Gwyneth told Oprah, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld, and Larry David,' they continued.\n'It’s shocking how many people know this story and how he has managed to keep it out of The Post… probably via his best friend [socialite Dasha Zhukova] - whose mom just married Rupert Murdoch.'\nBlasberg is no stranger to spending time with Paltrow at her five-bedroom Long Island home, where she hosted her wedding to Brad Falchuk.\nIn 2022 the fashion expert posted a snap of himself and the actress celebrating her 50th birthday at the sprawling property.\nAnd it appears someone tried to out Blasberg as the phantom pooper over the summer ago when they commented two poop emojis, a toilet emoji and a dynamite emoji on the Instagram post.\nSpeculation first kicked off when a blind item report started circulating via an email newsletter called Popb***h.\n\nPaltrow didn't rush to deny the anecdote and had a 'pained' expression on her face as she recalled it, according to Vanity Fair\n'The story goes that a recent houseguest of Gwynnie's catastrophically s**t themselves in bed while staying there, then fled back to the city before they had to face the music,' it read.\nRevealing that the scandal had become 'the Hamptons set's favorite piece of gossip to text to each other,' the report continued: 'Ozempic-induced diarrhea is becoming a very hot topic of conversation between hosts there - because so many of their guests are using it. So expect launderettes to be fully booked from July 4.'\nInsiders have since told DailyMail.com that Gwyneth was left 'horrified' by the incident but was hopeful they will 'eventually laugh' at it. \nThe fashion journalist has remained silent and up until the Vanity Fair interview, so had Gwyneth, with insiders previously claiming the Goop founder 'feels bad' - but knows they need to avoid hanging out for the foreseeable.\n'Gwyneth would like to eventually laugh about this with Derek, but currently there is still much embarrassment,' a source exclusively revealed to DailyMail.com.\n'They both know that if they are ever seen together or if he ever returns to her house, they go out to dinner, it will be the only thing people will be talking about.'\nThey continued: 'It is not that they aren't friends and won't be friendly with each other in the future, it is just a bit difficult, and they both realize some time should pass before they hang out again.\n'The likelihood of them being friends in the future is pretty good – she has moved on from worse events in her life.'\n\nInsiders have since told DailyMail.com that Gwyneth was left 'horrified' by the incident but was hopeful they will 'eventually laugh' at it; Paltrow pictured last month\nThe source claimed Gwyneth and her friends have all reacted similarly to the scenario, as they shut down claims the actress-turned-wellness guru is being seen as a snitch.\n'She thought that it was horrifying at first, but has since found the humor in it and has had a good laugh about it,' they said.\n'Most of Gwyneth's friends think it is shockingly hilarious and gross, but they aren't thinking differently about Gwyneth.'\nA subsequent blind item from the email newsletter titled Popb***h made it clear that Gwyneth had not been the one to leak the story across the Hamptons set.\n'Ever since the phantom Hamptons c**pper was unveiled as celebrity barnacle Derek Blasberg, Gwyneth Paltrow has come in for quite a bit of flak,' it read.\n'Society types are appalled she'd break a cardinal rule of hosting and blab about her guest's gastrointestinal indiscretion. But in fairness to Gwynnie, the leak may not have been her.'\nThe report continued: 'Gwyneth was lunching with Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Seinfeld when her irate housekeeper called, shouting loudly about the horrors she'd discovered, yelling about how much she hates \"that f**ing friend\" of hers.\n'And – most damning - complaining about the tip that had been left at the scene of the crime.'\nThe source noted that Gwyneth strongly believed that the situation would soon be old news, and finished: 'She does feel bad that it got out there and everyone in the world knows about it, but it will pass.'\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGwyneth Paltrow finally addresses Derek Blasberg diarrhea incident at her Hamptons home\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning'.\n\nNegotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.\n\nThe Israeli premier said in his address that 'from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire,' before adding: 'Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages'.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, witnesses in Gaza said the attacks had largely stopped, though sporadic bombing continued.\n\n'Today I felt that Gaza is a real hell,' said Jihan Nahhal, a 43-year-old woman from Gaza City, adding that some of her relatives were wounded or killed in the strikes.\n\n'Suddenly there were huge explosions, as if it were the first day of the war.'\n\nHamas, which has not responded militarily so far, accused Israel of attempting to force it to surrender.\n\nThe White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was 'fully coordinated' with Washington.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said that 'Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities'.\n\nA Hamas statement later urged friendly countries to 'pressure' the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.\n\nThe United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones.\n\nNetanyahu's office said Tuesday's operation was ordered after 'Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages'.\n\nHamas said Israel had 'decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement' brokered by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, and warned that the resumption of violence would 'impose a death sentence' on the remaining living hostages.\n\nThe group's leader, Sami Abu Zuhri, told AFP the aim of the strikes was 'to impose a surrender agreement, writing it in the blood of Gaza'.\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz said that 'Hamas must understand that the rules of the game have changed', threatening to unleash the Israeli military until the group's 'complete destruction' if it did not immediately free the hostages.\n\nHamas said the head of its government in Gaza, Essam al-Dalis, was among several officials killed.\n\nIn the southern Gaza Strip, AFP footage showed people rushing wounded people on stretchers, including young children, to hospital. Bodies covered with white shrouds were also taken to the hospital's mortuary.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said the bodies of 413 people had been received by hospitals, adding 'a number of victims are still under the rubble'.\n\nUNICEF spokeswoman Rosalia Bollen, speaking to AFP in southern Gaza, said the deaths include 'dozens and dozens of children, with many more children wounded'.\n\nMedical facilities that 'have already been decimated' by the war were now 'overwhelmed', she added.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages rallied in front of Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem, and a campaign group accused the government of causing 'the explosion of the ceasefire, which could sacrifice their family members'.\n\nGovernments in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere called for the renewed hostilities to end.\n\n'The images of burning tents in refugee camps are shocking. Fleeing children and internally displaced persons must never be used as leverage in negotiations,' said Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.\n\nHamas backer Iran denounced the wave of attacks as a 'continuation of the genocide' in the Palestinian territories, while Russia and China warned against escalation.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the strikes were part of 'deliberate efforts to make the Gaza Strip uninhabitable and force the Palestinians into displacement'.\n\nTrump has floated a proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza, an idea that was rejected by Palestinians and governments in the region and beyond, but embraced by some Israeli politicians.\n\nHours after the wave of strikes began, Netanyahu's Likud movement said that a far-right party that had quit the government in January in protest at the Gaza truce would rejoin.\n\nThe ceasefire in Gaza took effect on January 19, largely halting the war triggered by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.\n\nThat first phase of the deal ended in early March after numerous exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut the two sides have been unable to agree on the next steps, with Hamas demanding negotiations for a second phase, which should lead to a lasting ceasefire.\n\nIsrael had sought to extend the first phase, cutting off aid and electricity to Gaza over the deadlock.\n\nHamas's 2023 attack resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, while Israel's retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,577 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the two sides.\n\nOf the 251 hostages seized during the attack, 58 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels - have pursued a campaign of attacks in what they say is solidarity with the Palestinians - launched a missile at Israel, which the military said was intercepted.","summary":"The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14512873/Netanyahu-warns-Gaza-strikes-just-beginning-end-ceasefire.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/18/22/96329817-0-image-a-29_1742335722241.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/19/6424431471171710977/1024x576_MP4_6424431471171710977.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:42:08","author":"Editor,Miriam Kuepper","authors":["Editor","Miriam Kuepper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":301654870,"title":"JFK Files: How to Download the Newly Released Kennedy Assassination Files","text":"The Donald Trump administration has released tens of thousands of previously classified documents related to the assassination of former President John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released. The National Archives has partnered with agencies across the federal government to comply with the President’s directive in support of Executive Order 14176.\"\nThe newly declassified records, consisting of approximately 80,000 pages, are available online through the National Archives website. They can also be accessed in person in hard copy or other analog formats at the National Archives facility in College Park, Maryland.\nIntelligence Director Confirms No Redactions in JFK Files\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated that the records contain \"approximately 80,000 pages of previously classified records that will be published with no redactions.\"\nHowever, she noted that some documents remain restricted. \"There are additional documents that are withheld under court seal or for grand jury secrecy, and records subject to section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which must be unsealed before release,\" Gabbard explained. She added that the National Archives is coordinating with the Justice Department to expedite the unsealing of these remaining records.\nExpert Warns of Limited Revelations in JFK Files\nDespite the significance of the release, some experts caution that the documents may not provide the groundbreaking revelations that many anticipate.\n“I’m just telling you that we will learn things,” said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia and author of The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. Kennedy. “But it may not be about the Kennedy assassination. People who are expecting, you know, to crack the case after 61 years are going to be bitterly disappointed.”\nConspiracy Theories and Trump’s Interest\nKennedy’s assassination has long been a subject of conspiracy theories, some of which President Trump has previously referenced. The release of these documents is part of an ongoing effort by the Assassination Records Review Board to determine which records can be made public.\nAlso Read: Inside The JFK Files: What The Trump Administration’s 80,000 Page Document Release Reveal","summary":"The Trump administration has declassified tens of thousands of documents related to John F.

Kennedy.\n\n The only grandson of the late president — who was infamously shot and killed while riding in a presidential motorcade in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 — said his family was not told about the file release before it happened on Tuesday, March 18. However, he claimed one family member - his uncle and President Donald Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - was told.\n\n \"No — THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DID NOT GIVE ANYONE IN PRESIDENT KENNEDY’S FAMILY 'A HEADS UP' ABOUT THE RELEASE a total surprise, and not shocker !!\" Schlossberg wrote on X. \"But @RobertKennedyJr definitely knew.\"\n\n In another X post, Schlossberg retweeted Utah Sen. Mike Lee after Lee asked why it took \"so long\" to release the files. \"You really care about JFK’s legacy? You’re dismantling it. Go ask Bobby for a retweet,\" Schlossberg replied, name-checking his cousin RFK Jr. for a second time.\n\n Schlossberg also criticized the media for its coverage of the release. On his Instagram Stories, he published a picture of CNN anchors discussing the release with the caption, \"You're better than this.\"\n\n Schlossberg, 32, has previously spoken out about Trump’s desire to release the JFK files, accusing Trump of using his family's trauma for political capital.\n\n \"The truth is [a lot] sadder than the myth — a tragedy that didn't need to happen,\" Schlossberg wrote in a Jan. 23 post to X, which he shared on Instagram later that day. \"Not part of an inevitable grand scheme.\"\n\n He added, \"Declassification is using JFK as a political prop, when he's not here to punch back. There's nothing heroic about it.\"\n\n The following day, Schlossberg called out podcaster Joe Rogan for hosting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on an episode where they discussed conspiracies about JFK's assassination.\n\n Schlossberg urged Rogan to have RFK Jr. back on the show once the remaining JFK files were released, in order to ask him \"why he lied to everybody about how the CIA killed President Kennedy, and ask him if he went through all the documents.\"\n\n \"I thought you wanted to actually find out what happened, not just talk about it and make somebody famous so they can parlay that into a Cabinet position,\" he said toward Rogan, referencing his cousin's path to serving as Trump's health secretary.\n\n Prior to RFK Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Schlossberg's mother, Caroline Kennedy, released a scathing open letter that detailed why she believed he was \"unqualified\" for the position.\n\n In addition to a her claims about RFK Jr.'s history of drug abuse and cruelty to animals, Caroline also condemned her cousin for invoking the Kennedy family name throughout his unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign, stating that he “continues to grandstand off my father’s assassination and that of his own father.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​.\n\n \"It’s incomprehensible to me that someone who is willing to exploit his own painful family tragedies for publicity would be put in charge of America’s life and death situations,” she said.\n\n \"Unlike Bobby, I try not to speak for my father, but I am certain that he and my uncle Bobby, who gave their lives in public service to this country, and my uncle Teddy, who devoted his long Senate career to the cause of improving health care, would be disgusted.”","summary":"The only grandson of the late president previously criticized President Donald Trump's call to release the files","url":"https://people.com/jack-schlossberg-reacts-jfk-files-11699057","image":"https://people.com/thmb/E-spFm_7rkCYD6FYPUlrk9Afa1w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1126x300:1128x302)/Jack-Schlossberg-JFK-Declassified-Assassination-Files-012425-25d038416a8d40b7b72ad1cf700d6d24.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:39:30","author":"Daniel S.

The tough warning comes as the Trump administration seeks to ramp up deportations of Venezuelans living illegally in the U.S. and to need a temporary residency program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, which could pave the way for them to lose their legal status. 'WEAPONIZED MIGRATION': US FACES DEADLY CONSEQUENCES WITH MADURO IN POWER, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION WARNS Many of those with protected status migrated to the U.S. amid Venezuela's economic collapse under the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro. \"Venezuela is obligated to accept its repatriated citizens from the U.S. This is not an issue for debate or negotiation,\" Rubio wrote on X. \"Nor does it merit any reward. Unless the Maduro regime accepts a consistent flow of deportation flights, without further excuses or delays, the U.S. will impose new, severe, and escalating sanctions.\" The threat came days after Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump's special envoy tasked with securing the release of six U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela, said the Maduro government had agreed to accept repatriation flights. Maduro agreed to accept his citizens after initially refusing to do so. CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE In February, Trump ended a permit to export oil to allow Chevron to export oil from Venezuela to the U.S. In doing so, Trump noted that Maduro's government had not met benchmarks to promote free and fair elections. The Trump administration is fighting to deport Venezuelan gang members back to their country. Over the weekend, 238 Venezuelan gang members were flown to a high-security prison in El Salvador despite a federal judge’s order temporarily blocking the deportations. During an interview on Fox News Radio, Rubio thanked El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for accepting the migrants. \"Venezuela should be taking them, but they refuse to take them.

Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing campaign pledge.The release of these documents marks a major step toward greater transparency regarding one of the most debated events in American history. President Trump had promised to declassify the remaining files on the Kennedy assassination, and since taking office, his administration has already made some records available.\"People have been waiting for decades for this,\" Trump told reporters on Monday, emphasizing that his administration planned to release \"all of the Kennedy files\" the following day.The Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, wrote on X that “President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency. Today, per his direction, previously redacted JFK Assassination Files are being released to the public with no redactions. Promises made, promises kept.” The newly public records, now available through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), include:Newly released JFK files reportedly reveal that CIA-connected Gary Underhill fled Washington the day after Kennedy’s assassination, claiming a small CIA clique was responsible.Less than six months later, he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound behind his ear—an unusual spot for suicide.Despite the circumstances, his death was officially ruled a suicide.According to the National Archives, all assassination-related files that had been withheld for classification purposes have now been made public. These records can be accessed online or in person at the National Archives' facility in College Park, Maryland.The National Archives is currently working to digitize the Warren Commission's records, making them more accessible to the public. As this process continues, additional documents will be uploaded to the JFK Assassination Records site.President Trump assured the public that his administration aimed to release approximately 80,000 pages of files. \"I don't believe we're going to redact anything,\" he stated, though it remains unclear how many of these pages were previously made available.The push for transparency has been long supported by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of JFK, who has repeatedly called for the full release of documents. He believes his uncle’s assassination may have been part of a larger conspiracy.The newly released documents may provide fresh insights into the Kennedy assassination, fueling further public interest and speculation. As the National Archives continues its digitization efforts, more files will become accessible, bringing America closer to full disclosure of one of the nation’s most scrutinized historical events.","summary":"US President Donald Trump Releases JFK Assassination Files, Here is How You Download Them","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-releases-jfk-assassination-files-here-is-how-you-download-them","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/john-f-kennedy-1742344635683-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:37:24","author":"Digital Desk","authors":["Digital Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":301657440,"title":"Australia joins alliance pledging action on hostages","text":"Representatives from the United States and six allied nations including Australia have pledged to work together to counter global hostage-taking and detentions considered unjust.\n\n\"We are united in our demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,\" the alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday after talks in Montana.\n\nUS special envoy Adam Boehler led the talks on Monday and Tuesday in Big Sky, Montana, with counterparts from Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Israel and the United Kingdom.\n\nThey discussed sharing information about detainees and other collaborative efforts to free their citizens held around the world.\n\n\"We will spare no effort, in accordance with international law, to bring home hostages and unjustly or arbitrarily detained individuals and to deter such future acts,\" the statement said, without providing specifics.\n\nBoehler, who was involved in efforts that led to the freedom of American school teacher Marc Fogel from Russia last month, said in a statement that the gathering was centred on \"how to support individual freedom and stop the hostage takers who try to take it away.\"\n\nThe group vowed to work collectively to \"identify and deploy every diplomatic, economic, and strategic tool at our disposal to bring these individuals home while deterring future such acts,\" a US State Department official said.\n\nA report last August by the James W Foley Legacy Foundation said at least 43 US nationals were being held hostage or wrongfully detained in 16 countries across the world.\n\nIn addition to these people, US officials are working to gain the release of many others considered unjustly detained around the world, including in China, Russia, Venezuela, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nThe State Department official said President Donald Trump has made it a priority to bring Americans home.\n\n\"Anyone engaging in these practices is on notice that the United States is prioritising getting our people back.

Abbas Gallyamov, who worked as Mr Putin's speechwriter during his first two terms as president, said yesterday \"health problems\" may be as a result of an episode as long as two years ago. Footage showed Mr Putin walking stiffly and shaking as he walked to greet key ally Alexander Lukashenko, Belarusian President in March 2022, two weeks into Moscow's invasion of Ukraine . Now, as Mr Putin and US President Donald Trump held a telephone call to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine , Mr Gallyamov spoke to the media about concerns for the 72-year-old Russian leader. \"He definitely has some [health] problems. Journalists are writing about cancer, but what we saw back in 2022 looked more like the consequences of a mini-stroke,\" the source said on Tuesday. Mr Putin and Mr Trump's call centred on \"land and power plants\" and discussed \"dividing up certain assets,\" it is understood. Last week, Mr Putin said he accepts the proposals of a ceasefire but warned that \"there are questions that we need to discuss.\" He continued: \"We need to negotiate with our American colleagues and partners. \"Maybe I'll have a call with Donald Trump . It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire. We are in favour of it, but there are nuances.\" The Independent reported this week that Ukraine has set out its own red lines for a ceasefire. They include: No further territory to be ceded, the return of thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia , the return of thousands of civilians illegally held by Russia, and a need for international security guarantees. But Mr Gallyamov addressed his concerns in an interview with Daily Express , which says speculation around the world leader's health has been rife for some time with some chatter Mr Putin has been diagnosed with cancer. There has been no official confirmation of this. Mr Putin continues to strike bonds with his allies, including Mr Trump. Before their crunch meeting, it was reported the politicians \"are very good friends\" and the two presidents are dedicated to \"strengthening\" their relationship. Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, offered an insight into America's relationship with Russia. She explained that the leaders are focused on building their unison. It comes as the pair are set to discuss the Ukraine war on Tuesday. Mr Trump told reporters ahead of the meeting: “We will see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday. \"I will be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work’s been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end.\"","summary":"Since Vladimir Putin was seen shaking &quot;uncontrollably&quot; during a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, speculation has grown about the world leader's health","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-showing-signs-mini-34887955","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34887989.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Russia-Putin-25077493359589.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:28:42","author":"Bradley Jolly,Charlie Bradley","authors":["Bradley Jolly","Charlie Bradley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.052},{"id":301654758,"title":"Trump leads way towards peace — US secretary of state on Russia-US talks","text":"WASHINGTON, March 19. /TASS/.

Upon taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump issued a presidential order calling for a 90-day freeze on all foreign aid – a central part of USAID’s work.\n\nEstablished in 1961 by an act of Congress, USAID had become the US’s primary arm for distributing foreign assistance abroad.\n\nBut under Trump’s order, only aid that aligned with the president’s foreign policy would be allowed to continue.\n\nMusk became the face of the campaign to close USAID entirely. “USAID is a criminal organization,” he wrote on his social media platform X on February 2, without offering proof. “Time for it to die.”\n\nLater that day, Musk posted another message on X: “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could [have] gone to some great parties. Did that instead.”\n\nBy the end of February, the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, was effectively closed, with employees given only 15 minutes to collect their belongings. An estimated 1,600 workers were fired, and another 4,700 were put on leave.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio eventually announced that 83 percent of all USAID contracts had been cancelled.\n\nTo justify the cuts across government, Musk and Trump have repeatedly accused departments and agencies of having perpetrated “waste” and “fraud”, without offering proof.\n\nGiven that USAID was established as an independent agency under Congress’s Foreign Assistance Act, Judge Chuang ruled that Musk’s actions “likely violates the constitutional principle of Separation of Powers”.\n\nAs part of Tuesday’s injunction, Chuang required DOGE to restore USAID employees’ access to electronic systems and called for the department to restore any deleted emails.\n\nTrump allies, however, quickly slammed Chuang – an appointee of former President Barack Obama – for his temporary injunction.\n\nMusk reposted a social media message from conservative commentator Charlie Kirk which accused Chuang of partisanship. “Indeed”, Musk wrote in a one-word reply.","summary":"A federal court issued an injunction on behalf of USAID contractors and employees who filed a complaint against Musk.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/19/judge-says-musk-and-doge-likely-violated-constitution-in-usaid-shutdown?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25068753056388-1742342677.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:25:34","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":301654688,"title":"The Pentagon is Still Getting a Free Ride in the Administration’s “Efficiency” Drive","text":"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 9: White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after ...

Trump was returning to the White House after spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIt's been more than a month since President Trump told the Department on Government Efficiency (DOGE) to take a close look at the Pentagon.\n\nBut before we evaluate how the review of the Pentagon has gone thus far, it’s important to note that the so-called efficiency drive is nothing of the sort. Wholesale destruction of agencies like the Agency for International Development, layoffs based on how long someone has served in government rather than how effective they are at their job or how important their function is, and threats to reduce popular benefit programs without providing verifiable evidence that there is waste that justifies substantial budget cuts that will hurt millions of people are not characteristics of a genuine efficiency drive.\n\nEfficiency is a cover story for an ill-conceived across-the-board attack on government based on little or no analysis of what works and what doesn’t. It is impossible to implement a genuine efficiency drive when dramatic cuts are made within a matter of weeks – not nearly enough time to engage in thoughtful consideration of what can safely be cut and what is an essential function of government.\n\nWith that as background, we can look at what has been happening at the Pentagon. The announcement this week that the administration will seek to cut 60,000 civilian employees in the department has persuaded some that the efficiency drive at the Pentagon is real. But as large as it sounds, a 60,000 cut, if it is in fact implemented, represents less than 10% of the more than 700,000 civilians who work in the Department of Defense.\n\nThe proposed personnel cuts at the Pentagon are a far cry from what happened to agencies like AID, which had its work force almost completely eliminated, going from 10,000 employees to 300, or the Department of Education, which is slated for closure. And this doesn’t even account for the fact that the Pentagon employs over half a million people as contractors. While DOGE is reviewing contractors as well, there is no indication thus far that their numbers will go down significantly.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users—Do Not Use These Websites\n\n‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be Bad\n\nTesla Stock Slides Another 5% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company’s ‘Sales Woes’\n\nWhat is missing from DOGE’s recommendations about the Pentagon to date is anything that would significantly reduce the revenue of weapons contractors, despite the fact that a number of the systems they build are overpriced, underperforming and unnecessary for dealing with current challenges. And even items like the F-35 combat aircraft that have come under harsh criticism from Elon Musk, the power behind the DOGE, have only been criticized in the context that the funds freed up could be used to buy large quantities of additional drones, not to reduce the Pentagon’s topline budget.\n\nA New York Times analysis found that only a couple of major contractors have had reductions in contract revenue as a result of actions by the DOGE, with General Dynamics suffering a loss of less than one percent and Leidos suffering a 7% loss.\n\nEven if the Trump administration were engaged in a genuine efficiency drive, it would not be getting to the heart of the matter. America has built a war machine that is hugely expensive, but has not prevailed in a conflict in this century – not because of any failure on the part of members of the armed forces, but because of unrealistic expectations of what military force can achieve – like regime change that leads to stable democratic allies versus problematic governments that have done more to sow division and enable extremist groups than they have to provide security and stability in their nations or regions. If one takes a broad definition of waste, the $8 trillion that the Costs of War project at Brown University calculates that America has spent on its post-9/11 wars has largely been wasted.\n\nA genuinely efficient military would be more selective about what conflicts to engage in, more realistic about what force can and cannot accomplish, and more willing to engage in serious diplomacy before intervening militarily in a conflict overseas. Such a military could be smaller, better trained, an armed with simpler, more reliable weapons that can be more easily maintained and replaced than current high tech systems. By all means let’s push the DOGE to cut unnecessary systems within the Pentagon budget, but let’s not lose sight of what is really needed – a new, more realistic military strategy paired with an effort to reduce the role of special interests in shaping our budgets and our foreign policy.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Despite the recent announcement of civilian employee cuts at the Pentagon, the department has dodged the kinds of major reductions imposed on other federal agencies.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2025/03/18/the-pentagon-is-still-getting-a-free-ride-in-the-administrations-efficiency-drive/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67da0e04a07ed796d5b1b351/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:25:15","author":"Contributor,Samuel Corum,William Hartung","authors":["Contributor","Samuel Corum","William Hartung"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.537},{"id":301653004,"title":"New Unilever boss handed £763k to move house as big firms boost packages to attract top talent","text":"THE new boss of UNILEVER is being given £763,000 to move house, The Sun can reveal. \n\nFernando Fernandez will rake in the record “relocation benefits” of any top brass at British-listed companies. \n\nThe Argentinian, who is switching from New York to the UK, was promoted from being the firm’s £1million finance chief to the top job last month in a shock move that saw Hein Schumacher ousted as CEO after less than two years. \n\nConsumer goods giant Unilever, the FTSE 100-listed Magnums and Marmite maker, has already revealed that he is set to receive a basic salary of £1.5million. \n\nHe will also be in line for other perks including an annual bonus worth up to 225 per cent of his pay, equivalent to £3.3million. \n\nAnd he qualifies for a share plan worth up to a whopping 400 per cent of his salary — which could work out at an extra £6million, conditional on his performance. \n\nUnilever’s annual report sheds light on the growing trend for handing over huge sums to bosses to encourage them to move. \n\nIt reveals Mr Fernandez has already been handed £553,000 to relocate and will receive a further £210,000 for his move in the next year.

But he kept some files classified after the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other government agencies said that releasing them could pose national security risks.Thousands of documents related to Kennedy's assassination were also made available to the public during President Joe Biden's administration.Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in July 2023 that 99 percent of records associated with Kennedy's assassination were available for public consumption via NARA. Biden declassified more than 16,000 documents related to the assassination between 2021 and July 2023.Kennedy's assassination and the government's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing him became the source of several conspiracy theories. In response to public demands for more transparency surrounding his death, Congress passed the JFK Records Act of 1992, which mandated that all records related to the assassination be released by October 26, 2017, barring any national security risks.Trump didn't begin declassifying files related to the investigation until after October 2017, citing concerns about sources and methods being compromised.The president said in his January executive order that he has \"now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue.\"\"And although no Act of Congress directs the release of information pertaining to the assassinations of Senator Robert F.

I think there was a breakdown in the communication between the CIA and the FBI, and as a result Oswald slipped through the fingers of American intelligence.”\n\nGillon hypothesized that some materials may remain classified because they contain information about the methods the U.S. used to obtain intelligence – which may be methods they still use today.\n\nVoices: In the JFK files, there’ll be no smoking gun – only bombshells\n\nTuesday 18 March 2025 19:00 , John Kiriakou\n\nAs America braces itself for thousands of declassified CIA documents, former intelligence officer John Kiriakou explains why there isn’t much light left to shed on the presidential assassination – but we should expect intriguing detail about the ‘second gunman’ theory in the killing of his brother, Robert.\n\nWhere do the 'JFK files' come from?\n\nTuesday 18 March 2025 18:30 , Ariana Baio\n\nCongress passed a law requiring documents containing information about John F.

Only a few thousand remain.\n\nKevin Boyle, a professor at Northwestern University told NPR in January that the remainder were “not going to reveal something new” about Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nFredrik Logevall, a JFK biographer, similarly said the documents were not going to “dramatically overturn” history’s understanding of the assassination but that there could be useful information in the materials.\n\nTimeline in document releases so far\n\nTuesday 18 March 2025 15:00 , Ariana Baio\n\n1992: The federal government mandates all assassination-related documents be housed in the NARA and most be released by 2017, barring any exemptions by the president.\n\nJuly 2017: NARA releases 3,810 documents and 17 audio files related to the Kennedy assassination.\n\nOctober 2017: NARA releases 2,891 records related to the Kennedy assassination.

In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,” Reyes wrote. “We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.”\n\nThe judge issued a preliminary injunction requested by attorneys for six transgender people who are active-duty service members and two others seeking to join the military.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life” and is harmful to military readiness.\n\nIn response to the order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy that presumptively disqualifies people with gender dysphoria from military service. Gender dysphoria is the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don’t match. The medical condition has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nPlaintiffs’ attorneys contend Trump’s order violates transgender people’s rights to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nGovernment lawyers argue that military officials have broad discretion to decide how to assign and deploy servicemembers without judicial interference.\n\nThousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the total number of active-duty service members.\n\nIn 2016, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump’s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members. The Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office.\n\nHegseth’s Feb. 26 policy says service members or applicants for military service who have “a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”\n\nThe plaintiffs who sued to block Trump’s order include an Army Reserves platoon leader from Pennsylvania, an Army major who was awarded a Bronze Star for service in Afghanistan and a Sailor of the Year award winner serving in the Navy.\n\nTheir attorneys, from the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLAD Law, said transgender troops “seek nothing more than the opportunity to continue dedicating their lives to defending the Nation.”\n\n“Yet these accomplished service members are now subject to an order that says they must be separated from the military based on a characteristic that has no bearing on their proven ability to do the job,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “This is a stark and reckless reversal of policy that denigrates honorable transgender service members, disrupts unit cohesion, and weakens our military.”","summary":"A federal judge blocked enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender people from military service on Tuesday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/18/us-news/fed-judge-blocks-trump-admin-from-banning-trans-people-from-military-service/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-v7ivvh059-1742342767380.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1742328402&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/p7sxjPxd-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:14:52","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":301651160,"title":"Latest News | VIL Says in Talks with Satcom Players; Will Update at Appropriate Time","text":"New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Telecom operator Vodafone Idea is \"in conversation\" with satcom players to explore potential partneships, a senior company official said.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released,” the page reads.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear whether the material contained any bombshells that could put to rest years of conspiracy theories about the former President’s death.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr., founder of The Black Vault, a website which maintains a massive archive of government files obtained under freedom of information laws, gave a critical first reaction to the jumbled document dump.\n\n“Search box on the 2025 files page is useless/broken … PDFs are still not OCR’d (searchable) … no bulk download like previous releases … no spreadsheet index of records like previous releases,” he wrote on X, adding simply, “Oof.”\n\nMr Kennedy, known as JFK, died on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe official investigation, called the Warren Commission, found former Marine and defector to the Soviet Union Lee Harvey Oswald fired on Mr Kennedy’s motorcade from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nOswald was assassinated two days later in the basement of the Dallas Police headquarters by nightclub operator Jack Ruby.\n\nAppropriately on a trip to Washington DC’s John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the current inhabitant of the White House announced on Monday that a trove of papers concerning his death would be released the next day.\n\n“People have been waiting for decades for this, and I’ve instructed my people … lots of different people, (Director of National Intelligence) Tulsi Gabbard that they must be released tomorrow,” Mr Trump said on Monday.\n\n“I don’t believe we’re going to redact anything,” he added.\n\nMr Trump’s Monday afternoon announcement reportedly led to a scramble at the US Department of Justice with lawyers hurriedly reading hundreds of pages into the early hours to ensure they could be released.\n\nIt was thought as many as 80,000 pages of information on Mr Kennedy’s assassination on could be released.\n\nWhile the 80,000 remaining pages sounds like a lot of documents, it actually represents a tiny amount of the total documentation about the death. The rest of the government held documentation is in the public domain already. \n\nFor instance, the US National Archives has stated that “more than six million pages” of documents, files and photos on the Kennedy assassination are already declassified and available to the public.\n\nFormer president Joe Biden released vast amounts of papers on JFK’s death but held some back due to national security issues.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nJFK’s death has been the subject of conspiracy theories for decades. Indeed, together with the moon landings, alternative histories on his death are almost the original conspiracy theory.\n\nThese theories include that Oswald could have been completely innocent or part of a wider plot. There have been claims there were several shooters and the actual fatal shot may have come from the famous grassy knoll in the vicinity of the motorcade. \n\nNow US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has said that his father Robert Kennedy was sceptical of the Warren Commission’s findings calling it a “shoddy peace of craftsmanship”.\n\nNonetheless, most historians are doubtful the new release will turn up a major change to what we already know.\n\nTalking to the US’ National Public Radio, JFK biographer Fredrik Logevall said he did not believe the new information would “dramatically overturn our understanding of what happened on that terrible day in Dallas”.\n\n“Even if they don’t alter our understanding in this deep way, I think there’s still useful information potentially in these materials.”","summary":"Donald Trump has released thousands of pages of files related to JFK’s assassination, which sparked decades of conspiracy theories.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trump-set-to-reveal-secret-jfk-papers/news-story/d1c1d4e8ec2cc7485c1bdffc90a1178a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/843f60a12b64e6399957b62bad9490c8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:11:56","author":"Benedict Brook In The Us","authors":["Benedict Brook In The Us"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":301654872,"title":"What the Newly Released JFK Files Reveal About U.S. Missteps with India","text":"JFK Files Released: Newly declassified documents from the John F.

She gave the administration until 10 a.m. March 21 to appeal. One minute after that deadline, the order will automatically take effect, she said.\n\nThe court’s order — which follows a lawsuit from more than 20 trans service members — is intended to “maintain the status quo of military policy regarding transgender service that existed immediately before” Trump issued his executive order, Reyes wrote.\n\nJudge Reyes argues that a categorical ban on trans service members in the nation’s military discriminates based on transgender status and sex — and because “it is soaked in animus.”\n\n“Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,” she wrote.\n\nThe president’s January directive claims the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”\n\nThe judge also ordered the Trump administration to maintain and continue the military statuses of the 20 plaintiffs, a group that includes decorated U.S. military service members across all branches.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ service records are “remarkable,” Reyes said during a hearing this month.\n\n“You’re going to get rid of all these very qualified people who the military has spent millions of dollars into training specialized jobs for no other reason than they have had gender dysphoria or they transition,” she said.\n\nAcross a series of lengthy court hearings, Department of Justice lawyers repeatedly appeared to tie themselves in knots under the judge’s questioning. The judge poked holes in the data included in a Department of Defense memo, asked simple questions about the scope of the ban which government lawyers failed to answer, and scolded attorneys for their apparent lack of preparedness.\n\nA memo from Pentagon leadership revealed in court documents on February 26 gave military officials 30 days to identify all trans troops, and all removals “must be completed” no later than June 25. The order also immediately bans access to gender-affirming care for all trans service members.\n\nPentagon guidance claims that “the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”\n\nDuring a hearing in February, the judge condemned the president’s “demeaning,” “biologically inaccurate” and “frankly ridiculous” language in an executive order that revoked federal recognition of trans, nonbinary and intersex people — an order that forms the basis for a flood of other actions from the administration targeting trans Americans.\n\nJudge Reyes suggested that, taken together, Trump’s executive orders against trans people “scream animus,” or are motivated by prejudice.\n\n“Today's decisive ruling speaks volumes,” according Jennifer Levi, GLAD Law’s senior director of transgender and queer rights, which is representing the plaintiffs.\n\n“The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation,” Levi said. “Given the Court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal.”\n\nShannon Minter, legal director with the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the court’s actions “shield our troops from the harmful effects of this irrational ban.”\n\n“It would have ended careers of dedicated transgender servicemembers and created personnel gaps, leaving others to fill critical roles. The ban's harmful impact and rushed implementation show that it was motivated by prejudice,\" Minter said in a statement shared with The Independent.\n\n\"Our plaintiffs include lifelong military personnel who served in combat in Afghanistan, come from multi-generation military families, and have received honors like the Bronze Star,” he added. “This ban is unjustifiable and attacks brave servicemembers, recruits, and families who sacrifice so much for our country.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/judge-blocks-trump-unabashedly-demeaning-225942297.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b9ef85f49ec376942330885da1460f99","video":"","publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:10:33","author":"Kelly Rissman And Alex Woodward","authors":["Kelly Rissman And Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":301651166,"title":"World News | 'Blood and Treasure Spent on War Should Serve People's Needs': US President  Donald Trump on Russia-Ukraine Conflict","text":"Washington DC [US], March 19 (ANI): US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a crucial phone call, during which they discussed the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and agreed on the need for a lasting peace, including a proposed ceasefire in the Black Sea, while also addressing regional stability in the Middle East.\nDuring the conversation, both leaders agreed that improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia could have significant benefits, which could be realized once lasting peace is achieved in the region.\nAlso Read | US President Donald Trump and Russian Counterpart Vladimir Putin Discuss 'Peaceful Resolution of Ukraine Conflict and 30-Day Ceasefire' in Over an Hour-Long Phone Conversation.\nhttps://x.com/PressSec/status/1902049487457071248\n\"Today, President Trump and President Putin spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war.

Their disclosures are the largest insight yet into mass reductions that have become the signature focus of President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.Agency officials were required to file the declarations by Monday night in a legal case brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general which allege that the mass firings were illegal. US District Court Judge James K. Bredar previously granted the attorneys general request to temporarily restrain the Trump administration from fully carrying out the terminations.Many of the roughly 25,000 employees were put on administrative leave following their reinstatement, according to the filings. Some agencies have struggled to notify fired workers that they can come back. An IRS official said they had resorted to sending out certified mail.Agency officials repeatedly warned that complying with Bredar's order could cause chaos, especially if the temporary block is lifted and the workers are fired again. Even if employees can return to work, many officials said in the filings any reinstated employee would have to go through the onboarding process again, requiring them to obtain security badges, complete training, and receive whatever equipment they needed for their jobs. Some of the agencies said they don't have enough office space.The White House targeted probationary employees with less than two years of experience in their roles as early as Inauguration Day. Probationary employees are typically easier to terminate since they lack some civil service protections.The DOGE office was not directly responsible for the Office of Personnel Management memo that prompted agencies to review the status of their probationary employees. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the de facto leader of the DOGE office, has championed mass firings and claimed credit for at least some efforts to reduce the size of government, namely the US Agency for International Development (USAID).Here are the agencies that have been hit the hardest so far, according to the filings.The Treasury Department terminated 7,605 out of roughly 16,663 probationary employees.The IRS is by far the largest affected Treasury agency with 7,315 terminated employees.The Department of Treasury, the second-oldest Cabinet department, manages federal finances, ensures financial security, and, through the IRS, collects taxes.The Agriculture Department terminated roughly 5,714 employees.The department said that on March 12, it reinstated all of the affected employees and put them on administrative leave as part of a phased plan for them to return to work.USDA is responsible for food, nutrition, and rural development.The Department of Health and Human Services terminated 3,248 out of roughly 8,466 probationary and trial period employees. Many of those employees were immediately put on leave, some with no set end date.HHS said it has reinstated 88 employees and extended the leave of 2,855 others. Others were allowed to return to work. Additional employees were reinstated because they were found not to meet the definition of a probationary employee.The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for promoting the health of Americans. Among the largest agencies in HHS are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which focuses on preventing diseases, the FDA, which ensures the safety of food and drugs, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare and helps administer the federal portion of Medicaid.The Department of Veterans Affairs terminated 1,900 of roughly 46,000 probationary employees. After a review, this was narrowed down to 1,683 employees.The VA said it continues to try to notify those 1,683 employees of their reinstatement but has been unable to reach all of them.The Veterans Affairs Department is the second-largest Cabinet agency. It is responsible for healthcare and other services to veterans.The Department of Interior terminated 1,712 employees, including 1,303 probationary workers.The Interior Department said it has canceled terminations for roughly 90% of the 1,710 employees terminated during their probationary or trial period. The department said it will not reinstate two employees who are covered by the order.The Interior Department manages public lands both through the Bureau of Land Management, which awards commercial leases, and the National Parks Service, which manages national parks and many national monuments and historic sites.The Department of Commerce terminated 791 of roughly 9,000 total probationary or trial period employees.The department said 27 employees were reinstated within days of firing \"for various operational reasons.\" The department said it had notified the other 764 employees of their reinstatement.The Commerce Department helps promote economic growth and includes a wide range of agencies, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Census Bureau, the latter of which is responsible for planning and administering the once-a-decade census.According to its filing, the Department of Transportation terminated 788 probationary employees.The department said only 775 were affected by the court order. The remaining employees were either fired for performance reasons (2), already had their terminations rescinded (8), resigned (2), or accepted a deferred resignation program (1).The 775 employees have all been notified of their reinstatement. The department said it would place all affected workers on leave through March 19 to allow time to coordinate their return, including returning government equipment and issuing new ID cards.The Transportation Department is responsible for managing the nation's transportation infrastructure, including agencies like the FAA and Federal Highway Administration.The Department of Energy terminated 555 probationary employees.The department said it had canceled the termination of all of the affected employees and placed them on retroactive leave until their badging and IT status are restored.The Energy Department is responsible for national energy policy and maintaining the US' nuclear infrastructure, including the security of nuclear weapons.The EPA terminated roughly 419 probationary employees.The agency said it has notified all of the affected employees of their reinstatement. Most of the 419 workers have been put on paid leave, though some (\"including students on leave for the school year\") are on unpaid leave.Created in 1970, the EPA is responsible for enforcing environmental laws. The agency says it makes sure Americans have clean air, water, and land.The GSA has terminated roughly 366 of approximately 812 probationary and trial employees.By Monday morning, the GSA said it had reinstated all employees, minus two who declined to return to work.Often called the federal government's landlord, the GSA helps the federal government manage contracting for goods and services.The Department of Homeland Security terminated at least 313 probationary employees. The department did not indicate the number of total probationary workers it terminated because it said those fired for performance or conduct issues were not covered by the order.DHS said it has begun the process of reinstating more than 310 workers. One employee declined to return, while another worker was already in the process of coming back due to a deferred resignation program.Since 2001, DHS has grown to become the third-largest Cabinet agency — it encompasses everything from the Transportation Security Administration and US Customs and Border Protection to the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) terminated 312 of roughly 549 probationary employees.HUD said it has fully reinstated 13 employees. The department said it has begun the reinstatement process for the remaining workers who are being placed on administrative leave temporarily.The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for addressing housing policy and enforcing fair housing laws.The Small Business Administration (SBA) terminated 304 of roughly 700 probationary workers.The SBA said it quickly rehired six workers, five of which remain with the agency. One employee resigned.As for the remaining employees, SBA said had notified all 298 workers of their reinstatement. The agency said 127 workers have been reinstated and put on paid leave. Employees who were on intermittent status (164) have been put into non-pay status and will not receive back pay due to their work schedule.The Small Business Administration is a Cabinet-level agency focused on helping small business owners and entrepreneurs.USAID terminated 270 of 295 probationary employees.USAID says it has notified the affected workers of their reinstatement. If they return to work, they will be placed on administrative leave until further notice.The international aid agency, which had operations worldwide, is different from the other 17 departments and agencies covered by the order in that it has already effectively begun to shut down its operations. USAID previously vacated its DC headquarters. The State Department has absorbed its remaining operations.There are multiple ongoing lawsuits regarding USAID's restructuring and effective gutting.The Department of Labor terminated roughly 170 of approximately 620 probationary and trial employees.The department said all affected employees have either returned to work or voluntarily left the government.The Labor Department is responsible for enforcing federal labor laws, which, according to its website, cover over 165 million workers. The department is responsible for publishing closely-watched data on the economy and employment through the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The FDIC terminated roughly 156 of about 261 probationary employees.The FDIC said in its filing that five employees would have been terminated regardless due to performance/conduct issues. The remaining 151 employees have been reinstated and placed on administrative leave.The FDIC is an independent federal agency funded primarily by fees banks pay.

It came after Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 world championships amid disputed claims that she failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nShe went on to claim gold in the welterweight division in Paris and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is now facing legal action for allowing Khelif to compete.\n\nTrump signed an executive order entitled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports'. The president recently referred to Khelif as a 'male boxer' who had 'transitioned' and 'stole the women's gold medal after brutalizing his female opponent.'\n\nNow, though, the Algerian has hit back at Trump, insisting she will not be 'intimidated'.\n\nImane Khelif says she is not intimidated by Donald Trump and wants to fight at the LA Olympics\n\nThe Algerian boxer who won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics amid a gender firestorm\n\nImane Khelif, the Algerian boxer who won gold at the Paris Olympics amid a bitter gender eligibility row, speaks exclusively to @stevescott_itv about aiming to retain her title at LA 2028, why she isn’t intimidated by President Trump and how the ‘campaign’ against her in Paris… pic.twitter.com/aFNU13yeQf\n— ITV News (@itvnews) March 18, 2025\n\n'The US President issued a decision related to transgender policies in America.

It was a victory that held significance on every level—ethical, athletic, and even in terms of sportsmanship.' \n\nBut Khelif has revealed how the 'bullying' by big names such as Musk and Rowling left her mother 'going to the hospital almost every day' and almost saw her 'fall into a spiral of depression'.\n\n'When I saw that even heads of state, famous figures, and former athletes were speaking about me without having verified facts, it shocked me,' Khelif said.\n\n'It affected me mentally, as well as my family. Even my mother was deeply affected—she was going to the hospital almost every day. \n\nShe added: 'This went beyond just a sporting issue or a game...

In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,” Reyes wrote. “We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.”\n\nThe judge issued a preliminary injunction requested by attorneys for six transgender people who are active-duty service members and two others seeking to join the military.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life” and is harmful to military readiness.\n\nIn response to the order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy that presumptively disqualifies people with gender dysphoria from military service. Gender dysphoria is the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don’t match. The medical condition has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nPlaintiffs’ attorneys contend Trump’s order violates transgender people’s rights to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nGovernment lawyers argue that military officials have broad discretion to decide how to assign and deploy servicemembers without judicial interference.\n\nThousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the total number of active-duty service members.\n\nIn 2016, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump’s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members. The Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office.\n\nHegseth’s Feb. 26 policy says service members or applicants for military service who have “a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”\n\nThe plaintiffs who sued to block Trump’s order include an Army Reserves platoon leader from Pennsylvania, an Army major who was awarded a Bronze Star for service in Afghanistan and a Sailor of the Year award winner serving in the Navy.\n\nTheir attorneys, from the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLAD Law, said transgender troops “seek nothing more than the opportunity to continue dedicating their lives to defending the Nation.”\n\n“Yet these accomplished servicemembers are now subject to an order that says they must be separated from the military based on a characteristic that has no bearing on their proven ability to do the job,” plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “This is a stark and reckless reversal of policy that denigrates honorable transgender servicemembers, disrupts unit cohesion, and weakens our military.”\n\nGovernment attorneys said the Defense Department has a history of disqualifying people from military service if they have physical or emotional impairments, including mental health conditions.\n\n“In any context other than the one at issue in this case, DoD’s professional military judgment about the risks of allowing individuals with physical or emotional impairments to serve in the military would be virtually unquestionable,” they wrote.\n\nPlaintiffs’ attorneys say Trump’s order fits his administration’s pattern of discriminating against transgender people.\n\nFederal judges in Seattle and Baltimore separately paused Trump’s executive order halting federal support for gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19. Last month, a judge blocked prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men’s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy under another Trump order.\n\nTrump also signed orders that set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender and that intend to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.\n\n“From its first days, this administration has moved to strip protections from transgender people across multiple domains — including housing, social services, schools, sports, healthcare, employment, international travel, and family life,” plaintiffs’ lawyers wrote.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst and Gene Johnson contributed to this story.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – A federal judge blocked enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court Halts Trump Administration&#8217;s Attempt to Ban Transgender Individuals from Military Service first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/court-halts-trump-administrations-attempt-to-ban-transgender-individuals-from-military-service/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/4RTOXPTYPNDTZOU2D2IRILKN6A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:07:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":301647986,"title":"WWE Drastically Cuts Price of Hulk Hogan WrestleMania VIP Experience","text":"Professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has had a rough 2025 to say the least.More Pro Wrestling: WWE Charging Thousands Of Dollars For John Cena LuncheonAfter getting booed out of the arena at the Netflix premiere of Monday Night Raw, multiple current and former WWE Superstars have shared negative opinions of Hogan.Now, it seems that this negative press has affected the Hulkster's stock in the WWE Universe.During WrestleMania 41 in Las Vegas, NV, wrestling fans can purchase tickets to a VIP experience called the \"WrestleMania 41 Real American Suite.\"The Real American Suite offers plenty of unique experiences, including a meet-and-greet and photo opportunity with Hogan, an exclusive souvenir, a Topgolf event with The Miz, and Priority Pass WWE World & Superstore Access.WWE fans can access all of this for the price of $6950 plus tax.

But there will be no let-up in the bitter urban and trench warfare along the eastern frontline, nor will the Ukrainian army be allowed to complete its retreat from Kursk without bombardment. The meat-grinder will grind on.\n\nIt is not clear what penalties Russia will face if it breaches the pact to halt rocket attacks on energy facilities. The cost to Ukraine, however, of any failure to obey the ceasefire is all too obvious.\n\nAmerica, which has already suspended the sharing of intelligence once with Ukraine, could withdraw permission for the use of any of the munitions it has donated, including powerful ATACMS ballistic missiles and F-16 fighter jets. A substantial percentage of the equipment Europe provides to Ukraine is also manufactured in the US – and could be rendered useless if Trump so chooses. And it is not only this that risks debilitating Ukraine. Putin has issued a savage set of preconditions to a lasting peace, including the ‘complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv’ – a condition which, if met, would leave Ukraine extremely vulnerable.\n\nNegotiations are expected to begin immediately, though it is not clear who will be present other than Russian and American diplomats. The question for the coming weeks is how much the US is prepared to concede in exchange for Moscow’s co-operation in the Middle East, for instance.\n\nDuring the course of yesterday’s 90-minute phone call, Trump and Putin agreed that Iran should never be in a position to obliterate Israel. They also discussed holding a symbolic ice hockey match between Russia and the US – a canny suggestion from the Russian president. He knows Trump reveres 1970s president Richard Nixon, who used table tennis to break the ice with China, a practice that went down in history as ‘ping-pong diplomacy’.\n\nPutin will be hoping that, while Russia consolidates its military gains in eastern Ukraine over the next 30 days, Zelensky will come under increasing pressure from his domestic critics. Some have accused him of caving in to America after his humiliation in the Oval Office, others claim he is dragging out the war.\n\nIn the meantime, Britain and Europe can only sit and watch.

There are revised targets in the programme for government of 43,000 and 48,000 for next year and 2027 respectively.\n\nHowever, the Central Bank said housing completion forecasts for 2026 and 2027 are 40,000 and 44,000 respectively.\n\nThe Central Bank pointed to several factors, including low productivity in the construction sector, delays in utility connection, delays in the planning system and a shortage of zoned and serviced land in high-demand areas.\n\nAnd while housing commencements rose by almost 69,000 units in 2024, there is uncertainty over the proportion of these commencements that are likely to result in completed dwellings in the period between now and 2027. \n\nThe Central Bank has said that in order to “unlock” housing, there needs to be a “more investable and sustainable construction sector, where housing that is affordable for renters and buyers alike is delivered at viable cost”.\n\nIt said that residential development could be turned into a sector that is more attractive to investment by incentivising more productivity, scale and modern methods of construction in the sector, and incentivising the “most active use of available land for residential purposes”.\n\nIt also called for “maximising of the available land for residential construction through adequate public infrastructure delivery and a more effective planning regime, especially in urban areas”.\n\nTariff threat\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank has warned that the threat of tariffs “presents a very different landscape for the Irish economy” than has existed in recent years.\n\nIn a media briefing, Robert Kelly, the Central Bank’s Director of Economics and Statistics, noted that Donald Trump’s tariff threats are subject to change and that this creates a “real challenge” and adds to uncertainty.\n\nThis uncertainty in Ireland was described as being higher than that caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though not as high that brought on by Brexit.\n\nKelly said global economies are impacted by this uncertainty and that Irish and EU leaders need to engage and co-ordinate their response.\n\nHe added that the impacts of any tariffs on Ireland would “depend on detail” and how the EU responds to tariffs.\n\nExport growth of 5% has been revised down “moderately” from 5.1% in the Central Bank’s first quarterly bulletin, and this growth is expected to be supported by a “continued expansion in pharmaceutical and ICT services exports”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis “momentum” in the pharmaceutical sector itself is due largely to the exports of weight-loss drugs to the US.\n\nHowever, the Central Bank cautioned that this forecast is “sensitive to any further deterioration in global trade, including from potential new tariffs”.\n\nDuring Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s visit to the White House last week, Donald Trump said Ireland is “lucky” Trump wasn’t president when US pharmaceutical companies moved to Ireland as he would have placed 200% tariffs on them.\n\nTrump said “Ireland has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grip” and pointed to this as an example of Ireland taking “advantage” of the US.\n\nTrump also threatened to impose 200% tariffs on wine, champagne and other alcoholic products from EU Union countries.\n\nHe threatened the move in retaliation against an EU decision to impose 50% levies on US-produced whiskey.\n\nKelly remarked that a “significant rise in policy uncertainty in recent months is the most prominent feature of the current economic outlook”. \n\nHe said this rise in uncertainty “centres on the shift in geoeconomic relationships brought on by the signalled policy stances of the new US Administration”, as well as the responses from other major economies. \n\n“Widespread announcements and implementation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and the need for Europe to evolve geopolitical priorities, present a very different landscape for the Irish economy than we have had in recent years,” said Kelly.\n\nIn its bulletin, the Central Bank warned that Ireland’s “continued concentrated exposures to foreign multinationals, particularly pharmaceuticals, introduces key sector risk to the forecast”.\n\n“Should further evidence of trade tensions or a widespread increase in tariffs begin to emerge, then the outlook for the Irish economy would be weaker than in the current baseline forecast,” said the Central Bank bulletin.\n\nDomestic economy performing well\n\nHowever, while the outlook is challenged by global events, the Central Bank said that the domestic economy “has for the most part continued to perform well”.\n\nThis is most evident in the labour market, with the unemployment rate remaining at historical lows.\n\nBut “elevated economic uncertainty in recent months” has prompted a the Central Bank to issue a “modest downward revision to the outlook”.\n\nModified Domestic Demand is now forecast to grow by 2.7% in 2025 and 2.4% on average in 2026 and 2027, a reduction of 0.5% from the previous Central Bank bulletin.\n\nModified Domestic Demand (MDD) is a metric commonly used in Ireland as it excludes the economic activities of multinationals.\n\nThe Central Bank added that any “potential impact of a loss of excess corporation tax receipts” highlights the need to “broaden out the tax base”.\n\nIt also noted that while public finances have benefited from “surging corporation tax receipts in recent years”, it is “disconnected from domestic economic activity and drawn from a very concentrated and narrow base”.\n\nMeanwhile, households’ real incomes are forecast to continue to rise, supported by further growth in employment and with inflation expected to remain below 2% on average over the forecast horizon to 2027.\n\nHeadline inflation is projected to rise to 2.2% in 2025 before declining to 2.1% in 2026, and further easing to 1.4% in 2027.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of

Earlier, a report from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service also confirmed it in January this year. \n\nBut new details from the WMO’s State of the Global Climate report show how this heat reshaped the planet, unleashing permanent damage to oceans, glaciers, and ecosystems, and displacing millions from their homes.\n\n“It’s frightening to see our climate report looking so dire yet again,” said Dr Linden Ashcroft, a senior lecturer in climate science at The University of Melbourne. \n\n “I’ve been providing comments like these for my entire career, and honestly, I’m not quite sure what to do next. Scream these findings from the tops of buildings? Write my comments in capitals? Saying all this while dancing on TikTok? I don’t know. But unless we see real climate leadership from governments and businesses, I will save this response and send it through again next year.”\n\nCrossing 1.5C for a single year doesn't mean the Paris Agreement, which uses long-term averages to track warming, has failed. But scientists warn this year's extreme heat is a clear sign the planet is heading toward dangerous territory. \n\nDr Paul Read, director of the Future Emergency Resilience Network at UTS, said the world needs to brace for a \"1.5 world,\" with a third of the Arctic nearing tipping points and permafrost melting three times faster than elsewhere. \n\n“Your average five-year-old now faces a future with seven times more heatwaves, triple the floods, droughts and crop failures, double the wildfires,” he said. \n\nHowever, WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo stressed the difference between one-year spikes and longer-term trends.\n\n“While a single year above 1.5C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies and to the planet.”\n\nThe report shows atmospheric carbon dioxide reached 420 parts per million, the highest level in at least 800,000 years, with no signs of slowing down. This rising concentration is driving global heating, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification, and threatening marine ecosystems and fisheries globally.\n\nDr Xuebin Zhang, principal research scientist at CSIRO Environment, warned that these past emissions mean some changes are now unavoidable. \n\n“Ocean heat content will continue to increase, leading to long-term sea-level rise even if emissions are significantly reduced,” Dr Zhang said. \n\n“This committed response, driven by past greenhouse gas emissions, must be accounted for in any long-term climate adaptation planning.”\n\nWMO documented an unprecedented surge in ocean temperatures in 2024, which reached record highs for the eighth consecutive year. Ocean heat content is now rising twice as quickly as the average from 1960 to 2005. This heat trapped in the ocean is expected to drive sea-level rise for centuries, even if emissions drop sharply today.\n\nSea levels rose 4.7 mm per year between 2015 and 2024, more than double the rate recorded in the decade after satellite measurements began, according to the WMO. This rapid rise now poses existential threats to low-lying coastal communities around the world.\n\n“Data for 2024 show that our oceans continued to warm, and sea levels continued to rise. The frozen parts of Earth’s surface, known as the cryosphere, are melting at an alarming rate: glaciers continue to retreat, and Antarctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent ever recorded. Meanwhile, extreme weather continues to have devastating consequences around the world,” said Ms Saulo. \n\nTemperatures were boosted in the first half of 2024 by the natural El Niño climate phenomenon, but remained very high in the second half of the year even when El Niño dissipated. \n\nThe WMO report says the largest three-year loss of glacier mass ever recorded was from 2022 to 2024. Antarctic sea ice shrank to its second-lowest extent on record, compounding the rapid loss of Arctic ice, where the 18 lowest extents have all occurred in the past 18 years.\n\nDr Andrew King, associate professor in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said the impacts of this warming are now unmistakable. \n\n\"Not only was 2024 the hottest year on record for the planet but we also saw record warm oceans and record high sea levels. Humanity's fingerprint can also be seen in the loss of sea ice and glacier mass, in the acidification of the ocean, and in the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events.\"\n\nExtreme weather events linked directly to the climate crisis led to the highest number of people displaced since 2008. Communities around the world faced destructive storms such as Typhoon Yagi in Vietnam and the Philippines, Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States, and Cyclone Chido in Mozambique and Malawi, all of which were found to be influenced by climate crisis. \n\nEarlier reports have also found how global heat driven by greenhouse gas emissions intensified rainfall in Spain and led to monstrous flash floods. \n\nFood security in 18 countries deteriorated significantly due to these compounded impacts, exacerbated by floods, droughts, and severe heatwaves.\n\n“This year’s WMO report makes it clear: climate change is no longer a distant threat - it is a lived reality, displacing record numbers of people, straining food systems, and disrupting lives,” said associate professor Michele Barnes, an expert in climate adaptation at The University of Sydney.\n\nThese warnings come ahead of crucial international climate negotiations in November 2025, where countries are expected to submit new, stronger emissions targets to the UN amid United States president Donald Trump’s decision to pull his country out of the Paris Agreement and rollbacks of environmental regulations to boost fossil fuel production. \n\nScientists warn that current political responses are falling dangerously short of what's required. Professor James Renwick from Victoria University of Wellington said despite alarming evidence, there's little sign political leaders are taking climate commitments seriously. \n\n\"All extremely worrying, yet apparently of little concern to the world’s policy-makers, since there is no sign the world is living up to the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5-2°C,\" he said. \"Our busy day-to-day activities have consequences that will last for centuries, even millennia.\" \n\nExperts say the world needs an immediate shift from recognition to decisive action. \n\n“Incrementalism is no longer an option,” professor Martina Linnenluecke, director of the centre for climate risk and resilience at the University of Technology Sydney, said. \n\nDr Linnenluecke added that insurance companies are already retreating from high-risk areas, showing \"that climate risks are no longer hypothetical but economic realities.\"\n\nProfessor Nick Golledge, also from Victoria University of Wellington’s Antarctic Research Centre, added that stabilising emissions at current levels won't be enough, and much tougher policies are urgently required.\n\n\"Stringent mitigation is now critically important if we are to retain a habitable climate for our planet,\" he warned.\n\nDespite these warnings, the WMO says it is still possible to limit the damage by quickly scaling up climate services and early warning systems globally. Right now, only half the countries in the world have adequate protection against climate-related disasters. \n\n\"We are making progress but need to go further and need to go faster,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. \"Investment in weather, water and climate services is more important than ever to meet the challenges and build safer, more resilient communities.\"","summary":"Scientists warn the impacts seen in 2024 will be impossible to reverse","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/wmo-state-of-climate-report-2024-b2717327.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/05/19/09/GettyImages-2192352117.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hHMUVOWG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:05:12","author":"Stuti Mishra","authors":["Stuti Mishra"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":301648714,"title":"Canada, Australia developing new military radar system","text":"By Max Saltman and Paula Newton, CNN\n\n(CNN) — Canada and Australia are planning to jointly develop a new military radar system in the Arctic amid a global surge of interest in the region, according to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who warned that Canada’s “adversaries are increasingly emboldened.”\n\n“Our government will be working with our longstanding defense and security partners, Australia, to build a new long range over-the-horizon military radar system,” Carney told reporters in Iqaluit, Nunavut at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n“This is an investment of more than $6 billion in the most advanced and efficient radar system,” Carney continued, adding that the new installation “will enable Canada to detect and respond to both air and maritime threats over our Arctic faster and from further away.”\n\n“It will most fundamentally keep all Canadians safe,” Carney said.\n\nAny kind of new Canadian defense infrastructure in the Arctic would likely have to be compatible with NORAD, a key US-Canadian defense agreement.\n\nOnly eight countries have territory within the strategically and environmentally sensitive Arctic region – Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States – and competition for clout is intensifying.\n\nCanada, currently in the midst of its worst diplomatic spat with the United States in years, collaborates on security with its southern neighbor but has also long disagreed over the extent of Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic. Canada insists that the Northwest Passage through Arctic waters, for instance, lies exclusively within Canadian territory, while the US, asserts that the sea lane is in international waters.\n\nMeanwhile, China and Russia have been coordinating activity in the Arctic. In July, the US Department of Defense warned that “growing cooperation” between Russia and China in the region has the “potential to alter the Arctic’s stability and threat picture.”\n\nUS and Canadian forces intercepted Russian and Chinese bombers flying together near Alaska that same month, while the nations’ two navies have operated together in international waters off the Alaskan coast in 2022 and 2023, according to the US military.\n\nAnd as US President Donald Trump doubles down on his interest in controlling Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory in the region, Denmark has also been investing more in regional security, saying in January that it would spend 14.6 billion Danish kroner ($2.05 billion) to boost its own military capabilities in the Arctic.\n\nCNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
