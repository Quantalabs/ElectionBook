and at the centre of his heart is Nicola who he loves very dearly, but also the Peltz family who have really stuck by his side. He wanted to recognise them all, and was determined to do them all justice.' \nNews of the 'heartfelt tribute' to billionaire Nelson Peltz, 83, and wife Claudia, 70, will no doubt add to the pain of the Beckham family amid their estrangement from Brooklyn, with it said that no such tribute was given for his own parents.\nIn addition to his immediate family, Brooklyn's grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles were also absent and only found out about the wedding vow renewal by reading it online. \n\nView gallery\n\nIn fact, none of the Beckham family were invited to Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewal, which was officiated by her billionaire father Nelson, and took place at his lavish Westchester estate \n\nView gallery\n\nBillionaire heiress Nicola has previously been accused of 'isolating' Brooklyn from not only his family, but his friends too\n\nEXCLUSIVE Inside spoiled lives of ultimate nepo babies Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz \nIt comes as Brooklyn is reportedly 'heartbroken' over the way his wife Nicola is being 'painted as a viper' within their ongoing family feud.\nBillionaire heiress Nicola has previously been accused of 'isolating' Brooklyn from not only his family, but his friends too.\nNew sources allege Brooklyn is not being held from making his own decisions and is 'devastated' over the way his wife is being portrayed. \nA source told The Mirror: 'It’s so rooted in misogyny that all of the heat for his parents not being invited is on Nicola. \n'Everyone seems to forget that Brooklyn is an adult man and fully capable of speaking out. Nicola would have respected all that he chose. \n'It breaks Brooklyn’s heart to see his wife being painted as this vixen and viper.'\nInsiders previously told Daily Mail that Brooklyn's parents are concerned his wife Nicola holds disproportionate sway in her marriage to their son.\nBrooklyn and Nicola's vow renewal was a glamorous affair packed with family, fashion and friends earlier this month. \nAs more pictures of both the big day and the after-party come to light, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the festivities were fairly one-sided - with most of the guestlist comprising Brooklyn's post-Nicola peers and pals.\nThe lack of Brooklyn's side sparked widespread chat on social media, including comments from fans who likened their relationship to that of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - after the royal turned his back on his family and moved to the US. \nIt was recently claimed that Brooklyn has also cut ties with all of his celebrity pals from the UK, in favour of Nicola's own inner circle.\nAbsent from the event were former members of Brooklyn's entourage - including fellow nepobabies Rocco Richie and Gordon Ramsay's brood, as well as Anais Gallagher. \nIt appears Brooklyn isn't in contact with several of them anymore, as he no longer follows Anais, Rocco or Holly Ramsay on Instagram, and vice versa - despite many of them still following Brooklyn's brothers. \nA source told The Sun: 'It seems like a real shutdown - Brooklyn has no contact with friends from his former life in the UK.\n'Rocco, Selena, the Ramsay kids - none of them have even liked the wedding pics after Nicola posted, let alone commented to congratulate them.\n'Things have gone very cold with his old friends - it's like the marriage to Nicola meant he started a whole new life with new people around him.\n'It's really sad but clearly people have sensed a shift in his life and priorities.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicola Peltz packs on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham as her ever-present spouse joins her on set for her role as a bikini-clad influencer who stirs up family drama\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nPhotos show female stunt double 'smiling' on set while rehearsing 'rape' scene on Kevin Costner's Horizon series as he files to dismiss her lawsuit\n\nNicola Peltz packs on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham as her ever-present spouse joins her on set for her role as a bikini-clad influencer who stirs up family drama\n\nZoe Kravitz stuns in a plunging halterneck gown with Austin Butler at Caught Stealing screening in London after sparking romance rumours\n\nThis is what Katie Price told me after her toxic split from Peter Andre and what really sparked her new feud with daughter Princess: KATIE HIND\n\nPeter Andre's wife Emily left 'hurt' by Katie Price's 'disgusting' swipe at her children in bombshell cash-counting video with Princess: 'It's a new low'\n\nBeaches, history, waterparks, golf...

He's such a good, good kid.'\nPeter went onto share he's had to 'let go of the reins' as Princess reached adulthood, admitting he was a 'strict' parent during their upbringing.\nHe told Daily Mail: 'This is the hard bit, because I have to be honest, trying to cut that umbilical cord at 18, some people let go [more easily].\n'I know I had to let go of the reins a bit, and that it was not easy. It's scary because it's still your baby.\n'They still say things that they've said when they were 10 or 1, like, they might be grown up in actual age, but they're still your baby.\n'And yeah, OK, I could have been considered a bit of a strict dad, but I think I'm all right now. I'm, I'm chilled out a lot more now.\n'But of course, I just wanted to be safe and, you know, you try and keep the innocence as long as you can with them, and then, you just got to realise that they've got to live life.'\n\nView gallery\n\nSpeaking to Daily Mail, Peter said he was wary of letting Princess appear in her own show before she 'got to an age where she could do it herself' (pictured with son Junior in 2022)\n\nPrincess Andre admits not being over her previous relationship\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:35\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nKatie responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday.\nRumours of a 'rift' between Katie and their daughter Princess have been growing in recent weeks after Katie didn't attend Princess's 18th birthday party, or appear on the nepo baby's fly-on-the-wall ITV television series.\nKatie later claimed that it was her daughter's management who had told her not to appear on the show.\nPeter shared his side of the story on Thursday, explaining: 'For sixteen years, I have stayed silent in the face of repeated lies from my ex-wife and her family, out of respect for my children and loved ones, but staying silent has been incredibly frustrating. That ends today.\n'The latest comments about my children's welfare and living arrangements compel me to set the record straight. For well-documented reasons, and for their safety, Junior and Princess came into my care in 2018 and remained with me until they reached adulthood.\n'In 2019, the family courts issued a legally binding order to enforce this arrangement. I have never made this public before, out of respect for my children.\n'In 2011 and 2015, publicly documented court cases found my ex-wife had made false claims. She was ordered to pay substantial damages and legal costs, and to apologise to me and my management. The same falsehoods are being repeated today.\n'Unfortunately, there are many more lies and baseless accusations I have yet to address. Those will now be dealt with in the coming months.'\n\nView gallery\n\nPeter's chat with Daily Mail coincided with his role in Channel 5's upcoming series The Sunshine Murders alongside Stephanie Beacham (pictured) \n\nView gallery\n\nThe father-of-five added that he's found it hard to 'let go' of his eldest daughter after she turned 18 earlier this year\n\nView gallery\n\nPeter and his ex-wife Katie Price are currently locked in a bitter feud after he hit out at her 'baseless lies over the last 16 years' in a blistering statement on Thursday \n\nView gallery\n\nKatie later responded to Peter's bombshell statement with a bizarre Instagram post about 'fake Sinners who play the victim' on Friday \n\nPrincess Andre breaks her silence on her parents' bitter feud\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:31\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nPeter went onto tell Daily Mail he's instilled 'politeness' into his two eldest kids Princess and Junior during their upbringing, after receiving some helpful advice from his wife Emily, who he married in 2015.\nHe said: 'I used to annoy the hell out of them when I used to say, when someone says, how are you, you don't just say good. You say, \"I'm good, thank you. How are you?\" Always ask that.\n'One of the things with politeness, and listen, I've been in my teens and I've grown up, I'm 52 now and you know, my parents were so strict. One of the big things was manners. Always manners it's like such an important thing.\n'And yeah, we've got to be protective of our daughters and sisters. But I realised one very, very big thing that Emily taught me probably about seven years, six years ago.\n'She said to me, \"you can't treat one different than the other. Whatever rules you have for one, you have for the other\".\n'And it was like a light bulb moment because I remember my sister being so, we were so protective over her that we didn't let her do anything. \n'And actually, just because we were like that as kids, because that's what we were told, as I've gotten older, I thought, yeah, no, you're right, you've got to treat them all the same, all of them the same.'\nWhile Peter's eldest children regularly post on social media, the musician admitted it'll be wholly different when it comes to his three children with wife Emily, Theo, eight, Amelia, 10, and Arabella, 16 months. \nHe said: 'This is the difference that when social media first came out, so when Princess and Junior were little kids, obviously there was no social media.\n'Then when social media came out, you all went along with it, not knowing the dangers, just went with it because it was new and everyone was doing it and we were all doing it. Posting pictures of everyone and it's, and that was just how it went.\n'It's only been really, I think, in the last one or two years that we've realised the dangers of what, you know, AI is doing now, because AI was definitely not around.\n'But what AI's, what they can do with things on social media now, we're just like, \"oh my God\".\n'So, the same rules will apply to the little ones, where it'll be like they're not really allowed to do anything till they're 16, but, the difference is that Emily's really adamant on social media with them, like, really adamant that they're not allowed to have it.\n'So I'm like, I understand now that times are different, and we have to sort of go with that. \n'So the rules will apply the same, but we'll probably be a lot more strict on things like social media. But then again, by the time they become teenagers, it might be a different world.'\n\nView gallery\n\nRumours of a 'rift' between Katie and Princess have been growing in recent weeks after Katie failed to appear in her ITV series, but she insisted this was due to her daughter's management\n\n Katie Price releases defiant statement in response to Alex Reid's cash-counting video \nPeter's chat with Daily Mail coincided with his role in Channel 5's upcoming series The Sunshine Murders, which is set to be broadcast on the channel next month.\nThe star, who plays a doctor tasked with examining victims of gruesome murders, said the role, which he filmed in Greece, has made him more inclined to pursue other acting roles in the future.\nHe said: 'Yes, absolutely. But I think for me, you know, I'm one of these people that studied acting as a kid and then I did music because I got signed up at 16 on a live television show, which I never expected, and then I just ran with it.\n'I always said that when I get to my 40s, I'm going to move back into acting, and I've done a lot of short films in America, but they were never released, they were at like film festivals and stuff like that. And then I've done a couple of new features of them.\n'It's definitely the area I'm gonna go in, but music's always my first love in.'\nThe Sunshine Murders will air on Channel 5 next month. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPeter Andre reveals he was 'very strict' about what his daughter Princess could include in her ITV series as he admits he's found it hard to 'let go' of her amid feud with ex Katie Price\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nPhotos show female stunt double 'smiling' on set while rehearsing 'rape' scene on Kevin Costner's Horizon series as he files to dismiss her lawsuit\n\nNicola Peltz packs on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham as her ever-present spouse joins her on set for her role as a bikini-clad influencer who stirs up family drama\n\nZoe Kravitz stuns in a plunging halterneck gown with Austin Butler at Caught Stealing screening in London after sparking romance rumours\n\nThis is what Katie Price told me after her toxic split from Peter Andre and what really sparked her new feud with daughter Princess: KATIE HIND\n\nPeter Andre's wife Emily left 'hurt' by Katie Price's 'disgusting' swipe at her children in bombshell cash-counting video with Princess: 'It's a new low'\n\nBeaches, history, waterparks, golf...

Adam Schiff, a top target of President Donald Trump’s political wrath, formed a legal defense fund last week, according to documents reviewed by NOTUS.\n\n“It’s clear that Donald Trump and his MAGA allies will continue weaponizing the justice process to attack Senator Schiff for holding this corrupt administration accountable,” Schiff spokesperson Marisol Samayoa told NOTUS. “This fund will ensure he can fight back against these baseless smears while continuing to do his job.”\n\nThe legal defense fund, which was formed on Thursday, comes as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts against Schiff, who oversaw a congressional investigation into alleged Russian interference in Trump’s election in 2016 and a congressional probe into Trump’s alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election in 2021. News of the legal fund was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nLast week, Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate Schiff for leading the investigation into the president’s alleged connections with Russia.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel also sent Congress declassified whistleblower statements accusing Schiff of leaking classified documents in 2016 to benefit then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nSchiff’s office said the claims are false and politically motivated.\n\n“These baseless smears are based on allegations that were found to be not reliable, not credible, and unsubstantiated from a disgruntled former staffer who was fired by the House Intelligence Committee for cause in early 2017, including for harassment and potentially compromising activity on official travel for the Committee,” a spokesperson for Schiff’s office told NOTUS.\n\nTrump has also targeted Schiff on other grounds. In July, the president accused Schiff of engaging in a “sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud,” as he wrote in Truth Social. Soon after Trump made the accusation, the DOJ opened an investigation into Schiff’s alleged fraud.\n\n“The allegations against Senator Schiff are transparently false, stale, and long debunked,” Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney in New York and Schiff’s lawyer for this case, wrote in a statement sent to NOTUS on Tuesday. “The bias here is glaring.”\n\nDave Levinthal, a contributing editor at NOTUS and investigative journalist, contributed to this story.\n\nThis story was produced as part of a partnership between NOTUS — a publication from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute — and NEWSWELL, home of Times of San Diego, Santa Barbara News-Press and Stocktonia.","summary":"The senator’s office said the fund “will ensure he can fight back against these baseless smears while continuing to do his job.”","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/08/19/adam-schiff-forms-legal-defense-fund-to-prepare-for-trump-attacks/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24283023496401-scaled-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 00:50:27","author":"Damian Dovarganes,Samuel Larreal • NOTUS","authors":["Damian Dovarganes","Samuel Larreal • NOTUS"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":352326098,"title":"Palestine and Israel beauty queens to compete in Miss Universe pageant for first time since Hamas invasion","text":"A Palestinian and an Israeli beauty queen will go head-to -head in this year's annual Miss Universe pageant. \n\nNadeen Ayoub, 27, will be the competition's first Miss Palestine - a title she gained in 2022 and has promised to carry 'the voice of a people who refuse to be silenced' into the contest.\n\nIn an Instagram post she wrote: 'Today, I step onto the Miss Universe stage not just with a title but with a truth... \n\n'I represent every Palestinian woman and child whose strength the world needs to see. We are more than our suffering — we are resilience, hope and the heartbeat of a homeland that lives on through us.'\n\nShe will likely have an Israeli competitor as Israel has sent contestants to the competition since 1952.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organisation confirmed that Ms Ayoub will be competing in the pageant in November, along with 130 other countries and territories. \n\n'The Miss Universe Organisation proudly welcomes delegates from across the globe, celebrating diversity, cultural exchange and the empowerment of women,' it said.\n\n'Ms Ayoub, an accomplished advocate and model from Palestine, embodies the resilience and determination that define our platform.' \n\nShe previously represented Palestine in the 2022 Miss Earth beauty pageant in the Philippines, where she came third.\n\nThe beauty queen who lives between Dubai and Ramallah in the West Bank told The National newspaper in the United Arab Emirates: 'There hasn’t been another Miss Palestine since 2022, due to the genocide.'\n\nIn July, Melanie Shiraz was crowned Miss Israel at a competition in Miami, Florida. \n\nThe entrepreneur told the Jerusalem Post: 'I want to show people, both in and outside of Israel, that this title can be a force for connection, for understanding and for positive change.\n\n'It’s about far more than beauty — it’s about making our people proud by standing for something that matters.'\n\nMiss Universe is one of the four major global beauty pageant brands, alongside Miss Earth, Miss World and Miss International.\n\nUntil 2015, it was owned by Donald Trump but since 2022 has been owned by Thai JKN Global group. \n\nIt comes as Hamas said on Monday it had accepted a new proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a hostage return deal as the Israeli Prime Minister vowed to go ahead with the offensive on Gaza City. \n\nThe deal - presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators - involves a 60-day pause in fighting and the release of around half of the 50 remaining Israeli hostages, 20 of whom are believed to be alive, in exchange for 150 Palestinian security prisoners.\n\nIsrael announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks appeared to break down last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine. \n\nGaza's Health Ministry said on Monday that five more people, including two children, died of malnutrition-related causes. \n\nIt says at least 112 children have died of malnutrition-related causes since the war began, and 151 adults have died since the ministry started tracking adult malnutrition deaths in June. \n\nAmnesty International accused Israel of 'carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation'. \n\nIsrael has rejected such allegations, saying it allows in enough food and accusing the U.N. of failing to promptly deliver it. U.N. agencies say they are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order in the territory, around three-quarters of which is now controlled by Israel. \n\nThe U.N. World Food Program said on Monday that U.N. partner organisations reported that community kitchens in north and south Gaza produced 380,000 daily meals daily last week - far fewer than the more than 1 million daily meals they produced in April.","summary":"Nadeen Ayoub, 27, will be the competition's first Miss Palestine - a title she gained in 2022 and has promised to carry 'the voice of a people who refuse to be silenced' into the contest.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15016035/Palestine-Israel-beauty-queens-Miss-Universe-pageant-Hamas.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/00/101374741-0-image-a-22_1755647352466.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 00:49:24","author":"Editor,Jordana Seal","authors":["Editor","Jordana Seal"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.165},{"id":352322330,"title":"Trump imposed additional tariffs on India to apply ‘secondary pressure’ on Moscow","text":"US President Donald Trump imposed steep additional tariffs on Indian goods as part of efforts to push Russia towards ending the conflict in Ukraine, the White House said on Tuesday.Trump had doubled India’s tariffs to 50 per cent by adding an extra 25 per cent duty on top of the previously announced rate, which will take effect from August 27.Addressing reporters, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Look, the president has put tremendous public pressure to bring this war to a close. He’s taken actions, as you’ve seen, sanctions on India and other actions as well”, adding that the intent was to apply “secondary pressure” on Moscow.The move comes just days after Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, where both leaders signalled progress towards a potential trilateral dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump described the talks as “a very successful day”, while Zelenskyy called it the “best conversation” he had held with the US president so far.Leavitt stressed that Trump was determined to speed up peace efforts. “The president wants to move and he wants to bring this war to an end as quickly as possible,” she said, noting that European leaders and Nato chiefs who visited Washington after Trump’s recent meeting with Putin also viewed the talks as a “great first step”.She further claimed that European leaders were “very grateful” for Trump’s readout of Russia’s position, saying, “something that was not done by the previous administration at all.”On trade implications, Indian refiners have begun holding back on September-loading Russian oil tenders until there is clarity on the penalties. Executives warned that replacing Russian crude quickly would be difficult, as it makes up about 35 per cent of India’s imports. “If such a large supply disappears from the market, it will create tension and lead to price increases,” one industry official told the newspaper.Leavitt also repeated Trump’s long-standing claim that the war would never have begun had he been in office, adding that Putin himself had agreed. “True. Do you accept that as true? The European leaders do. Well, and President Putin himself said that, by the way,” she remarked when asked by a reporter.She emphasised that Trump was discussing long-term security guarantees with Nato and European partners. “He understands the need for that … He has expended an incredible amount of time, energy and effort into bringing this war to an end, and he remains determined to do that,” she said.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays, public holidays, current gold rate and silver price.","summary":"Donald Trump increased tariffs on Indian goods.

The approval followed consideration and modification of an initial proposal. \n\nWith the committee’s endorsement, the bill will now head to the full House for debate, pending scheduling by the House’s calendars committee. This progression suggests that the new mapping plan continues to advance in the legislative process. \n\nEarlier on Monday, enough Democratic lawmakers returned to Austin to restore a quorum, ending a two-week impasse with Republicans over the congressional maps. This return potentially sets the stage for Republicans to implement changes that might increase their seats in the House by up to five in the next election cycle. \n\nSubsequently, the revised bill, featuring the new congressional maps, was again assigned to the redistricting committee due to the kickoff of a new legislative session—an obligatory procedural step. No voting occurred, and the House adjourned until Wednesday. \n\nInfluential voices like President Donald Trump have been urging Texas Republicans to update their congressional district maps. In response, Governor Greg Abbott called a special session to focus on redistricting among other issues. On Monday, Trump reiterated his demand for the swift passage of the new maps. \n\n“This is one of the most popular causes I’ve ever championed. Republicans are thrilled to see us fight for something so important. Please pass this Map, ASAP,” Trump expressed on his social media platform. \n\nBurrows said that civil arrest warrants remain in force for Democratic members who prevented the House from reaching a quorum over the past few weeks.\n\n“The House has been through a tumultuous two weeks, but this institution long predates us and will long outlast each of us,” Burrows said. “Representatives come and go, issues rise and fall, but this body has endured wars, economic depressions and quorum breaks dating back to the very first session. It will withstand this too, and what will remain is a chamber where the majority has the right to prevail, the minority has the right to be heard.”\n\nState Rep. Nicole Collier, one of the Democratic members who had left the state to break quorum and prevent voting on the proposed maps, was stuck in the statehouse as of Monday night because she refused to agree to a law enforcement escort, according to a statement released by the Texas House Democratic Caucus.\n\nBurrows laid out strict conditions for the members who broke quorum and returned.\n\nOn Monday morning, he said that the “call of the House,” meant to help secure a quorum by locking doors and compelling members to return, was still in effect. Burrows said that House members who had civil arrest warrants out for them for denying quorum would be allowed to leave the House only if they got written permission and agreed to be put into the custody of a law enforcement officer who would ensure they return on Wednesday.\n\nCollier wrote in a statement that she had refused to agree to this condition and to be followed by law enforcement.\n\n“I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts. My community is majority-minority, and they expect me to stand up for their representation,” Collier said.\n\nDemocrats say that they are going to build a “legal case against the discriminatory map”. The new maps are widely expected to be hit by lawsuits if they pass the legislature.\n\n“We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” Democratic Caucus chair state Rep. Gene Wu said in a statement. “We’re returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans’ plans than when we left.”\n\nAt least one House Democrat, state Rep. Aicha Davis, said in a statement Monday she would not be one of the Democrats who would help restore a quorum.\n\n“I made a commitment to my district that I would fight until the end to keep our representation intact and I’m staying true to my word,” Davis said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Erin Zwiener said at a news conference after the House adjourned that Democrats are tapping legal and voting rights experts, and from the floor, “We are going to build a record that helps the legal fight go forward; we will try to persuade our [GOP] colleagues to do the right thing, but quite frankly I’m disappointed in the level of moral courage I see from a lot of my colleagues. And we’re going to speak about the real impact of these districts.”\n\nAsked if there was any chance Democrats leave the state again, Zwiener said that all options remain on the table and that she would not discuss strategy,\n\nAfter the Texas state legislature began a second special legislative session on Friday and failed still to meet quorum, Republican legislators are expected to try for a quorum Monday and then to work to advance the new maps, which will have to once again pass through the House’s redistricting committee and procedural votes.\n\nSeparately, Democratic state legislators in California formally unveiled their proposed legislation to get new congressional maps on the ballot in November, saying that it will be a counter to Texas if it moves forward with its proposed new congressional maps. Lawmakers did not get into the specifics of the map or the nitty-gritty of the legislation, but said it would be a constitutional amendment that would include maps, as well as affirmation for the state’s independent redistricting commission and language that triggers new maps only if other states move forward with mid-decade redistricting.\n\nBut Republican legislators said the move, pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is not only overtly partisan but could threaten democracy in California. Speaking to reporters in the state Capitol, they said that the proposed legislation subverts the will of voters in California. They also said they were critical of Texas’ redrawing effort and wanted independent redistricting nationally.\n\n“Governor Newsom, this is nothing more than a power grab. It’s a gamble, and we as Republicans here in Sacramento say we want non-partisan citizens redistricting for the whole country, and it is the role model that we have,” state Sen. Tony Strickland told reporters.\n\nDemocratic governors in Illinois and New York have also threatened to respond to Texas in kind and a bill in Maryland’s Democrat-controlled state House would force the state to change its map if another state proposed a new map mid-decade. Republican-controlled Florida and Missouri are also reportedly considering redistricting before the midterms.\n\nThe Trump administration has invited Indiana Republicans to the White House next week to hear from senior officials and Cabinet secretaries how they can partner with the administration to support Trump’s agenda, according to an invitation reviewed by ABC News. A source with knowledge of the event told ABC News that it’s expected that redistricting will be discussed as the White House ramps up pressure on Indiana state lawmakers to redraw congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterms.\n\nVice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana earlier this month to discuss redistricting with lawmakers at the state capitol.\n\nABC News’ Hannah Demissie contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives&#8217; redistricting committee approved a revised version of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Texas House Panel Approves Bill for Redrawing Congressional Maps first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/texas-house-panel-approves-bill-for-redrawing-congressional-maps/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Texas-House-redistricting-committee-advances-bill-with-new-congressional-maps.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 00:39:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":352334452,"title":"Kim slams South Korea-US drills during an inspection of his most powerful warship","text":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said yesterday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems.\n\nKim’s visit to the western port of Nampo on Monday came as the South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their annual large-scale summertime exercise to bolster readiness against growing North Korean threats. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, which the allies describe as defensive, will mobilize 21,000 troops, including 18,000 South Koreans, for computer-simulated command post operations and field training.\n\nNorth Korea has long denounced the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war, divided by the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea and South Korea.\n\nWhile inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies’ joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency said. He claimed that the exercises have grown more provocative than before by incorporating a “nuclear element,” requiring the North to respond with “proactive and overwhelming” countermeasures.\n\n“The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nKang Yu-jung, spokesperson for South Korea’s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who wants to improve ties with the North, said Seoul has “always regarded the Ulchi exercises as defensive” but offered no further comment on Kim’s remarks. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it had no immediate new assessments to share regarding the North Korean warship’s capabilities.\n\nSouth Korean and U.S. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks.\n\nDestroyer is key to nuclear-capable navy\n\nKim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. State media said the destroyer, which is being prepared to enter active duty next year, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including antiair and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nThe North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational.\n\nDuring Monday’s visit to Nampo, Kim also reviewed North Korean efforts to complete a third destroyer by October, KCNA said. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship’s weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy’s modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. He instructed officials to carry out performance tests in October, KCNA said.\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim accelerated his military nuclear program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term.\n\nIn his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks.\n\nThe 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front-line military activities and propaganda campaigns. The step came after North Korea had already declared it would no longer abide by the agreement.\n\nKIM TONG-HYUNG, SEOUL, MDT/AP","summary":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un condemned South Korean-U.S. military drills and vowed a rapid expansion of his nuclear forces to counter rivals, state media said yesterday, as he inspected his most advanced warship being fitted with nuclear-capable systems.

Torode was found to have used a racist term in 2018.\nTheir final series of MasterChef was filmed before they were both fired. The show's bosses have insisted on keeping them in the final edit - but only if they were on screen less and their banter and jokes were cut down to a minimum.\nSeveral contestants asked to be edited out themselves to avoid being on screen with them. \n Daily Mail revealed that viewers have pointed out 'disgraceful' edits in the new series on BBC One and iPlayer, with many cuts appearing awkward and repetitive, including those of Mr Wallace.\nIn one scene shown last week, stills of Gregg pulling the same face three times in around a minute made it to air - with many suggesting that the BBC and production company Banijay used the same footage of the disgraced host repeatedly through the show.\nSome of his fans have even claimed the edits, where Gregg gives a semi-gurning smile, were deliberately to embarrass him and 'make him look demented'.\n\nView gallery\n\nIt comes after MasterChef was ripped to shreds by viewers for its 'disgraceful' editing of scandalised former host Gregg in the latest installment of the cooking competition\n\nTikTok user Gingernat Design shared a particularly unusual example, writing: 'Clever editing fromMasterchef\n\nView gallery\n\nEagle-eyed viewers have pointed out 'disgraceful' edits in the new season, with many cuts appearing awkward and repetitive\n\nGregg on repeat!

During his second term, large sections of the border were designated as militarized zones, which allowed US troops to apprehend immigrants and others accused of trespassing on military bases.

It's difficult to put it into words, every night is the crowd's first night, so every one has that same energy to it.\n'It's been truly amazing, I'm not usually short for words, but I can't really articulate it at the moment.

It’s the second last show and we’ve played there a couple of times.\n'The Argentinians are without doubt in the top five places for us to play in the world and it’s the furthest away from Ireland and Manchester.\n'Everybody is looking forward to River Plate because it’s a special, special, special place for us.'\nNoel's words comes amid reports he has been inspired during the Oasis tour and has written a number of new songs for a potential Oasis album. \n\nOasis are back!

'Having been fronting a band for 16 years, I know how difficult that is and I couldn't do the stadium thing like he does it, it's not in my nature'\nThe singer is currently on tour with brother Liam and hasn't decided yet if they will perform the new music together. \nNoel, who also fronts High Flying Birds, is reportedly debating whether to keep the tracks for a solo album or join forces with Liam again to released a new Oasis album. \nAn insider has told The Mirror: 'Noel has been inspired by playing to adoring crowds, who have supercharged his creativity. But he is undecided whether his work will become a new album for Oasis with Liam on vocals.'\nNoel is said to be 'waiting to see how things play out' on tour but so far is said to be in a 'fine mood'. \nBut the source revealed: 'Noel has been in an absolutely fine mood. He's also been strumming some new tunes in his dressing room. But, from what he has said, these tracks are not yet aligned for any project.\n'There is no Oasis studio return as yet agreed by the band, and they still have a long way to go. Things are great now, but who knows what will happen given the brothers' past troubles on the road.'\nDaily Mail have contacted Noel's representatives for comment. \nNoel GallagherOasisLiam Gallagher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNoel Gallagher's pride for Liam as he says his younger brother is 'smashing it' on tour but he admits he 'grossly underestimated what he was getting into' with Oasis reunion\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nPhotos show female stunt double 'smiling' on set while rehearsing 'rape' scene on Kevin Costner's Horizon series as he files to dismiss her lawsuit\n\nNicola Peltz packs on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham as her ever-present spouse joins her on set for her role as a bikini-clad influencer who stirs up family drama\n\nZoe Kravitz stuns in a plunging halterneck gown with Austin Butler at Caught Stealing screening in London after sparking romance rumours\n\nThis is what Katie Price told me after her toxic split from Peter Andre and what really sparked her new feud with daughter Princess: KATIE HIND\n\nPeter Andre's wife Emily left 'hurt' by Katie Price's 'disgusting' swipe at her children in bombshell cash-counting video with Princess: 'It's a new low'\n\nBeaches, history, waterparks, golf...

It officially opened on Sunday and is already holding 1,000 people, U.S. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, said Monday. It will eventually hold up to 5,000 people.\n\nSen. John Cornyn called that facility the “Lone Star Lockup” during his visit to El Paso last week.\n\nIn a statement, DHS Secretary Krisi Noem thanked Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen for his partnership.\n\n“To help remove the worst of the worst out of our country,” Noem said. “If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska’s Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.”\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said his state stepping up is support of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\n“I am pleased that our facility and team in McCook can be tasked with helping our federal partners protect our homeland by housing criminal illegal aliens roaming our country’s communities today,” Pillen said.\n\nPillen also announced that he ordered the Nebraska National Guard to provide administrative and logistical support to Nebraska-based ICE officials in enforcing immigration laws.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy GRANT TUCKER, ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \n Published:00:24 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:01:08 BST, 20 August 2025 \n\nHe may be known for his cheery personality, but pantomime star Christopher Biggins has been driven to distraction by the DVLA – after it banned him from the road.\nThe 76-year-old I'm A Celebrity winner said he was 'depressed' and 'absolutely infuriated' after it refused to renew his licence following an eye test.\nAfter his licence expired this year, the DVLA contacted him to say he needed an eye test to renew it. So Biggins had his eyes checked at an opticians in Stratford, east London.\nHe added: 'Ten days later, I got a letter from the DVLA saying I had failed my test and I wouldn't be getting my licence back.'\nHowever, he said a doctor at Homerton Hospital in east London then gave him a clean bill of health after an eye examination, and he passed an eye test at a separate opticians.\nBoth gave him letters to send to the DVLA, but it stuck to its guns, saying: 'Unfortunately, the information you have supplied does not show that you are able to meet the required medical standards for driving.' \n\nView gallery\n\nHe may be known for his cheery personality, but pantomime star Christopher Biggins has been driven to distraction by the DVLA – after it banned him from the road\n\nKevin Costner fires back at stunt double's lawsuit with set photos\n\n7.7k viewing now\n\nCruel whispers about Tanya Burr and Jim Chapman's marriage...\n\n30.3k viewing now\n\nEmily Andre 'hurt' by Katie Price's 'disgusting' swipe at her kids\n\n2.6k viewing now\n\nThe actor insisted his vision had 'not changed', adding: 'How can they disregard a hospital doctor and another optician? It has left me very depressed. \n'I travel a lot and I need to drive. Not long distance, for that I take the train.\n'It is costing me a fortune in taxis. It is very unfair. I'm absolutely infuriated with their 'computer says no' attitude.'\nBiggins called Labour's plan for drivers over 70 to have eye tests every three years 'disgraceful', adding: 'Thousands could end up losing their licence unfairly.' \nWhen contacted by Daily Mail, ADVLA spokesperson said: 'While we cannot comment on individual cases, all drivers must meet minimum eyesight standards to drive a vehicle.\n'Whether a driver meets the eyesight standards can be tested through various means, including visual field and acuity, depending on the circumstances.\n'These standards apply to all drivers and, if someone does not meet the required standards they cannot be allowed on the road.'\n\nView gallery\n\nThe I'm A Celebrity winner, 76, said he was 'depressed' and 'absolutely infuriated' after it refused to renew his licence following an eye test \n\n Christopher Biggins blasts 'appalling' Celebrity Big Brother after his controversial axe \nIt comes after Christopher became the latest star to reveal he'd turned to jabs such as Mounjaro and Ozempic in a bid to lose weight after undergoing knee surgery.\nThe actor praised the effectiveness of the medication and claimed it could have other benefits, but acknowledged that there was still a lot that was unknown about possible side effects.\nHe told GB News: 'I’m on Mounjaro… and I think it’s good. I mean, I had a new knee put in, and I needed to lose weight because of the pressure on the knee.'\nChristopher added that 'they’re now finding out that this drug can cure a lot of other things', but noted that 'we don’t know the side effects' of it yet.\nLabourChristopher BigginsLondonDVLA\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChristopher Biggins, 76, says he feels 'depressed and infuriated' after being banned from driving by the DVLA... despite undergoing an eye test\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nPhotos show female stunt double 'smiling' on set while rehearsing 'rape' scene on Kevin Costner's Horizon series as he files to dismiss her lawsuit\n\nNicola Peltz packs on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham as her ever-present spouse joins her on set for her role as a bikini-clad influencer who stirs up family drama\n\nZoe Kravitz stuns in a plunging halterneck gown with Austin Butler at Caught Stealing screening in London after sparking romance rumours\n\nThis is what Katie Price told me after her toxic split from Peter Andre and what really sparked her new feud with daughter Princess: KATIE HIND\n\nPeter Andre's wife Emily left 'hurt' by Katie Price's 'disgusting' swipe at her children in bombshell cash-counting video with Princess: 'It's a new low'\n\nBeaches, history, waterparks, golf...

Shari Redstone, who was the controlling shareholder of the media giant before recently selling it to Skydance Media as part of an $8 billion merger, was outspoken about her support for Paramount to settle Trump's lawsuit over allegations of \"election interference\" in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Trump and Paramount reached a multimillion-dollar settlement last month. However, it wasn't CBS' political coverage that irked Redstone. It was the network's coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. According to The New York Times, \"Maybe, she thought, Mr. Trump’s criticism of the news division, and his lawsuit, could be helpful.\" \"We needed more balance,\" Redstone said in an interview with The New York Times Tuesday, referring to CBS' war coverage. \"Part of me thought, maybe Trump could accomplish what I never got done.\" SHARI REDSTONE BREAKS SILENCE ON ‘NO-BRAINER’ 16M TRUMP SETTLEMENT THAT PRECEDED PARAMOUNT-SKYDANCE MERGER Redstone, a staunch supporter of Israel, was vocal in her complaints about how slanted she perceived CBS' coverage was against Israel. The Times reported that a major inflection point came when \"60 Minutes\" aired a segment featuring former State Department officials who resigned in protest over U.S. support for Israel. The segment was viewed as one-sided with an emphasis on allegations of atrocities committed by Israel, while barely mentioning the barbaric Oct. 7 terrorist attack committed by Hamas. Internal objections to the episode led to the appointment of CBS veteran Susan Zirinsky as the network's newly created executive editor of standards, which, in turn, The Times reported, led to \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens' abrupt exit in protest over the increased corporate oversight. Owens' resignation caused further consternation with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley lamenting the drama on-air. PARAMOUNT, SKYDANCE COMPLETE $8 BILLION MERGER AS FCC CONTINUES CBS PROBE Redstone also spoke up in defense of \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil, who was facing internal backlash for grilling liberal media darling and anti-Israel author Ta-Nehisi Coates in an October 2024 interview. Dokoupil was scolded by his bosses, who told him the interview didn't meet \"editorial standards.\" Dokoupil also apologized to offended staffers. \"I think Tony did a great job with that interview. I think he handled himself and showed the world and modeled what civil discourse is. He showed that there was accountability, that there is a system of checks and balances, and frankly, I was very proud of the work that he did,\" Redstone said at the time. \"As hard as it was, frankly, for me to go against the company, because I love this company, and I believe in it, and I think we have a great, great executive team, I think they made a mistake here.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS CBS staffers last year were also reportedly instructed not to refer to Jerusalem, Israel's capital, as being in Israel, saying in a memo its status is \"disputed\" and that it \"goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\" Redstone, the daughter of the late billionaire mogul Sumner Redstone, was widely expected to receive a $2.4 billion buyout as a result of the Skydance merger. Paramount is now being run by David Ellison, son of billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.

That includes pushing Republican lawmakers in Texas and other conservative-controlled states to redraw their legislative maps to expand the number of U.S. House seats favorable to the GOP.\n\nOthers involve the direct use of official presidential power in ways that have no modern precedent, such as ordering his Department of Justice to investigate the main liberal fundraising entity, ActBlue. The department also is demanding the detailed voter files from each state in an apparent attempt to look for ineligible voters on a vast scale.\n\nAnd on Monday, Trump posted a falsehood-filled rant on social media pledging to lead a “movement” to outlaw voting machines and mail balloting, the latter of which has become a mainstay of Democratic voting since Trump pushed Republicans to avoid it in 2020 — before flipping on the issue ahead of last year’s presidential election.\n\nThe individual actions add up to an unprecedented attempt by a sitting president to interfere in a critical election before it’s even held, moves that have raised alarms among those concerned about the future of U.S. democracy.\n\n“Those are actions that you don’t see in healthy democracies,” said Ian Bassin, executive director of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that has sued the Trump administration. “Those are actions you see in authoritarian states.”\n\nTrump has already tried to overturn an election\n\nBassin noted that presidents routinely stump for their party in midterm elections and try to bolster incumbents by steering projects and support to their districts. But he said Trump’s history is part of what’s driving alarm about the midterms.\n\nHe referenced Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which ended with a violent assault on the Capitol by his supporters.\n\n“The one thing we know for certain from experience in 2020 is that this is a person who will use every measure and try every tactic to stay in power, regardless of the outcome of an election,” Bassin said.\n\nHe noted that in 2020, Trump was checked by elected Republicans in Congress and statehouses who refused to bend the rules, along with members of his own administration and even military leaders who distanced themselves from the defeated incumbent. In his second term, the president has locked down near-total loyalty from the GOP and stacked the administration with loyalists.\n\nThe incumbent president’s party normally loses seats in Congress during midterm elections. That’s what happened to Trump in 2018, when Democrats won enough seats to take back the House of Representatives, stymieing the president’s agenda and eventually leading to his two impeachments.\n\nTrump has said he doesn’t want a repeat.\n\nHe also has argued that his actions are actually attempts to preserve democracy. Repeating baseless allegations of fraud, he said Monday during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that “you can never have a real democracy with mail-in ballots.” Earlier this month, Trump said that, because he handily won Texas in the 2024 presidential election, “we are entitled to five more seats.”\n\nAn attempt to engineer GOP control of the US House\n\nRepublicans currently have a three-seat margin in the House of Representatives. Trump pushed Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional map to create up to five new winnable GOP seats and is lobbying other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, to take similar steps to pad the margin even more.\n\nThe Texas Legislature is likely to vote on its map on Wednesday. There’s no guarantee that Trump’s gambit will work, but also no legal prohibition against fiddling with maps in those states for partisan advantage. In response, California Democrats are moving forward with their own redistricting effort as a way to counter Republicans in Texas.\n\nMid-decade map adjustments have happened before, though usually in response to court orders rather than presidents openly hoping to manufacture more seats for their party. Larry Diamond, a political scientist at Stanford University, said there’s a chance the redrawing of House districts won’t succeed as Trump anticipates — but could end up motivating Democratic voters.\n\nStill, Diamond said he’s concerned. “It’s the overall pattern that’s alarming and that the reason to do this is for pure partisan advantage,” he said of Trump’s tactic.\n\nDiamond noted that in 2019 he wrote a book about a “12-step” process to turn a democracy into an autocracy, and “the last step in the process is to rig the electoral process.”\n\nThe Justice Department acts on Trump’s priorities\n\nTrump has required loyalty from all levels of his administration and demanded that the Department of Justice follow his directives. One of those was to probe ActBlue, an online portal that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in small-dollar donations for Democratic candidates over two decades.\n\nThe site was so successful that Republicans launched a similar venture, called WinRed. Trump, notably, did not order a federal probe into WinRed.\n\nTrump’s appointees at the Department of Justice also have demanded voting data from at least 19 states, as Trump continues to insist he actually won the 2020 election and proposed a special prosecutor to investigate that year’s vote tally. Much as he did before winning the 2024 election, Trump has baselessly implied that Democrats may rig upcoming vote counts against him.\n\nIn at least two of those states, California and Minnesota, the DOJ followed up with election officials last week, threatening legal action if they didn’t hand over their voter registration lists by this Thursday, according to letters shared with The Associated Press. Neither state — both controlled by Democrats — has responded publicly.\n\nAttempts to interfere with voting and elections\n\nTrump’s threat this week to end mail voting and do away with voting machines is just his latest attempt to sway how elections are run. An executive order he signed earlier this year sought documented proof of citizenship to register to vote, among other changes, though much of it has been blocked by courts.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol to reverse his 2020 loss, Trump’s allies proposed having the military seize voting machines to investigate purported fraud, even though Trump’s own attorney general said there was no evidence of significant wrongdoing.\n\nThe Constitution says states and Congress, rather than the president, set the rules for elections, so it’s unclear what Trump could do to make his promises a reality. But election officials saw them as an obvious sign of his 2026 interests.\n\n“Let’s see this for what it really is: An attempt to change voting going into the midterms because he’s afraid the Republicans will lose,” wrote Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, on X.\n\nThe president has very few levers to influence an election\n\nDerek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said the idea of seizing voting machines in 2020 was a sign of how few levers the president has to influence an election, not of his power. Under the U.S. Constitution, elections are run by states and only Congress can “alter” the procedures — and, even then, for federal races alone.\n\n“It’s a deeply decentralized system,” Muller said.\n\nThere are fewer legal constraints on presidential powers, such as criminal investigations and deployment of law enforcement and military resources, Muller noted. But, he added, people usually err in forecasting election catastrophes.\n\nHe noted that in 2022 and 2024, a wide range of experts braced for violence, disruption and attempts to overturn losses by Trump allies, and no serious threats materialized.\n\n“One lesson I’ve learned in decades of doing this is people are often preparing for the last election rather than what actually happens in the new ones,” Muller said.","summary":"The unprecedented moves are an attempt to interfere in a critical election.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/19/election-2026-trump/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Russia_Ukraine_War_35740-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:58:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.033},{"id":352315346,"title":"‘Pure partisan advantage’: Trump leverages presidential power to help his party in the 2026 midterms","text":"By NICHOLAS RICCARDI\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made clear in recent weeks that he’s willing to use the vast powers of his office to prevent his party from losing control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nSome of the steps Trump has taken to intervene in the election are typical, but controversial, political maneuvers taken to his trademark extremes.

Trump’s post accused the Smithsonian as well as other museums nationwide of pushing narratives that disparage the U.S. rather than celebrate its achievements. \"The Museums throughout Washington, but all over the Country are, essentially, the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE,’\" Trump wrote. \"The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL … Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.\" He added: \"This Country cannot be WOKE, because WOKE IS BROKE. We have the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.\" AMERICAN HISTORY WON'T BE DISPLAYED 'IN A WOKE MANNER' AT SMITHSONIAN, TRUMP SAYS The letter instructs Smithsonian leaders to provide exhibition plans, internal guidelines, and America 250 programming materials for review. \"As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story,\" the letter stated. \"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\" According to administration officials, the review will focus on public-facing content, curatorial processes, exhibition planning, collection use, and overall narrative standards. The initial phase will target the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CALLS OUT SMITHSONIAN FOR PUSHING 'ONE-SIDED, DIVISIVE POLITICAL NARRATIVES' Tuesday’s announcement follows earlier White House criticism of specific Smithsonian exhibitions. On July 5, Fox News Digital reported that officials had singled out the Entertainment Nation exhibit at the National Museum of American History for review. At the time, White House special assistant Lindsey Halligan said to Fox News Digital, \"American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives. The Smithsonian Institution should present history in a way that is accurate, balanced, and consistent with the values that make the United States of America exceptional.\" Among the panels singled out by the White House was a 1920s circus poster described as reflecting \"the colonial impulse to claim dominion over the world.\" Another display reinterpreted the Lone Ranger, comparing the character’s relationship with Tonto to U.S. global dominance. A third panel suggested that Mickey Mouse’s original design in Steamboat Willie drew on traditions of blackface minstrelsy. WHITE HOUSE REVIEWING ALL SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM, EXHIBIT CONTENT BEFORE AMERICA 250 CELEBRATION IN 2026 Despite the sharp rhetoric, the letter said the White House sees the review as a constructive process. \"Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America’s heritage,\" officials wrote. The timeline requires museums to submit requested materials within 30 days, schedule staff interviews within 75 days, and begin implementing content corrections within 120 days. The corrections, the letter said, should replace \"divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate and constructive descriptions.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP White House officials closed the letter by presenting the initiative as a collaborative effort with Smithsonian staff. \"We view this process as a collaborative and forward-looking opportunity, one that empowers museum staff to embrace a revitalized curatorial vision rooted in the strength, breadth, and achievements of the American story,\" the letter stated. \"By focusing on Americanism — the people, principles, and progress that define our nation — we can work together to renew the Smithsonian’s role as the world’s leading museum institution.\" The White House and the Smithsonian did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Trump orders sweeping Smithsonian review after blasting museums as “woke,&quot; vowing to reshape exhibits to emphasize unity, progress and American exceptionalism.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-smithsonian-out-control-orders-sweeping-review-all-museums-programming","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/trump-calls-out-smithsonian-.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376891434112","publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:53:46","author":"Jasmine Baehr","authors":["Jasmine Baehr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.367},{"id":352278604,"title":"Reason Aussie students are ditching the US","text":"Send My Bag, a UK company that ships luggage across the world, recorded a 34 per cent slump in quotes for shipping from Australia to the US in June and a sustained 20 per cent drop in relocation to the US since May. \n\nSend My Bag CEO Adam Ewart said the turn away from America had been propelled by the US President’s May crackdown on international students. \n\n“Our data shows that when President Donald Trump began scaling up executive orders in April, interest in relocating to the US started to slow,” he said.\n\n“But it wasn’t until his May 27 crackdown on international students, pausing visas and resuming them with tougher screening, that Aussies were really spooked.\n\n“From that point, relocation interest in the US fell off a cliff.\n\n“We saw a 34 per cent drop in quotes for moving from Australia to the US in June alone.”\n\nThe figures come from Send My Bag’s anonymised quote request data.\n\nThe platform processes thousands of relocation and travel inquiries each year.\n\nWhen booking, customers select their reason for shipment -

It's great because that particular track is a song made by Robbie Williams and Gary Barlow about Morrisey.\nDescribing the song as 'considerate', he added: 'The reason I'm considerate about it is because I'm writing it from the point of view of a stalker, so it's somebody who's stalking, and is completely obsessed and in love with him.'\n\nView gallery\n\nRobbie, who is set to release his new album on October 10th, also reflected on how his appearance has changed over the years, during an interview with Joe Lycett\n\nView gallery\n\nThe Angels legend confessed his hair is now 'thinning everyday' and he's struggling to keep his locks looking full for his fans\n\n Robbie Williams heartbreakingly reveals his beloved parents and in-laws' health is 'very precarious' \nRobbie and his wife Ayda, 46, share four children, Teddy, 12, son Charlie, ten, daughter Coco, six and four-year-old son Beau.\nRobbie previously said that his kids are a massive factor in deciding where to live because they need to be placed in suitable schools.\nIt was reported earlier this month that he and his wife Ayda have splashed out £30 million on a lavish new waterfront mansion in Miami. \nHe explained: 'The four kids are constantly a Rubix Cube puzzle that we're trying to sort out because if they are schooled then they don't see me because I'm all over the place and if they are home-schooled then they have another set of things that are a problem.'\nSpeaking in 2014, Robbie - then a father of two - admitted he was keen to make the United Kingdom his permanent base after spending an extended period of time in the United States.\nHe told The Sun: 'I love LA. The people and the weather are great but it's not England. It can't offer the same. Things change when you're a dad - there are people to look after who are more important than yourself.\n'I want [daughter] Teddy and the new baby, whatever it may be, to be educated in England. Teddy is already surrounded by English people so she's bound to have an accent anyway.\n'But that's not the point - we want to educate her in London.

The Pentagon and Nato did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the idea.\nIn a press briefing, the White House said that the United States could help coordinate a security guarantee for Ukraine.\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has ruled out the deployment of troops from Nato countries to help secure a peace deal.\n\nTrump has publicly ruled out deploying US troops in Ukraine but on Tuesday appeared to leave the door open to other US military involvement.\nIn an interview with Fox News Fox & Friends programme, he suggested Washington could provide air support to Ukraine.\n“When it comes to security, [Europeans] are willing to put people on the ground, we’re willing to help them with things, especially, probably, … by air because nobody has stuff we have, really they don’t have,” Trump said. He did not provide further details.\nUS air support could come in a variety of ways, including providing more air defence systems to Ukraine and enforcing a no-fly zone with US fighter jets.\nSince Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022, the United States has shipped billions of dollars worth of weapons and munitions to Kyiv.\nThe Trump administration briefly halted those weapons shipments, including after a contentious White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February and again in July.\nShipments have resumed and Trump has pledged to send weapons, primarily defensive ones, to help the war-torn country.\nNato military chiefs will focus on Ukraine and the way forward when they meet virtually on Wednesday, a conference first reported by Reuters.\n\nUS Air Force General Alexus Grynkewich, who also oversees Nato operations in Europe, will brief the chiefs of defence on the Alaska meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\nA US official speaking on condition of anonymity said US General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was expected to attend the meeting.\nThe official added that Caine would meet some of his European counterparts in Washington on Tuesday evening.\nTrump has pressed for a quick end to Europe’s deadliest war in 80 years, and Kyiv and its allies have worried he could seek to force an agreement on Russia’s terms after the president last week rolled out the red carpet for Putin.\nRussia says it is engaged in a “special military operation” in Ukraine to protect its national security, claiming Nato’s eastward expansion and Western military support for Ukraine pose existential threats.\nKyiv and its Western allies say the invasion is an imperial-style land grab.\n\nMeanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack late on Tuesday knocked out power to areas of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region under Russian control, the Moscow-installed governor said.\nRussian forces hold well over half of the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine’s southeast. But Kyiv maintains control of the region’s main administrative centre and its attacks have periodically knocked out electricity in Russian-held areas.\nRussia in 2022 annexed the Zaporizhzhia region, along with neighbouring Kherson as well as Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine’s east, about seven months after invading its smaller neighbour.\n“The reason for the power cuts in Zaporizhzhia region is yet another enemy terrorist drone attack on high-voltage equipment,” Moscow-appointed Governor Yevgeny Balitsky wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\nBalitsky said repair crews were restoring power and switching affected areas to reserve lines. He said the work was made more difficult “by the danger of repeat strikes and by darkness”.\nUkrainian shelling and drone attacks knocked out power in June for more than 24 hours to at least 700,000 residents across the area. That attack appeared to be the largest of its kind on Russian-held territory since the war began.\nThe Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe’s largest with six reactors, was operating as normal, unaffected by the power cuts, the plant’s director of communications, Yevgenia Yashina, told Russia’s RIA news agency.\nThe plant produces no electricity but needs power for cooling and monitoring systems to maintain safety. Ukraine and Russia regularly accuse each other of staging attacks on the plant, seized by Russian forces in the first weeks of the February 2022 invasion.\nIn the part of the Kherson region under Ukrainian control, Governor Vyacheslav Prokudin said in a Telegram post that Russian shelling killed a resident of a small town north of the regional capital.\nAnd the governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, to the north, Serhiy Lysak, also said on Telegram that Russian shelling killed a resident of Nikopol, a frequent target of Moscow’s attacks on the north bank of the Dnipro River.","summary":"US and European military planners have begun exploring post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine, US officials and sources said on Tuesday, following US President Donald Trump’s pledge to help protect the country under any deal to end Russia’s war.\nUkraine and its European allies have been buoyed by Trump’s promise during a summit on Monday of security guarantees for Kyiv, but many questions remain unanswered.\nOfficials told Reuters that the Pentagon is carrying out planning exercises on the...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3322434/us-nato-planners-start-craft-ukraine-security-guarantee-options","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/20/86b96907-f6ba-4617-93c6-f01cbc0e3f3e_acf60ffa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:48:57","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":352326126,"title":"Sanction Putin if he won't see Zelensky, says Sir Keir Starmer after Washington DC visit","text":"Sir Keir Starmer yesterday led calls to force Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table after Europe's unprecedented White House diplomacy put the ball back in the Russian dictator's court.\n\nThe Prime Minister suggested possible sanctions for Putin after co-chairing a virtual Coalition of the Willing meeting, debriefing their day trip to Washington DC and planning for the future.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also warned of a 'rough situation' if Moscow does not make peace as he pushed for Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to meet Putin in Switzerland in the next two weeks.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said last night: 'The leaders discussed how further pressure – including through sanctions – could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.'\n\nGerman chancellor Friedrich Merz laid down the gauntlet to the Kremlin over any potential talks, saying: 'We don't know whether the Russian president will have the courage to attend such a summit.'\n\nHinting at more sanctions as Russia again barraged Ukrainian cities with 270 drones and ten missiles in an overnight attack, he added: 'Therefore, persuasion is needed.'\n\nIt followed Monday's extraordinary meeting in Washington where Mr Zelensky and the US President were joined by Sir Keir, chancellor Merz and the leaders of France, Italy, Finland, the EU and Nato.\n\nSir Keir hailed a 'breakthrough' after the unprecedented gathering garnered a US commitment to military involvement in security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nMr Zelensky hopes to have such a proposal in writing within the next ten days to strengthen his hand before heading to any meeting with Putin to discuss territory.\n\nThe US administration's unorthodox, realpolitik negotiations offer the most significant hope of bringing peace to Europe since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\nBut there remains real fear in Ukraine that they could be sold out as the White House seems loath to pressure Moscow with sanctions and military might, instead turning the screws diplomatically on Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian journalist Peter Zalmayev told the Daily Mail: 'The message that Ukraine and Europe need to get through to Trump is that his getting the Nobel Peace Prize depends not on whether he ends the war in Ukraine, but on how he ends it.'\n\nMr Trump broke off Monday's talks to call Putin and update him on progress, during which the two superpowers agreed to set up a bilateral meeting between the Russian tyrant and Mr Zelensky.\n\nThe President was typically bullish afterwards, saying the two adversaries are 'getting along a little bit better than I thought' despite 'tremendous bad blood'.\n\nHe told Fox News that 'otherwise I wouldn't have set up the [bilateral] meeting, I would've set up a three – a trilat'. \n\nBut he cautioned: 'We're going to find out about president Putin in the next couple of weeks... It's possible he doesn't want to make a deal.'\n\nHe added: 'I hope president Putin is going to be good and if he's not, then it's going to be a rough situation. \n\n'And I hope that Zelensky will do what he has to do. He has to show some flexibility also. The thing is a mess.'\n\nYesterday, the Kremlin appeared to be dragging its heels over the plan, which would see a meeting with Mr Trump follow the one-on-one between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. \n\nForeign minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian state TV: 'Without respect for Russia's security... without full respect for the rights of Russians and Russian-speaking people who live in Ukraine, there can be no talk of any long-term agreements.'\n\nFurther muddying the waters, a source in Mr Trump's administration claimed it was Putin who suggested a meeting without the US President. \n\nDuring their call, Putin told Mr Trump: 'You don't have to come – I want to see him one on one,' Politico reported.\n\nIt was also claimed Putin suggested they meet in Moscow – a clear non-starter for Kyiv, with Geneva one possible venue.\n\nThe Swiss confirmed that if Putin was visiting for peace talks, the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for the dictator would not be acted upon.\n\nYesterday it was reported the Hungarian capital Budapest is the White House's first choice to host any meeting, but press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied to comment at her press briefing.\n\nKremlin observers are, however, extremely sceptical that Putin would countenance a one-on-one meeting with Mr Zelensky in the coming days.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer yesterday led calls to force Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table after Europe's unprecedented White House diplomacy put the ball back in the Russian dictator's court.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15016023/Sanction-Putin-Zelensky-Sir-Keir-Starmer-Washington-visit.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/20/00/101374197-0-image-m-28_1755646060494.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/19/8997450689582579367/1024x576_MP4_8997450689582579367.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:47:52","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":352297180,"title":"The past week at the White House has been 'nothing short of remarkable,' says Josh Holmes","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report August 19, 2025 08:14 \n\n The past week at the White House has been 'nothing short of remarkable,' says Josh Holmes \n 'Special Report' panelists Mary Katharine Ham, Josh Holmes and Dasha Burns discuss President Donald Trump pushing for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting and the DOJ's warning to sanctuary cities.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTV-VIDEOPOLITICS","summary":"&apos;Special Report&apos; panelists Mary Katharine Ham, Josh Holmes and Dasha Burns discuss President Donald Trump pushing for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting and the DOJ&apos;s warning to sanctuary cities.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6377101607112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/774b42ff-7a78-479e-b30e-c2852486a4e7/bf67adef-d23a-4964-b5a1-60980af2a621/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:45:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.517},{"id":352265786,"title":"`It’s Possible That He...`: Trump Days After Meeting Putin At Alaska Summit","text":"After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Alaska Summit and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, US President Donald Trump said he believed Putins action would be clear in the next couple of weeks.In an interview with Fox News’ Fox Friends program, Trump said that Putin and others are tired of the ongoing conflict.

Most of its museums are in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen asked if Trump would threaten funding cuts to the Smithsonian based on the findings, a White House official said “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.”\n\nThe White House said last week it will lead an internal review of some Smithsonian museums after Trump earlier this year accused it of spreading “anti-American ideology” and raised alarm among civil rights advocates.\n\n“The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said.\n\nThe Smithsonian receives most of its budget from U.S. Congress but is independent of the government in decision-making. Civil rights advocates say Trump’s administration is undoing decades of social progress and undermining the acknowledgment of critical phases of American history.\n\nTrump has made threats to cut federal funding of top U.S. educational institutions, citing pro-Palestinian protests against U.S. ally Israel’s war in Gaza, transgender policies, climate initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nLast month, the government settled its probes with Columbia University, which agreed to pay $221 million, and Brown University, which said it will pay $50 million. Both institutions accepted certain government demands. Talks to settle with Harvard University are ongoing.\n\nAdditional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump suggested today he will pressure the Smithsonian Institution, a premier museum, education and research complex for U.S. history and culture, to accept his demands, just like he did with colleges and universities by threatening to cut federal funding.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/19/breaking-news/trump-escalates-attacks-against-the-smithsonian-institution/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_2025-08-19T200937Z_317670482_RC2IYFAH26RY_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-SMITHSONIAN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:40:30","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":352326110,"title":"TikTok star John Crawley dead at 47 days after being rushed to ICU","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Costner drops explosive images that threaten to blow 'unscripted rape' claim sky-high\n\nInside the 'dark side' of tourist destination where a British woman was forced to pay thousands to rescue animals from 'death camp for dogs'\n\nMassive £210million Euromillions jackpot is WON by ticketholder\n\nSARAH VINE: I hate having to rent.

Jim Pillen said he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had agreed to use an existing minimum security prison work camp in McCook — a remote city of about 7,000 people in the middle of the wide-open prairies between Denver and Omaha — to house people awaiting deportation and being held for other immigration proceedings.

ICE centers were holding more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.\n\nThe new and planned facilities include the remote detention center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” which opened last month.

ICE centers were holding more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.\n\nThe new and planned facilities include the remote detention center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” which opened last month. It’s designed to hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. When Trump toured it, he suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide.\n\nThe Florida facility also been the subject of legal challenges by attorneys who allege violations of due process there, including the rights of detainees to meet with their attorneys, limited access to immigration courts and poor living conditions. Critics have been trying to stop further construction and operations until it comes into compliance with federal environmental laws.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that his administration is preparing to open a second facility, dubbed “Deportation Depot,” at a state prison in north Florida. It’s expected to have 1,300 immigration beds, though that capacity could be expanded to 2,000, state officials said.\n\nAlso last week, officials in the rural Tennessee town of Mason voted to approve agreements to turn a former prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.\n\nAnd the Trump administration announced plans earlier this month for a 1,000-bed detention center in Indiana that would be dubbed “Speedway Slammer,” prompting a backlash in the Midwestern state that hosts the Indianapolis 500 auto race.\n\nCorrections director Rob Jeffreys said the 186 inmates currently at the McCook work camp will be transferred to other state facilities over the next 45 to 60 days. The repurposed facility will be run by the state but will be paid for by the federal government. He said it’s already set up and accredited to hold prisoners, so detainees won’t be housed in tents or other temporary quarters.\n\nThe Nebraska plan has already raised concerns\n\nIn a video posted to social media, state Sen. Megan Hunt, an independent, blasted a lack of transparency about plans for a detention center, citing her unfulfilled request to the governor and executive branch for emails and other records.\n\nShe urged people to support local immigrant rights groups.\n\n“The No. 1 thing we need to do is protect our neighbors, protect the people in our communities who are being targeted by these horrible people, these horrible organizations that are making choices to lock up, detain, disappear our neighbors and families and friends,” Hunt said.\n\nAround a half-dozen protesters sat in the hallway outside the governor’s office Tuesday afternoon making signs that said, “No Nazi Nebraska” and “ICE = Gestapo.”\n\nMaghie Miller-Jenkins of Lincoln said she doesn’t think an ICE detention center is a good idea, adding the state should tackle problems like child hunger and homelessness. “This state has numerous things they could focus on that would benefit the constituents,” she said.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Steve Karnowski in St. Paul, Minnesota, Jack Dura in Fargo, North Dakota, and Scott McFetridge in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this story.","summary":"ICE centers held more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/19/nebraska-cornhusker-clink/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nebraska_Detention_Center_85501.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:32:40","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":352321876,"title":"Trump official 'ordered New Jersey mayor's arrest' at immigration centre in new footage","text":"In recent months, police officers and immigration enforcers have flooded into major US cities and made sweeping arrests of people they suspect of being undocumented migrants, often disregarding the legal process to do so. This shocking authoritarianism has also seen multiple elected officials detained, with at least one appearing to have been put behind bars after a major appointee of President Trump gave the order. Freshly released body cam footage has shown that the federal officer who detained New Jersey mayor Ras Baraka implied he might have been acting under instructions from the deputy attorney general. This comes as Donald Trump attempts to force a head-to-head meeting between Putin and Ukraine's President Zelensky. The footage emerged as part of a legal submission by Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was also taken into custody alongside Baraka during an oversight visit at an immigration centre, where they had a run-in with immigration officers. While Baraka faced trespassing charges that were later dropped, McIver was accused of assaulting federal agents. It appears she is pushing for the dismissal of her charges. Her legal team alleges that a Department of Homeland Security special agent, after concluding a phone call, informed fellow agents, \"We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general of the United States. \"Anyone that gets in our way, I need you guys to give me a perimeter so I can cuff him,\" the agent further instructed. The Mirror U.S. has not yet formally reviewed the footage. Although it has been submitted as evidence, the video has not been made available to the general public. Todd Blanche currently holds the position of deputy attorney general. Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Mirror : \"The American people can see with their own eyes a sitting member of Congress assaulting law enforcement,\" and she referenced a video of the altercation that DHS uploaded on X back in May. The apparent suggestion of Blanche's involvement is the latest in a series of moves where Justice Department officials have seemingly wielded their power to target Democrats and adversaries of President Trump. Since Trump resumed office, his DOJ has initiated multiple investigations into figures who oppose him, including Jack Smith, James Comey, and others. Moreover, it has been reported that federal law enforcement officers have apprehended New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and even placed California Sen. Alex Padilla in handcuffs. Suspicions are escalating as Politico disclosed that several Democrats are pondering whether agents at the Newark facility were directed to arrest Baraka. Witness statements and additional video evidence from the day depict the mayor standing calmly behind a fence with a guard for a significant period. Rep. Rob Menendez, also a Democrat, informed Politico that he saw an agent within the enclosed area on the phone receiving instructions to detain Baraka, who was outside the enclosure when the call occurred. Last week, McIver's lawyers submitted a description of the bodycam footage to the court, reinforcing this narrative. \"Even though he stepped out, I am going to put him in cuffs,\" the special agent is purported to have declared. Following this, the agent mentioned arresting the mayor \"per the deputy attorney general.\" Moments later, the mayor found himself in handcuffs, sparking off a brawl. Magistrate Judge André M. Espinosa described it as an \"embarrassing retraction\" that \"suggests a failure to adequately investigate, to carefully gather facts and to thoughtfully consider the implications of your actions before wielding your immense power.\"","summary":"The federal officer who arrested New Jersey mayor Ras Baraka and Rep.

He was released on a $10,000 bond, but no monitoring appeared to take place.\n\nRichard Davies, a criminal defence lawyer in Nevada, told Al Jazeera that the apparent lack of conditions on Alexandrovich’s release despite the seriousness of the charges was “fishy”.\n\n“Average Joe gets arrested, he would appear in front of the justice of the peace within 24 hours. The justice of the peace in that county would issue bail conditions, which very typically would include a GPS device, restrictions on movement, not being allowed to leave the state,” Davies said.\n\n“So the fact that this individual was not only allowed to leave without an ankle bracelet or a GPS device, not only to leave the state, but also leave the country, is highly unusual and suspect.”\n\nThe timeline\n\nAlexandrovich was arrested on August 6, but the incident was not made public until more than a week later, when the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department announced an undercover operation “targeting child sex predators”.\n\nA task force of local and federal agents had arrested eight suspects, including Alexandrovich, over two weeks.\n\n“This operation was conducted as part of the ongoing efforts to reduce violent crime and protect children in our community,” the police said.\n\nAccording to a police report, first obtained by the Breaking Points podcast, the authorities allege that Alexandrovich made sexual contact on two online and texting platforms with an undercover agent posing as a 15-year-old girl.\n\n“The sexual contact included bringing a condom and taking the decoy to ‘Cirque du Soleil’,” the report said.\n\nHe was arrested as soon as he arrived to meet the decoy.\n\nDuring his interview with law enforcement officers, Alexandrovich said he thought the person he was chatting with was 18.\n\nThen he repeatedly invoked his flight to Israel, the report says.\n\n“Alexandrovich stated it was very important he get numbers for his flight. Alexandrovich stated his flight is on Friday [August 8] to New York and then will fly to Israel.”\n\nDavies, the lawyer, said the mention of the flight should have given the court additional pause about granting Alexandrovich bail without stringent conditions.\n\n“The fact that he wants to leave the country should be an aggravating fact to restrict his movement even more,” the lawyer said.\n\nTrump administration denies involvement\n\nAlexandrovich’s next court appearance is set for August 27.\n\nIt is not clear how or why he was released despite being a flight risk. The lower court judge whose name appears next to the bail determination did not return Al Jazeera’s request for comment. Neither did the Clark County District Attorney’s office.\n\nThe State Department denial has done little to sweep away the controversy. On social media, the case has drawn increased scrutiny and stoked speculations, with some likening Alexandrovich’s release and what they see as President Donald Trump’s administration burying the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene raised the case on Tuesday, drawing a contrast between freeing Alexandrovich and blocking Palestinian children from Gaza from entering the US for medical care.\n\n“Two recent decisions made by the State Department both involve children,” she wrote.\n\n“We need to be the America that allows war torn children to come here for life saving surgeries and the America that never releases a foreign child sex predator that our great LEO’s [law enforcement officers] caught.”\n\nLast week, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that Alexandrovich was arrested and downplayed the incident .\n\n“A state employee who traveled to the US for professional matters was questioned by American authorities during his stay,” Netanyahu’s office was quoted as saying by Israeli news outlets.\n\n“The employee, who does not hold a diplomatic visa, was not arrested and returned to Israel as scheduled.”\n\nJustice Department blames local Democrat\n\nWith the spotlight on the Trump administration, the Justice Department has tried to shift the blame for the release of Alexandrovich to the local Democratic prosecutor in Clark County.\n\nActing US Attorney for the District of Nevada Sigal Chattah on Monday released a statement saying that the Clark County District Attorney’s office – not federal authorities – “is handling the prosecution” of the Israeli officials.\n\nShortly after that proclamation, Chattah wrote on social media: “A liberal district attorney and state court judge in Nevada FAILED TO REQUIRE AN ALLEGED CHILD MOLESTER TO SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT, which allowed him to flee our country.”\n\nShe added that Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel are “outraged” about the incident.\n\n“The individual who fled our country should have had his passport seized by the state authorities. He must be returned immediately to face justice,” Chattah said.\n\n— US Attorney Nevada (@USAO_NV) August 18, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, the controversy has brought scrutiny to Chattah’s record, who has a history of posting bigoted and dehumanising posts against Palestinians.\n\nOn her now-deleted personal X account, Chattah has referred to Palestinians in Gaza as “animals”, called for wiping the territory “off the map”, and suggested that “even the children” in the enclave are “terrorists”.\n\nThe Justice Department and Chattah’s office did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nDavies noted that Alexandrovich could still be extradited to face trial in the US, but the issue would require political will.\n\n“The court should be concerned about protecting children in this community and nationwide. So it’s highly unusual – again – to allow this person to leave. Can they extradite them? Yes, they can. Will they? I guess that remains to be seen.”","summary":"Release of senior Israeli official facing serious child sex charges in Nevada stirs controversy and raises questions.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/19/how-was-an-alleged-israeli-child-sex-predator-allowed-to-leave-the-us?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250102__2192081040__v1__HighRes__CybertruckExplosionOutsideTrumpInternational-1755642425.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:27:21","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.439},{"id":352254404,"title":"'Years‑long fraudulent scheme': Christian network sues Dr. Phil over $500 million deal","text":"Trinity Broadcast Network (TBN), the world’s largest Christian television network, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against TV show host Dr. Phil (Phil McGraw) and his production company, Peteski Productions, alleging fraud and breach of contract in what TBN describes as a “years‑long fraudulent scheme.”The suit stems from a $500 million agreement intended to produce and distribute 160 new 90‑minute episodes of \"Dr. Phil \"after McGraw’s departure from CBS in 2023.Dr. Phil, a MAGA-friendly anchor who has been vocally supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids under President Donald Trump's administration, has been accused by the network of promising more than he delivered when he inked a $500 million agreement to produce and distribute his show following his departure from CBS in 2023.READ MORE: 'Texas Republicans have lost their damned minds': Outrage as GOP employs 'Jim Crow playbook'\n\nThe lawsuit, lodged in a federal bankruptcy court in Texas, accuses McGraw of orchestrating a bidding war illusion between TBN and CBS through deceptive statements.TBN further claims that McGraw initially agreed to transfer the rights to the Dr. Phil Show’s archive but then “brazenly demanded that TBN pay him $100 million to obtain a 50 percent interest in the media library.”According to the suit, McGraw’s company Peteski “reiterated numerous representations related to the then‑current advertising revenue, product integrations, production costs, and viewership of the Dr. Phil Show.”READ MORE: Trump rages against 'woke' Smithsonian for saying 'how bad slavery was'On the basis of these purported misrepresentations, McGraw persuaded TBN to pay $20 million upfront, along with annual payments of $50 million for 10 years, in exchange for 160 new episodes of Dr. Phil.","summary":"Trinity Broadcast Network (TBN), the world’s largest Christian television network, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against TV show host Dr. Phil (Phil McGraw) and his production company, Peteski Productions, alleging fraud and breach of contract in what TBN describes as a “years‑long fraudulent scheme.”\n\nThe suit stems from a $500 million agreement intended to produce and distribute 160 new 90‑minute episodes of \"Dr. Phil \"after McGraw’s departure from CBS in 2023.\n\nDr. Phil, a MAGA-friendly anchor who has been vocally supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids under President Donald Trump's administration, has been accused by the network of promising more than he delivered when he inked a $500 million agreement to produce and distribute his show following his departure from CBS in 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Texas Republicans have lost their damned minds': Outrage as GOP employs 'Jim Crow playbook'\n\nThe contract called for 90‑minute episodes filmed over six to seven months.

The Trump administration is positioned to pressure the EU into a fairer trading atmosphere and ease burdens on the American energy sector, industry insiders told the DCNF.\n\n“It’s going to take the pressure of the Trump administration in the trade negotiations to get the EU to back down from these extraterritorial regulations imposed on American companies, including U.S. oil and natural gas producers,” Vice President of Corporate Policy at the American Petroleum Institute (API) Aaron Padilla told the DCNF. “The EU should not make it more difficult for companies to provide the energy that their consumers need.”(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Energy Agenda Can Help US Beat China In Crucial Tech Race, Oil Industry Leader Says)\n\nEnergy sector experts and insiders specifically pointed to the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (CER), the EU methane regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The CSDDD requires companies to have a net-zero transition plan and the EU methane regulation places additional stringent emissions standards on the oil and gas industry, while the CER requires companies to report a whole host of risks that add red tape, according to energy insiders.\n\nTrump has threatened the EU with tariffs to buy American oil and gas, and part of the major July trade deal required the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy by 2028.\n\n“The Administration continues to address trade barriers against every American industry with our trading partners, and commitments from the EU, Japan, South Korea, and other countries to buy hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American energy over the next few years reflect how President Trump is delivering on his agenda of fair trade and drill, baby, drill,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told the DCNF.\n\nTammy Nemeth, a strategic energy analyst, told the DCNF that the climate regulations and directives are burdensome to American oil and gas companies. Nemeth argues that these regulations increase costs on U.S. businesses and Americans as companies hoping to do business in the EU have to wrestle with layers of red tape and adopt a net-zero transition plan. It is difficult to estimate, but compliance with EU climate regulations and directives can add significant costs, according to Nemeth.\n\n“I think if companies are approaching [these non-tariff barriers] with open eyes, they’ll say we need the government to help us maybe eliminate some of these non-tariff barriers, because if the compliance costs [equate to a] 10 to 30% increase, then that’s something that they have to pass on, not just to those to whom they’re exporting, but also domestically, because those are costs that are borne by the entire company,” Nemeth told the DCNF. “[These non-tariff barriers] could therefore increase costs to Americans, not just passing it on only to the Europeans, because all of those bureaucratic structures have to be established within the company, and that’s cost they have to absorb or pass on in some way.”\n\nIf American oil and gas companies decide to not comply with the climate regulations, they can be heavily fined or essentially forced out of trading with the EU, Nemeth said.\n\n“It’s really quite absurd,” Nemeth said, noting that the EU already requires a significant amount of red tape and environmental reporting paperwork. Nemeth added that all the reporting also can open companies up to environmental litigation. \n\nAPI has generally supported President Donald Trump’s energy policy and praised his April decision to exempt oil and gas from new reciprocal tariffs, however, the trade association argues that now is the time to force the EU into relaxing its non-tariff barriers. API has asked the Trump administration to negotiate EU non-tariff barriers, including the CSDDD and the EU methane regulation, to ease burdens on American oil and gas companies hoping to do business in the EU, Padilla noted. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio rejected the International Maritime Organization’s net-zero framework on Tuesday, stating that the U.S. “will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.” (RELATED: Trump Delivers Fresh Threats To Europe, Demands They Buy American Oil Or Face Tariffs)\n\nAn EU official told the DCNF that negotiations with the U.S. are still ongoing, though any amendments to EU legislation would represent a non-negotiable boundary for the EU.\n\nEnergy costs have been a major concern for European officials following the 2022 spike in prices, which hit the continent’s economies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and weaponization of its natural gas supply. Many European countries are also devoted to a green energy transition as the continent faces high electricity prices and grid instability. \n\nNotably, several European countries have recently moved to rethink or reverse their anti-nuclear pledges in search of a sustainable energy resource. \n\n“We say to the Europeans, you don’t need to put these non-tariff barriers into place. The only result of them is going to be to make it more expensive and difficult for Europeans to import the energy that they need from the United States. Don’t bite the hand that feeds you,” Padilla said. “You need oil and you need natural gas from the United States, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. So, don’t make it more difficult to get that energy that you need from the United States.”\n\nNemeth and other energy policy experts argued that these non-tariff barriers work to benefit EU oil and gas companies and disincentivize American companies from competing in the European market.\n\n“For years, the European Union has used trade policy as a backdoor to impose its climate agenda on American businesses. Their reporting rules and carbon tariffs aren’t about saving the planet, they’re about controlling markets and kneecapping competitors,” CEO and founder of the American Energy Institute Jason Isaac told the DCNF. “As President Trump negotiates with the EU, the first order of business must include a clear commitment to scrap these schemes. The United States should set the terms and not let European bureaucrats punish American energy.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In an interview with “The Will Cain Show,” former KGB agent Jack Barsky said that the hostility between the two leaders goes beyond current politics and reflects a national identity crisis that neither side is prepared to resolve.\n\n“I’m picturing Zelenskyy and Putin sitting at the same table staring at each other. They hate each other like two people can hate each other, period. And that hatred is rooted in the history of both nations, started in the Middle Ages when the Kyivan Rus was formed,” Barsky told host Will Cain. “And I know enough Ukrainians and Russians to know that this hatred is not going to end.”\n\nBarsky warned that any proposal for peace would face a deadlock. Putin and Zelenskyy, he added, would need to make concessions while having a level of trust that simply doesn’t exist between them.\n\n“Assuming that there is a proposal on the table that comes from the United States, based on what you just said, that means both players have to give something up and have to trust that the other side gives something up. It’s also there’s a personal aspect involved,” Barsky said.\n\nThe former agent said both leaders remain trapped by ego and ambition, unable to make compromises because neither wants to appear weak or walk away without claiming some form of victory.\n\n“Both of these guys are narcissists, political narcissists who are working diligently on their legacy. They can’t walk away as losers. So they don’t trust each other. And so how can they trust that the other side will give something up too so they can walk away as not losers, but sort of at least play it that way that, you know, we won something?” Barsky asked.

Several European leaders also joined the discussions at the White House to review potential terms for a peace agreement. Before the talks began, Trump urged Zelenskyy to abandon efforts to join NATO and reclaim Crimea.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had wrapped up discussions with Zelenskyy and the European delegates. He said that the group addressed possible security arrangements, which would involve coordination between the United States and European nations.

An eyebrow-raising scene played out this time in Washington, D.C., as world leaders crowded around the Resolute Desk like schoolchildren and Trump at one point dismissed them for an impromptu call with Putin. Afterwards, the pro-Ukraine delegation was echoing a level of optimism that the White House was eager to echo at a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\nYet, there was one other development that took place over Monday and Tuesday that could keep progress towards a peace agreement elusive. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the Trump administration was wholly opposed to deploying troops to support Ukraine under any circumstances, and was only considering acting as a coordinator for a security agreement between Ukraine and its European neighbors. She couldn’t tell reporters where common ground on the issue still existed with Russia — which separately indicated through statements that a European security force in Ukraine was off the table.\n\n\"U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine,” Leavitt said on Tuesday. “But we can certainly help in the coordination, and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.”\n\nThe erosion of that common ground that Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff eagerly proclaimed had been found in an interview Sunday could present the biggest obstacle to a long-term peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia going forward.\n\nOn Sunday, the administration’s go-to conflict resolution expert was on CNN, telling Jake Tapper that Putin had agreed to allow “Article 5-like protections” to Ukraine, something he called a “game-changer” in the path towards a peace deal.\n\n“We got to an agreement that the United States and other European nations could effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee,” Witkoff said.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, it was completely unclear whether that was still a feasible suggestion. Russian officials repeated their objections to NATO forces entering Ukraine under any circumstances. The White House rejected the prospect of U.S. boots on the ground at any point. Yet Zelensky, in his own statements, has made clear that his government will not lay down arms without a concrete arrangement protecting his country’s sovereignty and borders from future Russian aggression. He wrote on Saturday on Twitter/X: “Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the U.S.”\n\nIt’s a demand seen all the more crucial by Kyiv, given that Trump is now talking openly about ceding the Donbas region, part of which is occupied by Ukrainian forces, to Putin as a concession to make a deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Leavitt was pressed further to confirm that Vladimir Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky within two weeks, something the Kremlin has not yet stated definitively.\n\nJust the development of the two leaders in the same room would present a massive step forward in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. But Russian officials previously agreed to begin “direct” talks with Ukraine in May, only for those plans to be abandoned. Kremlin officials seemed to already be moving in that direction on Tuesday, saying that talks needed to begin “gradually”.\n\n\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks,\" Trump himself told reporters on Tuesday. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"","summary":"The U.S. won’t send troops, and Russia won’t accept forces from NATO states in Ukraine, writes John Bowden. So what kind of security guarantee is it really?","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ukraine-security-guarantee-b2810683.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/19/7/26/US-UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT-DIPLOMACY-2s6apyf9.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HUxeZPyV-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:09:43","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":352239656,"title":"What 'security guarantees' for Ukraine would actually mean","text":"In the wake of this week's historic White House meetings, President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine and its allies are \"already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees\". \n\nSir Keir Starmer has been chairing a virtual meeting of those nations prepared to help secure Ukraine after a peace deal - the so-called \"Coalition of the Willing\". \n\nAnd Britain has dispatched its Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, to Washington to work out how the US can help. The cogs are clearly turning.\n\nBut what do \"security guarantees\" actually mean in practice?\n\nThere is a wide spectrum here, ranging from the much overused \"boots on the ground\" to the threat of crippling economic sanctions on Russia's oil exports.\n\nLet's start with what Ukraine wants, and isn't going to get, at least not for the foreseeable future, and that's membership of Nato. \n\nUS President Donald Trump has ruled that out but there are plenty of other Nato members who also quietly oppose it, such as Slovakia, mainly on the grounds it would dramatically raise the chances of the transatlantic alliance getting dragged into a shooting war with Russia.\n\nClearly Ukraine will need strong security guarantees after a peace agreement is reached, to prevent Russia from coming back and taking a second, or third, bite. \n\nThis is why Sir Keir and President Emmanuel Macron of France have been putting together the 30-plus nation Coalition of the Willing with the aim of providing Ukraine with some international reassurance after a peace deal is signed.\n\nPolicing Ukraine's airspace is one likely option. This could be done by basing planes at existing airbases in neighbouring Poland or Romania, with US participation. \n\nBut they would still need clear and robust rules of engagement if they are to be anything more than a symbolic gesture. \n\nIn other words, pilots need to know whether or not they can shoot back if Russia violates the peace deal by say, firing a cruise missile at a Ukrainian city.\n\nThe Black Sea is another area where Western security guarantees could help keep Russia's fleet at bay and ensure the free flow of commercial vessels out of ports such as Odesa.\n\nOn land, the situation becomes more problematic. Ukraine is a vast country and the front line currently stretches for more than 600 miles, or 1000km-plus. \n\nThe Coalition of the Willing cannot possibly muster enough troops to deploy to safeguard that line of contact, even if Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to that, which he won't. \n\nThe Kremlin has reiterated its absolute opposition to the presence of any Nato troops in Ukraine, under whatever badge. So military support here is likely to be more in the areas of training, intelligence and logistic support, helping Ukraine to rebuild its bruised army, along with an ongoing supply of weapons and ammunition.\n\nA big question mark, though, remains over what Russia will accept as security guarantees for Ukraine. Plenty of commentators online have suggested that Moscow should have no say in this matter at all. \n\nBut no countries in the Coalition of the Willing are prepared to send troops into Ukraine opposed. Nobody wants to start World War Three.\n\nJohn Foreman, a former British military attaché in Moscow who has been following every twist and turn of this conflict, told me: \"Russia might accept a US security guarantee for Ukraine in return for formal recognition of the occupied territories, effectively partitioning Ukraine for the long term, and no NATO (troops) in Ukraine and no Ukraine in NATO…Whatever happens, the Coalition of the Willing is no substitute for US power.\"","summary":"There are inherent contradictions in the idea of the guarantees meant to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine again","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2qr08l1yko","image":"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:09:19","author":"Frank Gardner","authors":["Frank Gardner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":352242948,"title":"Tommy Fury is supported by his family at the screening for his new documentary - but Molly-Mae Hague is a no show after he vowed to keep their relationship private","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Aug 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Costner drops explosive images that threaten to blow 'unscripted rape' claim sky-high\n\nInside the 'dark side' of tourist destination where a British woman was forced to pay thousands to rescue animals from 'death camp for dogs'\n\nEuroMillions winning numbers for biggest EVER jackpot are revealed - are YOU £210million richer?\n\nSARAH VINE: I hate having to rent.

It's all been lived out in front of a camera or on the front page of a newspaper.

I'm not happy that I went through that, but I'm grateful for the lessons that I've learned, and I don't think I would've known half of what I know about myself if I never went through that.'\nManchesterTommy FuryKaz CrossleyInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTommy Fury is supported by his family at the screening for his new documentary - but Molly-Mae Hague is a no show after he vowed to keep their relationship private\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 43\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

And it is not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct.”\n\nLast month, the federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered his release from jail before trial, finding that prosecutors failed to show “any evidence” that his history or arguments against him warrant his ongoing detention.\n\nThat order arrived moments after another federal judge overseeing his wrongful deportation case blocked the Trump administration from immediately arresting and deporting him after he is set to be released from jail.\n\nThe court agreed to pause his release from pretrial detention so attorneys can “evaluate options” as they brace for immigration officers to arrest and remove him a second time.\n\nThat pause is set to expire this Friday August 22.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s attorneys argue he was only charged because “he refused to acquiesce in the government’s violation of his due process rights.”\n\n“Rather than fix its mistake and return [him] to the United States, the government fought back at every level of the federal court system,” attorneys wrote. “And at every level, [he] won. This case results from the government’s concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back, rather than accept a brutal injustice.”\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Homeland Security.\n\nIn court filings, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys detailed the “severe mistreatment” and “torture” he experienced during his month-long detention inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.\n\nHis attorneys say the 29-year-old father was subject to “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” at the facility.\n\n“A group of the most senior officials in the United States sought vengeance: they began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation that led to the charges in this case,” his attorneys wrote.\n\nHis lawyers admitted that motions to dismiss on grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution are rarely granted but “if there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case,” they said.\n\n“The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort,” his attorneys wrote.\n\nAbrego Garcia — who entered the country illegally as a teenager after fleeing gang violence in El Salvador — was deported on March 15 despite an immigration judge’s order that blocked his removal from the country for humanitarian reasons.\n\nGovernment lawyers admitted in court documents that he was removed from the country due to a procedural error and several federal judges and a unanimous Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return.\n\nStill, the government spent weeks battling court orders while officials publicly said he would never step foot in the United States, characterizing him as a serial abuser and criminal gang member.\n\nEmails and text messages provided to members of Congress appear to show that administration officials and government lawyers were sympathetic to his wrongful removal and made efforts to get him out of El Salvador before the case made headlines, which caused major headaches for the White House.\n\nA two-count indictment in Tennessee accuses Abrego Garcia of participating in a years-long conspiracy to illegally move undocumented immigrants from Texas to other parts of the country. He faces one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.\n\nBut in their request to keep him in jail before trial, federal prosecutors also claimed he is a member of transnational gang MS-13, and “personally participated in violent crime, including murder.”\n\nProsecutors also claim he “abused” women and trafficked children, firearms and narcotics, and there is also an ongoing investigation into “solicitation of child pornography.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is not facing any charges on those allegations and a federal judge determined that the government failed to link those allegations to evidence that implicates him.","summary":"Lawyers for wrongfully deported Salvadoran man say federal prosecutors are retaliating against him for ‘having the audacity to fight back’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia-trump-criminal-case-dismiss-b2810680.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/19/46/FILE-PHOTO-A-picture-shows-Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia-a-Salvadoran-migrant-who-lived-in-the-U-S--legally-w.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F91BCwKG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-19 23:06:34","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.876},{"id":352326174,"title":"Justin Baldoni hits back at Isabela Ferrer's harassment claims amid Blake Lively legal battle","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Costner drops explosive images that threaten to blow 'unscripted rape' claim sky-high\n\nInside the 'dark side' of tourist destination where a British woman was forced to pay thousands to rescue animals from 'death camp for dogs'\n\nMassive £210million Euromillions jackpot is WON by ticketholder\n\nSARAH VINE: I hate having to rent.

Liman to 'grant' their request to serve Ferrer 'via alternative means.' \nMeanwhile, in legal docs obtained by People, Ferrer's lawyers alleged Baldoni 'engaged in bad faith tactics' and filed his motion 'for improper purposes and with the aim of harassing' and 'exerting pressure on' her.\nWhen the granddaughter of Rosemary Clooney and José Ferrer responded to Blake's subpoena in February, she invoked an indemnification clause in her It Ends with Us acting contract with Wayfarer Studios requiring them to pay her legal fees.\nMichelman alleged that Wayfarer agreed only on the 'serious' condition that Isabela 'confirm that she will \"surrender control\"' of her response, and she's since hired private counsel.\nThe legal docs read: 'Baldoni made no effort to tailor the subpoena towards the production of new or different materials, demonstrating that the real aim of the Baldoni subpoena, as well as the pending motion, is to harass Ms. Ferrer.'\nMichelman asked Judge Lewis J. Liman to 'deny the motion in its entirety and impose appropriate sanctions against Baldoni.'\n\nView gallery\n\nBaldoni, 41, has denied the claims by 24-year-old actress Ferrer (pictured in London in Augsut 2024) who filed a fiery legal rebuttal to director-star over alleged repeated attempts to subpoena her \n\nView gallery\n\nDaily Mail has obtained documents filed by Baldoni's team on Monday in which they claimed they were issued a subpoena for Ferrer to obtain 'documents that she either neglected to produce or were not requested' by Lively's Team (Lively is seen in New York in June) \nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the reps of Ferrer and Baldoni for comment on her August 12th filing.\nThe Wayfarer Studios co-founder selected the native New Yorker to make her big-screen acting debut as the young Lily Bloom in 2023 following a nationwide open casting call and an alleged thumbs up from Taylor Swift.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Taylor Swift says Blake Lively 'exploited' her \nBlake alleged that after Justin filmed the scene of young Lily losing her virginity for a flashback, he approached the actors and said: 'I know I'm not supposed to say this, but that was hot.'\nBut when asked about Baldoni during an EPK promotional interview in 2023, Isabela gushed that he 'has a really great method of just being able to keep things positive' on set.\n'I feel like that's, as an actor who's also first starting, when you're trying to get used to everything, it's really important to have someone go, \"That's really good. Okay, now let's look at this,\"' Ferrer continued.\n'And there's no patronizing, there's no, I don't feel not heard. I always feel like I can go up to him and ask for anything. I mean, our first phone call after I got this job, it was a FaceTime, and the first thing he said to be was like, whatever you need wherever, call me. I immediately had his number. There was an immediate understanding that literally, whatever, if I needed anything, I knew that I could reach out to him.'\nTwo weeks after production wrapped that same year, the former restaurant worker thanked the Man Enough podcaster for 'an incredible experience on my first film' as documented on his website.\n'I still can't shake the feeling of it all because it truly was life changing for me,' Isabela gushed via text.\n\nJustin Baldoni shock appearance during Blake Lively deposition\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:38\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nFerrer's lawyers alleged Baldoni 'engaged in bad faith tactics' and filed his motion 'for improper purposes and with the aim of harassing' and 'exerting pressure on' her\n\nView gallery\n\nMichelman asked Judge Lewis J.

I couldn't have asked for a more welcoming environment.

Isabela is my main priority.'\nFerrer enjoyed sleepovers with 'angel' mentor Blake, who styled her for the premieres, and told People last year: 'To be able to connect with the person that you're sharing a role with is huge, and she's just a really good person.'\n'How she manages four children with the businesses that she has and [her] career as an actor and a producer and everything else,' the Carnegie Mellon University grad marveled.\n'I mean, she is Wonder Woman.

At least three Aegis guided-missile destroyers — USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham among them — are part of the mission, two U.S. officials anonymously told the Associated Press Tuesday. Another official told Reuters the deployment, which could arrive soon, involves around 4,000 Marines and soldiers \"over the course of several months,\" backed by spy planes, warships and a submarine so that international waters and skies are covered. Tuesday's massive operation marks a dramatic escalation in Trump's push to block fentanyl and drug pipelines fueling America’s overdose crisis. TRUMP SENDS MILITARY AFTER THE CARTELS AND IT’S LONG OVERDUE It also comes as the administration called Venezuela’s regime a \"narco-terror cartel\" and demanded that President Nicolás Maduro be held accountable. When asked about this latest military vessel dispatch, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president \"has been very clear and consistent\" about using \"every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice.\" During a White House press briefing, she added: \"The Maduro regime is not the legitimate government of Venezuela. It is a narco-terror cartel. Maduro is a fugitive head of this cartel who has been indicted in the United States for trafficking drugs into the country.\" US ACCUSES VENEZUELAN REGIME OF NARCO-TERRORISM OVER ALLIANCES WITH TREN DE ARAGUA, SINALOA CARTEL Attorney General Pam Bondi last week also announced a historic $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest — more than triple the $15 million offer first unveiled in 2020. Meanwhile, the Justice Department says it has already seized more than $700 million in assets tied to the embattled dictator, including two private jets and nine luxury vehicles. Maduro, indicted in New York in 2020 on narco-terrorism and cocaine importation conspiracy charges, has clung to power with military backing and allegedly with support from Russia, China and Cuba.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has also been urged by Trump to cooperate further on security and clamp down on cartels. So far, Sheinbaum has rejected suggestions of military intervention.
