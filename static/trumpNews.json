The 90-minute debate, scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday in a Manhattan studio that once hosted the children’s program “Captain Kangaroo,” will be moderated by the outgoing “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell and “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan. During ABC’s debate between presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Donald Trump earlier this month, network moderators on four occasions pointed out inaccurate statements by Trump, and none by Harris. That infuriated the former president and his supporters, who complained it was unfair. Last spring, CNN moderators did not question any facts presented by Trump and President Biden in the debate where Biden’s poor performance eventually led to him dropping out of the race. On Friday, CBS said the onus will be on Vance and Walz to point out misstatements by the other, and that “the moderators will facilitate those opportunities” during rebuttal time. The network said its own misinformation unit, CBS News Confirmed, will provide real-time fact-checking during the debate on its live blog and on social media, and on the air during post-debate analysis. With its plans, CBS News is clearly indicating it wants to take a step back from the heat generated by calling attention to misleading statements by candidates. Some argue that offstage fact-checking is too little, too late and not seen by many people who watch the event. It’s not the first time Angie Drodnic Holan, director of the international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, said she has seen examples of moderators who have successfully encouraged candidates to keep their opponents honest. “I’ll be interested in seeing how this works in practice,” she said. “Having said that, you’re basically off-loading one of your journalistic responsibilities onto the candidates themselves, so I don’t think that it’s ideal. It takes journalistic courage to be willing to fact-check the candidates, because the candidates are absolutely going to complain about it. I don’t think the moderators’ first goal is to avoid controversy.” During the ABC debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis corrected Trump statements on abortion, the 2020 election, crime statistics and reports that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. Unlike the two presidential debates, the two sides agreed that the vice presidential candidates’ microphones will not be turned off while their opponent is speaking, increasing the chance for genuine back-and-forth exchanges and the risk that the two men will talk over each other. CBS says it reserves the right to shut off a “hot mic” when necessary. Each candidate will have two minutes for a closing statement, with Vance winning a virtual coin toss and choosing to get the last word. The stakes are high for CBS News It’s a big moment for CBS News, long mired in third place in the evening news ratings. O’Donnell just announced she was stepping down from the role. Brennan is considered a rising star. Like with the presidential debates, CBS is making its feed available for other networks to televise, and many are expected to take advantage of the opportunity. There will be no audience when Vance and Walz meet at a West Side studio that, in its past, has hosted editions of “60 Minutes,” “CBS Sunday Morning,” “Inside the NFL,” “Geraldo” and “Captain Kangaroo.” It’s not known whether there will be other opportunities to see Trump and Harris together on the same stage before the Nov. 5 election. Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for another debate on Oct. 23, but Trump has rejected it. In a poll taken by Quinnipiac University and released earlier this week, likely voters said by roughly a two-to-one margin that they’d like them face off again. CBS’ “60 Minutes” is looking to land both Harris and Trump for back-to-back interviews that will air on Oct. 7, but neither candidate has committed to it yet.","summary":"With its plans, CBS News is clearly indicating it wants to take a step back from the heat generated by calling attention to misleading statements by candidates.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/media/cbs-news-says-vance-walz-will-have-to-fact-check-each-other-in-vp-debate/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/cbs-vp-debate.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727464203&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1HSoAkCv-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:56:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":257695958,"title":"Ukraine war: US Sec. of State Blinken questions China peace push over Russia help","text":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday questioned China’s sincerity in seeking peace in Ukraine as he directly pressed his counterpart over exports that boost Russia’s military. Blinken met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the latest talks as the two powers look to dial down once-soaring tensions. While crediting the diplomacy with bringing progress, Blinken warned that the United States would not back down on concerns over China’s exports to Russia and made clear that Washington could impose more sanctions. Blinken said that China is fueling the “war machine” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “When Beijing says that, on the one hand, that it wants peace, it wants to see an end to the conflict, but on the other hand is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression, that doesn’t add up,” Blinken told a news conference. “Our intent is not to decouple Russia from China. Their relationship is their business,” he said. “But insofar as that relationship involves providing Russia what it needs to continue this war, that’s a problem for us, and it’s a problem for many other countries, notably in Europe,” Blinken added. The top US diplomat said that China has provided 70 percent of machine tools and 90 percent of microelectronics needed by Russia for military production that includes rockets and armored vehicles. China counters that it has not directly provided weapons to Russia and draws a contrast with the United States, which has shipped billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion by Russia. Wang told a Security Council session on Tuesday that China “is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor are we a party to it. China has all along stood on the side of peace.” Keeping up peace push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a UN address criticized China and Brazil for promoting negotiations to end the war, saying that forcing Ukraine to accept a peace deal was akin to colonialism. The two countries kept up the drive on Friday, leading a statement with other emerging powers that calls for a “comprehensive and lasting settlement” through diplomacy. But in a thinly veiled criticism of Putin’s recent saber-rattling, the emerging powers called on all sides to refrain “from the use or the threat of weapons of mass destruction.” South Africa and Turkey were among the powers that also signed the statement. Putin this week threatened to use nuclear weapons in the event of a major attack on Russian soil as Ukraine, looking to hit back against the invasion, seeks Western weapons to strike deeper across the border. Fruits of diplomacy Since Blinken and Wang last met in July at a regional conference in Laos, China has pleased the United States by releasing an American pastor imprisoned for years, although other Americans are detained. Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a summit in November 2023 with counterpart Joe Biden, agreed to key US demands of restoring military communication between the two powers. He also agreed to taking action against producers of ingredients in fentanyl, the painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States. But a wide range of disagreements remain. Blinken said he also warned Wang against Beijing’s “dangerous, destabilizing actions” on the South China Sea, where tensions have risen sharply between China and US ally the Philippines. The latest meeting came ahead of the November 5 election in which Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to take a harder line on China. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump, have said that they seek dialogue to avoid conflict between the two powers, although their administration has also taken a hard line. Blinken’s deputy, Kurt Campbell, recently told a congressional hearing that China posed a broader challenge to the United States than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War.

So why did she accept his fateful invitation that terrible summer?","text":"Whenever Princess Diana dropped into Harrods, typically via its most discreet entrance – Door 11 – she would check her wristwatch. Looking at her companion, she would ask: 'How long do you think we've got today? Four or five minutes?' This little game was played out time after time as the princess wondered just when her expedition would be interrupted by the establishment's bombastic Egyptian owner Mohamed Al-Fayed. Usually, she could hear him before she could see him: the heavy footfall of his --muscle-bound close protection detail cutting a swathe through other shoppers as they led Fayed to the princess where he would envelop her in a clammy embrace. 'How does he know I'm here so quickly?' she would murmur as he brushed off their encounters as mere chance. The answer, of course, was the CCTV that scanned the Knightsbridge department store's every aisle, corridor, exit and entrance – the same cameras the monstrous shopkeeper used to scour his own -emporium for attractive young female staff to groom and sexually abuse. As more women came forward this week with accounts of shocking allegations – 200 to date – it brought back another uncomfortable truth: that Princess Diana was as much a victim of Fayed's depravity as the girls he assaulted, raped and trafficked. The difference, of course, was that she was one of the few whom he treated with kid gloves – respect, even. This prolific sexual predator, who died aged 94 a year ago, did not grope Diana or trap her in a room and forcibly rub himself against her. Nor was she subjected to the obscenities and humiliating comments about her appearance directed at the girls who rejected his lascivious attention, let alone the fistfuls of cash he attempted to stuff down their blouses. The Diana he lavished with freebies whenever he managed to intercept her on those shopping trips was not part of his grubby sexual gratification but a target to be groomed, nonetheless. For him she represented the twin ambition of the respectability he craved as a retail magnate and revenge on the Establishment that had snobbishly – in his view – denied him his unquenched thirst for British citizenship. If his generous company, his family and, of course, the loving affection of his son Dodi, were good enough for the Princess of Wales, then how could the authorities refuse him the passport it had twice vetoed? As my colleague Amanda Platell movingly wrote for the Mail this week, had Diana heard one whisper of the appalling allegations against the man who so -dazzled her, she might still be alive today. These are the 'sliding doors' moments that can alter the trajectory of any life. And in fairness, had the princess worn a seatbelt as her chauffeur-driven, Fayed-funded car hurtled out of control and at high speed through the streets of Paris in 1997, she would almost certainly have survived the crash that killed her. But Amanda's point is a valid one: that had Diana known a fraction of the scurrilous claims against Fayed she might not have taken up with his son. At that time Fayed was not exactly a monster hiding in plain sight. Only after the princess's death did women begin to air their claims against him in earnest. True, Vanity Fair had published a dossier about Fayed and aspects of his grotesque behaviour in which it described how he 'walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office. Some were asked to go to Paris with him. Good-looking women were given gifts and cash bonuses almost before they understood they were being compromised. ''Come to Papa,'' he would say. ''Give Papa a hug.''' That article appeared in 1995, two years before the princess accepted Fayed's invitation to spend the summer, with William and Harry, at his beachside home in St Tropez. It was the start of a sequence of events that was to end in tragedy seven weeks later. For such explosive allegations the article received remarkably little coverage from Britain's media, no doubt in part because the notoriously writ-happy Fayed threatened to sue anyone who repeated them. But also because he had by then cultivated an avuncular image as an outsider who with his famous clip-on ties – which he said were to foil an assassin's attempt to strangle him – had 'rescued' one of Britain's great institutions and restored Harrods to its former glory. Diana, however, did subscribe to the glossy mag – she appeared on its cover in a memorable photoshoot just weeks before her death. What is more, I can reveal, she had once previously turned down a Fayed request. Seven years before accepting that fatal invitation, she had received a similar offer to join Fayed and his family – and she was tempted to go. She asked her security to fly to France to carry out a 'recce' or reconnaissance of the property where Fayed had offered to host her and the princes, then aged eight and five. But there was one crucial difference – Diana was still a senior member of the Royal Family and although not happily married her separation from Charles was on a distant horizon. As the police officer asked to carry out Diana's instructions, her then bodyguard Inspector Ken Wharfe was immediately wary. 'We may not have known anything about him and girls at that stage, but his reputation was already controversial and I was very anxious that Diana associating with him would not only harm her, but the good name of the monarchy,' Wharfe recalled this week. The reason for his anxiety was a scathing report from the Department of Trade and Industry, published in 1990, into how Fayed and his brothers had acquired -Harrods in a £615 million takeover five years earlier. It revealed how the tycoon had fabricated stories about his origins, wealth, business interests and resources. Decades before Donald Trump coined the phrase 'fake news', Fayed created what the government inspectors who led the investigation termed 'new fact: that lies were the truth and that the truth was a lie'. Wharfe said: 'I told her that he was basically a villain and it would make life very difficult for the Queen if he was able to parade the princess and the boys as his guests at a time when he was -publicly fighting Her Majesty's government over its failure to grant him a passport. 'Happily, back then she would take advice and was shrewd enough to see what I was driving at.' Diana declined the invitation. By 1997, however, as the princess had emerged from her broken marriage and been stripped of her royal title, she was no longer obliged to follow palace rules. Fayed had, in the intervening years, become an even more toxic figure. By bribing Tory MPs – then gleefully exposing them – he played a substantial role in the cash for questions scandal that destroyed the Conservative government of John Major. So when in early June that year Diana casually mentioned to friends that she had accepted an invitation for a summer holiday at the home of the foul-mouthed Fayed, many were horrified. They warned her that she would almost certainly be used and possibly compromised. One close friend told her all Fayed's properties were wired for audio and video and that he eavesdropped – and worse – on his guests. The message was clear: Diana couldn't even be certain of being able to undress without being watched. When I suggested he was not the cuddly figure he liked to appear at the annual Harrods sale, she bridled. She said she'd had a lifetime spotting charlatans who pirouetted around her former husband. 'Oilers,' she called the people who sucked up to the Prince of Wales. The Fayed she knew was a warm family man, whose four children with his second wife, Finnish former model Heini Wathen, were close in age to William and Harry. She told me she had been a guest at Fayed's Surrey home where she described an atmosphere of loving and happy domesticity. For a young woman brought up in a broken home after her parents separated and later on had seen her own marital happiness disintegrate, this was a joyful interlude for Diana. She also thought she had the measure of Fayed. A few weeks before the holiday invitation, he had asked her to inaugurate a Harrods escalator, in return for a £25,000 donation to a charity of her choice. She refused, telling me it was 'very tacky'. And just to prove that she had been listening to friends' concerns she began to jokily refer to Fayed as 'the phoney pharaoh', a nod to newspaper headlines about his behaviour. But if her friends were cautioning her against the holiday offer, one figure did not – Raine, her stepmother with whom she had reconciled following the royal separation. At one time a hated figure to Diana – she once pushed Raine down the stairs at Althorp, the Spencer family home – the princess had come to depend on the wise counsel of the woman who had nursed her father, the 8th Earl Spencer, following a stroke. The two met frequently for cosy lunches and Raine, who had been astutely hired by Fayed as a director of Harrods International, was insistent that she should take up the offer. She reminded the princess what a support Fayed had been to her father, who once told me that he considered Mohamed a 'good friend'. Raine and Johnny Spencer were guests of honour when Fayed threw a lavish party in Paris in 1989 to mark his £10 million restoration of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's former house, which he had acquired on a long lease, and they were frequently on Harrods' guest lists. Lord Spencer was a godson of the exiled King Edward VIII, a fact which surely can't have escaped Fayed's attention. After the earl's death, Fayed told Diana that her father had asked him to keep an eye on her. Even so, she found his attention on those Harrods shopping trips suffocating. 'He always tried to take over and give her stuff,' remembers Ken Wharfe. 'It always ended with her saying, 'Get me out of here, Ken!' But Fayed would never take no for an answer. Frequently delivery vans in the distinctive cream and green Harrods livery would trundle up the private road to Kensington Palace, depositing gifts for the princess and her sons – TVs, computer games and the latest electronic gadgets. When the princess told staff to send them back, an elderly Harrods beadle called Rodney would arrive on foot bearing yet more parcels. By now Fayed had inserted himself into the princess's life. In 1996 he had become a major backer of English National Ballet, one of the few patronages she kept up, with a donation of £100,000. It was at an ENB event at the Royal Albert Hall that he sprang his enticing holiday invitation. It was her first post-divorce summer and the princess felt she had to maintain the standards she and the boys had enjoyed while still a royal highness. The invitation over dinner following a gala performance by the ballet was posed with a homely informality. 'If you're at a loose end, come down and see us,' he suggested to her. She did not give an immediate 'yes' – she had other invitations from rich men but they both came with strings attached. The electronics mogul Gulu Lalvani had suggested a trip to his Thailand holiday home and American Teddy Forstmann, boss of Gulfstream private jets, had offered a stay in the wide-open spaces of Montana. The two men, however, wanted Diana to be more than just friends. How bitterly ironic that she ultimately chose the offer from the predatory Fayed whom she viewed as a father figure and who saw in the lonely and vulnerable princess an opportunity to make her his ultimate possession. If anything, the hostility of her friends towards Fayed helped propel her into his arms. He skilfully played on their joint 'outsider' status, convincing her that this gave them so much in common. She also noted that Fayed was not exactly a social outcast. He had been a long term sponsor of the Queen's favourite event, the Royal Windsor Horse Show, had entertained Prince Philip in the Harrods boardroom and invested in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme and financially backed Prince Charles's polo activities. He had also allowed Prince Edward, who was making a documentary about the Duke of Windsor, to film inside his Paris villa, and had offered Princess Anne the use of a cottage on his Balnagown Estate in Scotland, while Prince and Princess Michael of Kent had enjoyed a skiing holiday at his Swiss chalet. Was her acceptance of Fayed hospitality so very different? She she also liked to point out that Harrods still enjoyed the patronage of four royal warrants from her former husband's family. Even so, she was not prepared for the deluge of criticism that greeted her when her hoped-for secret holiday was uncovered within 24 hours of her arrival in France. I have a note of an exchange between us when she rang me, upset at media reports. Why was everyone so foul about Fayed, she asked. 'Because he is a sleazy man,' I replied. She countered immediately. 'What about Charles's trips on the Latsis boat? He's a crook.' This was a reference to the hospitality he had enjoyed from shipping tycoon John Latsis, described as a 'gangster' in his native Greece. She also pointed out that she had secured the permission of the Queen and Charles to take the boys and had informed the -Foreign Office. Accused by critics of becoming a rich man's trophy, she showed her disdain by extending her stay. By then, of course, she had met Fayed's son Dodi. Their deaths and the worldwide grief stilled the controversy but as Fayed began making outlandish claims that Prince Philip and MI6 were behind the fatal accident, sympathy evaporated. As the years passed the truth about 'the phoney pharaoh' began slowly to emerge with more and more claims about his vile activities. Scant comfort for his victims, however, and far, far too late for my friend Princess Diana.","summary":"Diana was as much a victim of Mohamed Al-Fayed's depravity as the girls he assaulted, raped and trafficked.

The two met frequently for cosy lunches and Raine, who had been astutely hired by Fayed as a director of Harrods International, was insistent that she should take up the offer. She reminded the princess what a support Fayed had been to her father, who once told me that he considered Mohamed a 'good friend'. Raine and Johnny Spencer were guests of honour when Fayed threw a lavish party in Paris in 1989 to mark his £10 million restoration of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's former house, which he had acquired on a long lease, and they were frequently on Harrods' guest lists. Lord Spencer was a godson of the exiled King Edward VIII, a fact which surely can't have escaped Fayed's attention. After the earl's death, Fayed told Diana that her father had asked him to keep an eye on her. Even so, she found his attention on those Harrods shopping trips suffocating. 'He always tried to take over and give her stuff,' remembers Ken Wharfe. 'It always ended with her saying, 'Get me out of here, Ken!' But Fayed would never take no for an answer. Frequently delivery vans in the distinctive cream and green Harrods livery would trundle up the private road to Kensington Palace, depositing gifts for the princess and her sons – TVs, computer games and the latest electronic gadgets. When the princess told staff to send them back, an elderly Harrods beadle called Rodney would arrive on foot bearing yet more parcels. By now Fayed had inserted himself into the princess's life. In 1996 he had become a major backer of English National Ballet, one of the few patronages she kept up, with a donation of £100,000. It was at an ENB event at the Royal Albert Hall that he sprang his enticing holiday invitation. It was her first post-divorce summer and the princess felt she had to maintain the standards she and the boys had enjoyed while still a royal highness. The invitation over dinner following a gala performance by the ballet was posed with a homely informality. 'If you're at a loose end, come down and see us,' he suggested to her. She did not give an immediate 'yes' – she had other invitations from rich men but they both came with strings attached. The electronics mogul Gulu Lalvani had suggested a trip to his Thailand holiday home and American Teddy Forstmann, boss of Gulfstream private jets, had offered a stay in the wide-open spaces of Montana. The two men, however, wanted Diana to be more than just friends. How bitterly ironic that she ultimately chose the offer from the predatory Fayed whom she viewed as a father figure and who saw in the lonely and vulnerable princess an opportunity to make her his ultimate possession. If anything, the hostility of her friends towards Fayed helped propel her into his arms. He skilfully played on their joint 'outsider' status, convincing her that this gave them so much in common. She also noted that Fayed was not exactly a social outcast. He had been a long term sponsor of the Queen's favourite event, the Royal Windsor Horse Show, had entertained Prince Philip in the Harrods boardroom and invested in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme and financially backed Prince Charles's polo activities. He had also allowed Prince Edward, who was making a documentary about the Duke of Windsor, to film inside his Paris villa, and had offered Princess Anne the use of a cottage on his Balnagown Estate in Scotland, while Prince and Princess Michael of Kent had enjoyed a skiing holiday at his Swiss chalet. Was her acceptance of Fayed hospitality so very different? She she also liked to point out that Harrods still enjoyed the patronage of four royal warrants from her former husband's family. Even so, she was not prepared for the deluge of criticism that greeted her when her hoped-for secret holiday was uncovered within 24 hours of her arrival in France. I have a note of an exchange between us when she rang me, upset at media reports. Why was everyone so foul about Fayed, she asked. 'Because he is a sleazy man,' I replied. She countered immediately. 'What about Charles's trips on the Latsis boat? He's a crook.' This was a reference to the hospitality he had enjoyed from shipping tycoon John Latsis, described as a 'gangster' in his native Greece. She also pointed out that she had secured the permission of the Queen and Charles to take the boys and had informed the -Foreign Office. Accused by critics of becoming a rich man's trophy, she showed her disdain by extending her stay. By then, of course, she had met Fayed's son Dodi. Their deaths and the worldwide grief stilled the controversy but as Fayed began making outlandish claims that Prince Philip and MI6 were behind the fatal accident, sympathy evaporated. As the years passed the truth about 'the phoney pharaoh' began slowly to emerge with more and more claims about his vile activities. Scant comfort for his victims, however, and far, far too late for my friend Princess Diana.","summary":"Diana was as much a victim of Mohamed Al-Fayed's depravity as the girls he assaulted, raped and trafficked.

Harris, a Democrat, arrived in Douglas, Arizona, a border town of less than 17,000 people, on Friday afternoon with a message ripped from Trump's playbook, hoping to convince voters that she can curb the numbers of people illegally entering the United States. Harris will call for tighter asylum restrictions in a speech later on Friday, her campaign said, leaving an asylum ban established by President Joe Biden in place longer and lowering the threshold at which it is activated. Some 7 million migrants have been arrested illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under Harris and Biden, according to government data, a record high number that has fueled criticism from Trump. Those border crossings have dropped sharply since Biden announced the asylum ban earlier this year. In Douglas, Harris spoke to Customs and Border Protection officials and viewed part of a border barrier constructed between 2011 and 2012, the White House said. Trump and his running mate JD Vance have increased their criticism of immigrants in recent weeks, repeating falsehoods about legal Haitian immigrants in Ohio and suggesting immigrants were committing crimes and stealing jobs. Immigration is a top issue for voters. Arizona is a closely contested election state, with a high population of Latino voters sought by both parties. And the nation's porous southern border remains a source of fentanyl, a leading cause of drug overdoses in the United States. On Friday, Trump blamed Harris for the rising trend of irregular migration. \"The architect of this destruction is Kamala Harris,\" Trump said at Trump Tower. \"She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border. We would merely ask, why didn't she do it four years ago? It's a very simple question.\" He also accused Harris of turning small towns in the U.S. into \"blighted refugee camps.\" A wide-ranging border security bill that took months to negotiate was blocked by the U.S. Senate in February, after Trump pressed Republicans to reject any compromise. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that 43% of voters favored Trump on the issue of immigration and 33% favored Harris, while 24% either didn't know, chose someone else or refused to answer. Harris was California's attorney general before being elected to the U.S. Senate and then vice president. Her California remit included targeting gangs that operate on both sides of the border and traffic in drugs, guns and people. Biden also tasked Harris with dealing with the root causes of migration from Central America, a diplomatic issue on which her record is mixed. Emigration from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia to the United States has created unease among voters concerned about what the trend means for the U.S. economy, crime rates and culture. The share of American residents born abroad rose by nearly a fifth to 47.8 million from 2010 to 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in her 2024 presidential campaign on Friday as her Republican opponent Donald Trump doubles down on…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/harris-to-call-for-tighter-immigration-controls-in-border-visit","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/37/d2/01e0455cfc9f724368fc66f0712be7f37dba/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:33:19","author":"Japan Today Editor,Trevor Hunnicutt","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Trevor Hunnicutt"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":257695634,"title":"Face it, Trump is a communist","text":"Recently, Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala Harris: “She's a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.” On the one hand, this isn’t worth taking seriously. After all, he’s putting everything he has mentally into stringing together words, any words, in the hope of scamming us into believing his lies. Whether it’s “Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist” or “person, woman, man, camera, TV,” it’s all kinda the same to the delusional and demented. On the other hand, we should take this seriously. I don’t mean asking whether Harris is a “Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.” She isn’t. I mean asking whether Trump is. Most of us understand why he’s a fascist. Too few of us understand why he’s a communist. In any conventional sense of the word, that’s what he is. And economics can have nothing to do with it. Just ask Ana Navarro, a former Republican who fled communist Nicaragua. At the Democratic National Convention, she said: \"Trump and his minions call Kamala a communist. I know communism. I fled communism from Nicaragua when I was 8 years old. I don’t take it lightly. And let me tell you what communist dictators do. … \"They attack the free press. They call them the enemy of the people, like Ortega does in Nicaragua. They put their unqualified relatives in cushy government jobs, so they can get rich off their positions, like the Castros do in Cuba. And they refuse to accept legitimate elections when they lose and call for violence to stay in power, like Maduro is doing right now in Venezuela. \"Now you tell me something. Do any of those things sound familiar? Is there anybody running for president who reminds you of that?\" That’s about power, but economics plays a role, too. History is filled with communist dictators who enacted economic agendas not because their policies were based on sound principles and solid data but because they served an immediate political interest. The outcome was sometimes the ruination of their country’s populations. Trump wants to decimate the labor supply by deporting 20 million “illegal immigrants.” He wants to impose an across-the-board tariff of 20 percent and more on all imported goods. And he wants to seize control of the Federal Reserve Bank’s power to set interest rates. A new report by the Peterson Institute, a very conservative think tank in Washington, found that these economic policies would “not only fail to solve inflation – they would make it much worse,” according to CNN. They would moreover depress growth, spike inflation and wipe out jobs to such a degree that the carnage would be felt well into 2040. “We find that ironically, despite his ‘make the foreigners pay’ rhetoric, this package of policies does more damage to the US economy than to any other in the world,” the Peterson Institute’s working paper said. This is not news. Anyone who knows anything about economics knows indiscriminate tariffs would help no one while harming everyone. Yet he keeps talking about them as if he cares about their real-world consequences. He doesn’t. He only cares about whether they work for him politically. In that, he’s just like a communist dictator. But there’s more to being a communist than power and economics. There’s character, too, or lack of it. The most important thing to Donald Trump is whether you like him. If you do, you’re good. If you don’t, you’re bad. It doesn’t matter that you once called yourself a “Black Nazi.” It doesn’t matter that you once said you would like slavery to return so you can own a few slaves. It doesn't matter that you once said you liked “tranny porn” and that you fantasize about peeping on women in public gyms. You can do all the things that North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson has reportedly done and it won’t matter to Trump. But Robinson likes him. So he endorsed Robinson. Former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory warned for years that Robinson was a “ticking time bomb.” He told CNN that even the quickest glance at his record would reveal things that are disqualifying. But McCrory is one of those RINOs (Republicans in name only). His warnings went nowhere, because if you don’t like Trump, he doesn’t like you. Due to the scandal surrounding Robinson, Trump might lose North Carolina. But defeat won’t be his fault. It will be McCrory’s. Such are the hallmarks of communist dictator. To be sure, my argument is a hard sell. Reasonable people may buy the idea that Donald Trump is a fascist, but not that he’s a communist. After all, he’s a billionaire. He’s on the side of the billionaire class. How can he be a communist? But reasonable people are overthinking it. Trump isn’t defending capitalism. He’s defending white power. If you prefer, he’s going to war against the enemies of the white collective. He’s prepared to use every instrument of the state toward that end. Reducing the labor supply (deportations), increasing taxes (tariffs) and seizing the power to set interest rates will hurt the country generally. But they will hurt nonwhite people more than white people. It would be a race to the bottom for everyone except the richest of Americans. But Trump wouldn’t be to blame. He’d find someone outside the white collective to accuse. Just like a communist.","summary":"Recently, Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala Harris: \n\n“She's a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.”\n\nOn the one hand, this isn’t worth taking seriously.

In the third of a four-part series on China’s ties with Asean, Orange Wang looks at how Beijing is using infrastructure to forge stronger links with the region. When Vietnam’s new top leader To Lam visited Beijing in mid-August, infrastructure was very much top of mind. During the trip, China agreed to support a feasibility study for two standard-gauge railway projects and help in the planning of another one in the Southeast Asian country, inching it forward in updating its colonial-era railways so they can link with Chinese train lines. Two weeks before that, Cambodia broke ground on the China-sponsored Funan Techo canal, which will connect the Mekong River with the Gulf of Thailand. The developments point to a Chinese infrastructure drive in Southeast Asia in high gear, and that analysts say is likely to give Beijing a geopolitical edge over Washington in a “critical battleground”. There are signs of movement elsewhere in the region, too. Bangkok launched passenger train services to Vientiane, Laos, three months after the approval of the second phase of a project in Thailand to connect high-speed railways in the three countries. The Laotian capital was first integrated into the Chinese high-speed railway network in December 2021, when a rail link to China’s Yunnan province opened. Meanwhile, Jakarta and Beijing have started discussions about extending a China-backed high-speed rail line in Indonesia, and a Chinese consortium has reportedly bid for contracts to build a high-speed rail project linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Nian Peng, director of the Research Centre for Asian Studies (RCAS) in Hong Kong, said there was an “accelerating trend” in infrastructure-based connectivity between China and Southeast Asia. Citing the developments on the routes to Vietnam and Thailand, he said China’s rail links with Southeast Asian countries had moved from nearly nothing before the China-Laos high-speed railway opened three years ago to “blossoming in multiple spots”. Peng predicted that this could help Beijing fend off the risk of the United States coaxing Southeast Asian countries into its orbit and pressuring them to decouple from the Chinese economy. “If we can achieve seamless docking of our infrastructure on land, including for highways, railways and aviation, we can put Southeast Asia firmly in a China-centred supply chain,” he said. “With the infrastructure connectivity between China and Southeast Asia advancing so rapidly, I think the US should be the most anxious one.” He added that the US and its ally Japan were unlikely to fully satisfy the region’s huge appetite for infrastructure due to limitations in funding and decision-making mechanisms, leaving a lot of space for China. However, Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the recent moves in China-Southeast Asia infrastructure cooperation were a “continuation” rather than an acceleration or a “new phase”. He noted that there had been no quantitative or qualitative leap compared to previous projects over the past decade. Still, he described Southeast Asia as a “priority” for China’s infrastructure engagement, adding that economic cooperation during the past three decades had helped put Beijing in a “leading position” over Washington in the region when it came to overall clout. “We can expect such effects may continue to be seen in the future,” Li said. He added that growing infrastructure investment would benefit China’s relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and help China compete for influence with other major powers in the region. “Southeast Asian countries will also gain many benefits, such as for their long-term economic development,” Li said, noting that they might leverage China’s offers to bargain with other powers for more attention and support. If we can achieve seamless docking of our infrastructure on land, including for highways, railways and aviation, we can put Southeast Asia firmly in a China-centred supply chain Nian Peng, analyst Building closer ties with Southeast Asian nations has become crucial for China in light of its fierce rivalry with Washington, a trade war that began under former US president Donald Trump and disruptions to global supply chains by the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Four years ago, the 10-member Asean bloc became Beijing’s biggest trading partner, while China has been the grouping’s top trading partner for 15 years straight. In US dollar terms, China’s exports to Asean grew by 10.6 per cent from a year earlier in the first eight months of 2024, and its imports from the bloc were up 3.5 per cent, according to the latest Chinese customs data on September 10. Figures from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce showed that China’s non-financial outbound direct investment to Asean jumped nearly 37 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Many Chinese companies have begun channelling their shipments to the rest of the world through Southeast Asian countries or relocating parts of their production lines to the region to bypass trade restrictions, such as tariffs, imposed by the US and its allies. The Asean countries have a population of nearly 700 million, representing a huge potential labour pool and a large consumer market for China to tap into. In an article published by Foreign Affairs earlier this month, Lynn Kuok, the Lee Kuan Yew chair in Southeast Asian Studies at the Brookings Institution, said projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative were “generally welcomed” in the region. Citing a survey by the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute released in April, she warned that the drop in support for the US in the region should sound alarm bells in Washington, which “sees China as its main competitor and the Indo-Pacific as a critical battleground”. “Southeast Asia lies at the geographic heart of this vast and dynamic region,” she added. Several Washington-led plans cover Southeast Asian infrastructure development. They include the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the Build Back Better World initiative and the Blue Dot Network. In an article published earlier this year, Yan Shaojun, a research fellow at the government-backed think tank China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, said that infrastructure had become a key element in great power competition. Yan warned that the US and other Western countries were likely to continue their “interference” in the belt and road – Beijing’s plan for building global trade and infrastructure links – and “neighbouring regions” including Southeast Asia would be a “top priority” for China in stabilising the strategy’s foundation. “[We] should further leverage the unique advantages of border provinces like Guangxi and Yunnan in opening up to Asean to promote cooperation between China and Asean in areas such as infrastructure,” she wrote. The idea of bridging Southeast Asia and China through infrastructure is not new. Eight years ago, Asean members adopted a master plan aimed at greater connectivity within the bloc by 2025. In 2019, Asean and Beijing agreed to align this plan with the belt and road strategy. In 1995, Mahathir Mohamad, then prime minister of Malaysia, proposed building a pan-Asian railway network that runs from Singapore to southwest China’s Kunming, passing through Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. Three decades later, the idea remains far from becoming a reality. But the proposed China-Vietnam rail lines, the completed China-Laos high-speed rail as well as the Thailand-China railway project and Malaysia’s East Coast Rail Link – both backed by Beijing and under construction – are all viewed as steps towards that vision. While China has become Southeast Asia’s biggest infrastructure financing partner, an estimated US$50 billion pledged by Beijing for funding in the region has gone unfulfilled, according to a study by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. Wang Qin, a professor at the school of international relations at Xiamen University, said many Chinese-invested infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia were “not going so smoothly”, partly due to issues such as political instability and land acquisition problems in recipient countries. He added that as the Chinese economy was still recovering, the country was likely to be more cautious about investing in expensive projects across the region in the future. He expected China would work on completing existing projects first, adding that the US$1.7 billion canal project in Cambodia was “not a huge investment” and was within China’s engineering abilities. “We may focus more on such smaller projects that contribute to the development and livelihood of a country,” he said. Li in Singapore also noted that Beijing had started to focus on “small but beautiful” projects and might not be as fixated on megaprojects as before. He said Southeast Asian nations were keen to diversify their trade partners, inbound investment and industrial cooperation to reduce their economic dependence on China. He added that though the supply chain connection between China and Asean countries would benefit from better transport links, it would also be influenced by other factors, notably trade wars. Li said China and Southeast Asian nations should better manage South China Sea disputes while improving connectivity. “If security issues continue to arise in the South China Sea, they could to some extent offset the positive impact of economic and infrastructure connectivity cooperation on China’s relations with Asean countries,” he said. Peng of RCAS expected China’s role in the region’s infrastructure push to become increasingly important, with more breakthroughs in cooperative projects. He said Southeast Asian demand for infrastructure investment from China would grow as they put greater emphasis on economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. China’s Belt and Road Initiative appeared to be shifting from casting a wide net to focusing on places with strategic significance like Southeast Asia, he added, expecting the country to spend more resources to firm up its neighbourhood amid Washington’s increasing presence there. “The willingness on both sides is very high. The connectivity between China and Southeast Asia will certainly continue to grow in the future,” he said.","summary":"Infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail could help Beijing keep US from coaxing region into its orbit, analysts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3280250/why-chinas-southeast-asia-belt-and-road-push-could-give-it-edge-critical-battleground","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/27/0071eb40-5115-42f7-8d40-6fb18600b5e2_2a422960.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:30:18","author":"Orange Wang","authors":["Orange Wang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.159},{"id":257695424,"title":"Trump meets with Zelenskyy in New York, vowing to resolve Ukraine war","text":"Washington — Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning, where the GOP nominee vowed to bring a quick end to the war between Russia and Ukraine if he captures the White House. “We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin,” Trump said before the meeting. “And I think if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly.” Zelenskyy, who has been in the U.S. to attend the U.N. General Assembly and to meet with U.S. officials, interjected to note that he hopes he and Trump “have more good relations,” compared with Putin. Trump replied that it “takes two to tango.” Trump has been highly critical of U.S. funding to Ukraine and, at times, Zelenskyy — an uneasy relationship that was made even less comfortable after the Ukrainian president visited an ammunition plant in battleground state of Pennsylvania. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on Zelenskyy to fire his ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, over the Pennsylvania trip, which did not include any Republican officials. Zelenskyy has in turn been critical of Trump, saying the former U.S. president “doesn’t really know how to stop the war.” Trump frequently says Russia “would have never attacked Ukraine” if he was president. After the meeting, Trump told Fox News that he “learned a lot” from his sitdown with the Ukrainian leader. “I think I haven’t changed from the standpoint, we both want to see it end and a fair deal made. It has to be fair. I think it will happen at the right time. I think it is going to happen,” Trump said. “The president wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place.” “Putin killed so many people and, of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war,” Zelenskyy said. “He is in our territory. That’s the most important. He is in our territory and how to stop the war, to pressure him as we can, we have to do it.” In a post on Truth Social later Friday, Trump wrote that the pair had a “great meeting.” “If I’m elected President, the war with Russia and Ukraine will end quickly. If not, that war will never end, and will phase into WORLD WAR III,” Trump said. Trump has frequently claimed that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine quickly, in as little as “a day.” CBS News’ Caitlin Huey-Burns asked him what an end to the fighting would look like. “I don’t want to tell you what that looks like,” he responded. He said of Ukraine that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “told me often it’s the apple of his eye.” Trump claimed he warned against invading Ukraine and said, “‘Vladimir, don’t even think about doing it.'” On Thursday, Trump told reporters “I believe I can work that out.” Asked whether Ukraine should cede land to Russia to end the war, Trump did not answer directly. “Let’s get some peace,” he said. “We need peace. We need to stop the death and destruction. Don’t you think? Wouldn’t that be nice?” Earlier in the day, Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, a message purportedly from Zelenskyy requesting a face-to-face meeting with Trump while Zelenskyy would already be in New York. Trump’s announcement that he would meet with Zelenskyy came shortly after that post. Zelenskyy was in Washington on Thursday for meetings with top members of Congress, as well as President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. A national security spokesperson for Harris’ campaign said in a statement, “The only Ukraine deal Trump wants is one that benefits Putin, not Ukraine. “ contributed to this report.","summary":"Washington — Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning, where the GOP nominee vowed to bring a quick end to the war between Russia and Ukraine if he captures the White House. &#8220;We have a very good relationship, and I also have a &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump meets with Zelenskyy in New York, vowing to resolve Ukraine war appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/trump-meets-with-zelenskyy-in-new-york-vowing-to-resolve-ukraine-war/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/27/47721db0-ab12-4a5b-89f3-eec2ace25e90/thumbnail/1200x630g2/c738c44434ba084b82194a550ce4f39b/gettyimages-2173922474.jpg?v=fa529222a2be3543711c1a879b51e860","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:28:01","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":257695636,"title":"'Worst of the human spirit': George Conway breaks down searing ad featuring Trump’s accusers","text":"Earlier this week, conservative attorney George Conway's \"Anti-Psychopath PAC\" released new 60-second campaign ads featuring the testimonies of women who accused former President Donald Trump of sexual assault and misconduct. In one of the ads, People magazine journalist Natasha Stoynoff recalled her encounter with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 2005, where he allegedly took her into a side room in the house while his wife, Melania, was changing and suddenly started aggressively kissing and groping her while she tried to push him away. The PAC also released an ad of former stockbroker Jessica Leeds describing how Trump started groping her and attempting to put his hand up her skirt without her consent on a flight in 1979. “Donald Trump views women as for his entertainment,” Leeds said. “He is a serial predator. He has said it point blank, and he’s done it, and he will continue to do it.” READ MORE: 'Frankly incriminating': George Conway reveals Trump's 'latest admission of guilt' According to the Hill, Conway is running both ads in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, and is targeting women watching the Lifetime and Hallmark channels in his $250,000 ad buy.

And among those boxes are really some very, very negative characteristics that you can find in a small number of human beings, which is a complete lack of empathy, a complete inability to follow rules and laws and to respect the boundaries and dignity of other human beings.\" \"There's so many of these characteristics that illustrate themselves in his behavior toward women. It explains his misogyny,\" he continued. Both women initially told their stories in the lead-up to the 2016 election, along with several others who came forward after the emergence of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape. In that audio, Trump is heard describing to host Billy Bush how he enjoyed kissing and groping women without their consent. Conway argued that the former president has exhibited predatory behavior for years, and that his PAC is making sure to remind voters of that history before voters head to the polls in November.

And the notion that he did this with his wife, to Natasha, with his wife in the same building, the notion that he did what he did to e. jean carroll, as a jury found, in a department store in midtown manhattan, he's a very, very sick and dangerous man. And that's part of the reason why we're doing this, is to really bring that home to people by showing them the victims.\" Conway — who used to be married to top Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway — launched the Anti-Psychopath PAC in July with an initial infusion of $343,434.34 of his own money. He said the amount was meant to symbolize the ex-president's 34 felony convictions in New York earlier this year. Watch the clip of Conway's interview below, or by clicking this link.

The PAC also released an ad of former stockbroker Jessica Leeds describing how Trump started groping her and attempting to put his hand up her skirt without her consent on a flight in 1979.\n\n“Donald Trump views women as for his entertainment,” Leeds said. “He is a serial predator. He has said it point blank, and he’s done it, and he will continue to do it.”\n\nREAD MORE: 'Frankly incriminating': George Conway reveals Trump's 'latest admission of guilt'\n\nAccording t","url":"https://www.alternet.org/george-conway-ad/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=53702479&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:25:33","author":"Carl Gibson","authors":["Carl Gibson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.569},{"id":257695896,"title":"Oasis 'are in talks to record a live album of their upcoming sell-out gigs - meaning fans who missed out on tickets will still get to hear the shows'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 28th 2024 1AM 9°C 4AM 8°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement The moment Netanyahu pushed the button: How Israeli PM 'tricked' Hezbollah by flying to US before authorising IDF to launch airstrikes to 'kill' terror group's leaders - leaving Beirut in ruins and the Middle East on the brink of 'all-out war' Shortly after this picture was taken, this mother-of-two stepped inside the 'suicide pod' - and waited for a robotic voice to tell her...

Email freya.barnes@mailonline.co.uk By Freya Barnes Published:00:43 BST, 28 September 2024 |Updated:01:01 BST, 28 September 2024 e-mail 1 View comments A warning has been issued over the so-called 'miracle' fat-busting jabs Ozempic and Wegovy after they caused 3,000 Brits to fall ill this year so far. The most common symptom was stomach problems but some also experienced blurred vision, depression and dizziness. Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs. Around 30 side effect complaints were sent to The Medicines and Healthcare Agency every week during 2023. In the first 20 weeks of this year, there has been a big spike in side effect complaints under the agency's Yellow Card scheme which lets patients and health experts submit reports of bad reactions to drugs. The agency has received 2,780 complaints since the year started, figures obtained by The Sun reveal. The rise is attributed to the growing popularity of the drugs for weight loss purposes and how readily available it is to buy online.

Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs (file photo) Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose and Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the drug due to vomiting. Other stars have rejected the idea of the drug, including chef Nigella Lawson who told The New York Time: 'I read something once where someone said, \"I was on Ozempic and it was the first time I didn’t think about food all the time,\" and I thought, I can’t imagine anything worse than that. I take great pleasure in thinking about food all of the time.' Read More Ozempic really IS life-saving, slashing risk of death from ALL CAUSES by a quarter, new data shows The drugs contain semaglutide, an amino acid, which suppresses appetite by mimicking a hormone telling the brain you are full up. The jabs were approved by the NHS last year and is called Wegovy for overweight people taking it to lose fat. It is referred to as Ozempic for those who suffer with Type 2 diabetes. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sun: 'For some, the benefits of semaglutide may well outweigh its risks but the drug has side effects. 'It's why doctors and GPs should always monitor anyone taking it for weight loss and the jabs should never be taken without a prescription. 'An inclination to suicide is a potential risk: that should stop anyone thinking of using the drug off-licence.' Manufacturer of the drugs, Novo Nordisk, said: 'We recommend patients take these medications for approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.' It comes after new data last month showed that semaglutide can slash the risk of deaths from all causes by up to a quarter. Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose of Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the weight loss drug due to vomiting Researchers from Harvard Medical School in the US showed obese and overweight people on semaglutide enjoyed a 23 per cent lower chance of dying overall in the three years that followed. Meanwhile a separate study led by Australian researchers showed diabetes patients on the drug for just two months had a 29 per cent lower chance of death from heart attacks and strokes. The studies are the latest to demonstrate that the fat-busting jabs have a protective effect, but scientists are still unable to pinpoint exactly why. While the jabs can help patients lose weight and improve their health in general experts say this doesn't fully explain the slash in risk of early death.

Email freya.barnes@mailonline.co.uk By Freya Barnes Published:00:43 BST, 28 September 2024 |Updated:01:01 BST, 28 September 2024 e-mail 1 View comments A warning has been issued over the so-called 'miracle' fat-busting jabs Ozempic and Wegovy after they caused 3,000 Brits to fall ill this year so far. The most common symptom was stomach problems but some also experienced blurred vision, depression and dizziness. Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs. Around 30 side effect complaints were sent to The Medicines and Healthcare Agency every week during 2023. In the first 20 weeks of this year, there has been a big spike in side effect complaints under the agency's Yellow Card scheme which lets patients and health experts submit reports of bad reactions to drugs. The agency has received 2,780 complaints since the year started, figures obtained by The Sun reveal. The rise is attributed to the growing popularity of the drugs for weight loss purposes and how readily available it is to buy online. A warning has been issued over the so-called 'miracle' fat-busting jabs Ozempic and Wegovy after they caused 3,000 Brits to fall ill this year so far (file photo) The most common symptom was stomach problems but some also experienced blurred vision, depression and dizziness. Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs (file photo) Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose and Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the drug due to vomiting. Other stars have rejected the idea of the drug, including chef Nigella Lawson who told The New York Time: 'I read something once where someone said, \"I was on Ozempic and it was the first time I didn’t think about food all the time,\" and I thought, I can’t imagine anything worse than that. I take great pleasure in thinking about food all of the time.' Read More Ozempic really IS life-saving, slashing risk of death from ALL CAUSES by a quarter, new data shows The drugs contain semaglutide, an amino acid, which suppresses appetite by mimicking a hormone telling the brain you are full up. The jabs were approved by the NHS last year and is called Wegovy for overweight people taking it to lose fat. It is referred to as Ozempic for those who suffer with Type 2 diabetes. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sun: 'For some, the benefits of semaglutide may well outweigh its risks but the drug has side effects. 'It's why doctors and GPs should always monitor anyone taking it for weight loss and the jabs should never be taken without a prescription. 'An inclination to suicide is a potential risk: that should stop anyone thinking of using the drug off-licence.' Manufacturer of the drugs, Novo Nordisk, said: 'We recommend patients take these medications for approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.' It comes after new data last month showed that semaglutide can slash the risk of deaths from all causes by up to a quarter. Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose of Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the weight loss drug due to vomiting Researchers from Harvard Medical School in the US showed obese and overweight people on semaglutide enjoyed a 23 per cent lower chance of dying overall in the three years that followed. Meanwhile a separate study led by Australian researchers showed diabetes patients on the drug for just two months had a 29 per cent lower chance of death from heart attacks and strokes. The studies are the latest to demonstrate that the fat-busting jabs have a protective effect, but scientists are still unable to pinpoint exactly why. While the jabs can help patients lose weight and improve their health in general experts say this doesn't fully explain the slash in risk of early death.

It is the first thing some sore losers have turned to after losing a presidential election. In 2016, you may recall, many Democrats took solace or vented their frustration by pointing out that “Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.” These complaints were almost always followed closely by demands that the Electoral College be eliminated. It was and still is often said that unless the Electoral College is scrapped, we don’t really have a democracy. This is increasingly so as the Democratic Party exiles itself to urban areas. The party can run up individual vote totals in large Democratic cities while doing nothing to increase its chances of Electoral College votes from swing states that don’t have a Los Angeles or New York City to produce a lopsided score. Enter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. This is a plan of dubious constitutionality to undermine the electoral system. It would make elections less safe and even more partisan than they already are if you can imagine that. The compact consists of states tying their votes in the Electoral College to the national popular vote total. It means that each state in the compact would award its electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in the country, even if that candidate lost in that state. At present, 17 states and the District of Columbia have tied their 209 electoral votes to the national popular vote, getting closer to the 270 electoral votes needed for a candidate to become president. The compact is popular only with Democrats, which makes sense because the party often wins the popular vote even when it loses the presidency. Democrats enthusiastic to tie their state’s Electoral College votes to the popular vote assume this will help Democrats, as indeed it would in current circumstances. But it is utterly devoid of principle. There is a useful thought experiment one can force upon Democrats when they tout the “democratic” principle of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. All you need to do is ask them this: “So let’s say your state voted for Kamala Harris, but Donald Trump won the popular vote, you’d be content that your state’s Electoral College votes would be cast for Trump, right?” This usually produces a certain amount of stuttering and foot shuffling and the circumstantial but unprincipled retort, “But that’s not likely to happen.” The compact fundamentally contradicts what America is supposed to be. We are the “United States,” or are supposed to be, which implies including all those participating in the federal system, not excluding those with whom one disagrees. The states make up the country. The nation does not have the right to treat smaller states as subservient departments. The loss of this concept of genuine federalism is why the federal government has become more intrusive in everyday life, as voters and the parties, especially the Democratic Party, expect the president to absorb responsibilities that should fall to state governments. The national popular vote idea is thus a “solution” to a problem that doesn’t exist. The system works as it is because it forces presidential candidates to make appeals to broad swaths of the country. Trump lost the popular vote but won 30 of the 50 states in 2016. A candidate needs to convince voters in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Georgia, states with unique cultures and issues, that he or she should be president. A system that simply awarded the presidency to the winner of the most votes nationwide would produce campaigns intent solely on riling up their party base. If the country is divided now, as it is, imagine a national popular vote election that frees Democrats and Republicans alike from the tempering effect of “swing states” and instead encourages them to juice up antagonisms to drive their flock to polling places. Thus far, only Democratic-controlled states and Washington, D.C., have signed on to the compact. This stems from Democratic chagrin about the 2000 election that Al Gore lost. They believe dearly that he should have been the winner because he “won the popular vote” against George W. Bush. The 2016 election revived that sentiment after Clinton “won the popular vote” but not the presidency. The 2016 election is a perfect representation of how Democrats view the electoral system. Clinton’s campaign ran up vote totals in big liberal cities. Her win by 2.9 million in the popular vote is due solely to her ability to rack up a landslide in California. She secured a margin of 1.7 million in Los Angeles County alone. Clinton was very popular in small pockets of the country where Democratic voters congregate, so both she and the Democratic Party think she shouldn’t have to waste their time trying to win voters in the middle of the country. She didn’t visit the swing state of Wisconsin once after the Democratic National Convention. She and the blue party regarded the heartland as literally flyover country. Basing the presidential election result on the national popular vote tally would make that permanent. Democrats seem to think that because their popular vote margin doesn’t mean anything in the current electoral system, that system must change. In truth, it is the Democrats who must change. They must change to try to win votes in flyover country. It is the same logic behind the Democratic push for statehood for Washington, D.C., which would gift the Democratic Party two senators. Democrats don’t want to have to campaign in states in the middle of the country to get power on Capitol Hill. It should be noted that the compact contains a trigger, and states don’t have to pull that trigger until enough states join to reach 270 electoral votes. It’s just another wrinkle Democrats added to ensure they don’t accidentally award a Republican presidential candidate the White House in a scenario in which the GOP wins the “popular vote” but Democrats win the Electoral College, a possibility this November. So, the popular vote compact fails in principle with what the U.S. is meant to be and fails in concept as a “solution” to an imagined problem, given that it is nothing more than a Democratic power grab. Just as damning, though, is that the national popular vote would fail in practice by making elections more prone to widespread fraud and fuel rampant distrust among the general public. If you thought Trump’s election conspiracy theories were bad in 2020, imagine how many people would reasonably believe them under a popular vote system. A national popular vote would encourage political actors in both parties to engage in all kinds of chicanery, including voter fraud and voter suppression, because the goal would simply be to have more votes total than the other team. While Trump’s claims of massive voter fraud are weak, there is some fraud that pops up in competitive races, such as in the 2008 Senate race in Minnesota, which secured the Democratic Party the filibuster-proof Senate majority that gave us Obamacare. The incentive to cheat in a presidential election decided only by raw vote totals rather than electoral votes would lead to far more fraud on a much larger scale. This isn’t just a hypothetical, given that Democrats in Colorado, Maine, and Illinois all tried to remove Trump from their ballots. That would all but guarantee a Democratic win in the “popular vote,” resulting in a tit-for-tat in which each state ends up with one presidential candidate on the ballot depending on what party runs the state. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Picture the 2016 election, with Trump leading by some 2 million votes the day after the election, only for California’s glacial vote count to chip away at that lead for more than a month. It wouldn’t be until December that all the votes would be counted in California, giving far more credence to accusations that Democrats would “find” votes to make up the total they needed. The national popular vote compact is lazy, destructive, ill-thought-out, blatantly partisan, and a defiance of the principles that make up America’s federal system. It is thus the perfect Democratic policy. As a means of choosing American presidents, it would manage to make every aspect of campaigns, governance, institutional trust, and the balance of power between states and the federal government worse. Given that both parties claim their last presidential loss only happened because the race was “stolen” from them, this supposed “solution” couldn’t come at a worse time.","summary":"Regardless of who wins and loses the coming presidential election, the nation will be forced to listen to complaints and irrelevant theories about the mythical “popular vote.” What is meant by this is the total count of individual votes for each presidential candidate, added up from all 50 states.

Kennedy Jr.’s Name Stays on Swing State Ballot","text":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will remain on the state’s presidential ballot, upholding a lower court’s ruling that candidates can only be removed from the ballot if they die. The video is from a previous report. The unanimous decision from the liberal-controlled court marks the latest twist in Kennedy’s quest to get his name off ballots in key battleground states where the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is close. Kennedy’s attorney in Wisconsin, Joseph Bugni, declined to comment on the ruling. The decision came after more than 418,000 absentee ballots have already been sent to voters. As of Thursday, nearly 28,000 had been returned, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. Earlier this month a divided North Carolina Supreme Court kept him off the ballot there while the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and kept him on. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin on Sept. 3 seeking a court order removing him from the ballot. He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy’s name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy’s name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy’s arguments weren’t developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn’t argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. “We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court’s legal conclusions on those claims. We simply are unable to make such determinations, given the inadequate briefing presented to us,” the five justices wrote in six-page opinion. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in a one-page concurrence that while she doesn’t disagree with the five other justices that Kennedy’s arguments were underdeveloped, keeping Kennedy on the ballot will confuse voters and could tilt the outcome of the election. “Voters may cast their ballots in favor of a candidate who withdrew his candidacy, thereby losing their right to cast a meaningful vote,” she wrote. “Ballots listing a non-candidate mislead voters and may skew a presidential election. In this case, the damage to voter participation in electoral democracy is real.” The court’s third conservative, Annette Ziegler, joined Bradley’s concurrence. The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot could be a key factor in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between about 5,700 to 23,000 votes. In 2016, Green Party nominee Jill Stein got just over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin – more than Trump’s winning margin of just under 23,000 votes. Some Democrats blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F.

He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy’s name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy’s name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy’s arguments weren’t developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn’t argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. “We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court’s legal conclusions on those claims. We simply are unable to make such determinations, given the inadequate briefing presented to us,” the five justices wrote in six-page opinion. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in a one-page concurrence that while she doesn’t disagree with the five other justices that Kennedy’s arguments were underdeveloped, keeping Kennedy on the ballot will confuse voters and could tilt the outcome of the election. “Voters may cast their ballots in favor of a candidate who withdrew his candidacy, thereby losing their right to cast a meaningful vote,” she wrote. “Ballots listing a non-candidate mislead voters and may skew a presidential election. In this case, the damage to voter participation in electoral democracy is real.” The court’s third conservative, Annette Ziegler, joined Bradley’s concurrence. The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot could be a key factor in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between about 5,700 to 23,000 votes. In 2016, Green Party nominee Jill Stein got just over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin — more than Trump’s winning margin of just under 23,000 votes. Some Democrats blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMADISON, Wis. – The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Wisconsin Supreme Court Rules that Robert F.

Boston agents arrested the migrants during a multi-day operation on Nantucket earlier this month, ICE officials said, according to the Boston Herald. The arrests come amid a new report that tens of thousands of illegal aliens with convictions for sex assaults, kidnapping, and even murder, are freely roaming around the country. The report finds that some 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges are not being detained by any law enforcement agency, Fox News reported. Those not being detained have been convicted of a variety of violent crimes including assault, drug offenses, murder, kidnapping, and sexual crimes. Meanwhile, the sting on tony Nantucket saw the arrest of 30-year-old Angel Deras-Mejia, a documented MS-13 gangbanger, who was charged with two counts sexually assaulting a woman in her home. “Angel Gabriel Deras-Mejia unlawfully entered the United States then made his way to Massachusetts, to apparently commit crimes of violence,” Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston Field Office Director Todd M. Lyons said in a public statement. “To make matters worse, Deras-Mejia is a documented member of a notorious transnational criminal organization and represents a significant threat to the residents of Nantucket.” The arrest of Deras-Meja came not long after 41-year-old Guatemalan national Felix Alberto Perez-Gomez was arrested on a charge of indecent assault and battery on a person 14 years or older. Perez-Gomez also has an arrest record in Boston for offenses including reckless driving and endangering another. In addition, two Salvadoran nationals, one 49 and another 28, were both charged with raping a child in separate incidents, and a man from Brazil was arrested for sexual assault, as well. Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, excoriated the Biden-Harris regime for putting Americans at risk as a result of their massive border crisis. “13,000 people convicted of murder have crossed into our country through Kamala Harris’ open border- non detained, non citizen, convicted criminals!” Trump wrote in a post on X. “Nobody who has allowed this to happen to our Country is fit to be President of the United States!” the former president added.

Trump has meanwhile doubled down on his divisive rhetoric targeting migrants, with the billionaire seeing it as appealing to his base of largely white, blue-collar voters.In his remarks on Thursday, Trump also repeated his claim that migrants were \"infecting our country,\" using language that Biden's team has previously compared to that used by Nazi Germany.Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have in recent weeks played up false stories about Haitian migrants eating pets in the town of Springfield, Ohio.","summary":"Kamala Harris was due to deliver a tough-on-illegal-migration message after visiting the US-Mexico border Friday, directly tackling the politically explosive issue in a bid to blunt one of Donald Trump's main attack lines in their fight for the White House.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/harris-visits-border-neutralize-weak-spot-against-trump-3744734","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4550426/former-us-president-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-has-doubled-down-his.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 23:21:19","author":"Gilles Clarenne","authors":["Gilles Clarenne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":257693016,"title":"RFK Jr. wears his wedding ring to Trump rally as details emerge of how he ‘love bombed’ journalist Olivia Nuzzi ","text":"Robert F.

THEM","text":"Democracy in America: What is it? Whatever it is, we know that it is under siege. Barely a moment goes by without tocsins sounding about various threats to “our democracy.” It used to be that the biggest, baddest threat to “our democracy” was Donald Trump. Then a curious thing happened. When it comes to “threats to our democracy,” Trump seems to have been overshadowed somewhat by a new threat: the Constitution. Today, if you are truly up-to-date, you know that the Constitution, while venerable, is basically at odds with democracy. The Constitution allowed Donald Trump to become president. Ergo the Constitution is “dysfunctional.” QED. Originally, “democracy” meant rule by “the demos,” the people. But most political theorists from Plato and Aristotle on down have been suspicious of “pure,” direct, unchaperoned democracy. James Madison, in Federalist 10, warned that throughout history most democracies have been as “short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” It was part of the founders’ genius to have forged a species of popular rule that carefully modulated the passions of the masses in such a way that protected individual liberty in the face of the imperatives of democracy. Hence the Electoral College, which is a primary mechanism for preserving federalism. Hence, too, two senators to every state: Why should Wyoming, say, be swamped by the ethos of California? When Benjamin Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, was asked what sort of government he and his colleagues had forged, he famously said “A republic, if you can keep it.” A republic, nota bene, not a democracy. The difference is critical. There is a sense, then, in which the Constitution’s detractors are right about its being “antidemocratic.” It is antidemocratic in the sense that it is pro-republic. The limits on federal power set forth in the Constitution make it a bulwark against many sorts of abuse, including that most constant temptation of democracies, the tyranny of the majority. Yet Americans now find their lives directed by a jumble of agencies far removed from the legislature and staffed by bureaucrats who make and enforce a vast network of rules that govern nearly every aspect of our lives. Woodrow Wilson, a standard-bearer for an earlier incarnation of the progressive juggernaut, welcomed such an arrangement. “The bulk of mankind,” he noted sadly, “is rigidly unphilosophical, and nowadays the bulk of mankind votes.” What to do? The solution was to shift real power out of elected bodies and into the hands of the right sort of people, enlightened people, progressive people — people, that is to say, like Woodrow Wilson. Many commentators have noted the profoundly undemocratic maneuver by which Joe Biden was erased and Kamala Harris installed as the Democratic presidential nominee. After all, nearly 15 million people voted for Joe Biden in the Democratic primary. He won, hands down, because certain high-level Democrats made sure that other candidates — including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — were shunted to one side. They had done the same thing to Bernie Sanders years before. All, of course, in the name of “democracy.” Which brings me to the distinction between “democracy” and what Democrats like to call “our democracy.” The latter poaches on the authority and prestige of the former. But honestly parsed, the phrase “our democracy” really means “rule by Democrats.” It used to be that the left accorded a certain latitude to opposing views. That’s all over now. Every issue is an existential emergency for which the left’s shock troops are willing to go to the wall. Every loss demands that people scream at the sky. We win or we threaten to burn everything down. At least since Trump’s victory in 2016, the dominant attitude has been that only the left is allowed to win. Any conservative victory is by definition illegitimate, a blow to “our democracy.” To reverse these developments, one major goal of conservatives must be to downgrade the place of Washington, the city as well as the spirit it entails, in the metabolism of American political life. Notwithstanding its overwhelmingly Democratic coloration, the capital has effectively developed into a political party itself. Its triumph stands behind the real threat to the republic bequeathed to us by the founders. That threat is not the Constitution, but subservience to the faceless managerial elite that exercises the real power in our society. Legitimacy is draining out of our governing institutions at an alarming rate. Stanching that debilitating flow requires that we redirect our attention away from the greedy puppet show in Washington to the true source of legitimacy, which is with the people.

Kennedy Jr. set aside headlines about his relationship with a reporter 40 years his junior to introduce Donald Trump at a campaign event in Michigan on Friday. And it was exactly the wild ride you might expect from a man whose presidential campaign included stories about dumping dead bears in Central Park, brain worms, and cutting the head off a whale. He warned about plunging sperm counts in teenagers, delivered a no-nonsense account of Trump’s meeting with the Ukrainian president and was interrupted by a telephone call from his doctor. The 70-year-old, who pushed antivax conspiracy theories, accused the Democratic Party of siding with Big Pharma, Big Agriculture and Big Food. ‘When my uncle was president, we spent zero on chronic disease,’ he said. ‘Now we spend $4.3 trillion and our children are so sick that 77% do not qualify for military service. ‘Our fertility levels have dropped to the lowest in the world. Teens today have 50 percent of the sperm count, 50 percent of the testosterone as American teens two generations ago. ‘Little girls are now hitting puberty at eight years old, because all the estrogen is generated by the poisons and toxic foods.’ It was familiar ground for a politician who came to prominence as an environmental lawyer. For the past week he has dodged questions about a sexting scandal involving Olivia Nuzzi, a 31-year-old reporter who profiled him for New York magazine. She has been placed on leave while editors investigate. R.F.K. Jr. reportedly boasted to friends about receiving intimate photographs from Nuzzi. And his wife of 10 years, actor Cheryl Hines, has been spotted without her wedding ring amid the fallout. Kennedy himself has avoided discussing the relationship, except through friends who claimed the reporter pursued him. ‘I never comment on those kind of stories,’ he told Fox News this week. He ended his own presidential run last month and endorsed Trump. On Friday, he warmed up a crowd waiting for the former president at the loading dock of a Michigan manufacturing plant. He riffed on the presidency of his uncle J.F.K., drawing parallels between the Cuban missile crisis and tensions today with Russia. And he talked up Trump’s diplomatic skills after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. ‘He was kind and civil to President Zelensky, but he was also firm in his resolve, and he said, “I’ve had a nice meeting, but I have not changed my mind,'” he said. Trump has made clear that he wants an end to the conflict before the U.S. spends more money supporting Ukraine. ‘And it was especially impressive to me, because I know what Donald Trump was thinking while he was having that meeting,’ Kennedy continued. ‘He was thinking, “I want to turn this guy over and hold him by his legs and shake all the money out of his pockets. And I hope it adds up to $208 billion because that’s what we get. ‘”That’s what the Democrats gave them, and we need to bring that money home and spend it here on our communities.” But he had clearly forgotten to silence his phone. At one point he pulled it from his pocket and apologized to the crowd. ‘Sorry my doctor’s calling,’ he said, as he rejected the call to the sound of laughter from the audience. Trump paid tribute to Kennedy in his speech. ‘He does have great ideas,’ he said. ‘And getting a Kennedy to endorse a Trump Republican, that was a big deal, right? ‘He’s a good man.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

A new CNN/SSRS poll shows that Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who is the Republican nominee in the Tar Heel State's 2024 race for the governorship, is now 17 points behind Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein with just five weeks to go before Election Day. The poll is notably the first survey of North Carolina voters since the news broke of an account believed to be Robinson making numerous racist, anti-Semitic, pro-slavery and even pro-Hitler posts on an adult website's message board. While Stein led Robinson in polls taken prior to the story, his new significant lead over the lieutenant governor could be a turning point in the election. According to CNN, if the poll turns out to be accurate, it would mean Robinson is about to \"suffer the largest defeat in more than 40 years for a major-party nominee for governor in North Carolina.\" READ MORE: Ex-North Carolina GOP gov admits Republicans knew Mark Robinson was a 'ticking time bomb' FiveThirtyEight's aggregated polling data shows that Stein holds a double-digit lead over Robinson in surveys taken by both Marist College as well as a poll by the New York Times and Siena College. The last time any candidate won by such a large margin was 1980, when popular Democratic Governor Jim Hunt — who was the incumbent — defeated his Republican opponent by a 24-point margin. Stein's huge lead over Robinson has so far not translated to an advantage for Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state. FiveThirtyEight shows that polls of the presidential election in the Tar Heel State have Harris in a dead heat with former President Donald Trump — including the CNN/SSRS poll that showed Stein far ahead of Robinson. Most other polls taken in September with the exception of one show Harris with a narrow lead of no more than two points, which is within the margin of error. Former Republican North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said recently that North Carolina voters have a propensity for \"ticket-splitting,\" in which a majority of voters will elect a Republican president but a Democrat to the governor's mansion. This happened in 2016 and 2020, when the Tar Heel State's electorate voted for Trump both times while simultaneously voting to elect and reelect Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. However, in that same interview, McCrory noted that the North Carolina Republican Party had known for awhile that Robinson's extreme policy positions and rhetoric could come back to bite them, calling the sitting lieutenant governor a \"ticking time bomb.\" He laid blame for Robinson's likely loss in November at the feet of former state GOP chair Michael Whatley, who is now the chairman of the Republican National Committee.

In another post, the account believed to be Robinson's called himself a \"Black NAZI\" and lamented that he couldn't join the Ku Klux Klan given his race. Since the story emerged, Robinson has insisted the posts were not him and dismissed the article as \"tabloid trash.\" As of Friday, Trump has not rescinded his endorsement of Robinson.

Harris arrived Friday afternoon at a site along the US border wall in Douglas, Arizona, where she was greeted by a pair of uniformed officers from the US Border Patrol. The two officers and the vice president chatted as they walked along a path next to the section of the wall, which was constructed during the Obama administration and is not part of the wall built during Trump’s presidency. Asked what she’d learned from the Border Patrol officials, Harris replied: “They’ve got a tough job and they need, rightly, support to do their job. They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.” She is also set to receive a briefing from Customs and Border Protection officials in Texas on US efforts to prevent the introduction of fentanyl into the United States. Harris is later expected to announce support for further restricting how people can claim asylum if they enter the country unlawfully between ports of entry along the border with Mexico. Illegal immigration — particularly from non-white countries — has been a key issue for Trump, who rarely makes a public appearance without engaging in incendiary rhetoric on the subject that often crosses a line into outright racism. Trump and his Republican allies have sought to attack Harris for the Biden administration’s record on migration and have attempted to brand her as a “failed border czar” because of her work handling diplomacy with countries that, until recently, accounted for a significant portion of the immigrants claiming asylum along the US-Mexico border. Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims and keep the restrictions in place longer compared to the executive order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to Arizona. Harris also met with Mayor Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor Ann English, along with Sen. Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris Mayes. Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a record influx of asylum seekers last year. Trump has an edge with voters on migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump. In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top Republicans to oppose it. “The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,” Harris plans to say, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign. After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed.

Twitch said in an announcement (via Kotaku) that the emote is being dropped because of expiring licenses, but rightsholder Edmund McMillen says he'd be happy to renew the license, but it's not up to him. BibleThump was popular enough to earn a place in our 2020 rundown of Twitch emote meanings, a handy guide for anyone baffled by the flood of weird faces floating across their screens. \"Roguelike fans will recognize this emote from The Binding of Isaac,\" we helpfully explained. \"That is baby Isaac right there, with tears streaming down his face. Stream viewers bust out BibleThump when a profoundly sad, or profoundly precious incident crosses through the stream.\" Popular though it may be, it won't be around for much longer. \"The end of the BibleThump Era (2013-2024) is nigh!\" Twitch wrote on X. \"On 9/30, the rights to our beloved emote expire. While this is sad news, we know that all emotes go to heaven. SPEAKING OF SAD - we’re going to need a new emote to spam these feelings…\" Well, that happens—content disappearing because of expiring licences is nothing new in the world of videogames. But as the attached community note indicates, the situation took a weird twist when Edmund McMillen, the creator of The Binding of Isaac, said he was open to extending the deal. \"For those wondering what happened with the Bible thump emote, I'm 100% fine with coming up with a good solution to keep or modify the emote but I'm not in control of the new Twitch policies so it's really up to them,\" McMillen posted. He confirmed in separate posts that he still owns the rights to the emote, and reiterated that he \"would be 100% fine with them renewing the rights.\" So, why isn't that happening? Some on X suggested, presumably ironically, that Twitch can't afford a new deal: Twitch is owned by Amazon, one of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world, but has reportedly struggled to turn a profit. That doesn't strike me as likely. I don't know how much a license for a single emote based on an old indie game would cost, but I can't imagine it would be a very big slice of Twitch's revenues. Others have speculated that Twitch wants to shift to emotes made in-house that it owns outright, which could be what McMillen was alluding to in his reference to \"new Twitch policies.\" Whatever the reason, there's been no sign that a new deal might be made. It's possible that BibleThump could live on elsewhere, though. In response to Twitch's message about the expiring license, streaming platform Kick, the place that pays guys like xQc and Nickmercs mountains of money to do gambling streams and recently hosted notorious former Twitch streamer (he was banned for life in 2023 for \"hateful conduct) Adin Ross in a bizarre, baffling stream with Donald Trump, posted an image of the emote and a message to McMillen: \"We cooking?\" The reaction to Kick's tweet was almost universally negative, with multiple respondents asking McMillen not to take the deal. McMillen himself hasn't indicated whether or not he might be interested in a deal, but he did repost Kick's message. Make of that what you will.","summary":"The Binding of Isaac emote will be gone at the end of September, and it's a little weird.","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/twitch-is-dropping-the-popular-biblethump-emote-because-the-license-is-expiring-even-though-creator-edmund-mcmillen-says-hes-100-fine-with-them-renewing-the-rights/","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYdksc6qEoy8DKRGKSYptE.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 23:10:23","author":"Andy Chalk","authors":["Andy Chalk"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.459},{"id":257693612,"title":"Trump’s promotion of $100,000 watches latest instance of former president testing ethics norms","text":"“The Official Trump Watch Collection is here, and these Watches are truly special,” Trump wrote in a social media post that included a link to GetTrumpWatches.com. “You’re going to love them. Would make a great Christmas Gift. Don’t wait, they will go fast. GET YOUR TRUMP WATCH RIGHT NOW!” The watches themselves start at $499 for the “Fight Fight Fight” version and range all the way up to $100,000 for a “Tourbillon” edition, which features hundreds of diamonds and a personalized “thank you” engraving. It’s just the latest in a wide range of Trump-branded products the former president has promoted throughout his political career that, according to Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, flouts rules governing elected officials and their personal businesses. “He’s integrated his business model with his official duties as president and a public official, so he is merging his public obligations with his private personal interests and actually enriching himself in the process,” Holman told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “This is not a clear violation of the Federal Elections Campaign Act, because the office of the president has to be somewhat isolated from some of the ethics rules,” he continued. “However, it runs absolutely contrary to ethics norms that all other presidents, at least for the last 60 years, have practiced in public office.”Former general counsel for the U.S. Office of Government Ethics Don Fox told the Washington Post earlier this month, before Trump’s latest business ventures, that there is “no precedent in history at all, and certainly not in modern history, for somebody who has monetized the office or running for office of president the way he has.” Still, Holman noted that, while technically the conflicts of interest code doesn’t directly apply to presidents, that hasn’t stopped modern presidents not named Trump from divesting before entering office, like other elected officials. “Jimmy Carter even got rid of his peanut farm,” he joked. “However, Donald Trump has decided that the law doesn’t apply to him. He just flouts it.” This cycle alone, Trump has started selling sneakers, perfumes, digital trading cards and currencies, Bibles, coins with his face on them, and more. Before launching his political career, that list included goods like vodka, steaks, ties, and even bottled water. His latest candidate financial disclosure forms, which were made public in August, show that virtually all of these “paid license agreements” are handled by CIC Ventures LLC. A second body, NFT INT. LLC, oversees the licensing agreement for his digital trading cards, and together, those two LLCs earned Trump more than $12 million from August of 2023-2024, according to the Federal Election Commission. Those forms do not disclose any earnings from the sale of Trump’s sneakers, which he launched in February, the cryptocurrency he launched alongside his sons earlier in September, the $100 silver coins bearing his face he began selling this week, or the new Trump watches. Trump’s FEC filings also showed that, over the past year, the former president held between $1 million and $5 million in the cryptocurrency etherium, pulled in $57 million from his Palm Beach, Florida, club, Mar-a-Lago, and owned 115 million shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of his social media company, Truth Social, worth more than $2 billion based on the latest stock price. The forms also showed hundreds of millions in legal liabilities stemming from multiple lawsuits. The websites for Trump’s various products bear disclaimers explaining that sale proceeds do not go to Trump’s campaign nor the Trump Organization. According to a disclaimer on a sales website, the watches are covered by a similar agreement to license Trump’s name, image, and likeness, and proceeds from their sales do not go to Trump’s campaign or the Trump Organization and “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” Ultimately, Holman told the Washington Examiner that closing the FEC loopholes allowing Trump, or any president, to continue these licensing deals would involve restructuring the FEC itself but that it’s not impossible down the road. “But if it becomes an egregious problem, and we do eventually succeed in changing the nature of the FEC, then I would expect this to be addressed by the FEC,” he stated. “Mixing private, personal gain with public office, and one’s campaign for public office, just poses a very, very serious conflict of interest, and when you have those types of conflict of interest, official decisions and official actions are often based on private gain rather than the public interest and merit.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump&#8216;s peddling commercial products while running for the White House is putting campaign finance norms to the test, according to ethics experts.

Patrick Dwyer Gilroy Delay football season’s start to offset heat Re: “Climate change making prep football fatal for some players” (Page C2, Sept. 21). At risk of sounding like the old guy from the olden times, I have what may be a simple solution to the issue of high school football players overheating and suffering heat-related illnesses on the field: start the season later in the summer. There’s no good reason for high school football games to be played as early as Aug. 23. When I was in high school (old guy talking) our season didn’t start until the second full weekend of September — usually around the 12th or 13th of the month. There’s no good reason we cannot revert to a later season start for the sport. It would be safer for the kids and, as a fan, football is a fall sport, not a summer sport. Mark Carbonaro Monterey Trump’s COVID lies were his most egregious The most egregious thing Donald Trump did was to lie to the American people about COVID. He said, “It was like the flu,” and, “It would be over by summer.” Then he told reporter Bob Woodworth that it was a health disaster and that he could not tell the American people the truth for the panic that would ensue. He made that up. There is no document, meeting or conversation with anyone or group telling him not to tell the truth. He consulted with no one. He “knowingly” lied to all of us and people died. Why is he not prosecuted for that? How can we forget this lie among all the lies he told us? Mark Grzan Morgan Hill Tell Congress to pass bill to pay kidney donors Every year 130,000 Americans are diagnosed with end stage kidney failure; they must be put on dialysis or have a kidney transplant. The average dialysis patient dies within 5-10 years; transplant patients live a normal life. In California, there are 11,000 new cases of kidney failure diagnosed each year. Nationwide, 1,000 people a month on a transplant wait list are removed either because they die or become too ill for transplant surgery. The California wait list time is up to 10 years; hence California has an even higher fraction of wait-list deaths. A proposed law, the End Kidney Deaths Act, now in Congress, provides $50,000 incentives to donate a kidney (people only need one), saving 10,000 lives per year and, since transplantation is much cheaper than dialysis, saving taxpayers $37 billion over 10 years. The bill would save lives, save tax dollars and reward donors for their sacrifice if passed. It deserves our support. Dana Seccombe Foster City Trump’s monetization of candidacy is distasteful Has there ever been a presidential candidate who has so blatantly monetized his name and image while seeking office or found multiple ways to enrich himself in the process? At the least, it is not presidential; at worst, it is downright sleazy. Surely, we can and should expect more from a president who will represent us on the world stage.

The indictment is the latest effort by the Biden administration to counter foreign efforts to interfere in the election between former President Trump, a Republican, and his Democratic rival Vice-President Kamala Harris. Iran said on Thursday that accusations that it had targeted former US officials were baseless. The three men — Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yasar Balaghi — were trying to undermine Trump’s campaign, Attorney General Merrick Garland told a news conference on Friday. “We are seeing increasingly aggressive Iranian cyber activity during this election cycle,” he said. The indictment says the three men used fake email accounts to trick several campaign officials into believing they were dealing with a trusted source, and then got them to click on links that allowed the hackers to steal emails and other internal documents, such as debate preparation material and profiles of potential vice presidential candidates. They then leaked that information to media outlets and the campaign of President Joe Biden while he was still a candidate, the indictment said. Charges include wire fraud, identity theft and computer fraud. The US Treasury Department also said it was imposing sanctions on the three men along with several other Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps members. Trump’s campaign said in August it had been hacked by Iran but said the perpetrators were not able to get private information. However, several news outlets have said they declined to publish internal campaign documents that were offered to them. Biden campaign officials also did not respond when offered Trump’s debate preparation material shortly before the two candidates met for their only debate on June 27, the indictment said. The restraint is a marked contrast to the 2016 election, when hacked communications from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign received extensive coverage. The Iranian hacking team, known as APT42 or Charming Kitten, is known for placing surveillance software on mobile phones that allows them to record calls, steal texts and silently turn on cameras and microphones, researchers say. The three men are currently in Iran and beyond the reach of US law enforcement, but Garland noted that the Justice Department has successfully apprehended other international suspects long after they were charged. “We will follow these people for the rest of their lives,” he said. The Justice Department says Iran’s efforts are not confined to the digital realm. A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty earlier this month to terrorism charges stemming from what authorities say was a plot to assassinate a US politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards top commander in 2020. The defendant named Trump as a potential target, according to a source, but there are not indications he was linked to the two recent attempts on Trump’s life. The Justice Department has also targeted Russian attempts to tamper with the election, bringing criminal charges and sanctions against employees of state media outlet RT for allegedly funding pro-Trump social-media influencers in the US. –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 28 (IANS) The US Justice Department has said that it has charged three Iranian hackers for targeting former President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign and were trying to disrupt the November 5 election.

Kennedy Jr.'s name will remain on the state's presidential ballot, upholding a lower court's ruling that candidates can only be removed from the ballot if they die. The video is from a previous report. The unanimous decision from the liberal-controlled court marks the latest twist in Kennedy's quest to get his name off ballots in key battleground states where the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is close. Kennedy's attorney in Wisconsin, Joseph Bugni, declined to comment on the ruling. The decision came after more than 418,000 absentee ballots have already been sent to voters. As of Thursday, nearly 28,000 had been returned, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. Earlier this month a divided North Carolina Supreme Court kept him off the ballot there while the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and kept him on. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin on Sept. 3 seeking a court order removing him from the ballot. He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy's name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy's name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court's four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy's arguments weren't developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn't argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. \"We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court's legal conclusions on those claims. We simply are unable to make such determinations, given the inadequate briefing presented to us,\" the five justices wrote in six-page opinion. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in a one-page concurrence that while she doesn't disagree with the five other justices that Kennedy's arguments were underdeveloped, keeping Kennedy on the ballot will confuse voters and could tilt the outcome of the election. \"Voters may cast their ballots in favor of a candidate who withdrew his candidacy, thereby losing their right to cast a meaningful vote,\" she wrote. \"Ballots listing a non-candidate mislead voters and may skew a presidential election. In this case, the damage to voter participation in electoral democracy is real.\" The court's third conservative, Annette Ziegler, joined Bradley's concurrence. The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot could be a key factor in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between about 5,700 to 23,000 votes. In 2016, Green Party nominee Jill Stein got just over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin - more than Trump's winning margin of just under 23,000 votes.

Their relationship is their business,\" he said.\"But insofar as that relationship involves providing Russia what it needs to continue this war, that's a problem for us, and it's a problem for many other countries, notably in Europe,\" Blinken added.The top US diplomat said that China has provided 70 percent of machine tools and 90 percent of microelectronics needed by Russia for military production that includes rockets and armored vehicles.China counters that it has not directly provided weapons to Russia and draws a contrast with the United States, which has shipped billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion by Russia.Wang told a Security Council session on Tuesday that China \"is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor are we a party to it. China has all along stood on the side of peace.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a UN address criticized China and Brazil for promoting negotiations to end the war, saying that forcing Ukraine to accept a peace deal was akin to colonialism.The two countries kept up the drive on Friday, leading a statement with other emerging powers that calls for a \"comprehensive and lasting settlement\" through diplomacy.But in a thinly veiled criticism of Putin's recent saber-rattling, the emerging powers called on all sides to refrain \"from the use or the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\"South Africa and Turkey were among the powers that also signed the statement.Putin this week threatened to use nuclear weapons in the event of a major attack on Russian soil as Ukraine, looking to hit back against the invasion, seeks Western weapons to strike deeper across the border.Since Blinken and Wang last met in July at a regional conference in Laos, China has pleased the United States by releasing an American pastor imprisoned for years, although other Americans are detained.Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a summit in November 2023 with counterpart Joe Biden, agreed to key US demands of restoring military communication between the two powers. He also agreed to taking action against producers of ingredients in fentanyl, the painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States.But a wide range of disagreements remain.Blinken said he also warned Wang against Beijing's \"dangerous, destabilizing actions\" on the South China Sea, where tensions have risen sharply between China and US ally the Philippines.The latest meeting came ahead of the November 5 election in which Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to take a harder line on China.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump, have said that they seek dialogue to avoid conflict between the two powers, although their administration has also taken a hard line.Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, recently told a congressional hearing that China posed a broader challenge to the United States than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War.","summary":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday questioned China's sincerity in seeking peace in Ukraine as he directly pressed his counterpart over exports that boost Russia's military.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/blinken-questions-china-peace-push-over-russia-help-3744731","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4550423/us-secretary-state-antony-blinken-met-chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-sidelines-un-general.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:51:19","author":"Shaun Tandon","authors":["Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":257691974,"title":"WATCH LIVE: Harris campaigns at the border in Arizona","text":"Harris is visiting the U.S.-Mexico border as she tries to close the polling gap on the border and immigration, a topic in which former President Donald Trump leads her.

Southern District of New York Judge Dale Ho, who is in his 40s, randomly landed the historic case Thursday by the spin of wooden wheel used to assign judges inside a Manhattan courtroom — a stroke of happenstance that thrusts him into the spotlight after barely a year on the bench. “That will be a new experience for him on the bench — he hasn’t had years and years of high-profile cases — but I think he’ll just work very hard and try to do the right thing,” Shira Scheindlin, a former Southern District judge, told The Post on Friday. “Of course, it’s very high-profile, he’ll be in the spotlight,” she said. “It’s a criminal charge of corruption, and I think one would expect him to be a fair and impartial judge.” But while Ho may lack judicial experience, the longtime lefty lawyer arguably is no stranger to high-profile attention — or pushback for his activist stances. After President Biden submitted Ho’s nomination to the Senate in 2021, the jurist waited nearly two years to be confirmed by a razor-thin, party-line 50-49 vote. Republicans objected to Ho’s past statements — including once describing himself as a “wild-eyed sort of leftist” who is accused of “sometimes seeing racial discrimination everywhere I look,” The National Law Journal reported. They also looked askance at his comments calling the Electoral College and Senate “anti-democratic.” “I very much regret the tone that I’ve taken on social media from time to time, particularly if it’s given anyone the impression that I wouldn’t be impartial,” ​Ho contritely told senators. A Princeton University and Yale Law grad, Ho clerked in the Southern District of New York and New York’s Court of Appeals before serving as assistant counsel with the NAACP’s legal defense fund. He became director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project in 2013 — a job that brought him Hollywood notoriety. Ho’s battle against former President Donald Trump’s proposed citizenship on the US Census was featured in the Kerry Washington-produced documentary “The Fight,” which premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Self-admitted “overheated” rhetoric aside, Ho ultimately made it onto the Southern District’s bench in 2023. Soon afterward, he recounted to a group of lawyers that US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor — who served in the Southern District — said it takes as many as five years for new judges to stop feeling like they’re drowning, Bloomberg Law reported. Ho has now been thrown in the judicial deep end, although his past racial justice work could arguably be a boon for Adams. Adams has received the support of prominent black leaders such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and NAACP president Hazel Dukes, who have echoed Hizzoner’s laments that his prosecution smacks of a racial double standard.","summary":"The judge overseeing Mayor Eric Adams’ corruption case is a Biden-appointed newbie to the federal bench who previously worked for the ACLU and NAACP fighting for racial and voter justice.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/us-news/who-is-dale-ho-the-judge-in-mayor-adams-corruption-case/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90535758.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:40:12","author":"Ben Kochman,Joe Marino,Matt Troutman,Priscilla Degregory","authors":["Ben Kochman","Joe Marino","Matt Troutman","Priscilla Degregory"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":257692794,"title":"Jews and Catholics warn against Trump’s latest loyalty test for religious voters","text":"Former President Donald Trump recently reissued his loyalty test to religious Americans, declaring that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming members of certain faiths should he lose the presidential election in November. Jews and Catholics can vote for him and ace the test, but those who don’t, he says, “need their head examined.” If he loses, Trump added, “Jewish people would have a lot to do with the loss.” Among the Jewish leaders appalled at Trump’s remarks was Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism – an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America. “Your words preemptively blaming Jews for your potential election loss is of a piece with millennia of antisemitic lies about Jewish power,” Jacobs said in a social media post. “It puts a target on American Jews. And it makes you an ally not to our vulnerable community but to those who wish us harm. Stop.” Trump’s speeches for years have hewed to divisive “us” versus “them” messaging, but tying those themes to specific religious Americans who oppose him is out of line and even dangerous, according to rhetoric experts, religious leaders and academics. “Non-Jews shouldn’t express public opinions about what is or isn’t good Judaism and non-Catholics shouldn’t express public opinions about what is or isn’t good Catholicism,” said Steven Millies, a public theology professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. “Not only is it bad form, but it’s also an ignorant waste of oxygen.” Asked to respond to criticism from Jewish leaders, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt sent statements from herself and several of Trump’s Jewish supporters. The statements didn’t directly address the potential blaming of Jews for a Trump defeat; rather, they depicted Trump as a stronger supporter of Israel than President Biden and Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. “Jewish Americans and Jewish leaders around the world recognize that President Trump did more for them and the State of Israel than any President in history,” Leavitt said via email. “The bottom line is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden cave to Far-Left extremists and terrorists while President Trump will protect Jewish Americans and put American citizens first.” Trump’s latest provocative comments came in a span of four days. His warnings about Jewish voters were in Sept. 19 speeches to Jewish donors and the Israeli-American Council in Washington. His remarks about Catholics came on Sept. 22 in a post on Truth Social. Matthew Boedy, who studies religious rhetoric as a professor at the University of North Georgia, said Trump has adopted spiritual warfare rhetoric, which is commonplace in certain Christian circles. “Those who gave him that rhetoric saw Satan or evil as the enemy. Now that enemy is anyone – Jew, Christian, Muslim – who stands in his way,” Boedy said via email, calling it dangerous to democracy and religion. “Trump always makes his religious followers – especially Christians – choose. They have to choose him over pluralism, over morality, over evangelism,” said Boedy, a Protestant. “If God is already on your side theologically, it’s not a far leap to say he should be on your side politically. That isn’t new to American politics,” Boedy said. “Trump is only making that divide advantageous to him. He’s furthering that which was there, but he is also adding his own weight to it. Making it worse.” David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Jesuit-run Fordham University, said that in past elections, “for a non-Catholic like Trump to be setting himself up as the savior of Catholics, or Jews for that matter, would have been political insanity.” “But it’s Trump, and conservatives who would attack a Democrat for such language are cheering for the Republican nominee,” Gibson added in an email. “There are many reasons, the most obvious is that they like Trump more than they heed their own church.” Gibson also suggested that Trump’s tough stance on immigration, which includes calls for mass deportations, is at odds with Catholic teaching. “Catholics listening to the increasingly Nativist rhetoric on immigration from Trump and even his running mate, JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, ought to have their hearts examined if they support that,” Gibson said. Professor Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A&M University, said typical politicians seek to connect to voters based on shared policy beliefs, not by demanding religious loyalty. “But Trump isn’t a typical politician, and he’s very concerned about loyalty,” she said. “He divides the world up into ‘us’ versus ‘them’ and tries to use those divisions to gain power.” “It’s especially dangerous to attempt to divide people based upon religious identity,” said Mercieca, author of \"Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump.” “The kind of language Trump is using here is more like that used by an authoritarian personality cult leader.” Trump’s recent comment about blaming Jews if he loses came at an event that also featured Jewish megadonor Miriam Adelson, widow of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. She introduced Trump as “a true friend of the Jewish people.” Among the pro-Trump statements provided to the Associated Press by Leavitt was one from Ellie Cohanim, who served during the Trump administration as deputy special envoy for combating antisemitism. Trump “is absolutely correct in challenging our assumptions about voting on auto-pilot and failing to comprehend that the Democrat Party, which has been hijacked by its far-left base, is no longer a home for the Jewish people,” Cohanim’s statement said. Adelson and Cohanim represent the portion of U.S. Jews that strongly supports Trump. In 2020, he received about 30% of Jewish Americans’ votes compared to 70% for Biden, according to AP VoteCast. The criticism of Trump’s recent remarks came from the center as well as the left of the national Jewish community. The American Jewish Committee – a prominent advocacy group that strives to broadly represent Jews in the U.S. and abroad – issued a sharply critical statement. It took issue with Trump’s suggestion that if 40% of the U.S. Jewish electorate voted for him, “That means 60% are voting for the enemy.” “Setting up anyone to say ‘we lost because of the Jews’ is outrageous and dangerous,” the AJC said. “Thousands of years of history have shown that scapegoating Jews can lead to antisemitic hate and violence.” “Some Jews will vote for President Trump and some will vote for Vice President Harris,” the AJC added. “None of us, by supporting the candidate we choose, is voting for the enemy.’” To the left of center, a harsh denunciation of Trump came from Lauren Maunus, political director of IfNotNow – an organization of U.S. Jews that has accused the Israeli government of oppressive policies toward Palestinians and protested Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. “Trump doubled down on his longstanding pattern of scapegoating Jews,” Maunus said. “Make no mistake: This is a clear and flagrant instruction to his fanatical base of extremists to target Jews with retributive violence if he should lose.” Some Jews found a positive twist to Trump’s remarks, as Betsy Frank of Mattituck, New York, conveyed in a letter published Sept. 23 in The New York Times. “As a proud Jewish woman who believes in Israel’s right to defend itself but supports the United States and everything it stands for even more, I would not vote for Donald Trump for any office,” she wrote. “If he loses the election, I will gladly take the blame.”","summary":"His declaration that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming some if he loses in November incenses some religious leaders.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/27/jews-and-catholics-warn-against-trumps-latest-loyalty-test-for-religious-voters/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Trump_22987_d30183.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:34:54","author":"David Crary And Holly Meyer,DAVID CRARY and HOLLY MEYER - Associated Press","authors":["David Crary And Holly Meyer","DAVID CRARY and HOLLY MEYER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":257691012,"title":"Mary Trump Raises Four Red Flags About Donald Trump's New Watches","text":"Mary Trump, former president Donald Trump's estranged niece, raised several concerns about her uncle's latest collectible merchandise, limited-edition watches.In a blog post Friday titled \"The Non-Fungible Grift,\" Mary Trump, a vocal critic of the GOP presidential nominee, called his newly launched watch line \"grifting his followers.\" Previously, he has sold limited-edition collectible Bibles and sneakers.Trump announced his newest merchandise on Truth Social on Thursday, with watches that start at $499 and go up to $100,000, depending on the style. \"The Official Trump Watch Collection is here, and these Watches are truly special—You're going to love them.

The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia. Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign. The three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out \"a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate. \"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election,\" Mr Garland said. Court documents revealed that the hackers had \"prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign\". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns. A Microsoft report last month said that \"Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\" In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that \"Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well.\" \"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections,\" Mr Garland said. Details on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies. The United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that \"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update.\" Today's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals. Donald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him. Top security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country. HOW DANGEROUS IS \"IRAN'S THREAT\" The Attorney General noted that \"there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\" Court documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign. The US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today. The United States Treasury \"remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions,\" said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. Besides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. \"Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord,\" the Treasury stated. RUSSIAN AND CHINESE \"INTERFERENCE\" The US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate. China, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges. The US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to \"influence and arguably interfere\" with the US elections.","summary":"Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case.

The US President made his first visit to Kyiv since Russia's large-scale invasion last February 24. (Photo by Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via Getty Images) Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via Getty Images Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 947. Zelenskyy's U.S. Visit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the White House during his U.S. visit this week to build support for his “victory plan,” as well as having a last-minute meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Zelenskyy presented his victory plan to President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 26, but media reports suggest it did not receive positive feedback from officials who reviewed it beforehand. The plan's primary objective is to pressure Russia into negotiations within the next three or four months, according to Forbes Ukraine. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. will allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory using American-made weapons, which is a critical component of Zelenskyy's strategy. On Sept. 27, Zelenskyy met with former President Trump, who has consistently criticized him and recently questioned Ukraine’s ability to rebuild. At the meeting, Trump touted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he would “quickly” broker a “fair” end to the war without providing any details for how that would be accomplished. Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris warned that some Republican peace plans for Ukraine were tantamount to surrender, and “are the same as those of Putin,” as they would require Ukraine to cede significant territory. At the United Nations General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that the Kremlin is planning new strikes on Ukraine’s nuclear power plant infrastructure. These anticipated attacks are part of a broader strategy to strain Ukraine’s fragile energy grid, which has been severely damaged by the war. Zelenskyy toured a military plant in Pennsylvania, drawing criticism from Republicans who said they were not invited to the event, and accusing the visit of boosting Democrats’ prospects in a key swing state for the 2024 elections. The controversy culminated with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the dismissal of Ukraine’s ambassador, Oksana Markarova. Kyiv has yet to respond. Read More: No Lasting Global Security Unless Russia Is Defeated Biden's aid package: Following the White House’s meeting with Zelenskyy on Sept. 26, the Biden administration announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth nearly $8 billion, on the heels of a $375 million aid package announced a day earlier. Biden instructed the Department of Defense to allocate all remaining security funds for Ukraine before the end of his term. This includes $5.5 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority, meaning immediate aid from Pentagon stocks, and $2.4 billion through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which includes contracts with American arms manufacturers for new weapons production for Ukraine. The U.S. is providing an additional Patriot air defense battery and surface-to-air interceptors. It is also supplying Ukraine with Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOWs), an F-16 integrated glide bomb with an 80-mile range. F-16 pilot training is being expanded, and a global cryptocurrency network helping Russia evade sanctions is being dismantled. Biden announced a state-level meeting of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in Germany next month. Ukraine, Regional. Zaporizhzhia region. Russia launched a sustained campaign of glide bomb attacks on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Sep. 22, a first such attack for the regional capital, that has killed at least one resident and injured 40 others this week. The Kremlin has been using glide bombs, which are equipped with pop-out wings and satellite navigation, with increasing frequency and devastating effect along the front lines and in other regions of Ukraine for months. The regional government is working to find ways to mitigate these attacks, which are expected to continue, but there’s no silver bullet. Glide bombs are nearly impossible to intercept, even with Ukraine’s most advanced air defense systems, as they are undetectable by radar. Russia has significant reserves of bombs from the Soviet era, which have destruction capabilities comparable to missiles, both designed to destroy robust structures. The most effective way to counter glide bombs, which are dropped by airplanes miles away, safely outside the reach of air defense systems, is to neutralize the jets carrying the bombs before they can be launched, as the Ukrainian Air Force has repeatedly emphasized. Kharkiv region. As Zaporizhzhia adjusts to the new phenomenon of glide bomb attacks, for the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Moscow’s Sept. 24 barrage of 8 glide bombs, which killed 5 people and injured 36 others, was woefully familiar. A third of the wounded were hospitalized, with four in critical condition. This marked the third direct hit to a high-rise residential building in Kharkiv in two weeks, according to the city’s mayor. Since the beginning of September, more than 250 houses have been damaged in the city. Khmelnytskyi region: Russian MIG fighter jets launched five \"Kinzhal\" hypersonic ballistic missiles on the military airfield at Starokostiantyniv in western Ukraine on consecutive mornings of Sept. 26 and 27. Though far from the Russian border, the small town of Starokostiantyniv endures frequent drone and missile attacks as host to a key military airfield equipped with Soviet-era concrete hangars that house F-16 fighter jets Ukraine has received from western allies. Although Russian sources reported damage to some of those jets, Ukraine’s Air Force declined to comment on the results of the attack. Donetsk region: Russian troops appear poised to capture Ukraine’s frontline town of Vuhledar, a strategic stronghold at the confluence of the eastern and southern front lines, experts warn. Despite significant losses, Russia’s intensifying offensive is closing in on Vuhledar, a town with rich coal reserves that has repelled attacks for nearly two years, leaving it in ruins. A “fortress,” Vuhledar is crucial for the Ukrainian military, putting it in shelling range of the rail line used by Russia to connect its forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Ruslan Mykula, co-founder of the analytical project DeepState, believes the fall of the town is imminent, predicting it will happen in a matter of days or weeks. Since the start of this week, Russian shelling has killed seven and injured 31 civilians across Donetsk province, according to the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. Odesa region: In the early hours of Sept. 27, Russia attacked the southern port city of Izmail on the Danube River, killing two women and one man, and injuring at least 16 others. Izmail, an important transit point for Ukrainian grain exports enroute to the Black Sea, is located across the Danube from Romania, a NATO member. Dnipropetrovsk region: Early on Sept. 27, a Russian air strike targeted a police building in the central city of Kryvyi Rih and hometown of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said regional governor Serhii Lysak. The bodies of three victims, a man and two women, were recovered from the rubble of the National Police building. At least six others were injured, with homes and other area buildings damaged. Rescue operations are ongoing, with more victims expected as the rubble is cleared. The Kremlin’s Arsenal: Russia produces between 132 and 171 missiles per month and currently holds more than 1,450 missiles of various types, according to estimates by Forbes Ukraine based on Ukrainian intelligence data. Despite sanctions and supply chain restrictions, Russia continues to manufacture between 42 and 56 ballistic missiles and 90 to 115 long-range cruise missiles monthly, all capable of striking deep into Ukrainian territory. The production of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones, which Russia uses near nightly to deplete Ukraine’s air defense systems, exceeds 500 units per month. Russia’s monthly missile manufacturing costs are estimated at $1.1 billion, while drone production costs are around $100 million. These production rates allow Russia to conduct large-scale missile strikes every one to two months, with the potential to cripple Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure ahead of winter.
