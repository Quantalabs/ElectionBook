Friends need to act in a way that reinforces to our respective populations the fact that we are friends,' he told reporters on Wednesday morning.\n\n'This is not a friendly act but it is imposed on every country.' \n\nHe added: ‘This is against the spirit of our two nations’ enduring friendship and fundamentally at odds with the benefits that our economic partnership has delivered for more than 70 years,' he told reporters on Wednesday morning. \n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has branded Donald Trump's decision to slap steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Australia as 'entirely unjustified' and 'not a friendly act'\n\nDonald Trump had earlier issued a crushing blow to the Albanese government after refusing to grant Australia an exemption from its tariffs on steel and aluminium imports\n\n‘Australia has no tariffs on good from the United States and, of course, we have a free trade agreement with the United States.'\n\nHe said his government would ‘continue to put forward a very strong case for exemption’.\n\n'We will advocate for Australian trade at every level and through every channel.' \n\n'We will continue to work for a different outcome and discussions with the Trump administration are ongoing.' \n\nMr Albanese said that steel and aluminium exports represented just '0.2 per cent of all Australian exports'.\n\n'Neither is in the top ten per cent of what Australia sells to the United States.' \n\n He described tariffs and escalating trade tensions as a 'form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation'. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt explained the United States was prioritising 'American-first steel' and that Australia would have to 'consider moving steel manufacturing' to the US in order to be exempt from the tariffs (pictured: a steelworks in Perth)\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nDonald Trump rules out tariff exemption in brutal blow for Australia\n\n'They are paid for by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,' he added. \n\nHe said he would not be flying over to Washington DC to sort the situation and insisted that Kevin Rudd was a 'very effective ambassador'. \n\nWhite House press secratary Ms Leavitt said the United States was prioritising 'American-first steel' and that Australian-owned companies could 'consider moving steel manufacturing' to the US to escape the tariffs. \n\nThe tariffs will make Australian steel and aluminium much more expensive to US buyers and therefore flatten demand, and will be imposed from 3pm on Wednesday (AEDT) only months out from an election.\n\nThere are also fears countries hit by similar tariffs could be forced to export low-cost or heavily subsidised steel and aluminium to Australia - undercutting local manufacturers, including the troubled Whyalla steelworks now in administration and Newcastle's Tomago Aluminium.\n\nIt comes despite President Trump telling Mr Albanese last month that he would give the prospect of an exemption 'great consideration' as Australia was one of few countries that ran a trade deficit with the US - where we bought more from them than they bought from us. \n\nHowever, White House Senior Counsellor for Trade and Manufacturing Peter Navarro later said Australia was 'killing' America's aluminium industry. \n\nFollowing Mr Navarro's comments, Australia's Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Jim Chalmers pleaded for an exemption, in a series of meetings. \n\nWhat tariffs mean for Australians \n\nThe tariffs will be imposed from 3pm on Wednesday (AEDT). \n\nThe United States is Australia's third biggest two-way trading partner after China and Japan, and it was Australia's fifth biggest export market in 2023.\n\nAMP chief economist and head of investment strategy Shane Oliver estimates steel and aluminium exports to the United States make up just 0.03 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product.\n\nThe tariffs will make Australian steel and aluminium much more expensive to US buyers and therefore weaken demand, affecting South Australia's Whyalla steelworks, now in administration, and the Tomago Aluminium smelter in Newcastle.\n\nBut Australian steelmaker BlueScope already manufactures steel in Ohio so it won't suffer.\n\nThere are also fears countries hit by similar American tariffs could be forced to export low-cost or heavily subsidised steel and aluminium to Australia, which will undercut local manufacturers. \n\nWidespread US tariffs risk strengthening the US dollar, as the Americans buys fewer imports. \n\nThis would have the effect of weakening the Australian dollar, now trading at just 63 US cents, which makes manufactured imports in particular more expensive, adding to consumer inflation. \n\nAustralians would also pay more to travel overseas. \n\nDr Oliver said President Trump's trade wars were likely to keep the Australian dollar at weak levels 'with the risk skewed to the downside if Trump continues to ramp up tariffs'.\n\nBeef, precious metals, pharmaceuticals, aluminium, aircraft parts and wine are Australia's biggest exports to the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Foreign Minister Penny Wong had admitted, at the end of February, that Australia had a 'hill to climb' when it came to receiving an exemption, despite carve-outs being agreed to in 2018.\n\nShadow finance minister Jane Hume accused Mr Albanese and Trade Minister Don Farrell of failing to do enough to secure an exemption.\n\n'Has the Prime Minister been to the States? No. Has the Trade Minister been over there? He said he was going over this week and failed to do so,' Senator Hume said. \n\n'I'm urging the Prime Minister to pick up the phone... We are entirely dependent on a strong US economy and our concern is that our aluminium and steel manufacturing sectors here will suffer.' \n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said negotiations 'will continue to the very last moment'. \n\n'We have a never-say-die approach to these things. It is obviously in Australia's best interests for these tariffs not to be imposed,' she told Sunrise on Wednesday.\n\n'We are doing everything we can and fighting with every single tool we have available in order to get ourselves in the best possible position.' \n\nAustralia's economy last year posted some of the weakest growth since the 1991 recession, outside of the Covid pandemic.\n\nIt comes after Trump told Mr Albanese last month that he would give the prospect of an exemption 'great consideration'\n\nGrim reality of what Trump's savage tariff trade war could mean for ALL Australian families\n\nThis was despite immigration levels hitting record-high levels above 500,000 only months earlier.\n\nBut Ms O'Neil was optimistic about Australia weathering the effects of American tariffs on Australia, and its biggest trading partner China. \n\n'We have seen time and time again where we have had global turmoil and the Australian government and the Australian people have managed to build and grow our way out of it,' she said. \n\n'We're going to survive and thrive no matter what happens here.\n\n'We have a strong, great economy here and will continue to build on that.' \n\nPresident Trump wasted little time fulfilling his 'America First' election promise of imposing the most draconian taxes on American imports since the Depression-era Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, of 1930.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican commander-in-chief revealed he would double Canada's tariff on aluminium and steel imports to 50 per cent, amid an escalating trade war between the two North American neighbours. \n\nThe tariff initially imposed on Canada was 25 per cent - in line with the steel and aluminium tariffs being levied on all imports to the United States. \n\nIn 2018, Australia was granted an exemption from 25 per cent American tariffs on steel and 10 per cent import taxes on aluminum after then Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull pointed out the US had trade surpluses with Australia - where we bought more goods and services from Americans than they bought from us\n\nDoug Ford, the Premier of Canada's Ontario province, announced he would place a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity it provided to the US states of Minnesota, New York and Michigan\n\nDoug Ford, the Premier of Canada's Ontario province, announced he would place a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity it provided to the US states of Minnesota, New York and Michigan.\n\nIn response, Trump said he had instructed his secretary of commerce to specifically increase Canada's tariffs to 50 per cent. \n\nMr Ford then revealed he would cancel the 25 per cent tariff on the US after revealing he had spoken with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nThe pair have agreed to meet on Thursday to discuss reciprocal tariffs that Trump wants to put in place on April 2.\n\nTrump, in response, agreed not to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium to 50 per cent. They will stay at 25 per cent. \n\nMexico has also been slapped with 25 per cent tariffs on goods being imported into the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, China has been hit with 10 per cent tariffs, which could rise even higher, given that Trump campaigned to inflict a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nIn 2018, Australia was granted an exemption from 25 per cent American tariffs on steel and 10 per cent import taxes on aluminum after then Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull pointed out the US had trade surpluses with Australia - where we bought more goods and services from Americans than they bought from us. \n\nThe Albanese Government made the same argument in 2025 but Mr Turnbull said the Trump Administration didn't want any exemptions this time.\n\n'The Trump Administration regrets giving exemptions last time because once they gave an exemption to Australia then they ended up having to give an exemption to somebody else... so I think this time there will be no exemptions and they will apply right across the board,' Mr Turnbull told ABC Radio National on Tuesday.\n\nThe tariffs also breach a 2005 free trade deal between the United States and Australia, which was designed to enable Australia to export 97 per cent of non-agricultural goods to the US duty free. \n\nAnthony AlbaneseWhite HouseAustralia Politics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAnthony Albanese takes aim at Trump in furious tariff spray: 'Not a friendly act'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese branded the move 'entirely unjustified'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14488627/Anthony-Albaneses-takes-aim-Trump-furious-tariff-spray.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/00/96093565-0-image-a-8_1741740033500.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:55:30","author":"Antoinette Milienos,Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Antoinette Milienos","Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":299199448,"title":"AOC's stinging response as she's accused of misusing taxpayer-funded allowance for 'troubling expenses'","text":"AOC's stinging response as she's accused of misusing taxpayer-funded allowance for 'troubling expenses'\n\nREAD MORE: AOC's shocking plan to take on Donald Trump on his 'home turf'\n\nBy SAMANTHA RUTT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:49 GMT, 12 March 2025 | Updated: 00:55 GMT, 12 March 2025\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez issued a scathing response to allegations that she misused taxpayer funds for 'troubling' expenses.\n\nThe complaint, filed by the National Legal and Policy Center on Tuesday, claims that the US Representative's office improperly allocated funds from her taxpayer-funded Members' Representational Allowance - which is meant to support official congressional duties -to cover costs associated with the dance troupe.\n\nHowever, the congresswoman has since denied any wrongdoing, taking to social media to claim that the government watchdog agency is '100% wrong.'\n\n'100% wrong,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 'None of this is taxpayer money, this is an FEC filing. Be loud and wrong about something else.

She notably wore a dress to that event which read 'tax the rich.'\n\nThe congresswoman has since denied any wrongdoing, taking to social media to claim that the government watchdog agency is '100% wrong'\n\nIn other recent news, Ocasio-Cortez announced plans to take Democratic resistance on the road, appearing in GOP-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York in coming weeks.\n\nThe congresswoman divulged her plans to the Associated Press for a story on Monday, after fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, attracted big crowds in Warren, Michigan on Saturday, for a stop on his 'Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' tour.\n\nThe New York Democrat said she would be joining Sanders on the road soon and also be doing the solo appearances.\n\n'You look around - who else is doing it? No one,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'My hope is that the dam wil break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.'\n\nOn Saturday, more than 6,000 people were packed into three different auditoriums for Sanders' joint appearance with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain.\n\nSanders said he was targeting Congressional districts that narrowly went to President Donald Trump, like Warren, a Detroit suburb.\n\nThe Vermont independent also made stops in Altoona and Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nHe's using the push to encourage swing members of Congress to vote against a funding bill that slahes Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs.\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin - and also Pennsylvania, where she plans to travel - have been the most important swing states in modern politics.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told the Associated Press she planned to visit GOP-controlled districts in Pennsylvania and New York, emulating progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has taken his message on the road in recent weeks \n\nSen. Bernie Sanders is conducting a 'Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' tour in areas that narrowly went to President Donald Trump. Over the weekend he made appearances in Wisconsin and in Warren, Michigan (pictured) \n\nThey make up the three 'blue wall' states that went to Trump in the 2016 election - states Biden won back four years later.\n\nThey again swung to Trump in 2024, when he defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while New York leans Democratic at the presidential level, it could help Democrats win back the House in 2026 with its handful of swing districts.\n\nSince Democrats have found themselves booted from the White House and in the minority in both the House and Senate, party leaders have struggled to find their footing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats responded to Trump's joint address before Congress by holding up signs, wearing pink and protesting.\n\nEven members of their own party found their actions to be performative.\n\n'Why are democrats just sitting there? The signs are not landing. It is giving bingo! Sigh,' said MSNBC host Symone Sanders, who was Bernie Sanders' 2016 press secretary before going to work for Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.\n\nBernie Sanders had kicked off his Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' in February, first traveling to Omaha, Nebraska and Iowa City, Iowa, before this weekend's trip to Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n'It's not about whether Bernie should or shouldn't be doing this. It's about that we all should,' Ocasio-Cortez told the AP.\n\nShe noted that Sanders - who came up short in his 2016 and 2020 runs for the Democratic nomination after being thwarted by more moderate candidates - holds a distinct position in American politics.\n\n'He is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it,' the Democratic politician said of Sanders.\n\nDemocratsNew YorkMichiganBernie Sanders\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAOC's stinging response as she's accused of misusing taxpayer-funded allowance for 'troubling expenses'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez issued a scathing response to allegations that she misused taxpayer funds for questionable expenses, including payments to a dance company.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14488327/aoc-misusing-taxpayer-allowance-troubling-expenses.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/00/96091831-0-image-m-14_1741739299940.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/22/2187211418702988582/1024x576_MP4_2187211418702988582.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:55:17","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":299200378,"title":"Kellogg sidelined from brokering Ukrainian peace settlement — newspaper","text":"WASHINGTON, March 12. /TASS/.

Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends. This is not a friendly act,” he said.\n\nHe said it was “against the spirit of our two nations’ enduring friendship, and fundamentally at odds with the benefit of our economic partnership”.\n\n“It is also a fact that this increases costs for US consumers. You cannot overnight change the amount of aluminum or steel that is produced in the United States,” he added.\n\n“Therefore, this decision just increases costs for imports into the US, which will continue and those costs will be paid by Americans, not by Australians.”\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong made the same argument, saying that was why Australia would not impose reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“We’re not going to make Australians pay more for goods and services. We know there’s a cost of living crisis for Australians. We know that we have to continue to address it ... we are not going to add to cost of living pressures in this country by putting in place tariffs, which will simply drive up prices,” she told Sky News.\n\nMr Albanese, who last spoke to Mr Trump on February 11 when the President agreed to give “great consideration” to giving Australia an exemption, said he had requested another discussion with the President.\n\n“We have mobilised everything at our disposal… We will continue to engage in all vehicles. We have put in a request for another discussion with President Trump,” he said.\n\nHe said the Government had “put forward a range of propositions” to the US in an attempt to avoid the tariffs, and that those discussions were “continuing”.\n\nHe said he did not regret his choice to not travel to the US and negotiate in person with Mr Trump, saying other world leaders who’d tried that approach were still subject to tariffs.\n\nThe Coalition has blamed Mr Albanese for the tariffs, arguing the PM should have had a face-to-face meeting with Mr Trump.\n\n“All of the other leaders of the Quad and AUKUS, Japan, India, the UK, travelled to the US, and they had face-to-face meetings and they did what they needed to do. They advocated fiercely in their country’s interests ... well, where has the prime minister been?” Deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley said.\n\nMr Albanese said no other country had managed to gain an exemption.\n\nSenator Wong reiterated the Government knew that the “hill we’re climbing this time is much harder” than what former PM Malcolm Turnbull climbed in 2018 when he negotiated an exemption from the first round of Trump tariffs.\n\n“You only need to look at the President’s advisor Peter Navarro, who has said that the lesson from the last Trump administration was that exemptions don’t work. Their position is hardened against exemptions, and they have made clear at this stage that there would be no exemptions,” she said.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has lashed US President Donald Trump’s ‘unfriendly’ decision to slap Australia with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-politics/unprovoked-unfriendly-unjustified-anthony-albanese-slams-donald-trumps-tariffs-decision-c-18011098","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18011098/767e57af28cb00f2e85bdad2e40ad7e46aa485a7-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:47:10","author":"Ellen Ransley","authors":["Ellen Ransley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":299199792,"title":"House passes spending bill to avert government shutdown","text":"March 11 (UPI) -- The House of Representatives passed a spending bill Tuesday to fund the government through the end of September and avert a government shutdown at the end of the week.

There will be no exemptions,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement early this morning.\n\nMs Leavitt said the reason for the refusal to exempt Australia was “American-first steel”.\n\n“And if they want to be exempted, they should consider moving steel manufacturing here,” she added.\n\nIn the wake of the news, there have been calls from everyday Australians across social media to cut ties with the US and abandon major partnerships like AUKUS and Pine Gap — a joint Australian-United States satellite communications and signals intelligence surveillance base near Alice Springs.\n\nSome Aussies are also calling for the country to respond tit-for-tat and boycott US products, given the tariffs contravene a 2005 free trade deal between Australia and the United States.\n\nComments like “with friends like this who needs enemies,” “time to change our trading partners,” and “Trump treats us as a trade enemy” are seen across news feeds.\n\n“It’s now Australia’s turn to boycott everything American,” one wrote on Facebook.\n\nAnother added: “Need to put a tariff on all American cars coming into America.”\n\nOne even demanded a boycott on alcohol such as Jim Beam and Jack Daniel’s.\n\n“The blinded belief that we are a ‘close ally’ means absolutely nothing when it comes to this current regime,” one person wrote.\n\n“And so it begins. History and honour mean nothing to this man. Stick his subs up his backside,” said another.\n\n“Boycott of American imports starts now, yes?” asked a third, while someone else proposed “fine then, the rent on pine gap has risen to cover it”.\n\n‘Close it down’: Wild call after tariff move\n\nSome are backing Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie’s idea for Australia to retaliate by closing Pine Gap.\n\n“We’ve got this thing called Pine Gap,” she said.\n\n“What I’d be doing is telling them we’ll close it down. That means their intelligence gathering for this end of the world — they won’t get anything.”\n\nEstablished in the 1960s, Pine Gap is regarded as one of the world’s most valuable intelligence bases.\n\nIt continues to be operated by US intelligence officials, which Senator Lambie said offered the Albanese Government bargaining power.\n\n“Pine Gap; they need it like no tomorrow. Just tell ‘em we’re going to switch it off in seven days. Give ‘em a real boot up their backsides,” she said.\n\n“Tell ‘em you’ve got seven days to get your marines off our soil. Stop mucking around. Stop mucking around with ‘em.”\n\nThe idea has gained traction on social media, with many Aussies supporting it.\n\n“1. Walk away from #AUKUS. 2. Shut down Pine Gap. 3. Kick the US Marines out of Darwin. The USA is no longer Australia’s ally. It should be treated as a malevolent foreign power,” wrote one person.\n\n“Another example that shows how America doesn’t really care about us except what they can take and use from us. They treat us with utter contempt. @AlboMP [Anthony Albanese] Time to close Pine Gap and US bases in Australia and cancel all aspects of AUKUS,” penned someone else.\n\nAmong Pine Gap’s crucial functions is to act as an early warning system for missile launches by foreign adversaries, including nuclear strikes on America.\n\nIt also controls a network of surveillance satellites that keep a watchful eye on Russia, North Korea and China, among other volatile nations.\n\nIt is a crucial part of a missile defence system run by the US and Japan and plays an important role in electronic intelligence in military hotspots, like the Middle East.\n\nAnd in the evolving space warfare space, Pine Gap would play a central role.\n\nAs for AUKUS, that is a trilateral security partnership between Australia, the UK, and US agreed in 2021 that focuses on technology sharing in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIt has a nuclear submarine program and will provide Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability.\n\nDuring a joint appearance of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Mr Trump in the Oval Office last month, a reporter asked Mr Trump about AUKUS and he appeared to have no idea what they were talking about.\n\n“Will you be discussing AUKUS with the Prime Minister, sir?” a reporter asked Mr Trump.\n\n“What does that mean?” he replied.\n\n“AUKUS. The Australia-US defence alliance,” the reporter clarified.\n\n“Yeah, we’ll be discussing that. We have (a) great relationship,” said Mr Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the tariffs “don’t make any sense”.\n\n“It’s an act of kind of economic self-harm,” Mr Marles said.\n\n“We’ll be able to find other markets for our steel and our aluminium, and we have been diversified in those markets.\n\n“But, you know, we’re obviously really disappointed with this.”","summary":"Australians are furious at Donald Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on our aluminium and steel – demanding the country retaliate.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/australians-react-to-donald-trump-imposing-tariffs-on-aluminium-and-steel/news-story/9934387b7073188f680b5a31b8098c89?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f20956db838ba0125a43e5e9ed09c5cd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:39:58","author":"Chantelle Francis","authors":["Chantelle Francis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":299197840,"title":"Asia-Pacific markets trade mixed on tariff uncertainty and recession fears in the U.S.","text":"Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose on Wednesday, breaking ranks with Wall Street which whipsawed with uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans and fears of a recession in the world's largest economy.\n\nThe White House confirmed that the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum would take effect on Canada and other nations from Wednesday state side, but added that Trump no longer plans to raise tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was flat in early trade, while the broader Topix index edged up 0.45%, reversing course from losses in the previous session.\n\nShares in automaker Nissan rose 0.84% in early trade, following an announcement that CEO Makoto Uchida will step down from his position on April 1.\n\nThe company had been in talks with Honda Motor to merge and create what would have been the world's third-largest automaker by sales.

The bill passed the House by a vote of 217-213. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, after the vote, Golden laid out his reasoning on why he voted to push it through.\"This CR is not perfect, but a shutdown would be worse. Even a brief shutdown would introduce even more chaos and uncertainty at a time when our country can ill-afford it,\" Golden said in part while touting the \"provisions Mainers can celebrate.\"Golden highlighted that the bill provides funding to junior enlisted members of the Armed Services, more funding for disaster relief, more funding for immigration enforcement, and extended telehealth for Medicare.Golden concluded his thread on X saying: \"To be clear, this CR is not the one I would have written. But elections have consequences. I am disappointed by messaging gimmicks from some in my party, particularly the untrue claim that this CR cuts veterans services. The truth is: There are no cuts to veterans care in the period covered by this CR & we have six months to ensure funding continues in the next fiscal year. To say it contains cuts is, at best, a misreading that creates unnecessary fear among veterans.\"\"At worst, Dems are adopting the same cynical GOP political tactics that we have rightfully denounced — using misdirection to justify a vote. This may seem politically expedient, but it only lowers us to a level we shouldn't accept,\" Golden said.What People Are SayingTrump on Truth Social on Tuesday: \"'Congressman' Thomas Massie voted to delay the Debt Ceiling Bill from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration (from September before the Election, to June after the Election!), without getting anything for this horrendously stupid move — When Republicans could have gotten EVERYTHING they wanted. He additionally voted to delay the current Budget Disaster from the Biden Administration to the Trump Administration. I was running for Office at the time, doing my thing, and when I heard about this, it was, quite simply, hard to believe — A catastrophic mistake! Now, and virtually on every other vote, he's a very simple, 'NO.' He can't even approve a Continuing Resolution when he approved them many times during his career as a 'Congressman.' Thomas Massie is a GRANDSTANDER, and the Great People of Kentucky are going to be watching a very interesting Primary in the not too distant future!\"Massie on X on Tuesday replying to Trump: \"This tweet from Trump's account is very misleading. I never voted for a CR that became law. I did vote for a CR under McCarthy that included an 8% cut to all discretionary spending, but unfortunately that CR did not become law. Do research and you'll find I've been consistent.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on X on Tuesday after the vote: \"Today, House Republicans stood for the American people and voted to maintain funding the paychecks for our troops, the agents who secure our borders, the TSA workers responsible for safe air travel, as well as the healthcare and benefits for veterans, and essential services and programs that keep the government operational. But House Democrats decided to double down on partisan politics.\"For years, House Democrats have railed against government shutdowns, but they suddenly changed their tune when President Trump returned to office. Their falsehoods and misinformation campaigns are a desperate attempt to distract from their own failures. Despite these tactics, President Trump and Congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to deliver on the mandate given by the American people.\"In a shameful display of coordinated political theater, Democrats are willing to run out the clock on funding the government in a failed attempt to block the America First agenda.

Has their opinion of Trump shifted due to his policies, or is it more about changing political currents?\n\n\"We should not generalise from one event or even one segment of the Indian American population. More than 50,000 Indian Americans gathered at 'Howdy, Modi!' first and foremost to see Modi, not Trump. Recall that Trump was added at a later date,\" Mr Vaishnav said.\n\n\"Second, this is a diverse diaspora with a range of political views. While Indian Americans lean overwhelmingly toward the Democratic Party, a very sizeable minority - we estimate around 30% in 2024 - support the Republicans under Trump.\"\n\nIndian Americans remain committed to the Democratic Party, but attachment has waned. Some 47% identify as Democrats, down from 56% in 2020, a survey found last year. \n\nDo Indian Americans have a nuanced understanding of political developments in both countries, or are their views more influenced by diaspora-driven narratives and media echo chambers?\n\nMr Vaishnav said data from 2020 shows that online news was the primary source of information about India, followed by television, social media and word of mouth. Within social media, YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp were the most common platforms.\n\n\"Direct engagement with India is more limited, with foreign-born Indian Americans typically more involved than those born in the US.\n\n\"Having said that, one should not overlook the fact that the bonds of cultural connectivity remain quite strong, even with second and third-generation Indian Americans.\"\n\nIn the end, the survey underscores a complex portrait of the Indian American community -

more than half the Consumer Price Index's increase of 2.4 per cent for the same period. \n\nThe data also found retirees were better off in the December quarter with a near 10 per cent fall in electricity bills despite higher costs for domestic holiday travel and accommodation and home and vehicle insurance. \n\nASFA CEO Mary Delahunty explained high inflation was weighing heavily on retirees but the latest figures proved there was a 'substantial easing' in cost and living prices. \n\n'The good news for retirees from the latest Retirement Standard is there has been a substantial easing in price increases for the goods and services they purchase,' she said. \n\nThe average single Aussie aged between 65-84 needs $51,805 a year to live comfortably in retirement, while couples need a combined $73,077 a year, according to the research\n\n'However, the last couple of years of high inflation are still weighing on their ability to fund a comfortable retirement.' \n\nShe added Australians would benefit from utilising both compulsory and voluntary superannuation contributions for a retirement they deserve. \n\n'The most recent Retirement Standard budgets reinforce the fact that Australians need both compulsory superannuation and voluntary contributions which are preserved until retirement to have the sort of retirement they need and deserve,' she said. \n\nIt comes after the announcement of Donald Trump's brutal new tariffs had already impacted the retirement plans of millions of Australians. \n\nFrom March 12, Australian exporters selling aluminium and steel to the United States will be hit by the 25 per cent import tariffs, with no reprieve in sight.\n\nBut even before the tariffs were imposed on new US import taxes, the threat had seen super funds drop for only the second time this financial year.\n\nBalanced super funds fell by 0.8 per cent in February, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate cut last month.\n\nSuperRatings executive director Kirby Rappell warned the RBA had failed to stem concerns about President Trump sparking a global trade war, prompting the drop.\n\n'It was clear that signs of discomfort were emerging as markets digested the looming risks of tariffs and the effects that may result in the global economy,' he said.\n\n'Despite the Reserve Bank of Australia lowering interest rates in February, both Australian and international share markets declined over the month as the President's agenda came into focus.\n\n'The impact of tariffs on China and potential flow on effects to the economy influenced Australian share expectations, offsetting any potential benefit from the reduction in interest rates.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHow much Aussies need to retire comfortably -

The Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.4 per cent. The CSI 300 Index edged up 0.3 per cent, and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4 per cent.\nThe run on Hong Kong stocks, particularly Chinese tech shares, exhibited signs of wobbling even as the valuation of the Hang Seng Tech Index closed in on that of the Nasdaq 100. The 30-member tech gauge is now valued at 29.5 times earnings, compared with a January low of 20.6 times, while the multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index is 32.2 times, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe Hang Seng Index has climbed 19 per cent this year, and the Hang Seng Tech Index has fared better with a 34 per cent advance after DeepSeek’s rapid ascent spurred a re-rating. The CSI 300 Index of Chinese onshore stocks was little changed.\n\n“Funds are flowing out of the South Korean and Indian stock markets and rotating into Chinese stocks,” Thomas Fang, head of China global markets at UBS Group, said in a press briefing on Tuesday.\nBut large global funds were still evaluating whether to increase their holdings of Chinese stocks, Fang said.\nRecent conversations with investors showed that global long-only funds were more actively participating recently in initial public offerings and stock placements by Chinese companies, Goldman Sachs said in a report on Sunday. Investors were also showing more interest in buying Chinese stocks on the secondary markets amid turbulence in US equities, it said.\nGlobal fund managers were still underweight in Chinese stocks after three years of fleeing. Almost half of the mutual funds with US$400 billion in assets tracked by Goldman had no position in Chinese stocks, while 37 per cent had light positions, with an average allocation of 3.3 percentage points, it said.\n“Every percentage-point rise in global mutual funds’ allocation to China equity would translate into US$8 billion of net buying, while a neutral allocation across the universe would correspond to a total of US$30 billion in incremental demand for Chinese stocks,” analysts led by Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in the report.\nThe bull run, which has lifted the MSCI China Index by 20 per cent in 2025 in the best-ever start to a year, may have more staying power than a surge in September following Beijing’s package of measures to rescue the stock market and the economy, they said.\nTo further ride on the rally, investors could shift to Chinese yuan-denominated onshore shares, also known as A shares, they said. This would allow them to catch up with their Hong Kong counterparts in performance in the next three months thanks to policy support and compressed price gaps.\nUBS’s global wealth management unit expects a further 10 per cent gain in Chinese internet stocks because of continued policy support and reasonable valuations, but is neutral on the broader market amid policy uncertainty.\nLiu of CICC said that while the valuation of the Hong Kong stock market remains at a relatively low level within the historical range, “risk premium is a bit rich adjusted for the current environment”.\nGoldman’s report also said that the risk of intensified geopolitical tension may slow the gain. A memorandum on national security signed by US President Donald Trump last month reignited concerns about new restrictions on investing in Chinese stocks. An extreme scenario that banned US investors from trading in such stocks would trigger a more than US$800 billion divestment worldwide, including American depository receipts and Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks, according to Goldman.","summary":"‘A short-term fluctuation doesn’t equal a pullback, and markets might go up if there are new catalysts,’ CICC Research analyst says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3301974/global-banks-see-upside-chinese-stock-rally-international-capital-rotates","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/11/5ec9240e-336e-4907-9473-db54605203d7_98dc3052.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:30:08","author":"Yulu Ao,Zhang Shidong","authors":["Yulu Ao","Zhang Shidong"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":299200564,"title":"Crypto Sell-Off: 3 Cryptos That Are on Sale in 2025","text":"The \"Trump Bump\" has turned into the \"Trump Dump.\" Just about every cryptocurrency is down big for the year, and there are no signs yet that there will be a turnaround anytime soon. Fears around U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff declarations, combined with recession fears, have been a potent double-whammy for both Nasdaq tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 7.45%) is down 15% for the year, Solana (SOL 9.66%) is down 35%, and Ethereum (ETH 6.35%) is down 45%. So are any of these cryptos worth buying right now?\n\nWe've seen this story before with Bitcoin. There's a reason why Bitcoin has acquired the reputation of being a highly volatile asset. Drawdowns of 20% to 30% are par for the course. In fact, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, there have been at least five distinct times in Bitcoin's history when it has fallen by 77% or more.\n\nAnd, while there's no glossing over the fact that investors are de-risking and selling Bitcoin, even the biggest skeptic has to admit that Bitcoin has held up much better than just about any other cryptocurrency. Until recently, Bitcoin had been considered a hedge against economic uncertainty. Some investors even consider Bitcoin to be a \"safe haven\" asset and the equivalent of \"digital gold.\"\n\nOne way to ride out the current crypto storm is by hunkering down and buying Bitcoin. You can dollar-cost average on the way down, and then dollar-cost average on the way up. This is not to say that Bitcoin is by any means \"safe\" -- but it has gained so much institutional adoption over the past 15 months (ever since the launch of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs) that it might just be the one crypto worth loading up on right now.\n\nSolana and Ethereum\n\nYou have to make a choice here: Solana or Ethereum. They are the two leading Layer 1 blockchain networks, and both have very large, very diverse blockchain ecosystems. In short, they're the building blocks of the modern blockchain economy. That makes them very valuable. Every sector of the blockchain world -- from gaming to Web3 to decentralized finance (DeFi) -- depends on them.\n\nFrom my perspective, Solana is the future, while Ethereum is the past. Solana is cheaper, faster, and more efficient than Ethereum, and that is leading to much higher future growth prospects. Granted, some of that growth has been the result of meme coin fads, but there's still a lot to like. Solana is making major headway in areas such as decentralized finance, and has a very robust mobile crypto strategy.\n\nEthereum is still a major DeFi powerhouse, and the Trump administration is doing everything it can to promote the idea of Ethereum becoming the building block of a modern, blockchain-based financial system. If you look through the portfolio holdings of World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated crypto company, it's clear that it's positioning itself for an Ethereum-led DeFi system. So maybe Ethereum really can turn things around.\n\nBeware the bargain basement bin\n\nKeep in mind, though, that just because a crypto is down big for the year, that doesn't necessarily make it a great buy. Think about any experience you've ever had shopping at a \"Going Out of Business, Everything Must Go\" sale. Sure, some things are really cheap, but how many of them do you want or need?\n\nIn the crypto market, there's one category I'm avoiding for now: meme coins. The numbers are ugly, and I don't see a lot of hidden value. Among major meme coins, Dogecoin is down 50%, Pepe is down 70%, Floki is down 70%, and Dogwifhat (yet another dog-themed meme coin, this one wearing a hat) is down 80%. The meme coin speculative bubble burst in February, meaning that even the Official Trump meme coin is too hot to handle right now.\n\nBuy, sell, or hold?\n\nOf the three cryptos listed above, Bitcoin and Solana are clear buys. They've been beaten down to unreasonably low levels. Solana, for example, was a $294 coin on Jan. 19. Less than two months later, it's trading around $125.\n\nI'm still on the fence about Ethereum, however. If you only look at its past historical track record, it seems like a no-brainer buy at current discounted prices. But it has been a market laggard for months now, even before the crypto sell-off started. If you already have Ethereum in your crypto portfolio, it's worth holding on to see if the Trump crypto team can move it higher. But I wouldn't advise adding to your Ethereum position.\n\nHopefully, as President Trump has suggested, the current market pain will only be temporary. If it is, you'll be glad you added Bitcoin and Solana to your portfolio at such bargain-basement prices.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/11/crypto-sell-off-cryptos-on-sale-in-2025/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=c18784c0-6f69-4f11-87b7-865a55c91a1a","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F810769%2Fdistressed-investor.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:28:58","author":"Dominic Basulto","authors":["Dominic Basulto"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049},{"id":299197418,"title":"Disney scales back ‘Snow White’ premiere as controversy surrounding film grows: report","text":"Looks like this premiere won’t be the fairest of them all.\n\nAfter suffering intolerable backlash over the forthcoming live-action “Snow White,” Disney has decided to scale back its usual over-the-top premiere in Los Angeles, reported Variety on Tuesday, March 11.\n\nInstead, the studio has allegedly opted for a quiet, laid-back pre-party and screening at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Calif., on March 15.\n\nUnlike usual red carpets, “Snow White” stars Rachel Zegler, 23, and Gal Gadot, 39, will not be answering questions from dozens of different media outlets, as Disney has allegedly handpicked only a select few photographers and a house crew to cover the high-profile event.\n\nZegler plays “Snow White,” and Gadot stars as the Evil Queen. Both starlets are expected to attend the premiere next week.\n\nDisney did not comment when contacted for comment. The Post reached out to Zegler and Gadot’s reps but did not immediately hear back.\n\n“Snow White” will hit theaters on March 21 — however, the Marc Webb-directed film has been bombarded with controversy following the decision to replace the fairy tale’s seven dwarfs with “magical creatures” of all sizes and genders.\n\nMany accused Disney of being too “politically correct” and “woke.” Others also took issue with Zegler, a Latina actress, being cast as the lead.\n\nEven “Game of Thrones” actor Peter Dinklage, who has dwarfism, shared his critiques. \n\n“Literally no offense to anyone, but I was a little taken aback [when] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White, but you’re still telling the story of ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,’” Dinklage said in January 2022.\n\n“You’re progressive in one way but then you’re still making that f–king backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together. What the f–k are you doing, man? Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox? I guess I’m not loud enough.”\n\nDisney responded by claiming it was taking a “different approach” to “avoid reinforcing stereotypes” from the 1937 film.\n\nZegler has faced her own criticism after she spoke out against those who voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 election and for calling the original animated “Snow White” “extremely dated.”\n\n“She’s not going to be saved by the prince and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true,” the “West Side Story” actress said in 2022.\n\nGadot, who is Israeli, and Zegler have been outspoken about the ongoing war in Palestine, with the latter writing “free Palestine” on X after the first “Snow White” trailer was released online.\n\nIn February, Zegler opened up about the movie’s backlash.\n\n“I interpret people’s feelings about this film as passion for it, and what an honor to be able to be a part of something that people are so passionate about,” she told Vogue Mexico. \n\n“We’re not always going to have the same feelings as everyone around us and all we can do is give our best.”","summary":"Looks like this premiere won't be the fairest of them all.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/entertainment/disney-scales-back-snow-white-premiere-after-controversy-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/snow-white.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:27:43","author":"Whitney Vasquez","authors":["Whitney Vasquez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":299197440,"title":"Why The Health Of The Most Vulnerable Will Suffer Under The Trump Administration","text":"PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 18:: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after signing an ... [+] executive order at his Mar-a-Lago resort on February 18, 2025. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nTariff and trade wars seem to be dominating recent headlines. Equally if not more important is the devastating health consequences of some of President Trump’s executive orders on health and global health. The health of society’s most vulnerable population is intimately linked to government policies and priorities. Here are how the most vulnerable populations in America and around the world will suffer because of recent policy shifts.\n\nIndividuals In Low-Income Countries\n\nThe Trump administration officially cut 83% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts, which equates to billions of dollars in aid to fight important infectious diseases like malaria, a leading cause of death in many African countries. Although the U.S. State Department for Humanitarian Assistance issued a waiver that would get malaria medicines to millions that need them, many humanitarian contracts have been terminated and many medicines and insecticide-treated bed nets that help treat and prevent malaria have not reached some of the poorest countries like Uganda and Nigeria. These countries endure the largest burdens of malaria worldwide.\n\nNew modeling from Malaria No More suggests that just a year of disruption of life-saving malaria drugs would lead to 15 million additional malaria cases and 107,000 additional deaths globally, most occurring in low-income countries in Africa. These deaths in the poorest populations would be entirely preventable with U.S. aid.\n\nConsider also tuberculosis, which globally accounts for the most deaths of any infectious disease. About 1.25 million people died globally from this bacterial infection in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe USAID normally funds up to $250 million for tuberculosis programs in 24 countries, many in Africa that face the highest burden of disease. With the onslaught of funding cuts, drug supply chains are breaking down and laboratory services have been disrupted, making identifying, monitoring and treating tuberculosis difficult.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warning—Delete These Texts On Your iPhone, Android Phone\n\nOne Of TV’s Best Mystery Shows Returns With A 100% Perfect Critic Score\n\nGoogle’s Android Decision—Bad News For All Samsung, Pixel Users\n\nSince the discontinuation of USAID funding, about 3,600 tuberculosis deaths have occurred and 6,400 new cases have been diagnosed. The vast majority of these cases and deaths could have been prevented with continued aid and funding from the United States. These health casualties are occurring predominantly in poor patients who live in low-income countries and cannot afford tuberculosis medications.\n\nAnother important federal program that has been impacted by the freeze on foreign aid includes the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. This program has provided life-saving HIV/AIDS care to low-income countries since 2003, and has saved more than 26 million lives since its inception. Despite waivers in place that theoretically would allow life-saving anti-retroviral therapy and HIV testing to continue, many PEPFAR programs have since been terminated. As an example, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS foundation, which treats HIV pregnant women to prevent their babies from contracting HIV in the U.S. and abroad, received a cancellation notice that affected the care of over 350,000 people.\n\nIf funding for PEPFAR is not restored completely, about 1 million people will die every year. These will all occur in low-income countries where people otherwise cannot afford anti-viral medications to fight HIV.\n\nMarginalized Communities In America\n\nPresident Trump, in a recent executive order, also terminated the Health Equity Advisory Committee for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This committee identifies and addresses systemic barriers to healthcare access, and is particularly important to marginalized communities like people of color and those who live in rural areas that face significant challenges in accessing high-quality healthcare. Without this committee, people of color will continue to suffer and racial disparities in healthcare will continue to be amplified.\n\nLow-income Americans And Those With Disabilities\n\nThe future of Medicaid also remains uncertain as Congressional Republicans are attempting to reduce spending. Trillions of dollars could be cut for Medicaid, by potentially capping the amount of spending per enrollee or adding work requirements for each beneficiary.\n\nIf these policies are enacted, millions of Americans could be dropped from Medicaid, the largest health insurance program serving over 70 million Americans. Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income individuals, pregnant females, children and those with disabilities. This would mean these Americans would have less access to doctor visits, dental care and access to life-saving medications.

[+] new scheme hangs in the balance after the U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Federal Highway Administration had \"terminated approval\" for it. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n© 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nOn 5 January 2025, New York became the first city in the U.S. to introduce a congestion pricing zone, in an effort to ease traffic in central areas, and to raise funds for the city's public transit system. The scheme requires drivers to a pay a fee for their vehicle to access Manhattan (below 60th Street), with the fee set higher for larger vehicles and for travel during peak times, and lower for smaller vehicles and for travel during off-peak times.\n\nWithin the scheme’s first week, traffic had fallen by 7.5%, with 273,000 fewer cars entering Manhattan’s central business district, and travel times on inbound river crossings had been cut by more than a third, leading to faster bus journeys. By the end of January, tolls from the congestion pricing program had generated $48.66 million in revenue, putting it on-track to meet the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s first year target of $500 million. So far, so successful.\n\nAnd then, on 19 February, the U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Federal Highway Administration had \"terminated approval\" of New York City's congestion pricing scheme, calling it “backwards and unfair.” The next day, the official White House account tweeted an image of President Donald Trump, in which he likened himself to a king ‘saving’ the city.\n\nIn response, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said “I’m here to say New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years. And we sure as hell are not going to start now.” The MTA filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court challenging the decision, and they’ve since been joined in that effort by environmental groups and transit advocates.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warning—Delete These Texts On Your iPhone, Android Phone\n\nOne Of TV’s Best Mystery Shows Returns With A 100% Perfect Critic Score\n\nGoogle’s Android Decision—Bad News For All Samsung, Pixel Users\n\nAt the time of writing – ten days before the termination date of 21 March set by the Trump administration – no decision has yet been made on the lawsuit. The fate of NYC’s scheme hangs in the balance.\n\nBut are congesting pricing programs really worth pursuing? Let’s look at some of the impacts that they’ve had in other cities around the world.\n\nA local bus passes an ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) sign on the South Circular at Tulse Hill, on ... [+] 21st July 2023, in London, England. The scheme has been extended since it was first introduced, and now incorporates all London boroughs (Photo by Richard Baker / In Pictures via Getty Images)\nIn Pictures via Getty Images\n\nWhat’s happening elsewhere?\n\nUrban congestion pricing has existed for 50 years – Singapore was the first place in the world to adopt it, but schemes have since been rolled out in cities including Milan, Stockholm and London. Each of these cities use their own slightly different zoning schemes and pricing mechanisms, but ultimately, all are trying to reduce the number of cars and other vehicles in specific areas.\n\nEconomists argue about the details of road- or zone-based tolls, e.g. around how much to charge, and how to reduce the cost of running a pricing scheme – but most agree that such schemes have a net positive effect on society. Congestion pricing is often very unpopular when first introduced, and is (sometimes rightly) viewed as profitable but inequitable. Ultimately, the key to making congestion pricing zones both fair and popular is through the provision of alternative modes of transport beyond private vehicles – frequent and low-cost mass transit, and safe cycleways and footpaths. On that front, some cities are more successful than others.\n\nLondon’s pricing zones are the most extensive and the most well-known. The city has two overlapping schemes that manage the type and quantity of vehicles that can drive on its roads. Ultra-low-emission zones (ULEZs) are areas in which vehicles that exceed specific exhaust emission standards are either banned entirely, or are required to pay a toll. As of 2019, the ULEZ covers all London boroughs; an area measuring 1,500 km2, which is home to nine million people. There’s also a smaller Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ) in central areas, which, like NYC, charges all vehicles to enter during specific times.\n\nThe Stockholm congestion tax was made permanent in 2007, after being discussed for close to two ... [+] decades. (Photo by JOKER / Paul Eckenroth/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\nullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nDoes congestion pricing decrease traffic?\n\nShort answer – yes, generally.\n\nThe Stockholm congestion tax was introduced in 2007, after being discussed for close to two decades. What really made it possible was a seven-month trial period (January to July 2006), which included some public transit expansion in addition to the introduction of tolls. Prior to the trial, public support for the system was low, at just 36 %. But a significant drop in traffic volumes measured during the trial changed that. 53 % of voters ultimately supported the decision to retain the system permanently. Since then, congestion has stayed low, with fewer delays on the roads than projected. In addition, it’s had an impact on the type of vehicles people drive – over a three-year period, the share of cleaner, alternative-fuel vehicles on the roads rose from 3 % to 14 %.\n\nSingapore has continued to keep its traffic flowing relatively freely, even as the number of cars in the city-state has grown. Speaking to the NYT, economics professor Walter Theseira explained that pricing was just one lever used to keep the car fleet manageable. The other is a vehicle quota system which limits car purchases to only those Singaporeans who have a specific certification.\n\nThe situation in the British capital is more nuanced. According to Transport For London (TfL), the number of vehicles driving into the city center dropped by 18 % during weekdays as a result of congestion pricing. But earlier this year, transport analytics company Inrix declared London as the most congested city in Europe, saying that the number of hours drivers spend sitting in traffic continues to increase. When asked why this might be the case, Alina Tuerk, head of transport strategy and planning at TfL told CBS News that it’s partly because some car lanes have been “repurposed for other uses”, such as walkways, bus lanes and bike lanes. This has reduced capacity for drivers, but it has increased capacity for other transport users, “making Central London and the city a much more pleasant, people-centric place to be. But also increasing the throughput of people that you're getting through,\" Tuerk told CBS.\n\nNYC's congestion pricing zone has led to leading to faster bus journeys for commuters. Photographer: ... [+] Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n© 2023 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nDoes congestion pricing increase uptake of mass transit?\n\nProbably. However, it’s likely that much depends the existence of extensive public transit networks, as well as the quality and frequency of services offered on them, and the demographics of those travelling.\n\nIn Stockholm, the number of passengers on public transit was 4.5 % higher after the introduction of the congestion tax than before, but that just 0.1 % of the reduction in vehicle traffic “… can be ascribed to expanded bus traffic.”\n\nA 2023 study looked at the impact of a sudden, temporary pause in the Milan congestion pricing scheme. It showed that bike-sharing declined by between 5% and 8 % during that time, which the authors attribute to “the increase of road traffic congestion, which makes cycling less safe and pleasant.”\n\nA survey of Beijing drivers in 2019 concluded that congestion pricing strategies were “… more effective than reward strategies in promoting mode shifts among more habitual automobile travelers.”\n\nPeople living in London are relatively well-served by public transport, which explains why, in 2022, 67 % of Londoners travelled by active or public transit. But I didn’t manage to find any research that explicitly links the adoption of the city’s CCZs and LEZs to the use of mass transit.\n\nA recent study that looked at the London low emission zones and congestion charging zones showed ... [+] that together they have “a statistically significant effect on long-term public health.”(Photo by Hollie Adams/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWhat impact do congestion zones have on air quality?\n\nOverall, the effect on air quality is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nA few days ago, London’s City Hall (the office of the city’s Mayor, Sadiq Khan) released a new report that showed significant improvements in air quality as a result of the ULEZ. Particle emissions (PM2.5) from vehicle exhausts are estimated to be 31 % lower on the outskirts of the city than they would have been without the ULEZ expansion. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) – a gas known to impair lung function – has decreased by 27% across the entire city, with central London seeing the largest drop. The data also showed that vehicles in the city are getting cleaner – 100,000 fewer non-compliant vehicles were detected in London on an average day in 2024 than on an average day in 2023.\n\nBefore introduction of its congestion charging zones, Milan had repeatedly violated European Commission targets for particular particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Various studies have shown overall reductions in particulate emissions, as well as pollutants like carbon monoxide, since adopting a pricing scheme.\n\nIn Stockholm, total emissions of NOx and PM10 fell by 8.5 % and 13 %, respectively, as a result of their congestion tax.\n\nTraffic congestion – especially when it includes vehicles powered by fossil fuels – is bad for us. A ... [+] 2014 study from The World Bank concluded that air pollution and injuries from on-road motor vehicles cause 1.5 million deaths globally each year.\n\nDo we see any health benefits to reducing traffic?\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nIt’s been well established that traffic congestion – especially when it includes vehicles powered by fossil fuels – is bad for us. In fact, in 2014, a study from The World Bank concluded that air pollution and injuries from on-road motor vehicles cause 1.5 million deaths globally each year. That represents 2.9 % of deaths from all causes.\n\nThere have also been several studies that aim to investigate the health impacts of congestion pricing schemes. The most comprehensive review of these studies was published in Lancet Public Health in 2023. It screened more than 2000 papers to find those that included reliable data on the health effects of low-emission zones (LEZs) and congestion charging zones (CCZs). From that, they focused on 16 studies from Italy, UK, Germany, Sweeden and Japan.\n\nResults varied across each health specific outcome they were interested in, but they concluded that LEZs have an overall positive effect on cardiovascular disease. In other words, lower emissions lead to better heart and circulatory health among populations living in those areas. In some instances, they also found that LEZs led to a reduction in the number of people suffering from respiratory conditions, and in Germany, the health benefits of LEZs were most felt by those over 65. CCZs were associated with reductions in road-traffic incidents, with lower overall incidence of injuries. Analysis of childhood asthma in Stockholm found that the introduction of a CCZ led to a drop in acute asthma visits to hospitals.\n\nAnd a separate paper from 2025 that looked at the London LEZs and CCZs showed that together they have “a statistically significant effect on long-term public health.”\n\nOverall, I’d argue that congestion pricing is a positive thing to introduce to a dense city well-served by public transit services.

'Other countries have taken away our businesses, taken away our jobs.'\n\nHe spoke to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House while promoting Tesla electric cars with his senior advisor and CEO of Tesla Elon Musk. \n\nThe president blamed Biden's 'horrible economy' and 'horrible inflation' for the stock market's problems, and said he was acting to correct the mistakes of his administration.\n\nHe admitted it would be easier to 'coast' for four years on the economy, but that he wanted to do the 'right thing' for American workers.\n\n'Right now, we're like a chicken that's being plucked at from all over the world, we're not going to let that happen anymore,' he said.\n\nTrump sent the stock market to further lows after the president threatened Tuesday to level additional tariffs on Canada after Ontario Prime Minister Doug Ford threatened to tax electricity provided from Canada to northern United States.\n\nThe Dow Jones closed down 478 points on Tuesday and the S&P 500 closed ten percent lower than its record high in February. \n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House \n\nU.S. President Donald Trump appears with White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to promote Tesla electric cars\n\nBut Trump did not appear to be concerned by the stock market losses. \n\n'Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down but we need to rebuild our country, our country has been stripped of its jobs and its factories,' he said.\n\nFord backed off of his threat in response to Trump's announcement and speaking with administration officials. \n\nTrump spoke speaking to reporters after he brought them out to film him buying a Tesla from billionaire Elon Musk from the White House.\n\nHe urged Americans to be patient, promising them more wealth after the United States regained its manufacturing prowess.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting in Washington, DC\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the White House \n\n'We've been treated very unfairly by Canada, we've been treated very unfairly by Mexico ... the European Union has been horrible,' he said. \n\nTrump called Biden's economy a 'fake economy.'\n\n'They were putting in all government jobs,' he said. \n\nHe said the tariffs would only increase American investments into American companies, putting trillions of dollars back into the economy. \n\n'I'm very optimistic about the country, we're going to have the greatest markets we've ever had,' he said. \n\nMexicoPoliticsCanadaDonald TrumpElon Musk\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump breaks his silence on a looming recession hours after market tanks over trade war\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Donald Trump broke his silence as the stock market continues to fall in reaction to his decision to level tariffs on Mexico and Canada, escalating a trade war.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14488561/Trump-recession-stock-market-trade-war-mexico-canada.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/00/96092567-0-image-m-58_1741738051526.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:17:52","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":299197634,"title":"Trump backs off doubled tariffs on Canadian metals after Ontario suspends electricity price hikes","text":"President Donald Trump’s threat Tuesday to double his planned tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50% for Canada led the provincial government of Ontario to suspend its planned surcharges on electricity sold to the United States.\n\nAs a result, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S. president pulled back on his doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs, even as the federal government still plans to place a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports starting Wednesday.\n\nThe drama delivered a win for Trump but also amplified concerns about tariffs that have roiled the stock market and stirred recession risks. Tuesday’s escalation and cooling in the ongoing trade war between the United States and Canada only compounded the rising sense of uncertainty of how Trump’s tariff hikes will affect the economies of both countries.\n\nTrump shocked markets Tuesday morning, saying the increase of the tariffs set to take effect Wednesday was a response to the 25% price hike that Ontario put on electricity sold to the United States.\n\n“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday afternoon that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called him and Ford agreed to remove the surcharge. He said he was confident that the U.S. president would also stand down on his own plans for 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.\n\n“He has to bounce it off the president but I’m pretty confident he will pull back,” Ford said on Trump’s steel and aluminum tariff threat. “By no means are we just going to roll over. What we are going to do is have a constructive conversation.”\n\nAfter a brutal stock market selloff Monday and further jitters Tuesday, Trump faces increased pressure to show he has a solid plan to grow the economy. So far the president is doubling down on tariffs and can point to Tuesday’s drama as evidence that taxes on imports are a valuable negotiating tool, even if they can generate turmoil in the stock market.\n\nTrump suggested Tuesday that tariffs were critical for changing the U.S. economy, regardless of stock market gyrations.\n\nThe U.S. president has given a variety of explanations for his antagonism of Canada. He has said that his separate 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada, some of which are suspended for a month, are about fentanyl smuggling and objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalize U.S. farmers. He also continued to call for Canada to become part of the United States, which has infuriated Canadian leaders.\n\n“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,” Trump posted Tuesday. ”This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”\n\nTensions between the United States and Canada\n\nIncoming Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government will keep tariffs in place until Americans show respect and commit to free trade after Trump threatened historic financial devastation for his country.\n\nCarney, who will be sworn in as Justin Trudeau’s replacement in coming days, said Trump’s latest tariffs are an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses.\n\n“My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade,” Carney said in a statement.\n\nCanadian officials are planning retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump’s specific steel and aluminum tariffs. Those are expected to be announced Wednesday.\n\nCarney was referring to an initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs that have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.\n\nTrump also has targeted Mexico with 25% tariffs because of his dissatisfaction over drug trafficking and illegal immigration, though he suspended the taxes on imports that are compliant with the 2020 USMCA trade pact for one month.\n\nAsked if Mexico feared it could face the same 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as Canada, President Claudia Sheinbaum, said, “No, we are respectful.”\n\nTrump participated in a question and answer session Tuesday afternoon with the Business Roundtable, a trade association of CEOs that he wooed during the 2024 campaign with the promise of lower corporate tax rates for domestic manufacturers. But his tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China — with plans for more to possibly come on Europe, Brazil, South Korea, pharmaceutical drugs, copper, lumber and computer chips — would amount to a massive tax hike.\n\nThe stock market’s vote of no confidence over the past two weeks puts the president in a bind between his enthusiasm for taxing imports and his brand as a politician who understands business based on his own experiences in real estate, media and marketing.\n\n“The tariffs are having a tremendously positive impact — they will have, and they are having.” Trump told the gathering of CEOs, saying the import taxes would cause more factories to relocate to the United States.\n\nWorries about a recession are growing\n\nHarvard University economist Larry Summers, President Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary, has put the odds of a recession at 50-50. The investment bank Goldman Sachs revised down its growth forecast for this year to 1.7% from 2.2% previously. It modestly increased its recession probability to 20% “because the White House has the option to pull back policy changes if downside risks begin to look more serious.”\n\nTrump has tried to assure the public that his tariffs would cause a bit of a “transition” to the economy, with the taxes prodding more companies to begin the yearslong process of relocating factories to the United States to avoid the tariffs. But he set off alarms in an interview broadcast Sunday in which he didn’t rule out a possible recession.\n\nThe stock market slide continues\n\nThe promise of great things ahead did not eliminate anxiety, with the S&P 500 stock index tumbling 2.7% on Monday in an unmistakable Trump slump that has erased the market gains that greeted his victory in November 2024. The S&P 500 index fell roughly 0.8% on Tuesday, paring some of the earlier losses after Ontario backed down on electricity surcharges.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.\n\nTrump has long relied on the stock market as an economic and political gauge to follow, only to look past it as he remains determined so far to impose tariffs. When he won the election last year, he proclaimed that he wanted his term to be considered to have started Nov. 6, 2024, on Election Day, rather than his Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration, so that he could be credited for post-election stock market gains.\n\nTrump also repeatedly warned of an economic freefall if he lost the election.\n\n“If I don’t win you will have a 1929 style depression. Enjoy it,” Trump said at an August rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n-- Josh Boak, Rob Gillies and Michelle L.

But it is imposed on every country, that is important.\"\n\nShortly before, Foreign Minister Penny Wong warned ordinary Americans would feel the pain of the \"unprovoked and unjustified\" tariffs.\n\n\"Guess who will pay the price of this? It's actually Americans, American consumers. These tariffs will harm the ordinary American and the American economy,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\"[It is] not the way to treat a friend and partner\".\n\nSenator Wong added for the same reason she believed tariffs would not be good for US consumers, retaliatory tariffs would \"add to Australians' cost of living\".\n\nMr Albanese said the government did not believe the matter was final, noting it took many months during the previous Trump administration for Australia to secure exemptions on that occasion.\n\nBut he said today's refusal was harmful.\n\n\"This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship and fundamentally at odds with the benefit of our economic partnership that has delivered over more than 70 years,\" the prime minister said.\n\nHowever, he noted that Australian steel and aluminium exports to the US made up only 0.2 per cent of the total value of Australia's exports, while flagging there would be further support for the industry in the coming federal budget through the government's \"Buy Australian\" campaign.\n\nCoalition blames Albanese government — though no nation has won an exemption\n\nThis Trump administration has hardened in its view on tariffs compared to the last, when several exemptions were granted including to Australia.\n\nInitial hope that repeat exemptions could be granted has faded in recent days, as their start date neared.\n\nEarlier this week former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who helped to secure the previous tariff exemption, expressed his doubt that another would be granted or that the Albanese government could be blamed for failing to secure one.\n\nSenator Wong said the US president's advisors, like trade adviser Peter Navarro, had made it clear Australia was unlikely to win another exemptions, and they had made it clear \"at this stage there will be no exemptions\".\n\nWhile other global leaders including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have travelled to meet with Mr Trump, those nations also failed to secure exemptions from what the senator described as \"global tariffs\".\n\nBut the Coalition has turned up its attack in the wake of the Trump administration's refusal.\n\nFor months the opposition has warned the government must do all it can to secure an exemption, while also openly questioning whether Australia's ambassador, Kevin Rudd, could secure one given the US president's previously dim view of him. \n\nThis morning Liberal deputy leader Sussan Ley told Sky News there was more the government could have done, including arranging in person meetings between Mr Albanese and President Trump and between Trade Minister Don Farrell and his US counterpart Howard Lutnick.\n\n\"One thing we do know that the Trump administration is that it's about personal relationships. It's about building the personal networks and the communication one on one and that's what Anthony Albanese he has clearly not done,\" Ms Ley said.\n\n\"It's been two months and still no visit.\"\n\nShadow Finance Minister Jane Hume told Channel 7 urged the prime minister to call Mr Trump.\n\n\"I'm not saying this with my Coalition hat on, I'm not talking about things that have gone wrong. For the sake of your children, my children, the prosperity of the nation in the future, this is the time to pick up the phone and do something. The prime minister has failed to do that,\" Senator Hume said.\n\nSenator Wong said the government had engaged at every level, including in two calls between Mr Albanese and Mr Trump.\n\nSenator Wong also defended Mr Rudd's work on the issue as \"outstanding\".\n\n\"Mr Dutton and his lieutenants are very quick to get out a political attack, they're very slow to stand up for Australian jobs and Australian workers,\" she said.","summary":"The prime minister says the United States, if it is a friend, needs to act in a way that reinforces \"the fact that we are friends\" after the Trump administration confirms no exemptions will be granted to US steel and aluminium tariffs on Australia.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-12/australia-reacts-us-steel-tariffs-poor-friend-partner/105040948","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/41b2cac58bda76c0bc40db6594326a12?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=844&cropW=1500&xPos=0&yPos=138&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:11:50","author":"Jake Evans,Stephen Dziedzic","authors":["Jake Evans","Stephen Dziedzic"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":299192992,"title":"Worst news confirmed for Aussies as Trump trade war spirals","text":"Donald Trump has welcomed Ukraine’s decision to agree to a US proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Russia. \n\nUkraine agreed to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire during talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia, the countries announced in a joint statement on Tuesday, US time.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trump said: “Now we have to go to Russia and hopefully President Putin will agree to that also.

While addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), she said that US President Donald Trump believes in reciprocity and wants to have fair and balanced trade practices.\nAlso Read | PM Modi Mauritius Visit: Relationship of Faith Between India and Mauritius Major Basis of Our Friendship, Says Prime Minister Narendra Modi (See Pics).\nThe Press Secretary also accused Canada of \"ripping off\" the US and Americans \"for decades\" with its \"egregious\" rate of tariffs. Being asked about the timeline for Trump speaking to Canada's Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney, Leavitt responded, \"The president is again responding to the fact that Canada has been ripping off the United States of America and hardworking Americans for decades. If you look at the rates of tariffs across the board that Canadians have been imposing on the American people and our workers here, it is egregious.\"\nAlso Read | Sarah Wynn William, Former Facebook Director Claims Ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg Invited Assistant to Bed, Spent USD 13,000 on Lingerie in Her New Book; Meta Responds.\nLeavitt further mentioned the tariffs imposed by India and Japan on different US products. She added that today the US has a President who \"actually looks out\" for the interests of American businesses and workers.\n\"In fact, I have a handy dandy chart here that shows not just Canada but the rate of tariffs across the board. If you look at Canada since you brought it up American cheese and butter nearly 300 per cent tariff. You look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that's helping Kentucky bourbon be exported into India? I don't think so. 100 per cent tariff on agricultural products from India,\" Leavitt said.\n\"Look at Japan, tariffing rice, 700 per cent. President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about...time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers. And all he's asking for at the end of the day are fair and balanced trade practices and unfortunately, Canada has not been treating us very fairly at all over the past several decades,\" she added. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that tariffs against neighbouring countries Mexico and Canada could go higher in the future, Fox News reported. He added that the global community has been ripping off the US for ages.\n\"I think [the business community could see clarity on tariffs],\" he said, addressing CEOs' desire to see predictability for Capital Expenditure spending and shareholder purposes.\n\"But the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up...\" he added, as per Fox News.\"For years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They've been taking money away from the United States, and all we're doing is getting some of it back, and we're going to treat our country fairly,\" Fox News quoted Trump as saying.\nTrump said that the US would get back at the other countries for the same, as per Fox News. \"This country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We've been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we're going to do is get it back,\" he said.\nTrump has imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, citing the countries' alleged border control issues leading to fentanyl pouring into the US and killing American citizens, Fox News reported.\nEarlier on March 7, Trump delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a short-term period for certain products before the \"big one\" from April 2. He said he agreed after having \"fruitful conversations\" with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum while he slammed Canada for being a \"high tariff nation\".\nLast week, Trump attacked India's tariffs, saying it is \"next to impossible to sell anything to India\" because of the \"high tariffs.\"\nIn a nationally televised address, Trump focused on the tariffs his administration will be putting in effect soon. However, he also revealed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs significantly, allegedly because \"somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.\"\nIn his remarks at the White House, Trump stated, \"India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.  &quot;You look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol.

shutdown beginning this weekend even as President Donald Trump dramatically cuts the government.\n\nThe bill passed in a nearly party-line 217-213 vote, with one Republican voting no and one Democrat yes.\n\nThe continuing resolution, which largely keeps the government funded at its current level through September 30, would need to be passed by the Republican-majority Senate and signed by Trump into law by Friday to avoid a shutdown.\n\nTrump has been pressing Republicans to fall into line, and Vice President JD Vance urged them to stay unified at a closed-door meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nHardline Republican lawmakers have traditionally opposed the stopgap measures, known as CRs, and Tuesday's vote marked the first time several of them voted in support of one since the party assumed the majority in the chamber in January 2023.\n\nRepublican Representative Tim Burchett said he voted for the first time in favor of a CR because it will reduce federal spending.\n\n“It’s the first time I’ve been here ... that we’ve actually voted to decrease the size of government,” said the Tennessee lawmaker, who entered Congress in January 2019.\n\nBurchett, who spent much of the

This is Republican leadership handing over the keys of the government, and a blank check to Elon Musk and to President Trump,\" she said.\n\nOne Republican, hardline Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted no and one Democrat, moderate Jared Golden of Maine, voted yes.\n\nSenate Republicans will need at least seven Democrats to vote with them to prevent a lapse in funding, which could disrupt everything from financial oversight to scientific research and force hundreds of thousands of federal workers to go without pay.\n\nMany of those workers have already been stressed by Trump's blunt-force campaign to thin the ranks of the U.S. civil service and slash spending.\n\nSenate Democrats have voiced opposition to the bill but also have a history of criticizing government shutdowns as needless chaos that they say hurts their constituents. Several have said they would vote for the measure to avert a shutdown.\n\nAt least 100,000 of the government's 2.3 million civilian workers have either been fired or taken a buyout so far, and Trump has effectively shuttered agencies that handle foreign aid and consumer protections. Trump's administration has ordered a second round of layoffs as well, with plans due later this week.\n\nDemocrats say Trump's downsizing effort runs roughshod over Congress' authority over spending matters.\n\nThe bill would extend government funding until the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Increases in defense, veterans' care and border security would be offset by cuts to some domestic programs.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a stopgap bill to keep federal agencies funded past Friday, averting a partial shutdown beginning this weekend even as…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/us-house-republicans-pass-stopgap-bill-to-fund-government1","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/fb/5d/e27d1d93d9e27b7cb883992b0816d611ece8/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 23:59:54","author":"David Morgan,Japan Today Editor","authors":["David Morgan","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":299193664,"title":"Trump Appears To Read From Tesla Pitch While Speaking With Elon Musk","text":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to read from a piece of paper detailing Tesla's selling points at the White House.Why It MattersTrump has tapped Elon Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, to oversee the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).What To KnowThe note Trump was holding appeared to tout that Tesla is a self-driving vehicle.\"Tesla Pricing,\" the note said. \"Full Self Driving.\"Trump's note went on to list the pricing of different Tesla models.

The 25% increase on steel and aluminum is still expected to take effect on Wednesday. \n\nFord, on Tuesday, told CNN that he apologized to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer after his previous comments and actions. \n\nThe premier told the outlet that he considers the governor a friend, having worked with her for seven years, but that she understand his frustration. \n\nOn Monday, he had stated that if the United States further escalated the tariff, he would “not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely.”\n\nInstead of doing that; however, he retracted the electricity surcharge once Trump threatened to double the tariffs on aluminum and steel. \n\nThat led to Trump pulling back on his own threat. \n\nGoing back and forth, Ford said Tuesday, is only hurting Americans and Canadians. \n\n“This is absolute chaos, created by one person and that’s Donald Trump, not the American people,” Ford said. “Canadians love Americans. I love Americans. And this has to stop. Let’s sit around the table and negotiate a new deal, even though he created the deal in the first place.”","summary":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford reversed course on a 25% electricity surcharge after President Trump threatened a 50% tariff.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/03/canada-trump-back-down-on-tariff-hikes-ontario-premiere-apologizes-to-whitmer.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/XCQQIGMIANFF3ARBVZSEM4U2QM.JPG?auth=0685e08f20116b46adff1ec218390552543ac4959e9ae931ac6e001b000ccea3&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 23:58:05","author":"Ryan Boldrey","authors":["Ryan Boldrey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":299193454,"title":"Secretly single?

I'm a workaholic and I love it, I love it,' Sweeney expressed to the outlet. \nAnd in April 2024, Sweeney was spotted leaving a bridal shop in Los Angeles while carrying a large garment bag.\nBoth Sydney and Jonathan have also worked together in the entertainment industry. While Sydney starred in the romantic comedy, Anyone But You (2023), she also co-produced the film with Davino through her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. \nOn having the chance to work closely with Jonathan, the Immaculate actress told the outlet, 'I think it's incredible being able to work with people who you wanna be in business with.\n'It's amazing having someone who cheers you on and someone who fully just supports what you do.'\n\nLast month, TMZ reported that the star's wedding to Davino has been postponed after a date had been set for May of this year; seen in January in NYC \n\nLast year in October, the star broke her silence on claims that the businessman from Chicago pays for everything or financially backs her projects\nLast year in October, the star broke her silence on claims that the businessman from Chicago pays for everything or financially backs her projects.\n'I'm a very successful, independent woman who's worked really hard,' Sweeney told Glamour. 'I've accomplished and bought everything myself, and I provide for myself and my family.\n\n Sydney Sweeney's, 27, wedding to fiancé Jonathan Davino, 41, postponed \n'I would love to set the record straight. You can be in a healthy relationship with someone and also be very successful without needing the man.'\nShe continued to the outlet, 'We're teammates. We're in it together. And we want to see each other succeed.' \nSince sparking up a romance, Sydney and Jonathan have been seen together during a few public outings - but mainly keep details of their relationship private. \nWhile talking to Cosmopolitan in 2022, she opened up about her need for privacy. 'Sometimes I feel guilty about it,' she admitted.\n'I would love to share my normal life so that people can see that it's not all glamour. But I can't because, one, I like my privacy, and two, social media is another platform for business.' \nShe continued, 'Sharing my life on it could go against the integrity of the business and brand I'm trying to create.' \n\nWhile talking to Cosmopolitan in 2022, she opened up about her need for privacy. 'Sometimes I feel guilty about it,' she admitted; seen in February in Berlin \nIn another update regarding their wedding, she explained to Glamour UK in December 2023 that she has a Pinterest board full of ideas for the big day.\n'What girl doesn't create a Pinterest board for their wedding? I started making that when I was like 10. I don't have a color scheme yet.\n'I'm more of an experience planner, so I'm like, \"What experience do I want to give people? Are we going on a tropical vacation? Are we doing a carnival?\"' she continued.\nShe also discussed wanting to have a family in the future.\n'I think about having four kids,' she shared. 'I dream of teaching them how to ski when they're little and having them follow me around on adventures, taking them on hikes, teaching them how to build tree houses, just living through their imagination.'\nSydney continued, 'That's something I really, really look forward to.'\nIn March of last year, Sweeney gushed about Jonathan during her opening monologue while hosting Saturday Night Live.\nShe notably poked fun during the show at affair rumors that surrounded her and her Anyone But You costar Glen Powell, who also made a surprise cameo during the episode.\n'But the craziest rumor is that I was having an affair with my costar Glen Powell. That's obviously not true,' Sweeney stated while addressing the studio audience.\n\nIn March of last year, Sweeney gushed about Jonathan during her opening monologue while hosting Saturday Night Live (seen above) \n\nEarlier this month, Sweeney also shared a playful video of herself with her The Housemaid co-star Brandon Sklenar\n\n'Me and my fiancé produced the movie together, and he was there the entire shoot,' she explained.\n'And I just want to let everyone know that he's the man of my dreams, and we're still together and stronger than ever. He even came here tonight to support me. Can we cut to him?' Sydney asked.\nHowever, the camera then cut to Glen in the audience, instead of Davino. The actress quickly exclaimed, 'That's not my fiancé! He's in my dressing room!' \nEarlier this month, Sweeney also shared a playful video of herself with her The Housemaid co-star Brandon Sklenar. \nIn the clip shared to Instagram, the pair could be seen inside what appeared to be a studio and the actor lifted the beauty up into his shoulders with ease. \n\nSydney also included a snap as the two stars had a blast playing games while spending time at an arcade\nSydney also included a snap as the two stars had a blast playing games while spending time at an arcade. \nThe Housemaid is an upcoming movie - directed by Paul Feig - and is an adaptation of the 2022 novel of the same name written by Freida McFadden. \nThe premise, 'Follows a struggling woman who is happy to start over as a housemaid for an affluent, elite couple,' per IMDB. \nOther cast members aside from Sweeney and Sklenar include Amanda Seyfried and Michele Morrone. \nSydney Sweeney\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSecretly single?

The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which is struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices.\n\n“It's a great product,” he said. Referring to Musk, Trump said “we have to celebrate him.”\n\nIt was the latest — and most unusual — example of how Trump has demonstrated loyalty to Musk, who spent heavily on his comeback campaign last year and has been a key figure in his second administration. Tesla's stock price increased nearly 4% on Tuesday after dropping almost 48% since Trump took office in January.\n\nThe Republican president announced on social media overnight that he was going to buy a new Tesla as “a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”\n\nMusk continues to run Tesla — as well as the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump's adviser.\n\n“Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!\" Trump wrote. \"But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.”\n\nSpeaking later Tuesday at a business roundtable event, Trump said that Musk, the world's richest man, “shouldn't be scarified or have to suffer because he wants to help the government.”\n\nOthers have also rallied to Musk's defense. Alex Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist, said that he bought a customized version of a Cybertruck that he'll give away to a customer of his online store next month.\n\nIn addition to Tesla's struggles, Musk has faced other challenges too. He said X was targeted by a “massive cyberattack” that disrupted the social media platform on Monday, and the last two test launches of his Starship rocket ended in explosions.\n\nPresidents almost never drive for security reasons. Joe Biden got behind the wheel of an electric truck while promoting domestic manufacturing, and Barack Obama took a spin with Jerry Seinfeld in the White House driveway for a comedy show.\n\nBut regardless of the practicality of Trump's purchase, his overnight announcement about buying a Tesla represented another step in how the president has blurred lines between private and public interests.\n\nDuring his first term, top adviser Kellyanne Conway urged people to show their support for Trump’s daughter Ivanka by purchasing her retail products.\n\n“Go buy Ivanka’s stuff,” she said. “I’m going to give it a free commercial here.”\n\nTrump's wealth and business savvy is core to his political appeal. The president promoted his products while running for office last year, and he attached his name to a cryptocurrency meme coin that launched shortly before he took office.\n\nHowever, it's rare to see Trump use his own money to support an ally, no matter how important they are.\n\nMusk is the world's richest person, with billions of dollars in government contracts. He's also exerting sweeping influence over Trump's administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and traveling frequently with the president.\n\nDuring an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk “how are you running your other businesses” while also advising Trump.\n\n“With great difficulty,” he said.\n\n“But there’s no turning back, you say?” Kudlow responded.\n\n“I’m just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk said.\n\nTesla has recently faced protests and vandalism. Police are investigating gunshots fired at a dealership in Oregon, and fire officials are examining a blaze that destroyed four Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle.\n\nAt times, the White House has needed to play cleanup for Musk, who had never worked in public service before and has admitted that he'll make mistakes along the way.\n\nFor example, Musk presented inflated estimates of fraud in government benefits like Social Security on Monday, leading Democrats to argue that he was planning cuts to the popular programs.\n\n“Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” Musk said in the interview. “That’s the big one to eliminate.”\n\nThe next morning, a White House account on X criticized news organizations as “lying hacks” and told Democrats to “spare us the fake outrage\" about reducing benefits.\n\n“He was clearly talking about the WASTE in the programs,\" the White House posted.","summary":"President Donald Trump shopped for a new Tesla on the White House driveway on Tuesday, selecting a shiny red sedan to show his support for Elon Musk &amp;#39;s electric vehicle company as it faces blowback because of his work to advance the president&amp;#39;s political agenda and downsize the federal gover...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/538028/Trump-selects-a-new-Tesla-on-White-House-driveway-to-show-support-for-Elon-Musk","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/3/c33d57ddfdfcf0524768f75717308b1d89d2edde419aea0e52fddf9c1502b132_p4159879.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 23:54:00","author":"Luke Perry,The Canadian Press","authors":["Luke Perry","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.224},{"id":299192118,"title":"B.C. government to unhappy doctors, nurses in the U.S.: Come work for us","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nB.C.

Baraka said Tuesday that the private owner of an immigrant detention center lacks city planning board approval and a certificate of occupancy to open, and that his administration will file a lawsuit and padlock the building if necessary to block its opening without the necessary approvals.\n\n“If they try to do something to violate the law, we will take them to court,” Baraka said outside the facility, known as Delaney Hall, before a crowd of about 300 immigrants' rights advocates and other opponents of the facility demonstrating in its parking lot.\n\nBaraka, a Democrat running for governor in this June’s primary, was the main speaker at a rally co-hosted by a pair of immigrants' rights organizations, Make the Road New Jersey and the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, the latter a coalition of 60 related groups statewide.\n\nMembers of those groups, labor unions, environmental justice advocates, local clergy, and others chanted, “The people united will never be defeated,” in English and Spanish. They held up signs reading “Immigrant power,” “NJ Says No Dice to ICE,” and “We are all immigrants.”\n\nOne of the most arresting images of the afternoon was a banner depicting the Virgin Mary — a well-known migrant herself — in handcuffs, flanked by a pair of black-clad ICE agents.\n\nSunny skies and mild temperatures amplified protestors' enthusiasm, though the spirit was occasionally dampened by odors from the Passaic Valley Sewerage Authority plant just across Doremus Avenue.\n\nThe PVSC plant and Delaney Hall are in an industrial area of Newark’s Ironbound section that environmental justice advocates say is already overburdened by industrial uses that have caused health and other problems for the heavily immigrant community.\n\n“We need a lot in this neighborhood; what we don’t need is a detention center,” said the Rev. Moacir Weirich, pastor of the Ironbound’s Saint Stephan’s Grace Church.\n\nDelaney Hall is a 1,000-bed facility owned and operated by the GEO Group of Boca Raton, Florida. It would triple ICE’s capacity to hold detainees in New Jersey.\n\nICE chose the site in part for its location less than two miles northeast of Newark Liberty International Airport, where, following hearings and deportation orders by an immigration judge, detainees could be put on flights to their countries of origin.\n\nNew Jersey’s only immigrant detention center currently operating is a 300-bed facility in neighboring Elizabeth, just south of the airport. The Elizabeth facility is also privately operated under an ICE contract by CoreCivic of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nCriticism of plans for Delaney Hall has intensified since ICE announced its “impending” opening on Feb. 27 and has been bound up with opposition to other initiatives by President Donald Trump since his Jan. 20 swearing-in.\n\nHowever, opposition to the Newark facility by Democratic elected officials from New Jersey had already begun mounting in April 2024, when ICE announced under then-President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, that it was negotiating with the GEO Group to open the facility as a detention center.\n\nThe resulting deal announced by ICE and the GEO Group last month will be worth about $1 billion to the company over 15 years.\n\nThe GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on Baraka’s assertion that it needs the city’s permission to begin operating.\n\nA regional ICE spokesperson did not address the mayor’s assertions, and instead, she referred to ICE’s original Feb. 27 announcement of Delaney Hall’s opening.\n\nThe announcement quotes ICE Acting Director Caleb Vitello saying the facility would help the agency “pursue President Trump’s mandate to arrest, detain and remove illegal aliens from our communities,” but it was silent on the issue of local approvals.\n\nBaraka joined others Tuesday in calling for passage of the Immigrant Trust Act, stalled state legislation intended to codify guidelines issued by New Jersey’s state attorney during Trump’s first term, which would limit information sharing by local law enforcement agencies with ICE.\n\nAll Americans are migrants of some kind, Baraka said, recalling his family’s move up to Newark from the Jim Crow South. Likewise, all people living in the United States share in protections provided by the Constitution, which he said were now under threat by warrantless raids and injustices of other kinds.\n\n“I don’t know if you can find anybody who is not an immigrant,” Baraka told the gathering.\n\nBut, he added, “This is not just a problem of immigrants.”\n\n“If one person is hurt, we all are hurt,” Baraka said. “If one person’s rights are violated, all of our rights are violated.”\n\nNobody knows Jersey better than NJ.com Sign up to get breaking news alerts straight to your inbox. \n\nSteve Strunsky may be reached at sstrunsky@njadvancemedia.com","summary":"Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, vowed to padlock the doors if necessary to block the opening of the 1,000-bed facility in the city's Ironbound section.","url":"https://www.nj.com/essex/2025/03/newark-mayor-leads-detention-center-protest-says-it-needs-local-approval.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/SGNGQGTD6VBCRM3MZLWTCACVAM.JPG?auth=f8bc457d4d6edbf0095017b824c0c6e3484c1d8017bc720767cc5ad190634e74&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 23:45:55","author":"Steve Strunsky","authors":["Steve Strunsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":299191218,"title":"Donald Trump Furiously Branded Rupert Murdoch a 'Piece of S---' After Media Mogul's New York Post Mocked his 2024 Presidential Announcement","text":"Rupert Murdoch may turn 94 on Tuesday, but he better not be expecting a happy birthday cake from President Donald Trump. \n\nThe two have been awkwardly at odds since Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 presidential election result, and an explosive new book is only adding to their rift RadarOnline.com can reveal.Trump, who has been known to hold a personal grudge or two, reportedly called the elderly Fox head a \"piece of s---\" when the right-wing media mogul’s New York Post mocked his decision to run for re-election.\n\nMurdoch is apparently not that enamored with Trump either, according to a new book tracking the former reality star's return to power as president.\n\nMichael Wolff, whose 2018 tell-all expose of the first Trump administration led to the businessman's wrath, is back with a follow-up called All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, which exposes more inside dirt from unnamed sources with ties to the president.\n\nSpeaking about his new book, Wolff revealed: \"In his heart of hearts, Rupert hates Trump. He kind of thinks Donald Trump is a moron.\"Despite his conservative Fox News Channel regularly trumpeting Trump, Murdoch has lost his patience with the president.\n\nWolff said: \"Murdoch has expressed on any number of occasions to me and to many other people that he hates Trump.\n\nHe added: \"(He) thinks Donald Trump is a deeply unserious person, that would be the complimentary version.\"\n\nPart of that could be due to Trump's current alliance with Russia in its war with Ukraine. Murdoch has not shied away from blasting Trump in his newspapers for \"selling out\" Ukraine to Russia and launching the \"dumbest trade war in history\" by imposing tariffs.\n\nThe billionaire reportedly threatened to go after Trump following his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, but then made a desperate attempt to become his bestie again after his convincing re-election.\n\nNow Trump is having the last laugh, according to Wolff, as Fox rushes to show its support once more.\n\nWolff said: \"Did Trump need Fox News or did Fox News need Trump? Murdoch clearly assumed that Trump needed Fox and that he could at will deprive him of that political air that he breathed (after the 6 January Capitol riots).\n\n\"The order was to keep Trump off the air.

Ruehl: Trump’s Address to Congress Highlights the Absence of Opposition","text":"By John P. Ruehl\n\nAuthor Bio: John P. Ruehl is an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022.\n\nCredit Line: This article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.\n\nDuring his address to Congress on March 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump faced brief heckling from Democratic Representative AI Green and scattered jeers from his colleagues. But the overwhelming response was silence, reflective of the reality that opposition to Trump has sharply weakened, even as his administration pushes sweeping domestic and international policy upheaval.\n\nThe opening weeks of his first term in January 2017 were met with fierce resistance, and not just from combative Democrats. People came together to protest against Trump’s immigration policies and his proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Republican politicians openly defied him amid constant media scrutiny. Clashes with the so-called “deep state” due to intelligence leaks escalated when the FBI publicly confirmed an investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election. These combined tensions defined his first term, culminating in him being temporarily banned from most major social media platforms and leading to widespread condemnation and isolation after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nNow, at the start of his second term, opposition is notably subdued. The Women’s March that drew millions in 2017, becoming “the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history,” according to the New York Times, seems to have “lost its luster” during his second term. The February 5 protest against Trump and Elon Musk’s policies drew a low turnout, mostly confined to liberal enclaves, and the 2025 Oscars—once a stage for political grandstanding—avoided directly critiquing the president. Even Green’s disruption caused dissent within his own party, with 10 Democrats censuring him the next day.\n\nPolitical and institutional fatigue, shifting cultural dynamics, and strategic alignment by corporations, billionaires, politicians, and other public figures have blunted resistance, leaving the Trump administration with fewer obstacles as it pushes forward with its agenda.\n\nOne major factor is the weakness and division within the Democratic Party, preventing grassroots progressives from working with top-level establishment Democrats. After years of Biden attempting to balance the party’s competing factions, tensions rose significantly following his response to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. Trump’s victory a year later—securing both the electoral college and popular vote—has only deepened these fractures, fueling a blame game that contrasts with the unity following Trump’s narrower 2016 election victory.\n\nThe party’s electoral failures are compounded by the absence of a unifying figure. Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker, and while Chuck Schumer is the Senate minority leader, both of them are old and unpopular. Bernie Sanders, who is in his 80s, represents a sidelined progressive movement that has struggled to elevate new, dynamic leaders due to years of suppression by establishment Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has failed to offer new solutions, only deepening apathy and fatigue.\n\nWithout organizational cohesion and the ability to inspire its base, the Democratic Party has been unable to marshal its diverse coalition against Trump’s agenda. The issue that has mobilized progressives in large numbers in recent years is Palestine, which establishment Democrats are reluctant to support, including the recent arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil. Losing young male voters has further weakened the party’s ability to generate active dissent.\n\nIts association with progressive identity politics has meanwhile alienated broader segments of the electorate, with Biden having failed to address glaring economic issues and matters like crime and immigration during his presidency.\n\nOn the Republican side, dissenting voices like Mitt Romney and the late John McCain are gone, and those who still might challenge Trump within the party fear backlash and isolation. “Never Trump” conservative groups have struggled to pull voters away, while Trump’s systemic dismantling of government bureaucracy (historically staffed with left-leaning officials) and the appointment of loyalists to key positions have cemented his control over the government and prevented institutional attempts to undermine him.\n\nWith Republican control over all three branches of government, a conservative-majority Supreme Court, and Trump loyalists installed across federal agencies, his power—though often overstated—far surpasses that of his first term. Executive orders, constrained by previous presidents, are now being deployed at an unprecedented rate. His administration’s ambitious federal restructuring efforts, tied to the Project 2025 framework, go beyond the government overhauls of Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission or Bill Clinton’s bipartisan National Performance Review. Yet, Democratic disarray has left these efforts largely unchecked.\n\nTrump’s progress also hinges on the support of the ultrawealthy. The Democratic Party is experiencing a funding shortfall, not just from grassroots donors but from major oligarchs as well. Meanwhile, Trump has secured broader public backing from America’s corporate elite. Years of frustration with Democrats and the political left over issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, taxation, and regulationshave pushed many business leaders toward his camp.\n\nThis repositioning was on full display at Trump’s inauguration, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more wealthy individuals were given front-row seats. Google’s decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” a Trump executive order, signals the larger realignment across corporate America.\n\nNo billionaire has played a more consequential role than Elon Musk. Though his relationship with Trump was rocky just a few years ago, Musk’s endorsement of Trump in July 2024 cemented a powerful alliance between them. Musk’s control of X (formerly Twitter) not only reintroduced Trump to the media platform but also helped normalize his return to other social media networks. Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to maintain their online presence amid declining engagement and financial strain.\n\nThis realignment has extended into the corporate media landscape. The aggressive anti-Trump narratives that dominated his first term have softened, driven by audience backlash against media institutions and wider progressive messaging. With traditional media outlets facing declining viewership, and the growing influence of oligarchic forces now backing Trump, the media’s pivot is as much about survival as it is about political recalibration.\n\nSigns of this emerged even before the election. Jeff Bezos, who has owned the Washington Post since 2013, withdrew the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, as did billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times. CNN, under new leadership since 2023, has steadily adopted a more centrist tone, shedding high-profile anti-Trump figures like Don Lemon. MSNBC is undergoing an even more dramatic transformation, with outspoken Trump critics like Joy Reid and Alex Wagner losing their primetime slots in February 2025, while there has been scaling back of influence of others like Rachel Maddow in favor of less combative voices.\n\nEmboldened by a changing media environment, Trump is increasingly punishing outlets. The Associated Press was banned from presidential events in February after declining to adopt the “Gulf of America” name. CBS remains embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an edited interview with Kamala Harris, with Musk declaring that CBS reporters “deserve a long prison sentence.”\n\nMeanwhile, Disney-ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million and recently replaced a transgender character from a new series with a Christian one. Meta, too, in January 2025, settled for $25 million for banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram after January 6. While these are small fines for corporate giants, they symbolize an increasing subservience to Trump, with both payments directed toward funding Trump’s presidential library.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that Trump appears so powerful at this moment. Political opposition is fractured, leaving no effective barriers to Trump’s agenda. Many oligarchs have given him their quiet or public approval, as seen during his inauguration. The media’s softened stance has shaped a perception of reduced conflict. The absence of strong opposition has created new momentum as political, corporate, and media institutions adapt to this shifting power balance instead of fighting it, reducing the public’s appetite for resistance as well. For now, Trump is riding high after his election victory.\n\nBut cracks are beginning to show. Public resistance to Musk’s influence is growing, and the economic turbulence triggered by Trump’s policies is stirring unease. Without a strong and combative adversary, Trump and his most ardent supporters may find themselves without a rallying cause. International stability could further test his power, and the reality of governance may prove far more challenging than dismantling what came before.\n\nIs this already the peak of Trump’s power, or can it be sustained? Opposition to Trump fluctuated during his first term, yet today, the political, business, and culturallandscapes have adjusted in his favor. His greatest advantage, however, may be the quiet acquiescence of elites from various backgrounds. While some may oppose him openly, many are content to let events play out due to self-interest or inertia.","summary":"The relentless resistance that defined Trump’s first term has faded into an unsettling quiet.

Just one House Republican, the conservative Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, voted against it. And just one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, who represents a district President Donald Trump carried in Maine, voted for it.\n\nThe outcome is a victory for GOP leaders and the White House, who do not want to see a shutdown in the first two months of the new administration and are eager to move on to advancing Trump’s agenda on the border, taxes and other policy areas. \n\nOver the past several days, Trump and his top aides called undecided Republicans to urge them to back the funding bill, multiple sources familiar with the calls told NBC News. And ahead of the vote Tuesday morning, Vice President JD Vance huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol to rally support.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., one of the Republicans who were on the fence, voted for the bill after she said she visited the White House earlier in the day.\n\nBut the drama is far from over. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has made clear he’s firmly against the funding bill. That means at least eight Democratic senators would have to support it to cross the Senate’s 60-vote threshold and send it to Trump’s desk. \n\nHouse Democratic leaders were staunchly against the bill. They blasted Republicans for drafting the bill on a partisan basis and argued they gave the Trump administration too much discretion in how to spend certain pots of money. \n\nSenate Democratic leaders, however, have stayed mum. After an unusually long Senate Democratic lunch meeting on Tuesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to state his position on the bill, a sign that his members lack consensus on the path forward.\n\nPublicly, many Senate Democrats said they wanted to see how the House voted first before weighing in. But Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he would vote for the bill.\n\n“I refuse to burn the village down and to claim to save it,” Fetterman said. “I probably won’t agree with many facets of that CR, but when the choice is about shutting the government down, I don’t want to be involved with that.”\n\nMassie fallout: Trump’s patience appears to be running thin with Massie, who also voted against the House GOP’s budget resolution last month. Trump said on Truth Social he would “lead the charge” to find a primary opponent to challenge him next year.\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nThe Education Department is preparing to lay off roughly half its workforce.The U.S. will immediately lift a pause on intelligence sharing and resume providing security assistance to Ukraine after delegates from Kyiv agreed to accept the Trump administration’s proposal for an interim 30-day ceasefire with Russia.Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he had agreed to suspend a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the U.S. after conversing with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in the wake of Trump’s threats to hike steel and aluminum tariffs on the nation by 50%.Tesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect, hours after he said on Truth Social that he planned to buy a Tesla to demonstrate his support for Elon Musk and for the slumping car company. The U.S. Agency for International Development is instructing its staff in Washington to shred and burn documents, according to an email obtained by NBC News. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said that she had stripped security clearances of dozens of former Biden officials and attorneys involved in Trump-related cases.\n\nThe voter trends shaping the first big battleground state race of 2025\n\nBy Steve Kornacki\n\nIn three weeks, we’ll get our first battleground state readout of the post-2024 political landscape. \n\nWisconsin’s election on April 1 for a seat on the state Supreme Court is nonpartisan in name only. Prominent Republican donors and activists are squarely behind conservative Brad Schimel, while Democrats are with liberal Susan Crawford. \n\nTurnout will be far lower than in November, and the electorate figures to be skewed toward voters who are more politically engaged and partisan, making this an imperfect test. But the outcome will at least offer clues about how the political winds might be shifting in what is arguably America’s premier swing state. \n\nThere are a few key patterns and trends that enabled President Donald Trump to flip the state in November that will be under the microscope next month. \n\nWhere Republicans made gains\n\nEight of the 10 counties where Trump improved his performance the most from the 2020 elections are in the southwestern part of the state, in what is called the “Driftless Area” (a nod to the unique topography that resulted from the lack of glacial coverage more than 10,000 years ago).\n\nPolitically, it represents a significant growth opportunity for the GOP, having remained loyal to Democrats until more recently than other small towns and rural parts of the state. It was Trump’s emergence in 2016 that triggered the area’s movement toward the GOP.\n\nDoes this represent a partisan realignment that is ongoing and that will allow Republicans to build an even bigger advantage here going forward? Or is it more tentative and Trump-specific, offering Democrats a chance to stabilize and improve their performance without Trump on the ballot? Notably, the area did return to its Democratic roots in recent state Supreme Court races. \n\nWhere Democrats are in growth mode\n\nThe “WOW” counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha outside of Milwaukee have historically been the biggest vote bank in the state for Republican candidates, and all favored Trump by double digits last year. But the GOP’s advantage has been receding.\n\nThe GOP’s declines here match the national trend of the last generation or so of highly educated, professional-class, white suburbanites shedding their previous Republican allegiance — which accelerated drastically with Trump’s emergence. \n\nEven while losing ground statewide, Democrats modestly improved their performance in the WOW counties last November. In Ozaukee and Waukesha, Harris won a higher share of the vote than any Democratic presidential nominee there since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. \n\nThat the Democratic gains have been particularly stark in Ozaukee is no surprise. Outside of Dane County (home of the University of Wisconsin-Madison), it has the highest concentration of white, college-educated voters in the state.\n\nLast November, Democrats were banking on even bigger gains in the WOW counties, which could have pushed Harris over the top statewide. Still, Democrats see an opportunity to make further strides here and to cement them, with Republicans hoping to arrest their slide without Trump at the top of their ticket. \n\nThat’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was due to meet his Russian counterpart in the coming days and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff plans to visit Moscow this week to meet Putin.On Tuesday, Trump said he hoped for a swift ceasefire and thought he would talk to Putin this week. \"I hope it'll be over the next few days,\" he told reporters at a White House event to promote his close adviser Elon Musk's Tesla car company.The U.S.-Ukraine agreement was a sharp turnaround from an acrimonious White House meeting on February 28 between the new Republican U.S. president, who has long been a Ukraine aid skeptic, and Zelenskiy.In Tuesday's joint statement, the two countries said they agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources, which had been in the works and was thrown into limbo by that meeting.Following that encounter, the United States cut off intelligence sharing and weapons shipments to Ukraine, underlining Trump's willingness to pressure a U.S. ally as he pivots to a more conciliatory approach to Moscow.Trump said on Tuesday he would invite Zelenskiy back to the White House.Ukrainian officials said late on Tuesday that both U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing had resumed.EUROPEAN PARTNERSA top aide to Zelenskiy said options for security guarantees to Ukraine were discussed with U.S. officials. Security guarantees have been one of Kyiv's key aims, and some European countries have expressed willingness to explore sending peacekeepers.In the joint statement, Ukraine reiterated that European partners should be involved in the peace process. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will be at the White House on Thursday.\"It seems like the Americans and Ukrainians have taken an important step towards peace.
