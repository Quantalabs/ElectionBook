He's done a phenomenal job. He's taken Israel through a period of trauma. Israel, with other people, might not exist right now if you wanna know the truth...that's a pretty big statement, but I feel that. If you had the wrong prime minister, Israel would not exist today,\" the US President told the press before stepping inside his resort with Netanyahu.\"There were met with a force the likes of which very few countries could have handled. We were met with a force and we were very victorious, to put it mildly,\" Trump continued, adding, \"now I hear Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we are gonna have to knock 'em down. We'll knock the hell outta them.\"Trump also told reporters that it is essential for Hamas to disarm in order to move ahead with the second phase of his peace plan.He also hoped that the Israeli PM will 'get along' with Syria, which is now under the leadership of Ahmed al-Sharaa.“We made a lot of progress already. We had about a five-minute meeting, and we’ve already settled about three of the difficulties,” CNN reported Trump as saying right before the press was ushered out and the meeting began.Trump's ‘pardon’ claims denied by Israel PresidentTrump, on Monday, once again voiced his support for the pardon request of Netanyahu, and claimed that the Israel President has told him that a pardon for the PM is “on its way.”However, the office of Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel, said in a statement, “There has been no conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted.” adding that a few weeks ago, “Herzog spoke with a Trump representative who inquired about the request and received an explanation of the process and that any decision would follow standard procedures,\" as per a CNN report.Trump's meeting with the Israeli PM comes hours after his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he discussed the current situation in Ukraine.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/donald-trump-hosts-benjamin-netanyahu-at-mar-a-lago-to-discuss-gaza-situation-11767034153766.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/29/1600x900/US-ISRAEL-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY-TRUMP-NETANYAHU-22_1767034310197_1767034323788.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30

Speaking with JIS News, Portfolio Minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, said that fogging is a “safe method” for getting rid of mosquitoes that transmit dengue and other viruses.\n\nHe noted that over the years, the insecticides used have “improved significantly” and “are a lot more environmentally friendly”.\n\n“It is not going to kill anyone or harm anyone, and it does get rid of the nuisance or the health risk of the mosquito. So, I would encourage persons to have the foggers do what they have to do,” he said.\n\n“We encourage persons who may have an allergy or an allergic reaction to avoid being overly exposed to the mist… or apply a [damp] cloth over the nose until the mist dissipates. But it is a safe method,” the minister assured.\n\nMedical Entomologist and National Programme Manager for Vector Control in the Ministry, Sherine Huntley Jones, told JIS News that the chemicals being used for fogging are certified and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nShe assured that they are being used as directed by the manufacturers, so there is no need to fear any adverse health effects.\n\nHuntley Jones noted that there has been an increase in fogging activities post Hurricane Melissa.\n\n“The ministry is on high alert for increased transmission in mosquito-borne diseases and has enhanced its mosquito control programme, which includes expansion of our fogging schedule as well as our larvicidal schedule,” she said, noting that operations will decrease over time “as we become satisfied that we are not going to see an increase or have an outbreak”.\n\nWhere individuals experience any difficulty with the process, they are advised to contact the health department in their parish.\n\n“We want to assure the public that the chemicals are safe and the activity of fogging is necessary at this time to mitigate… the impact of the hurricane and a possible increase in the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases,” Huntley Jones said.\n\nMeanwhile, she is encouraging members of the public to do their part in controlling mosquito breeding in and around their homes.\n\n“This is by taking the time to search their yards and their environment for any containers or anything that can hold water that might increase mosquito breeding because the more the public does, the less the ministry will have to do. If we all begin to take action, then we can together and collectively see a reduction in the mosquito population and reduce that risk of an outbreak,” she pointed out.\n\nThe WHO advises that the amount of insecticide used during fogging is very small and dispersed at quantities that are only effective at killing small insects like mosquitoes. At these low concentrations, there are no expected adverse health effects on people who are occasionally exposed to the fog.\n\nThe organisation recommends an integrated vector management (IVM) approach for mosquito control, focusing on proven methods like Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs), Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), and using United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered repellents (DEET, Picaridin), alongside environmental management (removing standing water) to prevent breeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: fogging Health mosquito \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ex-heavyweight champion ‘stable’ following fatal Nigeria crash \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n SAGAMU, Nigeria (AFP) — Former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was in a \"stable condition\" in hospital after a car accident in Nigeri... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $159.92 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, December 29, ended trading at $159.92, up two cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s d... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Women entrepreneurs in Hanover receive over $630,000 in recovery support \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n HANOVER, Jamaica — In a powerful moment of community healing and empowerment, the Youth for Development Network (YFDN), in partnership with the Think... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man found dead at crash scene was murdered \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Information has now indicated that, contrary to earlier information which suggested that Christopher Clarke died from injuries sus... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ladies shine at Pic-Nic Festival at UWI Mona Bowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINSTON, Jamaica — Style, colour and confidence were on full display as patrons turned out in their numbers for the Pic-Nic Festival, held on Saturday... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US hit docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump said Monday the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Small Business Association calls for OUR and JPS to reconsider 7% bill increase \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) President, Garnett Reid, is appealing to the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(Photo by Tonye BAKARE / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nDecember 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Ex-heavyweight champion ‘stable’ following fatal Nigeria crash \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAGAMU, Nigeria (AFP) — Former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was in a “stable condition” in hospital after a car accident in Nigeria that killed two close friends and associates, his promoter announced on Monday.\n\nMatchroom confirmed police and media reports that he was involved in the smash, which happened on Monday morning on a main road linking Lagos and Ibadan in the southwest of the country.\n\nPictures circulating online showed a shirtless Joshua — a British national of Nigerian heritage — surrounded by what appeared to be broken window glass on the seats around him.\n\nHis promoter said the boxer’s “close friends and team members” Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele were killed and Joshua himself was taken to hospital “for checks and treatment”.\n\n“He is in a stable condition and will remain there for observation,” a statement read.\n\n“Our deepest condolences and prayers are with the families and friends of all those affected –- and we ask that their privacy is respected at this incredibly difficult time.”\n\nPolice in Ogun state, just north of Lagos, said the circumstances around the wreck were “currently being investigated”.\n\nLagos, Nigeria’s bustling economic capital, throngs with visitors from across the country and diaspora each December.\n\nPolice said the accident occurred around 11:00 am local time (1000 GMT) in the town of Makun, along the Lagos–Ibadan Expressway.\n\nNigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said the Lexus Joshua was in “was suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor, lost control during an overtaking manoeuvre and crashed into a stationary truck… by the side of the road”.\n\nHowever, a witness who gave his name as Kunle told AFP: “The truck was not stationary when the accident happened.”\n\n“People rushed to help without even knowing those inside the car,” the 27-year-old said. “It was when we got there we realised it was Anthony Joshua that’s inside.”\n\nThe FRSC said that Joshua’s car was towed to the police station in nearby Sagamu.\n\nJoshua’s family hails from the southwest Nigerian city and he is known to visit there when he is in the country.\n\nPhotos released by the FRSC showed a totalled black SUV, and what appeared to be blood on the road.\n\nAn AFP reporter on the scene Monday evening saw the 18-wheeler truck that Joshua’s car was said to have hit being towed off the highway.\n\n– ‘More important than boxing’ –\n\nPolice said the two victims died “at the scene”.\n\nSharing a photo of himself with Joshua on social media, President Bola Tinubu wrote: “As a sportsman, you have always shown courage, discipline, and unwavering love for our country.”\n\nPresident Tinubu later said on X that he had spoken with “AJ” and the boxer’s mother.\n\n“(State) Governor Dapo Abiodun, who was at the hospital with them, assured me he will do everything possible to ensure AJ receives the best attention,” Tinubu added.\n\nEarlier this month, Joshua knocked out YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a Netflix-backed bout in Miami.\n\n“Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today’s unfortunate accident,” Paul said Monday on X.\n\nThe former Olympic champion Joshua has since been linked with a fight against compatriot and fellow former world champion Tyson Fury.\n\nJoshua’s last fight before the match with Paul was a fifth round knockout loss to fellow Briton Daniel Dubois in September last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Anthony Joshua Boxing Crash \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police on the scene of double murder in Falmouth \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n TRELAWNY, Jamaica — The Trelawny police are currently on the scene of a double murder on Wellington Street in Falmouth.

These packages provided immediate relief while reinforcing the broader goal of community recovery and stability.\n\n“This is more than a handover. It’s a hand-up,” said André Wilson, founder & executive director of YFDN. “By supporting women-led businesses and responding to urgent family needs, we are helping entire communities recover—economically and emotionally.”\n\nThe “Gifts That Give Back” initiative is designed to generate double impact: women founders receive income and inventory support to restart their businesses, while vulnerable families receive essential goods and services directly from these same entrepreneurs.\n\nThe initiative aligns with YFDN’s VOW (Valuing Our Women) programme, which centres women’s economic empowerment as a pathway to community resilience. The activity was supported by The Syensqo Fund, the Hanover Chamber of Commerce, and community partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: entrepreneurship Hurricane Melissa Women \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man found dead at crash scene was murdered \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Information has now indicated that, contrary to earlier information which suggested that Christopher Clarke died from injuries sus... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ladies shine at Pic-Nic Festival at UWI Mona Bowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINSTON, Jamaica — Style, colour and confidence were on full display as patrons turned out in their numbers for the Pic-Nic Festival, held on Saturday... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US hit docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump said Monday the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Small Business Association calls for OUR and JPS to reconsider 7% bill increase \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) President, Garnett Reid, is appealing to the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Bess family gets fresh start with new home just before Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — After witnessing Hurricane Melissa destroy her home, leaving her family homeless for weeks, single mother Novia Russell receiv... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Racing United seek to extend lead in JPL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Leaders Racing United will be going after a second win this season over former champions Arnett Gardens when they meet at the Anth... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TCL donates 100 televisions to communities in western Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—In response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, global technology brand TCL has donated 100 \"43” televisions ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police shoot patient after stabbing incident at Kingston Public Hospital \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A male patient was shot and injured by police on Monday at the Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) after he allegedly attacked cops who... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

He was subsequently taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nHowever subsequently, according to an officer familiar with the investigation, Clarke was actually stabbed prior to his death.\n\n“We are treating this as a homicide,” the officer said.\n\nClarke, it is being reported, had been stabbed by an unknown assailant and was in the process of driving himself to the hospital when the vehicle collided with the utility pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Crash murder Police \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ladies shine at Pic-Nic Festival at UWI Mona Bowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINSTON, Jamaica — Style, colour and confidence were on full display as patrons turned out in their numbers for the Pic-Nic Festival, held on Saturday... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US hit docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump said Monday the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Small Business Association calls for OUR and JPS to reconsider 7% bill increase \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) President, Garnett Reid, is appealing to the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Bess family gets fresh start with new home just before Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — After witnessing Hurricane Melissa destroy her home, leaving her family homeless for weeks, single mother Novia Russell receiv... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Racing United seek to extend lead in JPL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Leaders Racing United will be going after a second win this season over former champions Arnett Gardens when they meet at the Anth... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TCL donates 100 televisions to communities in western Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—In response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, global technology brand TCL has donated 100 \"43” televisions ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police shoot patient after stabbing incident at Kingston Public Hospital \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A male patient was shot and injured by police on Monday at the Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) after he allegedly attacked cops who... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

One U.S. official said a potential plan might be to offer cash incentives in exchange for weapons, echoing a “buyback” program Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff has previously floated.\n\nThe troubled opening months of the multi-staged ceasefire have stoked fears that regional fighting could resume in the new year. Arab and Muslim partners have voiced concerns about continuing Israeli military strikes in the war-shattered and now-divided Palestinian enclave, as well as in Lebanon and Syria.\n\nTrump has been highly supportive of Israel even as it faced censure elsewhere over the carnage in Gaza. But the president has shown impatience with questions of when and how his Gaza plan can move to the reconstruction and reconciliation stages, known as Phase 2.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with Netanyahu on Monday. Earlier this month, Rubio told reporters the next step in the peace process should be naming a “Board of Peace” — identifying a group of technocrats who would run Gaza — and a move that would allow for a cohort of foreign troops to create an International Stabilization Force to provide security.\n\nIsrael says it’s fending off fresh threats by armed Islamist groups. Chief among these is Hamas, which triggered the two-year conflict in the Gaza Strip and agreed to the truce and a full hostage release — but not to surrender weapons as demanded by Trump’s internationally endorsed 20-point peace plan. The group has said it might be willing to integrate into the military of a future Palestinian state.\n\nIn Lebanon, Israel has been hitting Hezbollah and accusing the Beirut government of lagging in its promise to prevent the militia from rearming and regrouping at the border.\n\nYet Israeli and U.S. officials privately acknowledge arguing over whether Israel should withdraw troops and tanks from parts of the 53% of the territory it still holds, and hand them over to the ISF, even as Hamas remains armed and defiant in the rest.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether the ISF would be willing and able to confront Hamas, which is branded a terrorist group in the West.\n\nTrump on Monday also said the parents of the last remaining Israeli hostage taken by Hamas were at Mar-a-Lago, highlighting one of the key lingering issues.\n\nHamas has blamed technical difficulties for the failure to return the body of the last of the some 250 people it seized during the Oct. 7, 2023 shock invasion of southern Israel, while Israel accuses it of playing for time.\n\nSince the U.S.-backed ceasefire took effect in October, periodic Israeli strikes and operations in Gaza have continued, although large-scale combat has largely come to an end. Israel has said its sporadic strikes were caused by Hamas violations of the truce. The Palestinian group has accused Israel of undermining the ceasefire deal and limiting aid into the enclave.\n\nTrump said the reconstruction of Gaza would begin soon.\n\n“We’re going to straighten it out. We’re already starting certain things,” he said, without providing further details.\n\nTrump also reiterated his threats against Iran, saying that he had heard Tehran was “building up again” after the U.S. — aided by Israel — earlier this year struck nuclear targets in the country.\n\n“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,” Trump said. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening.”\n\nWhen Netanyahu took the war to Iran — the sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah — in June, U.S. strategic bombers joined Israel’s air force in the assault on its nuclear facilities.\n\nTrump also renewed his call on Israeli President Isaac Herzog to grant Netanyahu, who is in the midst of a corruption trial, a pardon.\n\nNetanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favors with wealthy political supporters.\n\nTrump has previously written to Herzog to urge a pardon and advocated for one during his October speech before the Knesset. He said Monday that Herzog has told him “it’s on its way” without offering further details.\n\n“He’s a wartime prime minister who’s a hero. How do you not give a pardon?” Trump said.\n\nHerzog’s office said in a statement that the Israeli president and Trump have not spoken since the pardon request was submitted, but that Herzog has spoken with a Trump representative about the U.S. president’s letter advocating for Netanyahu’s pardon.\n\n“During that conversation, an explanation was provided regarding the stage of the process in which the request currently stands, and that any decision on the matter will be made in accordance with the established procedures,” the Israeli president’s office said.","summary":"President Donald Trump said “there has to be a disarming of Hamas” as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a crucial meeting as the U.S. looks to shore up the ceasefire in Gaza and move to phase two of the plan.

The murder of Arlington Heights native and conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September made headlines and stirred emotions across the nation.\n\nHere is a chronological look at some local losses:\n\nJan. 28: Comedian Ken Flores, a former Aurora resident, died at age 28 of congestive heart failure. A 2014 graduate of East Aurora High School, the Los Angeles-based entertainer had embarked on his “Butterfly Effect” national tour several weeks before he died.\n\nVirginia McCaskey\n\nFeb. 6: The owner and matriarch of the Chicago Bears, McCaskey died at the age of 102. The daughter of team founder, coach and NFL legend George S. Halas, she had been the principal owner of the team since his death on Oct. 31, 1983. A longtime Des Plaines resident, McCaskey had turned over daily operations to her sons but remained on the organization’s board of directors until her death.\n\nDan McCormick\n\nFeb. 15: Dan McCormick, 90, a career public servant and former Libertyville police chief, died surrounded by family. He served as a Lake County sheriff's deputy for about 10 years before joining the Libertyville police department in the late 1960s, rising through the ranks and retiring as chief in 1996.\n\nCraig Podolski\n\nMarch 2: Craig Podolski, 45, an eighth-grade teacher at Aptakisic Junior High School in Buffalo Grove, died from a cardiac event. The Lake Zurich resident known as “Mr. Podo” was remembered for his humor, smile and dedication to family, students and the community.\n\nBill Murphy\n\nMarch 30: Murphy served as Woodridge’s mayor from 1981 to 2013, an era that saw the development of Seven Bridges and much of the town itself. “I think (it is) because of Bill that Woodridge is who we are and where we are today,” Mayor Gina Cunningham said upon his passing at 81 years old. Murphy also was a longtime educator in Woodridge School District 68.\n\nCorsello brothers\n\nMarch 30: Twins Kayden and Jayden Corsello, age 2, and their brother Xander, 1, died as a result of a fire at a house in Carpentersville.\n\nGeorge Ryan\n\nMay 2: Disgraced by a corruption scandal that put him in prison and overshadowed a tenure that included clearing the state’s death row, Ryan died at his home in Kankakee. He was 91. A small-town pharmacist whose political career began when he was appointed to fill a vacant county board seat, he rose to serve speaker of the Illinois House, lieutenant governor, secretary of state and, finally, governor. He was convicted of corruption charges related to accusations he used government offices to reward friends and win elections, and was sentenced to 6½ years in federal prison.\n\nJosé Torres\n\nMay 2: José Torres, a nearly 40-year educator and former Elgin Area School District U-46 superintendent, died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after a brief illness, according to sources. He was 65. Torres headed the state’s second-largest school district — at the time serving about 40,000 students — for six years starting in 2008. In 2014, Torres left U-46 to become president of Aurora-based Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy.\n\nColin McRae\n\nMay 8: Former Mundelein Mayor Colin McRae, 81, died at a medical facility in Lindenhurst surrounded by family. McRae, who also served on the Lake County Board and as president of the Lake County Forest Preserve District board, was a resident of Grayslake and Florida in recent years\n\nLorrie Murphy\n\nJune 6: Lorrie Murphy, 63, Elk Grove Village’s clerk and Mayor Craig Johnson’s executive assistant, died after a long illness. Murphy, who called the roll at meetings, kept official records and helped coordinate local elections, had been clerk since 2017, and was hired by the village in 2005.\n\nBrian Wilson\n\nJune 11: Brian Wilson, 82, legendary Beach Boys leader and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, died in Beverly Hills, California. In the late 1990s, Wilson and his wife, Melinda, lived in a five-bedroom house with a custom-built basement recording studio purchased in St. Charles in 1997. He recorded much of his 1998 solo album, “Imagination,” in the recording studio of the $1.4 million Crane Road Estates home.\n\nRosemary Argus\n\nJune 18: Rosemary S. Argus, 88, was a Des Plaines City Council and Mount Prospect Park District board member. The Rosemary S. Argus Friendship Park Conservatory in Des Plaines bears her name. Argus served on the parks board from 1974 to 2001. She represented the 8th Ward on the city council from 2001 to 2011. Starting in the 1990s, Argus led the Des Plaines Community Foundation.\n\nDennis Kelly\n\nJune 27: Barrington Hills community leader Dennis Kelly was remembered as a nature lover and advocate for small businesses. A longtime member of both the Barrington Hills Park District board and the Barrington Area Chamber of Commerce, the 76-year-old Kelly died at home after a battle with cancer.\n\nBob Vinnedge\n\nJuly 25: Bob Vinnedge, 80, of Hoffman Estates was a longtime Schaumburg Township official and historical society president. The Ohio native had worked for Underwriters Laboratories before his retirement. Upon moving to Elk Grove Village, he became involved with Schaumburg Township and several of its civic groups, including the Schaumburg Township Republican Organization.\n\nThomas Rivera\n\nJuly 30: Thomas Rivera, 91, led the Greater Woodfield Convention and Visitors Bureau for more than two decades after founding it in 1983. H was remembered for his influence and impact across the region and state. He considered the 2006 opening of the Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel his greatest achievement.\n\nJames Lovell\n\nAug. 7: Lovell, the Apollo 13 commander who helped turn a failed moon mission into a triumph of on-the-fly can-do engineering, has died at 97 in his Lake Forest home. He flew four space missions in all — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — but it was the latter for which he was best known, made famous for a new generation by the 1995 film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell. The Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago is named in his honor.\n\nMike Alagna\n\nAug. 23: Mike Alagna, 80, of Hoffman Estates was the longtime chief operating officer of Nation Pizza and Foods in Schaumburg. Alagna was a dedicated member of the Schaumburg Business Association and an architect of Harper College’s Advanced Manufacturing program and its Harper Promise scholarship program with Palatine-Schaumburg High School District 211.\n\nRoger Minale\n\nAug. 26: Roger Minale, 82, a longtime Rosemont village trustee, died of a heart attack just moments after attending a ribbon cutting in town. He was elected to the village board in 2009.\n\nSept. 9: Al Carius, 83, the retired North Central College men’s track and field and cross country coach, died after a long bout with cancer. “Run for Fun and Personal Bests” was the title of a book the Naperville resident published in 2021, as well as his mantra to athletes he coached from 1966 to 2020 as the Cardinals head coach. His cross country teams won 19 NCAA Division III national titles and were runner-up 16 times, to go with 12 national track championships. He was named “coach of the century” in 2000 by his peers.\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\nSept. 10: Political activist, media personality and author Charlie Kirk was fatally shot by an assassin during an appearance at Utah Valley University. The Turning Point USA founder and Wheeling High School alumni inspired strong opinions for his conservative views. Kirk, 31, rose from a teenage activist to a top podcaster and ally of President Donald Trump. Memorial gatherings were held throughout the suburbs in the days after his murder.\n\nSept. 14: Former Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar, a moderate Republican who led the state from 1991 to 1999, died in a Springfield hospital from complications of his treatment for pancreatic cancer. He was 79. In a state with a long legacy of political strife and corruption, Edgar was remembered by Republicans and Democrats alike for his decency and bipartisanship. Edgar was elected to the Illinois House in 1976 and was reelected two years later before being named legislative director for former Gov. Jim Thompson. Edgar served as Illinois secretary of state for a decade before becoming governor.\n\nDale Berman\n\nOct. 2: Kane County Board member Dale Berman died at age 91. He was in his second term. He also served several terms as North Aurora president and trustee, and in the 1990s was on the Fox Valley Park District board, including a stint as president.\n\nOct. 13: Longtime Arlington Heights resident Ed Murnane, who died at age 81, worked on President Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign, was a public affairs director for the Regional Transportation Authority and was executive director of the Illinois campaign to elect George H.W. Bush president. In 1992, Bush appointed Murnane as a deputy assistant and director of presidential advance.\n\nBeverly Sussman\n\nDec. 6: Former Buffalo Grove Village President Beverly Sussman served nearly two decades on the village board. Before she entered politics, Sussman taught middle school science for more than 25 years. Sussman served the village for nearly 30 years, first on the Rick Kahen Commission for Residents with Disabilities, then as a 10-year village trustee and finally as village president, an office she held for two terms before retiring in 2023.\n\nJeff Thorne\n\nDec. 10: Thorne led the North Central College Cardinals to the 2019 NCAA Division III national championship. It was the Naperville school’s first national title and cemented the program as a national power. Diagnosed on Feb. 4 with Stage 4 gastric cancer, Thorne, 53, of Naperville, died Dec. 10.\n\n• Daily Herald staff writers Russell Lissau, Dave Oberhelman, Eric Peterson, Christopher Placek, Susan Sarkauskas, Katlyn Smith, Barbara Vitello and Mick Zawislak and Daily Herald wire services contributed to this report.","summary":"As we close out 2025, we remember those we lost this year in the suburbs.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20251229/news/those-we-lost-local-leaders-former-governors-and-a-conservative-activist-among-notable-deaths-of-2/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=0a28ebee-b9bd-539d-9e94-3a1d3ec58c6f&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:56:48","author":"Madhu Krishnamurthy","authors":["Madhu Krishnamurthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.287},{"id":389954640,"title":"Trump says Netanyahu pardon is \"on its way\", Israeli President's office denies claim","text":"Florida [US], December 30 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Monday said a pardon for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an ongoing corruption case is \"on its way,\" claiming that Israeli President Isaac Herzog had conveyed this to him, even as Herzog's office later denied any such remarks.Speaking to the press at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida during a joint appearance with Netanyahu, Trump strongly backed the Israeli leader. \"How do you not give a pardon?

He is facing three separate corruption cases filed in 2019, alleging bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He has consistently denied the charges.

He also spoke with Vladimir Putin twice over the phone.\n\nBut the president couldn’t point to solutions that he’d been able to iron out with any of the involved parties as the two days came to a close, and on Monday, his frustration was evident as he spoke to Netanyahu at a luncheon, which featured a brief press availability. The moment occurred as reporters were still walking into the room and getting set up for what’s known as a “pool spray”, where Trump briefly made remarks to the press.\n\n\"Do I get credit for it? No,” Trump complained as the audio kicked on mid-sentence into the president’s rant about one conflict. “I did eight of them.” He can be heard beginning another sentence, griping about the Nobel Peace Prize being won by a Venezuelan opposition figure: “They gave the Nob[el]...”\n\nAs he eyed reporters entering the room, the volume of the president’s voice dropped slightly and he told the Israeli prime minister in the clip: “And then I’ll tell you the rest of it [later].”\n\nThe revealing look into Trump’s hangup on his loss of the Nobel Peace Prize comes just weeks after the announcement of the 2025 prize going to Venezuelan dissident María Corina Machado. Trump’s longtime U.S. political rival, Barack Obama, was awarded the prize in 2009.\n\nOn Monday, Trump used the meeting with Netanyahu to press his often-repeated declaration that he halted as many as eight wars upon becoming president.\n\nCritics say that the total is inflated, however, and exaggerates both the severity of some conflicts as well as Trump and the U.S.’s roles in solving them.\n\nIsrael’s conflict with Iran is one of the eight wars Trump claims to have stopped. The Israeli military and Iran traded barrages on multiple occasions after October 7, 2023, and erupted into broader hostilities in June of this year. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire ended those hostilities, and the U.S. assisted in efforts to destroy Iran’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nHe, along with the leaders of two other countries, nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize as part of the U.S. president’s unsuccessful campaign this year.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister said that he would award his country’s highest cultural honor, the Israel Award, to Trump.\n\nThe president was also awarded a “peace prize” by the president of FIFA, the world soccer federation, after his Nobel bid collapsed.","summary":"Trump’s complaint came as Netanyahu announced he would award president with his country’s highest cultural honor, the Israel Award","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-netanyahu-peace-prize-wars-b2891850.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/29/23/44/GettyImages-2253961501.jpg?crop=1024,682.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zDozFj5k-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:34:18","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":389949896,"title":"St Bess family gets fresh start with new home just before Christmas","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVM Group Chairman Michael McMorris (centre) cuts the ribbon to officially hand over a new two-bedroom home to Myersville, St Elizabeth resident Novia Russell (right) and her children Javon, Danique and Zaliyah.

My children now have a safe place, and for that I am deeply grateful to VM and Food for the Poor, and I hope God continues to bless you so you can bless another family like me,” said Russell at the handover ceremony of the house on December 23.\n\nRussel, who is from Myersville, St Elizabeth, was left homeless after the Category 5 storm delivered a punishing blow to the south-western end of Jamaica on October 28.\n\nThe mother of three, who is also the guardian of a young niece and her elderly mother, shared that prior to the storm, her house was not in the best condition and noted that the new house will provide a safe space for her to care for her family.\n\nDelivering his address at the handover ceremony, Michael McMorris, chairman of VM Group, said the initiative reflects the company’s commitment to stand with communities during times of crisis.\n\n“As a board, we felt compelled to act, and this home symbolises our commitment to ensuring that no family is left behind during moments of national hardship. This initiative allows us to get up close and personal with our purpose. We see this house as the start of a home, and we know that you and your family will make it a true home, one that becomes the foundation for so much more,” said McMorris.\n\nHis sentiment was echoed by VM Group’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Courtney Campbell, who emphasised that the project goes beyond charity.\n\n“VM was built on the principle of people helping people. In moments like these, especially following a natural disaster, our role extends beyond financial services. This home represents safety, security and hope, and it reflects the values that have guided VM for generations,” Campbell said.\n\nIn the meantime, Kivette Silvera, executive director of Food for the Poor, expressed gratitude for the partnership.\n\n“At Food for the Poor, we know we can’t do this work on our own, and that’s why partnerships like this one with VM Group matter so much. We also really wanted to get this home finished before Christmas, and thanks to this partnership, we made it happen,” said Silvera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Christmas home Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police on the scene of double murder in Falmouth \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n TRELAWNY, Jamaica — The Trelawny police are currently on the scene of a double murder on Wellington Street in Falmouth.

After winning just once in their first seven matches, they followed up with a three-game winning streak that put them on course for a top-six finish, only to lose their last two.\n\nThey will hope to avenge their first-round loss to Chapelton Maroons, who are three points and five places below them in the tables and winless in their last eight games.\n\n— Paul A Reid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Arnett Gardens Football JPL Racing United \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ladies shine at Pic-Nic Festival at UWI Mona Bowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINSTON, Jamaica — Style, colour and confidence were on full display as patrons turned out in their numbers for the Pic-Nic Festival, held on Saturday... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US hit docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump said Monday the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Small Business Association calls for OUR and JPS to reconsider 7% bill increase \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) President, Garnett Reid, is appealing to the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Bess family gets fresh start with new home just before Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — After witnessing Hurricane Melissa destroy her home, leaving her family homeless for weeks, single mother Novia Russell receiv... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TCL donates 100 televisions to communities in western Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—In response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, global technology brand TCL has donated 100 \"43” televisions ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police shoot patient after stabbing incident at Kingston Public Hospital \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A male patient was shot and injured by police on Monday at the Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) after he allegedly attacked cops who... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Wanted man killed in St Andrew police operation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A wanted man was shot dead and 18 other persons detained during a police operation at Bottom River on August Town Road, St Andrew,... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

This donation embodies our ‘Tech for Good’ commitment—using our products to address real community needs—and reaffirms our long-term bond with the Caribbean communities we serve,” Cui added.\n\nAcknowledging that electricity restoration remains ongoing in some affected areas, TCL noted that the televisions are intended for use as infrastructure and essential services are progressively restored, ensuring long-term value and sustained impact for the communities served rather than immediate, short-term use.\n\nThe donation forms part of TCL’s ongoing commitment to the communities in which it operates and reflects the brand’s belief that, in moments of crisis, corporate entities have a responsibility to contribute in meaningful ways that support resilience, recovery, and access to essential resources.\n\nThis particular donation is being facilitated with the support of Food For The Poor Jamaica, which continues to play a critical role in coordinating relief and recovery initiatives across the island.\n\n“Recovery after a disaster is not only about rebuilding roofs and walls, but also restoring access to information, education, and shared community spaces,” said Marsha Burrell-Rose, manager of marketing and public relations and missions at Food For The Poor Jamaica.\n\n“This donation from TCL will help support schools, shelters, and community centres as they move from crisis response into long-term recovery, once they are in a position to receive and utilise these resources,” she said.\n\nThe televisions will benefit communities located in the western parishes most heavily impacted by Hurricane Melissa, once conditions allow for their safe and effective use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa TCL televisions \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police on the scene of double murder in Falmouth \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n TRELAWNY, Jamaica — The Trelawny police are currently on the scene of a double murder on Wellington Street in Falmouth.

I think it's the world's great fortune.\"This was the first meeting between Trump and Netanyahu in nearly two months. Trump had earlier visited Israel in October during the period when a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was announced alongside the release of hostages.During the meeting, Trump highlighted his close ties with Netanyahu, calling their relationship great. He said the Israeli prime minister is a \"strong man\" who has made Israel \"stronger than ever,\" while also remarking that Netanyahu \"can be very difficult on occasion.\"Trump also repeated his support for Netanyahu's request for a pardon in an ongoing corruption case. \"How do you not give a pardon? He is a wartime prime minister who is a hero,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"I spoke with President Isaac Herzog. He tells me it is on its way.\"However, President Isaac Herzog's office later contradicted Trump's claim, stating, \"There has been no conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted.\" The statement said Herzog had earlier spoken to a Trump representative who was informed about the legal process and that any decision would follow standard procedures, CNN reported. Trump had first publicly backed Netanyahu's pardon during an address to Israel's Knesset in October, where he dismissed the corruption charges as minor issues involving \"cigars and champagne.\"After the meeting, Netanyahu described the talks as successful, saying he had \"a very, very productive meeting.\" He added, \"We talk about our ideas. Sometimes we have different ideas, but we work it out, and most of the time, we see eye to eye.\"Trump also told reporters that he was satisfied with Israel's role in the Gaza peace plan. \"I'm not concerned about anything that Israel is doing,\" he said. \"They've lived up to the plan. They're strong.\" He added, \"Israel has lived up to the plan, 100 per cent.\"While calling the meeting productive, Trump acknowledged that there were some differences between the two leaders, including on how to deal with settler violence in the occupied West Bank.

Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he was not informed of the military exercise in advance but that he was not worried either, because China has been “doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area.”\n\nTouting his “great relationship” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump suggested he didn't think Xi was going to attack Taiwan.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nTaiwanese army on high alert\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2025/12/30/china-stages-military-drills-around-taiwan-to-warn-external-forces-after-us-japan-tensions","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:16:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.178},{"id":389956110,"title":"Trump presses for peace in high-stakes meetings with Zelenskyy, Netanyahu","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report December 29, 2025 02:21 \n\n Trump presses for peace in high-stakes meetings with Zelenskyy, Netanyahu \n Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on President Donald Trump’s meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on ‘Special Report.’\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTV-VIDEOPERSONALITIESUKRAINEDONALD TRUMP","summary":"Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports on President Donald Trump’s meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on ‘Special Report.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387046722112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3c09f9ac-84dd-4db6-9363-24a1f5582b02/6cc7e4a0-2214-47d0-8506-4f315e7a164a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:15:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":389948248,"title":"US pledges $2 billion for UN humanitarian aid as Trump warns agencies must &#039;adapt or die&#039;","text":"GENEVA — The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump’s administration slashes U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies they must “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities.\n\nThe money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is still a generous amount that will maintain America's status as the world’s largest humanitarian donor.\n\n“This new model will better share the burden of U.N. humanitarian work with other developed countries and will require the U.N. to cut bloat, remove duplication, and commit to powerful new impact, accountability and oversight mechanisms,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media.\n\nThe pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the U.N. that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.\n\nThe $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-coordinated programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8 billion to $10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.\n\n“The piggy bank is not open to organizations that just want to return to the old system,\" Jeremy Lewin, the State Department official in charge of foreign assistance, said at a press conference Monday in Geneva. \"President Trump has made clear that the system is dead.”\n\nThe State Department said “individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.” Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.\n\nA year of crisis in aid\n\nThe move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations, including its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting the agencies to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.\n\nThe U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations — the world’s top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money — takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.\n\nFletcher, who has spent the past year lobbying U.S. officials not to abandon U.N. funding altogether, appeared optimistic at the deal's signing in Geneva.\n\n“It’s a very, very significant landmark contribution. And a month ago, I would have anticipated the number would have been zero,” he told reporters. “And so I think, before worrying about what we haven’t got, I’d like to look at the millions of people whose lives will be saved, whose lives will be better because of this contribution, and start there.”\n\nEven as the U.S. pulls back its aid contributions, needs have ballooned worldwide: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.\n\nThe cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the Biden administration — or even during Trump’s first term.\n\nNow, the idea is that Fletcher’s office — which has aimed to improve efficiency — will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.\n\nAsked by reporters if the U.S. language of “adapt or die” worried him, Fletcher said, “If the choices are adapt or die, I choose adapt.”\n\nUS seeks aid consolidation\n\nU.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA’s annual appeal for money. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.\n\n“This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz said.\n\nAt its core, the changes will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be initially targeted, including Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres also welcomed the announcement, saying that “every dollar counts.\"\n\nTwo of the world’s most desperate countries, Afghanistan and Yemen, are not included, with U.S. officials citing aid diversion to the Taliban and Houthi rebels as concerns over restarting contributions.\n\nAlso not mentioned on the list are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump’s as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.\n\nThe U.N. project, months in the making, stems from Trump’s longtime view that the world body has great promise but has failed to live up to it and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.\n\n“No one wants to be an aid recipient. No one wants to be living in a UNHCR camp because they’ve been displaced by conflict,” Lewin said. “So the best thing that we can do to decrease costs, and President Trump recognizes this and that’s why he’s the president of peace, is by ending armed conflict and allowing communities to get back to peace and prosperity.”","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2025/12/30/us-pledges-2-billion-for-un-humanitarian-aid-as-trump-warns-agencies-must-adapt-or-die","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:12:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":389947466,"title":"Kyiv rejects Russia’s claim of Ukrainian attack on Putin residence  - Haiti Gazette – Daily Haiti News","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected Russia’s claim that his country carried out an attack on a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on Monday that the attack had taken place on Putin’s residence in northwestern Russia’s Novgorod region, using 91 long-range strike drones.\n\nLavrov said air defence systems shot down the aerial attack, and added that no one was injured.\n\nKremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the strike took place on Sunday, “practically immediately after” talks held in Florida between United States President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy on negotiations to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy quickly rejected Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of attempting to derail the peace talks.\n\nUkrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha also condemned Moscow’s allegation, saying it was aimed at undermining the negotiations.\n\nIn a post on X, Sybiha said the claim was intended “to create a pretext and false justification for Russia’s further attacks against Ukraine, as well as to undermine and impede the peace process”.\n\nRussia said it would reassess its negotiating position in light of the alleged attack, with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova warning that Moscow’s response “would not be diplomatic”.\n\nLater on Monday, Trump said that Putin had told him during a phone call that Ukraine had attempted to attack the Russian president’s residence.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump said Putin raised the allegation during their call.\n\n“I don’t like it.

And then I’ll tell you the rest of it,” he says.\n\nIt also follows Trump receiving the specially created FIFA peace prize at the official draw for next year’s soccer World Cup in Washington three weeks ago.\n\nAfter his talks with Netanyahu, Trump said the US could support another major strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or nuclear weapons programs and warned Hamas of severe ‍consequences if it does not disarm.\n\nSpeaking beside Netanyahu following their meeting, Trump suggested Tehran may be working to restore its weapons programs after a massive US strike in June.\n\n“I’ve been reading that they’re building up weapons ​and other things, and if they are, they’re not using the sites we obliterated, but possibly different sites,” Trump said.\n\n“We know exactly where they’re going, what they’re doing, and I hope they’re not doing it because we don’t want to waste fuel on a B-2,” he ⁠added, referring to the bomber used in the earlier strike.\n\n“It’s a 37-hour trip both ways. I don’t want to waste a lot of fuel.”\n\nTrump, who has broached a potential nuclear deal with Tehran in recent months, said his talks with Netanyahu focused on advancing the fragile Gaza peace deal he brokered and addressing Israeli concerns over Iran and over Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said last week that it had conducted missile exercises for the second time this month.\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s warning.\n\nNetanyahu said last week that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Iran, but was aware of the report. He said he would raise Tehran’s activities with Trump.\n\nTrump said he wanted to move to the second phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas reached in October after two years of ‌fighting in Gaza, a progression that ​entails international peacekeeping forces deployed in the Palestinian enclave.\n\nIsrael and Hamas accuse each other of major breaches of the deal and look no closer to accepting the much more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase. Hamas, which ‍has refused to disarm, has been reasserting its control as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory.\n\nIsrael has indicated that if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully, it will resume military action to make it do so.\n\nDuring his Monday comments, Trump heaped the blame on the militant group for not disarming more promptly, arguing that Israel had lived up to its side of the deal and warning that Hamas was inviting grave consequences.\n\n“There will be hell to pay,” Trump warned when asked what he will do if Hamas does not lay down its arms. He has made similar statements at previous intervals during the fighting.\n\nWhile Washington has brokered three ceasefires involving its long-time ally – between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, and Israel and Lebanon – Netanyahu is wary of ‌Israel’s foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in multiple wars.\n\nOverall, Trump’s comments suggested he remains firmly in Netanyahu’s camp, even as some aides have privately questioned the Israeli leader’s commitment to the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nTrump’s plan to end the Gaza war ultimately calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian territory and Hamas to give up its weapons and forgo a governing role.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire included a partial Israeli withdrawal, an increase in aid and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian detainees and prisoners.\n\nTrump said he wants to get to the second phase of the Gaza deal “as quickly as we can.”\n\nIsrael has yet to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, also a condition of Trump’s plan, saying it will only do so once Gvili’s remains are returned.\n\nTrump said he and Netanyahu did not agree fully on the issue of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but the Republican leader did not lay out what the disagreement was.\n\nBefore the meeting, Trump said he would talk to Netanyahu about the possibility of stationing Turkish peacekeepers in Gaza.","url":"https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/middle-east-news/2025/12/30/trump-israel-peace-award","image":"https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1767052904-TrumpNetanyahuMarALagoAAP.jpg?resize=1200%2C630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:02:56","author":"The White House","authors":["The White House"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":389956648,"title":"តម្លៃប្រេង​ឡើង​ថ្លៃ ២% ខណៈ​វិនិយោគិន​ថ្លឹងថ្លែង​ការណ៍​ ចរចា​អ៊ុយក្រែន​ប្រឆាំង ​នឹង​ទស្សនវិស័យ​នៃការផ្គត់ផ្គង់","text":"បរទេស៖ តម្លៃប្រេងបានកើនឡើងជាង ១ ដុល្លារ នៅថ្ងៃចន្ទ ខណៈដែលអ្នកវិនិយោគបានថ្លឹងថ្លែងការពិភាក្សារវាងប្រធានាធិបតីសហរដ្ឋអាមេរិក និងប្រធានាធិបតីអ៊ុយក្រែន លើកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងដែលអាចមានដើម្បីបញ្ចប់សង្រ្គាមនៅក្នុងប្រទេសអ៊ុយក្រែន ប្រឆាំងនឹងការរំខានការផ្គត់ផ្គង់ ប្រេងដែលមានសក្តានុពលនៅមជ្ឈិមបូព៌ា។\n\nយោងតាមសារព័ត៌មាន Reuters ចេញផ្សាយនៅថ្ងៃទី២៩ ខែធ្នូ ឆ្នាំ២០២៥ បានឱ្យដឹងថា ប្រេងឆៅ Brent បានកើនឡើង 1,២២ដុល្លារ ឬ ២% ដល់ ៦១,៨៦ ដុល្លារក្នុងមួយបារ៉ែល ខណៈប្រេងឆៅ West Texas Intermediate របស់អាមេរិក ឡើង ១,២២ដុល្លារ ឬប្រហែល ២,២% នៅតម្លៃ ៥៧,៩៦ដុល្លារ ។\n\nអ្នកវិភាគ IG លោក Axel Rudolph បាននិយាយថា “ទីផ្សារថាមពលបាន ផ្លាស់ប្តូរកាន់តែខ្ពស់ ដោយសារការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍ភូមិសាស្ត្រ នយោបាយផ្តល់ជំនួយដល់តម្លៃប្រេងឆៅ ដោយ Brent បាន​កើនឡើង ដោយសារការបន្តភាពតានតឹងនៅមជ្ឈិមបូព៌ាជាថ្មី និងការផ្លាស់ប្តូរការចរចាសន្តិភាពអ៊ុយក្រែន” ដោយលោកបន្ថែមថា ទីផ្សារអាចបង្កើនភាពប្រែប្រួលដល់ដើមឆ្នាំក្រោយ។\n\nប្រធានាធិបតីអ៊ុយក្រែន លោក Volodymyr Zelenskiy បាននិយាយ នៅថ្ងៃចន្ទថា ការវិវឌ្ឍន៍ដ៏សំខាន់ត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើង នៅក្នុងកិច្ចពិភាក្សាជាមួយសមភាគី អាមេរិក លោក Donald Trump ហើយលោកបានយល់ព្រមថា ក្រុមរបស់សហរដ្ឋអាមេរិក និងអ៊ុយក្រែននឹងជួបប្រជុំគ្នានៅសប្តាហ៍ក្រោយ ដើម្បីបញ្ចប់បញ្ហាដែលមានបំណង បញ្ចប់សង្រ្គាមរបស់រុស្ស៊ីនៅអ៊ុយក្រែន។\n\nប្រែសម្រួលៈ ណៃ តុលា\n\nRelated Items","summary":"បរទេស៖ តម្លៃប្រេងបានកើនឡើងជាង ១ ដុល្លារ នៅថ្ងៃចន្ទ ខណៈដែលអ្នកវិនិយោគបានថ្លឹងថ្លែងការពិភាក្សារវាងប្រធានាធិបតីសហរដ្ឋអាមេរិក និងប្រធានាធិបតីអ៊ុយក្រែន លើកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងដែលអាចមានដើម្បីបញ្ចប់សង្រ្គាមនៅក្នុងប្រទេសអ៊ុយក្រែន ប្រឆាំងនឹងការរំខានការផ្គត់ផ្គង់ ប្រេងដែលមានសក្តានុពលនៅមជ្ឈិមបូព៌ា។ យោងតាមសារព័ត៌មាន Reuters ចេញផ្សាយនៅថ្ងៃទី២៩ ខែធ្នូ ឆ្នាំ២០២៥ បានឱ្យដឹងថា ប្រេងឆៅ Brent បានកើនឡើង 1,២២ដុល្លារ ឬ ២% ដល់ ៦១,៨៦ ដុល្លារក្នុងមួយបារ៉ែល ខណៈប្រេងឆៅ West Texas Intermediate របស់អាមេរិក ឡើង ១,២២ដុល្លារ&#160;

The Mar-a-Lago meeting is their fifth in the US this year, amid concerns negotiations are stalling.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/wont-exist-if-trump-praises-netanyahu-as-hero-israel-never-had-watch/videoshow/126241805.cms","image":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-126241805/126241805.jpg?resizemode=4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:00:00","author":"Timesofindia.com","authors":["Timesofindia.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.035},{"id":389948746,"title":"Donald Trump calls for Hamas to disarm after meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu","text":"Donald Trump says there will be \"hell to pay\" if Hamas does not disarm soon, following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe US president has been hosting Mr Netanyahu at his residence in Florida for talks on Gaza and several other issues.\n\nMr Trump described the meeting on Monday, local time, as very productive and said Israel had lived up to a plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\nHe reiterated his call for Hamas to put down its weapons and said it would be given a short amount of time to do so.\n\n\"If they don't disarm, and they agreed to, then there'll be hell to pay for them, and we don't want that,\" Mr Trump told reporters.\n\nMr Trump said he and Mr Netanyahu had \"come to a lot of conclusions\" during the meeting and that they \"agree on most of the things\".\n\nHowever, Mr Trump said: \"We don't agree on the issue of the West Bank 100 per cent, but we'll come to a conclusion on the West Bank.\"\n\nMr Trump would not be drawn on what the disagreement was regarding the Israeli-occupied territory, but said Mr Netanyahu would \"do the right thing\".\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Pentagon announced it had awarded an $US8.6 billion ($12 billion) contract to Boeing for F-15 fighter jets for Israel.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said he was eager to get to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, with its first phase beginning in October.\n\nIf successful, the second phase would see the rebuilding of a demilitarised Gaza under international supervision by a group chaired by Mr Trump and known as the Board of Peace.\n\nThe Palestinians would form a \"technocratic, apolitical\" committee to run daily affairs in Gaza, under the Board of Peace supervision.\n\nAfter the meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu did not rule out the Palestinian Authority having a role in governing Gaza in the future, should they undergo meaningful reforms.\n\nMr Netanyahu announced he had decided to award the Israel Prize, which is regarded as the state's highest honour, to Mr Trump.\n\nTrump's warning to Iran Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump warned Iran against reconstituting its nuclear program, saying the US would \"knock the hell out of them\" if it did.\n\nMr Trump has insisted that Tehran's nuclear capabilities were \"completely and fully obliterated\" by US strikes on key nuclear enrichment sites in June.\n\nBut Israeli officials have been quoted in local media expressing concern about Iran rebuilding its supply of long-range missiles capable of striking Israel.\n\n\"If they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down,\" Mr Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"\n\nIran has insisted that it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its nuclear program.\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr Trump's warning.\n\nMr Trump criticised Iran anew for not making a deal to completely disarm its nuclear program ahead of the US and Israeli strikes earlier this year.\n\n\"They wish they made that deal,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n[Source: ABC/wires]\n\nOriginal Story link:https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-30/donald-trump-calls-hamas-disarm-netanyahu-meeting/106186218?utm_campaign=abc_news_web&utm_content=link&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_source=abc_news_web","url":"https://www.fijivillage.com/news/donald-trump-calls-for-hamas-to-disarm-after-meeting-with-benjamin-netanyahu-756707/","image":"https://www.fijivillage.com/news_images/20251230110438_media_6953086c1d25a1_56996885.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 00:00:00","author":"Abc/wires]","authors":["Abc/wires]"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fj","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":389943320,"title":"The winners and losers to emerge from the wild, chaotic rollercoaster which was 2025","text":"The year 2025 could be summed up in one word: chaos.\n\nSure, we started with a so-called vibe shift, a demoralized left and a triumphant right winning the White House and positive cultural oxygen.\n\nBut since then, the mood seemed to shift daily in this ever-frenetic digital landscape, where AI is taking over and conspiracies are running rampant.\n\nIn the last 365 days, there’s been triumphs like a Trump negotiated ceasefire in Gaza — but many scars. Los Angeles was ravaged by wildfires and Conservative voice Charlie Kirk was assassinated while advocating for free speech.\n\nSickos openly cheered Kirk’s murder.\n\nHis death — or conspiracies about it — sparked infighting between voices on the right. Over on the left, their pols adopted cursing in a desperate and misguided attempt to reclaim some credibility with voters.\n\nAll the political strife made everyone want to escape to movies, right? Nah. Hollywood, too, is in crisis as tumbleweeds blow through theatres. No one went to see Rachel Zegler’s “Snow White,” or Julia Roberts in “After the Hunt.” Springsteen’s biopic “Deliver me from Nowhere” delivered nuttin’ to the box office. \n\nStreaming, at least, provided some entertainment. “Righteous Gemstones” star Walton Goggins shined in “White Lotus” while beloved gazillionaire everyman Adam Sandler brought a cameo filled nostalgia fest to Netflix in “Happy Gilmore 2.”\n\nMeanwhile, “Sex and the City” led a clinic on how to ruin a beloved franchise in three seasons. Replace Jimmy Choo with Poo. Yes, the cringey and woke spinoff “And Just Like That” ended with an overflowing toilet and literal feces for a finale.\n\nSpeaking of crapola, late night continued to sink into the abyss with Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert turning a once sacred part of American culture into humorless MSNBC after dark. Johnny Carson warned them.\n\nAs for the absurd, Sydney Sweeney was smeared as a “Nazi” for… doing a denim ad?\n\nLegendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, 73, continued to look like an old fool as it was revealed he handed over his brand and legacy to his 24-year-old cheerleader girlfriend. Furthermore, his inaugural season as head coach at UNC was a distraction-filled losing disaster.\n\nOn the bright side, he did finally land the cover of Us Weekly.\n\nWith her Instagram video frolicking on the beach, writing 2025 in the sand, Meghan Markle was marking her territory. This would be her year. Or not. Her Netflix show “With Love, Meghan” bombed, as did another short-lived podcast. At least she has mail-order flower sprinkles.\n\nThis year the Kansas City Chiefs’ dynasty seems to have officially died, but Travis Kelce did put a ring on Taylor Swift’s finger. Quarterback Phillip Rivers came out of retirement at 44 to play for the Colts and made every 40 something American believe. Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza brought wholesome back.\n\nIn 2025, celebrities continued to be insufferable, with their egos literally rocketing to space. Katy Perry, Gayle King and Lauren Sanchez took a Blue Origin flight to proclaim themselves astronauts. A self-important King chastised the public for calling it a “ride” instead of a “journey.” It was a nausea inducing odyssey — for those of us on the ground.\n\nAfter a sensational trial, Sean “Diddy” Combs beat the most serious charges against him. But he is still in prison, sentenced to four years for transportation to engage in prostitution, as an explosive Netflix documentary further sinks his reputation.\n\nThe body positivity movement died at the end of an Ozempic needle, as one time celebrants like Amy Schumer and Meghan Trainer ditched the cause for thinner thighs with ease.\n\nAnother shrinking person, Andrew Cuomo ran a lackluster Mayoral campaign and thus the window for his political return was firmly slammed shut.\n\nInstead, socialism triumphed in New York City as Democratic Socialists of America member Zohran Mamdani was elected Mayor. Yikes.\n\nAmid the digital overload, it’s been a great year for faith. Catholicism has seen a surge in young converts and soaring mass attendance, even in New York City. And in a historic moment, the first American Pontiff was chosen. We now call Robert Prevost, a Chicago native, White Sox fan and Villanova grad, Pope Leo XIV.\n\nMeanwhile the man who literally invented “winning,” rose again in 2025. This time, Charlie Sheen did it without Tiger Blood or crack cocaine. His Netflix doc “aka Charlie Sheen” was a dizzying look into his fame and addiction, a portrait of his father’s love and a requiem for a Hollywood of a faster, but simpler, time.\n\nBill Maher did something out of that simpler time: he ate dinner with someone he disagrees with politically. That man was Donald Trump, and it drove the ‘tolerant’ left wild.\n\nLet’s take Maher’s energy and Kirk’s words going into 2026. Speak to all kinds of people. And maybe next year will be a better one.","summary":"The year 2025 could be summed up in one word: chaos.

Earlier in December, the United Nations launched a 2026 aid appeal for $23 billion to reach 87 million people at risk – half the $47 billion sought for 2025, reflecting plunging donor support despite record global needs.\n\nFletcher acknowledged it had been a tough year for the UN, following a slew of cuts while humanitarian crises in ​war-torn countries such as Sudan surged, but said he was optimistic following the U.S. pledge.\n\n“Millions of lives will be saved across 17 countries,” said Fletcher.","summary":"GENEVA/WASHINGTON >> The United States today pledged $2 billion in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/12/29/breaking-news/u-s-pledges-2b-in-new-u-n-model-for-delivering-humanitarian-aid/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/web1_2025-12-29T171707Z_1544487539_RC2NBGA44JSE_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-UN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:58:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":389943458,"title":"Do I get credit?

No,\" Trump said, before trailing off mid-sentence. \"They gave the Nob...,\" he added, appearing to reference the Nobel Peace Prize.The US President then listed what he claimed were his conflict-resolution successes. \"How about India and Pakistan?\" he said. \"So I did eight of them.

Since May, he has repeatedly said Washington played a role in securing a full and immediate ceasefire after the conflict triggered by the Pahalgam terror attack.India has firmly rejected Trump's version.

Looking over at Zelensky, Trump acknowledged at the podium, “It sounds a little strange,” as the Ukrainian president tilted his head, smiled and said, “Yeah.“ Trump continued that Moscow could supply Ukraine with energy, electricity “and other things at very low prices.“ Zelensky told Baier during a “Special Report“ interview in West Palm Beach, Florida, “I don’t trust Putin, and he doesn’t want success for Ukraine, really, he doesn't. I believe he can say such words to President Trump, but it's not true, really.“ He continued, “He can say, that I want success for Ukraine, and I'm ready to give them cheap electricity.

We will knock them down. We will knock the hell out of them,” he told reporters.When asked whether the United States would support Israel in targeting Iran’s missile programme, Trump affirmed that Washington would act immediately if Iran moves to redevelop its nuclear capabilities.He also urged Tehran to consider negotiations with the United States. “If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear? One will be: Yes, absolutely. The other is: We will do it immediately. That is smarter. They could have made a deal the last time before we went through, you know, a big attack on them,” he added.Earlier this year, the United States conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, an operation Trump has repeatedly hailed as a major success, claiming it “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.However, Netanyahu recently warned that Iran is once again expanding its ballistic missile programme, raising the urgency for tougher action during his discussions with Trump.When pressed about the possibility of supporting regime change in Iran, Trump declined to give a direct answer but highlighted the country’s internal challenges.“I am not going to talk about the overthrow of a regime. They have got a lot of problems there. They have tremendous inflation. Their economy is no good, and the people are not happy,” he continued, “Every time they have a riot, or whenever somebody forms a group, big or small, they start shooting people. They kill people. I have watched this for years, there is tremendous discontent.”The meeting at Mar-a-Lago also served as a platform for Trump and Netanyahu to discuss the second phase of the Gaza peace plan, with the Iranian threat looming large over regional security talks.","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/world/trump-warns-iran-we-ll-knock-them-down-if-missile-or-nuclear-programmes-are-rebuild-3001445.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2025/12/30/1884840-trump-iran.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:54:35","author":"Zee Media Bureau","authors":["Zee Media Bureau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":389940860,"title":"State Department Slams Daily Beast Over 'Sexist' Attack on Trump's New Consular Chief, Mora Namdar","text":"The Trump administration has criticised a media outlet for its piece on the newly appointed assistant Consular head Mora Namdar. They described the article on Namdar as 'sexist' at a time when Namdar herself has allegedly come under scrutiny over her leadership in another position within the State Department.The principal deputy spokesperson for the US State Department, Tommy Pigott, criticised the article by the Daily Beast about Namdar, who was promoted to Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Pigott called the outlet's manner of describing Namdar's career as 'sexist' and 'pathetic.' The backlash comes as a separate report from Responsible Statecraft cites insiders who accuse Namdar of 'elevating loyalists' over seasoned diplomats, leading to 'morale issues' within the department.'A Shameful, Pathetic, and Sexist' Description'What a shameful, pathetic, and quite frankly sexist way to describe her career. Assistant Secretary Mona Namdar is an accomplished lawyer, business owner, and government official. Americans can be proud that patriotic public servants like her are stepping forward to serve our country and advance our national interests,' said Pigott.'Project 2025' Contributor to Enforce Immigration PolicyAs the new head of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Namdar will also be overseeing matters related to passport issuance as well as visas, both approvals and revocations. Namdar previously was in the same role in an interim capacity in 2020. She was also one of the contributors to the notorious Project 2025 agenda, having written about the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM).In her piece, Namdar accused USAGM of mismanagement and claimed the department posed 'espionage-related security risks' and allegedly parroted anti-US talking points and promoted propaganda by countries deemed adversaries. Namdar also called for USAGM to either be reformed or shut down.During her testimony at her Senate confirmation hearing, Namdar said visa adjudications are crucial to national security. Namdar echoed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's stance that should anyone 'undermine our foreign policy, consular officers have the authority to revoke their visa.'Scrutiny in the DepartmentBefore becoming assistant secretary for Consular Affairs, Mora Namdar worked on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa. Her leadership style had already drawn scrutiny during her time as interim head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. According to Responsible Statecraft, critics said she often promoted staff who were personally loyal to her and aligned with President Donald Trump's agenda, rather than advancing career diplomats with long regional experience.An insider told the outlet that Namdar only elevates those 'in her specific circle' which has led to morale issues within the Near Eastern Affairs bureau. 'Instead of having experts in leadership positions, people who are either chummy with Mora or have specific ideological viewpoints end up being elevated over people who have done their time and their work in specific areas,' the insider said.At the time of the report, the State Department has defended Namdar. They said she is 'elevating personnel who have proven that they have the merit, expertise, and experience to best implement President Trump's agenda.'Part-Time Salon OwnerAside from being an attorney, Namdar is also known for owning a mini-chain of hair salons called Bam in Texas, including locations in the West Village in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Plano. Namdar combined her salon and her one-woman law firm, Namdar Law PLLC. However, on Christmas day, Namdar said the law firm closed because of her State Department appointment.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/state-department-slams-daily-beast-over-sexist-attack-trumps-new-consular-chief-mora-namdar-1766820","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779213/mora-namdar.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fe844d92aa421caeb1d41f95a27a0a2a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:45:04","author":"Denise Nequinto","authors":["Denise Nequinto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.202},{"id":389949900,"title":"Wanted man killed in St Andrew police operation","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Wanted man killed in St Andrew police operation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — A wanted man was shot dead and 18 other persons detained during a police operation at Bottom River on August Town Road, St Andrew, on Monday morning.\n\nAn illegal weapon and several rounds of ammunition were seized during the operation, police said.\n\nThe dead man has been identified as 26-year-old Deandre Williams, otherwise called “Street Life”, from Nanny Boulevard in Nannyville, Kingston 3.\n\nReports indicate that around 5:00 am, a large contingent of police conducted an operation during which Williams was accosted. This led to a confrontation in which he was killed.\n\nThe illegal weapon, a 9mm Taurus pistol with a magazine containing 10 9mm cartridges, was seized, and 18 men believed to be aligned with the African Gardens/Vietnam Gang were apprehended and taken into custody.\n\nWilliams, the police said, was wanted for the murder of 39-year-old Charles “Tallman” Walford, a mason from Mandela Terrace, Kingston 11. Walford was shot dead by gunmen on East Road in Kingston 11 on Friday, August 22, 2025.\n\nFurther information indicates that Williams previously operated as a member of the Ashanti and the Dust City gangs. He was also a top-tier member of the Night Time Brawling group and the African Gardens/Vietnam Gang.\n\nAdditionally, Williams was considered a person of interest in multiple murders and shootings committed across the St Andrew Central, North, South, and Kingston Eastern divisions.\n\nThe police said Williams was deported from Canada on June 24, 2024, after spending four years in prison for forcible confinement, assault and possession of a prohibited weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: St Andrew Wanted man \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ladies shine at Pic-Nic Festival at UWI Mona Bowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINSTON, Jamaica — Style, colour and confidence were on full display as patrons turned out in their numbers for the Pic-Nic Festival, held on Saturday... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US hit docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump said Monday the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Small Business Association calls for OUR and JPS to reconsider 7% bill increase \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Small Businesses Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) President, Garnett Reid, is appealing to the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Bess family gets fresh start with new home just before Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — After witnessing Hurricane Melissa destroy her home, leaving her family homeless for weeks, single mother Novia Russell receiv... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Racing United seek to extend lead in JPL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Leaders Racing United will be going after a second win this season over former champions Arnett Gardens when they meet at the Anth... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TCL donates 100 televisions to communities in western Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—In response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, global technology brand TCL has donated 100 \"43” televisions ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police shoot patient after stabbing incident at Kingston Public Hospital \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A male patient was shot and injured by police on Monday at the Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) after he allegedly attacked cops who... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.
