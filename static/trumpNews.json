Silver fell 27% in the same session, its biggest downfall on record.Gold fell more than 13% and silver nearly 34% over the last two trading sessions. But analysts largely expect this to be temporary.\"Although the fall was large and fast, it should also be remembered that we are currently at the same levels we saw just three weeks ago,\" said Ross Norman, an independent analyst.\"This is a significant correction but it does not, by any stretch of the imagination, signify the bull run has ended.\" AN OVEREXTENDED RALLY Gold’s retreat follows what analysts say was an overextended rally, taking the metal from a record peak of $5,594.82 to around $4,700 - nearly $900 lower. It was sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, followed by CME Group's decision to raise margin requirements on precious metals futures. The pullback could discourage speculative buying, analysts at WisdomTree noted, potentially creating space for long-term strategic buyers to re-allocate. Gold prices could see a period of consolidation before moving higher over the next few weeks and months, said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader.Markets also expect the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates two times this year, which will support non-yielding gold.\"We look for gold to reach a new record high above $6,200/oz later this year,\" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.JP Morgan expects gold to reach $6,300/oz by year-end, the bank said on Monday, while Deutsche Bank reiterated its gold price forecast of $6,000 this year citing sustained investor demand. However, some analysts caution that volatility may persist in the near term, warning that the sell-off may not be over yet. \"It is far too early to suggest gold has found a bottom yet,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.Expectations for silver remain mixed, reflecting its dual status as both a precious and industrial metal.(Reporting by Anjana Anil and Kavya Balaraman in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Ashitha Shivaprasad; editing by Pratima Desai and Diane Craft)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/golds-bull-run-seen-intact-despite-steep-pullback-11770059392098.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market3_1733466045716_1733466057117.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 19:09:51","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.027},{"id":398724754,"title":"Vanguard CEO Ramji Calls Trump Accounts a ‘Fabulous Concept’","text":"The Trump administration’s plan to give $1,000 in seed funding to millions of US children is a “fabulous concept,” Vanguard Group Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji said.“It helps people invest early — in this case right from when they’re born,” Ramji said in an interview Monday on Bloomberg TV. “It does it in a low-cost way.” President Donald Trump introduced the accounts as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, offering children born during his second administration funding that they can then put into individual retirement accounts. The US government is considering making Robinhood Markets Inc. an initial trustee of the program, along with one or two other firms.Ramji didn’t say whether Vanguard has been in contact with the administration about the accounts. Still, he praised the “underlying ethos” of the program because fees are capped and the accounts would be invested in a diversified, broad-based set of indexes.While customers could eventually move their funds to a different provider, the program would likely hand Robinhood billions of dollars of new assets to manage if it’s selected as a trustee. Trustees would potentially gain millions of new customers, as well.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and some other banks have said they’ll match Trump account contributions for eligible employees.Vanguard, which oversees about $12 trillion, reversed its longstanding ban on cryptocurrencies in December, allowing exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that primarily hold select cryptocurrencies to be traded on its platform.Ramji, a former BlackRock Inc. executive, was tapped by Vanguard in 2024 to become the first outsider to lead the firm known for revolutionizing investing with the index funds. Asked about Trump’s choice of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Ramji called him a “great choice.”©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/vanguard-ceo-ramji-calls-trump-accounts-a-fabulous-concept-11770058841616.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_1_1733464951182_1733464958176.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 19:00:41","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":398697614,"title":"India, US sync on trade, tariffs","text":"US president Donald Trump on Monday said that he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have agreed to a trade deal between India and the US, nearly a year after the two sides agreed to work towards a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.Under the deal, Washington would lower its reciprocal tariff on Indian goods from 25% to 18%, while India would reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US to zero, Trump said. US is also removing the extra 25% duty on Indian goods applied in response to India’s purchases of crude from Russia, Bloomberg reported, citing officials familiar with the matter.In his social media post, Trump said he spoke to Modi earlier in the day and that the agreement was reached “effective immediately”. The two leaders discussed a range of issues, including trade and efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, he claimed. Trump also said that Modi had agreed to stop India's Russian oil purchases, and instead buy more energy from the US and, potentially, Venezuela. The US president said India would buy more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural products, coal and other goods, and commit to 'Buy American' at a much higher level.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X, “Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Donald Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.”“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump’s leadership is vital for global peace, stability and prosperity, and India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” said PM Modi in his post on X.At 11:40pm India time, the SGX Nifty was up 2.6%. SGX Nifty—now Gift Nifty—is an overseas futures contract linked to the Nifty 50, which trades longer hours than NSE, and is used as an early indicator of how Indian markets may open.\"The India-US trade deal has gone through ups-and-downs like a roller coaster. While devil is in the details, it removes a hanging sword over rupee, equity and rates market,” said Nilesh Shah, MD of Kotak Mahindra AMC.'Thrilled'US ambassador to India Sergio Gor said in a post on X, \"As I have said many times, President Trump genuinely considers Prime Minister Modi a great friend! Thrilled by the news of the trade deal this evening. The relationship between the United States and India has LIMITLESS POTENTIAL!\"Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) chairman Ashwin Chandran said, “The move would help Indian textile and apparel exporters regain competitiveness in the US market, India’s single largest destination for such exports.”“While we await the final text of the deal, indications suggest that the additional punitive 25% tariff risk has been removed and the base tariff has been reduced from 25% to 18%. This brings India broadly in line with its Asian peers on tariff rates, at the very least removing the earlier unfair and disproportionate drag on exports and, by extension, the rupee,” said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services.There are no incremental advantages or preferential placements vis-à-vis Asian peers, but restoring a level playing field is a meaningful reset point from a trade perspective, said Arora.Welcoming the move, Colin Shah, managing director, Kama Jewelry, said, “The slashing of the reciprocal tariff to 18% comes as a great relief for the Indian gems and jewellery sector. The US has been a key consumer market for Indian gems and jewellery, and sentiment had been hit by the tariff implications. This partial relaxation will help restore confidence among Indian jewellery manufacturers and exporters, as well as buyers in the American market.”On 13 February, 2025, a joint statement issued during Modi’s visit to Washington had said the two countries agreed to work towards a trade pact. Since then, negotiations have continued amid strains triggered by Washington’s steep tariff hikes on Indian exports. US tariffs on most Indian goods now stand at 50%, including a 25% punitive tariff for New Delhi's Russian oil purchases.The proposed 18% tariff on India would be lower than or comparable to several South and Southeast Asian countries, including Bangladesh (20%), Sri Lanka (20%) and Vietnam (20%). It would be slightly higher than tariffs faced by more developed economies such as Japan (15%) and South Korea (15%) under negotiated frameworks.Other regional peers, including Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, are subject to reciprocal tariffs of around 19%. In contrast, China continues to face much steeper duties, with average US tariffs on Chinese exports now standing at 47.5%.The timing of Trump's announcement is also notable as it follows India’s Union Budget for fiscal year 2027 (FY27), parts of which sought to address challenges arising from higher US tariffs, and comes days after New Delhi announced the conclusion of negotiations for what it described as the “mother of all trade deals” with the European Union on 27 January, underscoring India’s push to lock in major trade pacts with key partners.Trump and Modi have spoken multiple times since last summer, including during Modi’s Washington visit. In their last publicly acknowledged call in December 2025, the two leaders reviewed progress in bilateral ties and discussed expanding cooperation in areas such as trade, critical technologies, energy, defence and security.ExportsExports to the US, India’s largest overseas market, rose month-on-month in December, indicating that demand held up despite higher tariffs, even as exporters faced pricing and margin pressures. Exports in December rose to $7.01 billion from $6.98 billion in November despite stiff tariffs. Shipments in the first nine months (April–December) of the current fiscal year also rose about 10% to $65.88 billion.Bilateral goods trade between India and the US stood at $105.31 billion during April-December, with India recording a trade surplus of $26.45 billion. This compares with bilateral trade of $94.97 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, when the trade surplus stood at $25.09 billion.Earlier, in November last year, the US had exempted a group of agricultural and food-related products from the reciprocal tariffs it imposed earlier this year. The 14 November decision removed commodities such as coffee, tea, tropical fruits, spices, cocoa, bananas, tomatoes, beef and certain fertilisers from the 2 April tariff list. These products were to face only normal Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) duties, instead of the higher reciprocal tariffs of up to 50%.About 30% of India’s exports to the US, including electronics, energy products and medicines, have been kept outside the tariff net. In contrast, labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, and seafood are bearing the brunt of the 50% tariff that came into effect on 27 August.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-us-tie-up-trade-deal-11770052864186.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/02/1600x900/logo/INDIA-PAKISTAN-USA-0_1751017352417_1751017370468_1770058175806.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 18:55:17","author":"Dhirendra Kumar","authors":["Dhirendra Kumar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.288},{"id":398697602,"title":"Gold, silver extend fall as CME margin hikes compound sharp selloff","text":"By Anmol ChoubeyFeb 2 (Reuters) - Gold and silver prices continued to fall on Monday as higher margin requirements at CME Group compounded last week's sharp selloff following the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair.Spot gold was down 4.8% at $4,630.59 an ounce by 01:32 p.m. ET (1832 GMT), after tumbling nearly 10% earlier in the session.

Silver has dropped roughly 37% since hitting a record high of $121.64 last week.Despite the rout, analysts cautioned against reading the move as the start of a prolonged downturn. \"The conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices,\" said Michael Hsueh, precious metals analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a note, adding that investors \"remain highly bid for upside,\" pointing to continued volatility rather than a collapse in sentiment.CME Group said on Friday it would raise margin requirements on precious metal futures, with the changes taking effect after Monday's market close. Meanwhile, analysts said the sharp fall in prices has pushed out many speculative traders who had piled into the market during the rally, helping cool the market and reduce excess speculation.\"We saw some money coming out of ETFs and we suspect some brave hedge funds took it from there,\" Meyer said.

Lamberth concluded Monday. Orsted said it has spent $7 billion on the development, which is 45% complete.Lamberth granted a request by Denmark-based Orsted for a preliminary injunction blocking the stop-work order, saying the Trump administration’s decision was likely arbitrary and capricious. Last month, the same Washington-based judge allowed Orsted to resume development of its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. Orsted’s wind farms and three others off the US East Coast were halted Dec. 22 by the Interior Department, which claimed the projects posed national security risks it didn’t disclose. All five, including those owned by Dominion Energy Inc. and Equinor ASA, have prevailed in legal challenges so far. Despite the setbacks, Trump’s attacks have led to a significant pullback in US offshore development plans that had been promoted by the Biden administration, which sought to bring more than 30 gigawatts of capacity online by 2030. Only about one-fifth of that amount is now likely to be built, according to BloombergNEF.Once completed next year, Sunrise Wind’s turbines would deliver enough energy to power more than 600,000 homes in New York.

(Photo by Shawn THEW / POOL / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nFebruary 2, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Bill, Hillary Clinton to testify in US House Epstein probe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify in a US House investigation surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesman for the ex-president said, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.\n\nThey had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the disgraced financier, who had connections and correspondence with the world’s business and political elite.\n\n“The former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,” Angel Urena said on X.\n\nThe House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.\n\nThe Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.\n\nDemocrats say the probe is being weaponized to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump — himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify — rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.\n\nTrump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.\n\n– Democratic divisions –\n\nNeither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein’s activities.\n\nIn letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.\n\nRepublicans say the Democratic couple’s past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton’s use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in‑person questioning under oath.\n\nInstead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nBill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein’s plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.\n\nHillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.\n\nThe contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats.\n\nSome Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein’s crimes.\n\nBut others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump’s past contacts with Epstein.\n\nThe Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton Jeffrey Epstein testify

Respectful disagreements are not a source of fragmentation,” he said.\n\nHe said that Caricom has stood the test of time for more than 50 years, remaining resilient and relevant in a changing global environment, even as he acknowledged that the time has come to strengthen the organisation.\n\n“It is now incumbent upon us to make the community stronger, more responsive, and better equipped to serve both the collective and national interests of our peoples. This requires renewal, commitment, and a shared sense of purpose,” Ali said.\n\nCaricom leaders are due to meet in St Kitts and Nevis from February 24-27 and in recent times Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been critical of the integration movement following her country’s support for the United States war on drugs in the Caribbean.\n\nLast December, Persad-Bissessar said the regional organisation was “not a reliable partner at this time” and that every sovereign state must be prepared to accept the consequences of its foreign and domestic policy choices as she defended the United States’ announcement of partial entry restrictions on nationals of Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica.\n\n“Caricom cannot continue to operate in this dysfunctional and self-destructive manner,” Persad-Bissessar said, highlighting what she described as poor management, lax accountability, factional divisions, destabilising policies, and inappropriate meddling in domestic politics by some member states.\n\nShe said also that the organisation’s support for the then Nicolas Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has been accused of human rights violations and threats against Caricom members, further undermines its credibility.\n\nShe insisted that the Caribbean was not a zone of peace given the violent and deadly spate of crime in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Caricom Dr Irfaan Ali Guyana \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US wants St Lucia to ban nationals from studying medicine in Cuba, says PM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n CASTRIES, St Lucia (CMC) – St Lucia Prime Minster Phillip J Pierre says the United States has called on the Caribbean country to stop sending its nati... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica need win over Honduras to advance in Women’s Concacaf U17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica must defeat Honduras in Monday’s final game in Group D of the Concacaf Women’s U17 Qualifiers at Stadion Guillermo Prosper... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ministry of Health urges caution as windy weather continue to affect Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Health and Wellness is urging members of the public to take the necessary precautions as the island experiences high... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says Mexico will ‘cease’ sending oil to Cuba \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump said Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba, which is already struggling after su... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former France striker Benzema switches Saudi clubs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) -- French striker Karim Benzema, who fell out with his club Al-Ittihad, has joined another Saudi club, Al-Hilal, the curren... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guyana president says SIDS must be given a seat at the table to discuss impact of climate change \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Guyana’s President Dr Irfaan Ali on Monday said that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be afforded a seat at the globa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.54 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, February 2, ended at $157.54, remaining unchanged, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s dai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Many of our doctors got trained in Cuba and now the great United States has said we can’t do that any longer,”Pierre told the weekend meeting of the secondWorld Congress on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities held in St Lucia.\n\n“This isa major problem I have to face,”Pierre said, noting that most ofthe local doctors have been trained in Cuba.\n\n“We also have Cubans who come over to work. Sothe American government has said we can’t even train them in Cuba. So I have a major issue on my hand,” Pierre told the conference.\n\nPierre told the audience that the situation adds pressure to an already strained health sector.\n\nHe cited the United States geopolitical pressures as the driving force behind this unprecedented shift, while urging the diaspora and innovative local initiatives to help the country navigate these new challenges.\n\nLast month, the United States Embassy in Barbados said the Cuban regime’s “medical missions” programme, which has benefitted several Caribbean countries “relies on coercion and abuse.\n\n“Cuban medical workers face withheld wages, confiscated passports, forced family separation and exile, restriction of movement through curfews and surveillance, intimidation and threats, and even pressure to falsify medical records and fabricate procedures. Many also endure excessive work hours and unsafe conditions,” the Embassy said.\n\nWashington said it “is committed to exposing injustices and bringing an end to the Cuban regime’s coercive programme”.\n\nWashington has also stepped up its attack on the Cuban health brigade programme, saying that the regime in Havana is profiting off the forced labour of medical personnel and that “renting out Cuban medical professionals at exorbitant prices and keeping the profit for regime elites is not a humanitarian gift.\n\n“It is forced labour. It treats the doctors as commodities rather than human beings and professionals. The United States calls for an end to the Cuban regime’s coercive and exploitative labor export scheme.”\n\nThe chair of the Congress,Sir Cato Laurencin, an orthopedic surgeon and senior academic based in the United States, said St Lucia is not without options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Cuba medicine Phillip J Pierre St Lucia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica need win over Honduras to advance in Women’s Concacaf U17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica must defeat Honduras in Monday’s final game in Group D of the Concacaf Women’s U17 Qualifiers at Stadion Guillermo Prosper... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ministry of Health urges caution as windy weather continue to affect Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Health and Wellness is urging members of the public to take the necessary precautions as the island experiences high... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says Mexico will ‘cease’ sending oil to Cuba \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump said Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba, which is already struggling after su... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former France striker Benzema switches Saudi clubs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) -- French striker Karim Benzema, who fell out with his club Al-Ittihad, has joined another Saudi club, Al-Hilal, the curren... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guyana president says SIDS must be given a seat at the table to discuss impact of climate change \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Guyana’s President Dr Irfaan Ali on Monday said that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be afforded a seat at the globa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.54 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, February 2, ended at $157.54, remaining unchanged, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s dai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump urges ‘no changes’ to bill to end shutdown \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump urged the House of Representatives on Monday to swiftly adopt a spending bill and end the th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The flu vaccine is also available free of cost at health centres across the island,” the ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, individuals are being advised to take precautions when using generators.\n\n“Generators are not to be used indoors or in enclosed areas; generators should be kept at a safe distance from structures because of engine heat, and persons should avoid using appliances that have heating elements, for example, toasters or hair dryers, while on generator power,” the ministry urged.\n\nIndividuals are urged to select the outlet that uses the correct voltage, as some generators can produce 115/120 volts or 220 volts. Individuals who become ill or injured are asked to visit the nearest health centre or private doctor.\n\nREAD: Cool, windy weather to continue through Tuesday as cold front affects Jamaica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Health Ministry of Health and Wellness weather \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says Mexico will ‘cease’ sending oil to Cuba \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump said Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba, which is already struggling after su... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former France striker Benzema switches Saudi clubs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) -- French striker Karim Benzema, who fell out with his club Al-Ittihad, has joined another Saudi club, Al-Hilal, the curren... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guyana president says SIDS must be given a seat at the table to discuss impact of climate change \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Guyana’s President Dr Irfaan Ali on Monday said that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be afforded a seat at the globa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.54 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, February 2, ended at $157.54, remaining unchanged, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s dai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump urges ‘no changes’ to bill to end shutdown \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump urged the House of Representatives on Monday to swiftly adopt a spending bill and end the th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize PM calls for urgent international talks on Cuba in face of US aggression \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Prime Minister of Belize John Briceño on Monday called for immediate international talks to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Cu... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over $115 million paid out to Hurricane Melissa beneficiaries under ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) says it has paid out over $115 million to Jamaicans whose homes were damaged or de... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Mexico is going to cease sending them oil,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about Cuba.\n\nFor years, until Maduro’s ouster, the Cuban economy spluttered along on cheap supplies of Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe end of Mexican supplies, too, would significantly deepen what is already Cuba’s most serious economic crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Mexico to Trump’s comments.\n\nThe US president has approved punitive tariffs against countries supplying oil to Cuba.\n\nThe decree effectively forced Cuba’s partners to choose between trade with the world’s largest economy or with an impoverished island of 11 million people.\n\nMexico has been reluctant to cut supplies, with President Claudia Sheinbaum warning of a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis directly affecting hospitals, food supplies, and other basic services for the Cuban people.”\n\nBut the United States is Mexico’s largest trade partner, and tariffs could damage the already slow-growing economy.\n\nWhile reiterating her “everlasting solidarity” with the Cuban people, Sheinbaum added, “We don’t want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs.”\n\nShe also said that during a phone conversation Thursday with Trump, the two leaders “never discussed” the issue of oil with Cuba.\n\nIn his Oval Office remarks, Trump again said his administration was in talks with Cuba’s leaders.\n\n“I think we are pretty close, but we are dealing with the Cuban leaders right now,” he said, without elaborating.\n\nA senior Cuban diplomat on Monday said there were contacts between the two countries, but no formal talks.\n\n“Today we cannot talk about having a dialogue table with the United States, but it is true that there have been communications between the two governments,” vice foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio told AFP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Cuba Mexico Nicolas Maduro Oil US President Donald Trump \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former France striker Benzema switches Saudi clubs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) -- French striker Karim Benzema, who fell out with his club Al-Ittihad, has joined another Saudi club, Al-Hilal, the curren... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guyana president says SIDS must be given a seat at the table to discuss impact of climate change \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Guyana’s President Dr Irfaan Ali on Monday said that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) must be afforded a seat at the globa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.54 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, February 2, ended at $157.54, remaining unchanged, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s dai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump urges ‘no changes’ to bill to end shutdown \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump urged the House of Representatives on Monday to swiftly adopt a spending bill and end the th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize PM calls for urgent international talks on Cuba in face of US aggression \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Prime Minister of Belize John Briceño on Monday called for immediate international talks to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Cu... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over $115 million paid out to Hurricane Melissa beneficiaries under ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) says it has paid out over $115 million to Jamaicans whose homes were damaged or de... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie missing, police investigate ‘crime’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Police in Arizona were searching Monday for the mother of top US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, after the elderly wo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

While we are among those most exposed to the consequences of climate change we are also determined to be part of the solution. The solution is not a begging bowl for handouts or for charity, or for sympathy. The problem is real and we have real assets. So the solutions must be market based and we must let the world understand that what we possess, this natural asset is part of an ecosystem that supports life and livelihood on this earth and the valuation and value must come to our people,” he said.\n\nAli said while SIDS are among those most exposed to the consequences of climate change “we are also determined to be part of the solution”.\n\nHe said Belize and Guyana have consistently demonstrated leadership in this regard providing the world with critical ecosystems and environmental services including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and climate regulations.\n\nHe reminded legislators that Guyana launched the Climate Biodiversity Alliance, adding “we live on a planet today where in the last 60 years we have lost more than 60 per cent of our biodiversity assets globally.\n\n“Belize and Guyana have kept most fours intact. When biodiversity goes, eco systems go, medicine goes, pharmaceuticals goes, research and development goes, culture goes, indigenous knowledge goes because biodiversity supports all of those things,” Ali said.\n\nHe said forest rich and biodiversity endowed countries must place “appropriate values on these assets and manage them responsibly.\n\n“In Guyana we have made it clear that our forests are worth more standing than being felled. Through our Low Carbon Development Strategy we have begun to translate this principle into action by monetising the value of forest conservation through jurisdictional carbon credit mechanism,” he said.\n\nAli said Guyana is also engaging in “innovative financing mechanisms to safeguard biodiversity and strengthen environmental resilience,” adding that food security is another pressing issue for SIDS.\n\nHe said globally, more than 700 million people face hunger, while billions experience “moderate or severe food insecurity”.\n\n“Conflict, climate shocks, supply chain disruptions and economic volatility have combined to place unprecedented pressure on global food systems,” he said, adding that rising food prices are further compounding this pressure.\n\nHe said for Belize, Guyana and the wider Caribbean, “food security must mean ensuring that all our people have reliable access to affordable nutritious and adequate food as he praised the region for its “ambitious and achievable targets” to reduce its food import bill by 25 per cent.\n\nHe said achieving this target requires sustained investment in agriculture, the adaptation of modern technology, the expansion of climate resilience farming practices and greater emphasis on value added agro-processing among other issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: climate change Guyana’s President Dr Irfaan Ali Small Island Developing States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.54 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, February 2, ended at $157.54, remaining unchanged, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s dai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump urges ‘no changes’ to bill to end shutdown \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-US President Donald Trump urged the House of Representatives on Monday to swiftly adopt a spending bill and end the th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize PM calls for urgent international talks on Cuba in face of US aggression \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Prime Minister of Belize John Briceño on Monday called for immediate international talks to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Cu... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over $115 million paid out to Hurricane Melissa beneficiaries under ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) says it has paid out over $115 million to Jamaicans whose homes were damaged or de... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie missing, police investigate ‘crime’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Police in Arizona were searching Monday for the mother of top US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, after the elderly wo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth police list wanted men, persons of interest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica—The St Elizabeth police have listed several wanted men and persons of interest in the division who they say can assist them in t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dujuan Richards joins Leicester City on loan – agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n Jamaican football prodigy Dujuan “Whisper” Richards has completed a loan move from English Premier League club Chelsea FC to second tier team Leiceste... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Protection of wetlands linked to long-term development goals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change, Matthew Samuda, says the protection of wetlands is critical to achieving the co... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

I’m convinced,” Johnson said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe speaker has a razor-thin majority in the House, however, and cannot afford to lose more than one vote on the Republican side.\n\nHis margin was reduced even further on Monday with the arrival of a Democrat who won a special election in Texas.\n\nRepublican defections could force Johnson to rely on Democratic votes to advance the funding bill and end the shutdown.\n\nIf the House approves the Senate deal, lawmakers would then have just two weeks to negotiate a full-year DHS funding bill.\n\nBoth parties acknowledge these talks will be politically fraught, as Democrats are demanding new guardrails on immigration enforcement and conservatives are pushing their own policy priorities.\n\nDemocrats in the House want changes to the way DHS conducts its immigration sweeps — with heavily armed, masked and unidentified agents who sometimes detain people without warrants — before voting on the spending package.\n\nShutdowns temporarily freeze funding for non-essential federal operations, forcing agencies to halt services, place workers on unpaid leave or require them to work without pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: shutdown US President Donald Trump \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Belize PM calls for urgent international talks on Cuba in face of US aggression \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n BELMOPAN, Belize (CMC)–Prime Minister of Belize John Briceño on Monday called for immediate international talks to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Cu... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over $115 million paid out to Hurricane Melissa beneficiaries under ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) says it has paid out over $115 million to Jamaicans whose homes were damaged or de... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie missing, police investigate ‘crime’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Police in Arizona were searching Monday for the mother of top US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, after the elderly wo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth police list wanted men, persons of interest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica—The St Elizabeth police have listed several wanted men and persons of interest in the division who they say can assist them in t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dujuan Richards joins Leicester City on loan – agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n Jamaican football prodigy Dujuan “Whisper” Richards has completed a loan move from English Premier League club Chelsea FC to second tier team Leiceste... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Protection of wetlands linked to long-term development goals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change, Matthew Samuda, says the protection of wetlands is critical to achieving the co... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police capture wanted man ‘Bones’ for murder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2, 2026 \n\n\n ST MARY, Jamaica—The St Mary police have captured a man wanted for a murder in Jack Vale district, Bull Bay, St Andrew, in November 2025.

While New Delhi has formally confirmed the tariff relief, several wider claims made by the US President—ranging from Russian oil purchases to a $500 billion buying pledge—remain unverified by the Indian side.Tariffs Cut Under New India–US Trade UnderstandingUS President Donald Trump said on Monday that he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"have agreed to a Trade Deal\" between the United States and India, under which Washington DC will apply a reduced reciprocal tariff of 18 per cent, down from 25 per cent.India has since confirmed this tariff reduction, with Prime Minister Modi publicly welcoming the move following the call. The revised rate represents a significant easing of trade pressure after months of elevated duties on Indian exports.What Changed: Removal of the Russian Oil PenaltyThe earlier 50 per cent levy on Indian goods was composed of two parts: a 25 per cent reciprocal tariff and an additional 25 per cent import duty imposed over India’s purchase of Russian crude oil.Under the new arrangement, the United States has withdrawn the punitive duty linked to Russian oil imports and lowered the remaining reciprocal tariff, bringing the overall rate down to 18 per cent. A White House official told Reuters that only the revised reciprocal tariff will now apply.Competitive Edge for Indian ExportsWith the revised tariff structure, India gains a relative advantage over several competing export economies in the region. Its tariff rate is now lower than those applied to Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam. Compared to China and Pakistan, Indian exports face significantly reduced US tariffs, potentially strengthening India’s position in key global supply chains.$500 Billion Purchases and Oil Claims: What Trump SaidIn a post on his Truth Social platform, President Trump outlined what he described as a broader package accompanying the tariff cuts. He claimed India would:Reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods to zeroCommit to purchasing more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural products, coal and other goodsStop buying Russian oil and shift energy purchases to the United States and potentially Venezuela, linking the move to efforts to end the Russia–Ukraine warWhat India Has—and Has Not—ConfirmedWhile India has officially acknowledged the reduction in US tariffs, it has not publicly confirmed several elements outlined by President Trump. These include claims regarding a halt to Russian oil purchases, the removal of all tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US goods, or any commitment to buy $500 billion worth of American products.Prime Minister Modi’s public statement focused solely on tariff relief and did not reference oil imports or large-scale purchase commitments.India–US Trade Deal: What We Know So FarThe US will cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 25 per cent to 18 per centPrime Minister Modi has confirmed the 18 per cent tariff ratePresident Trump says the trade deal is effective immediatelyTrump claims India will buy over $500 billion in US goodsTrump claims India will reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers to zeroTrump claims India will stop buying Russian oil and shift purchases to the US and possibly VenezuelaIndia has confirmed tariff relief but not oil or purchase commitmentsContext: From Trade Tensions to Reset Between India and USThe announcement follows a period of strain in India–US trade relations after Washington last year imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, including the additional duty linked to Russian oil purchases. The latest agreement signals a partial reset, easing tariff pressures while leaving open questions over the broader strategic and economic commitments claimed by the US President.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/indiaus-trade-deal-18-per-cent-tariff-russian-oil-claims-500-billion-us-goods-push-key-things-to-know-explained-11770081617101.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/03/1600x900/logo/USA-INDIA-RUSSIA-OIL-2_1765462824866_1765462847649_1770082401068.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:49:13","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":398781676,"title":"India-US trade deal: ‘Mogambo Khush Hai' – Congress party takes swipe at Govt after Trump announcement","text":"The Congress took a swipe at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government on soon after President Donald Trump announced that the US and India have agreed to a trade deal on Monday.

Trump said this after a phone conversation with PM Modi, announced by the US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who joined last month.After Trump's announcement on Truth Social, PM Modi wrote in an X post that he was delighted that \"made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18 per cent\".The India-US deal announcement comes days after India and the European Union, sealed a landmark free trade agreement – billed as the \"mother of all deals\" – to create a market of two billion people.Congress general secretary in charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, said that in Washington, \"clearly Mogambo Khush Hai\", a play on a popular dialogue from the 1987 Hindi movie Mr India.‘Surely this cannot be the father of all deals’\"He (Trump) announced the halt of Operation Sindoor from Washington DC.

The U.S. followed up with another 25% tariff, citing India's purchase of Russian oil. The tariff moves pushed duties on most Indian goods shipped to the U.S. to 50% and drove relations between the two countries to a historic low.India called the actions by Trump unfair.By mid-2025, prospects for a U.S.–India bilateral trade agreement deteriorated, with negotiations stalling amid heightened tensions. By then, Trump had closed larger deals with Japan and the EU, and offered better terms even to Indian archrival Pakistan. Trump's repeated remarks about mediating the India-Pakistan conflict further strained negotiations and contributed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delaying calls and meetings with Trump.Modi declined an invitation from Trump to visit Washington after the G7 meeting in Canada in June. Modi said in a speech that he would protect the interests of farmers, hinting that talks failed over disagreements in the politically sensitive agriculture sector. India pivoted to improving its relationship with China and struck a landmark trade deal with the European Union.Despite the tariffs, merchandise exports to the U.S., India's largest export market, have risen. In November, for instance, they rose 21% year-on-year, mostly thanks to increased electronics exports. Consumer goods like textiles, jewellery and auto parts were hit the hardest.The Indian markets have been edgy since the worsening of India's relationship with the U.S. Indian equity markets and the Indian rupee were the poorest performers among emerging-market peers last year, on the back of record selling by foreign investors.

They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,' Angel Urena said on X.The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.The Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.Democrats say the probe is being weaponized to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump — himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify — rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.Democratic divisionsNeither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.Republicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in person questioning under oath.Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.Bill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.The Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/02/03/world/americas-emea/bill-hillary-clinton-to-testify-in-us-house-epstein-probe/2270225","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/02/03/922357.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:44:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":398781660,"title":"Nifty 50, Sensex today: What to expect from Indian stock market in trade on February 3 after India-US trade deal","text":"The Indian stock market benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to open higher on Tuesday after the announcement of India-US trade deal by President Donald Trump.The trends on Gift Nifty also indicate a gap-up start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading around 25,937 level, a premium of nearly 795 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close.Donald Trump announced the reduction in reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 25% and said that India will also reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US to zero.On Monday, the Indian stock market snapped its two-day losing streak and ended higher, with the Nifty 50 reclaiming the 25,000 level.The Sensex rallied 943.52 points, or 1.17%, to close at 81,666.46, while the Nifty 50 settled 262.95 points, or 1.06%, higher at 25,088.40.Here’s what to expect from Sensex, Nifty 50, and Bank Nifty today:Sensex PredictionSensex formed a promising reversal pattern on intraday charts, and a bullish candle on daily charts, which supports a further uptrend from the current levels.“We are of the view that now 81,500 and 81,200 will act as immediate support zones for the bulls. Above these levels, a pullback formation is likely to continue, with Sensex potentially moving up to 82,200 or the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Further upside could also push the index toward 82,500,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities.On the flip side, he believes if Sensex falls below 81,200, sentiment could change, and below this level, traders may prefer to exit their long positions.Mayank Jain, Market Analyst, Share.Market said that the immediate support for the Sensex is now at the 81,000 – 81,200 zone.“On the upside, reclaiming the 82,000 – 82,200 resistance zone is essential for a complete trend reversal. The 82,000 mark continues to host a high concentration of Call Open Interest (OI), acting as a major psychological and technical barrier for the bulls,” said Jain.Nifty 50 PredictionNifty 50 formed a bullish candle on the daily chart along with an inside bar pattern.“A long bull candle was formed on the daily chart beside the big bear candle of Sunday. Technically, this market action indicates counterattack of bulls from the lows, which is also a similar candle pattern like bullish Piercing line (not a classical one). The sharp recovery of Monday seems to be a cheering factor for bulls to make a comeback,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.According to him, on the way up, Nifty 50 could encounter crucial overhead resistances around 25,200 and next 25,400 levels in the near-term. Immediate support is placed at 24,900.Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research), Centrum Broking Ltd said that the immediate resistance for Nifty 50 is placed at the 200-DMA around 25,210, and a decisive move above this level would confirm a short-term trend reversal.“On the downside, immediate support is seen at 24,800, followed by 24,680. The RSI has reversed from oversold territory and is trending higher, indicating improving momentum. Meanwhile, India VIX cooled off sharply by 9% to close near 13.8, a further decline would add comfort for the bulls. Overall, the structure appears constructive for a follow-up move towards the 25,200 zone,” said Jain.Mayank Jain highlighted that Nifty 50 has moved back toward its 200-day EMA (~25,160), which now acts as a crucial pivot for the next leg of the trend.“According to current chart patterns, immediate support is placed between 24,850 and 24,950, where the 25,000 Put strike has seen aggressive fresh writing, reinforcing it as a new floor. Conversely, immediate resistance is visible in the 25,150 – 25,250 range, with a significant hurdle at 25,300 where Call writers remain positioned ahead of the weekly expiry,” said Jain.Bank Nifty PredictionBank Nifty index ended 201.80 points, or 0.35%, higher at 58,619.00 on Monday, forming a bullish-bodied candle on the daily chart.“The broader structure remains cautious as Bank Nifty continues to trade below key overhead resistance. Going forward, 58,400 remains the pivotal level — sustained trade above this could open a pullback toward 58,900 – 59,100, while a decisive move below may reintroduce downside risk toward 58,000 and 57,750, both of which remain structurally important demand zones,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities said that the 50 day EMA zone at 59,000 – 59,100 now acts as the immediate resistance. On the downside, 58,100 – 58,000 remains the crucial support zone for the Bank Nifty index.Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

In an email to the committee on Monday, the Clintons' legal team said the former president and former secretary of state \"accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.\" \"As has been the Committee's practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning,\" said the email, which was obtained by CBS News.Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who chairs the oversight panel, said in a statement late Monday: \"The Clintons' counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.\"The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons last year, but the pair called the subpoenas legally invalid and refused to appear before the panel, which is probing the Justice Department's investigations into Epstein. The committee then recommended holding the Clintons in contempt in January.Both contempt resolutions advanced out of the House Oversight Committee with bipartisan support, though more Democrats supported the one related to Bill Clinton, who has acknowledged previous interactions with Epstein.Neither Clinton has been accused of any wrongdoing in the Epstein case.In an effort to avoid the contempt of Congress votes, lawyers for the Clintons said in Jan. 31 letter to the committee that the former president would agree to sit for a four-hour transcribed interview if it takes place in New York City and is \"confined to matters related to the investigations and prosecutions\" of Epstein. The former secretary of state would offer another sworn declaration to answer any questions the committee still has, the lawyers said. If the committee still requires her in-person testimony, her appearance should follow the same terms as her husband's testimony, they said. The Clintons' legal team asked that the subpoenas and contempt resolutions be withdrawn if the conditions were agreed to. Responding in a letter earlier Monday, Comer said the panel has \"serious concerns\" about the offer.Comer argued the proposed scope of Bill Clinton's testimony was too limited and \"would result in your client answering few questions.\" The other demands were \"not reasonable\" and \"insufficient,\" Comer said. Comer said the terms proposed for Hillary Clinton's sworn declaration or appearance were also unacceptable. The news of the Clintons' offer was first delivered by Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw of Virginia during Monday night's House Rules Committee meeting, which was expected to advance the contempt resolutions and tee them up for floor votes in the coming days. \"I understand that the Clintons have agreed to appear for depositions and have agreed to the terms that you laid out in your most recent letter,\" Walkinshaw told Comer as they both appeared before the committee. Comer said he was unaware of the news. The Clintons' attorney had emailed the committee with the offer while Comer was testifying, according to a committee aide. Comer left the House Rules Committee, which briefly recessed for floor votes Monday, questioning the Clintons' agreement. \"There is no offer. They texted us and said they accept our offer. There is no offer,\" he told reporters. \"What do they accept? … They said they would accept my offer. They sent an offer, and I rejected their offer.\" Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the Clintons have now accepted \"every single request\" from Republicans on the terms of their testimony and urged Comer to respond with dates for their appearance. \"We're going to find out right now if Chairman Comer actually wants to hear from the Clintons, or this is all a political, partisan witch hunt by Donald Trump,\" Garcia told reporters Monday night. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August, along with former Justice Department officials dating back to George W. Bush's administration. Since then, only Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during President Trump's first term, has provided closed-door testimony to the committee, while the panel has accepted written statements from the others. Comer has said the committee accepted statements from other former officials because they weren't photographed with Epstein or his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, \"nor is there any evidence that they were directly involved in the investigation.\" The Clintons have accused Comer of treating them differently than other officials in an attempt to embarrass them and punish Mr. Trump's political rivals.

Repeated refrains of \"ICE out\" and \"F*** ICE\" smattered my timeline, and while it isn't surprising to see so many out-of-touch celebrities parroting the same DNC talking points they've been spewing for decades, it got me thinking: when did this whole \"no human is illegal, lax immigration stance start popping up on the left? To be fair, there probably always has been a fair share of the lunatic fringe of the Democratic Party that have espoused these views, but Democrats at large haven't always been so pro-illegal immigration. The Party Of The Working Class Not too long ago, the Democratic Party was the \"party of the working class, for the working class.\" Whether that was true or not is another topic for another time, but as recently as the 1990s and 2000s, the DNC postured itself as the champions of the middle-class working man. Part of looking out for the working-class American citizen meant making sure jobs went to American citizens first, so the fact that Democrats have more recently changed their tune on immigration is eye-opening. If you don't believe me, just look at what some of the more prominent figures of the DNC had to say about illegal immigration as recently as a decade ago. Barack Obama Many know Barack Obama as the \"Deporter-In-Chief,\" a pejorative used by the right to highlight just how hypocritical Obama's recent stance on immigration has been. This was the man who, after all, appointed Tom Homan, Trump's current \"border czar,\" as Immigration and Customs Enforcement's executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations in 2013. What is even crazier is to hear Obama's public stance on immigration as recently as his second term in office. During a 2014 address to the nation, the 44th President of the United States stated, \"Our immigration system is broken. Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules…\" Sounds like a far cry from the modern stance of almost every Democrat to the left of center. Obama was even instrumental in overturning Bill Clinton's \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy regarding Cuban immigrants defecting to America, saying \"Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal.\" Speaking of Clinton. Bill Clinton In a 1995 State of the Union address, former President Bill Clinton sounded like the very people the left tries to frame as Nazis when he said, \"All Americans … are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country…\" Clinton called on both \"Republicans and Democrats\" to curb what he called a disturbing trend, and even went so far as to call illegal immigrants \"a burden on our taxpayers.\" Funny, but I was told that illegal immigrants bring in so much tax revenue that we would be stupid to deport them. This was in response to Americans missing out on jobs because of illegal immigrants entering the country and becoming cheap labor, a talking point that would have you labeled a xenophobic fascist by today's standards. He even used the term \"illegal alien.\" Fancy that! Hilary Clinton We can't talk about Bill Clinton without also discussing his \"better half,\" so here's Hilary on a talk show in 2003 discussing how she's \"adamantly against illegal immigrants.\" She even took things a step further and said that we need to \"stop employing illegal immigrants.\" But it gets even better! During her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton called for the deportation of illegal immigrants if they've committed a crime, \"no questions asked.\" Kind of like how the Trump administration is doing the same thing right now? Bernie Sanders This one might shock you, considering how radically left he is on a bevy of issues, but Bernie Sanders sat down with Vox's Ezra Klein to discuss the issue of \"open borders.\" When Klein asked whether Sanders' socialist platform meant opening the borders of the United States to help combat global poverty, the Vermont senator dismissed it as a \"right-wing\" stance (what?) and a \"Koch Brothers proposal.\" \"It would make everyone in America poorer, then you're doing away with the concept of a nation state.\" Wow, sounds like right-wing nationalism to me. It makes sense, in theory, that Sanders would have held this position, considering he is pro-labor and pro-worker, and importing large numbers of immigrants would make it harder for blue-collar Americans to get jobs within their own country, but what do I know? I'm just a racist bigot like Bernie, right? Why The Change? To be fair, it seems like the DNC started to change its stance on immigration right around the time Donald Trump became a serious threat to win the presidency in 2016. Once Trump adopted an \"America First\" stance, it probably would've been political suicide for a left-leaning candidate to hold any position the Evil Orange Man held. I believe you could also point to the large voter bases the Democrats cultivated through illegal immigrants, and changing their position on social issues isn't anything new for the Democratic Party. Democrats were famously the party of Jim Crow Laws and the KKK, but when they started to curry favor with African-Americans thanks to FDR's progressive policies such as social welfare spending, they realized they had a voting bloc that was potentially an untapped goldmine. The same goes for their support of gay marriage. Similarly to how they were once staunch supporters of immigration reform, DNC figureheads like Obama and Clinton famously ran on marriage being between a man and a woman and outwardly opposed gay marriage. As late as 2012 for Obama and 2013 for Clinton, the idea of opposing gay marriage was a nearly bipartisan issue. Once it became en vogue to back LGBTQ+ causes, Democrats welcomed their new voters, and within a couple of years, the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage and the rest is history. So the next time a liberal tries to lecture you on how evil and fascist you are for supporting such barbaric policies, just remind them some of their political heroes were no different than the very man they try to paint as the next Hitler.","summary":"With Hollywood liberals once again speaking out about Trump&apos;s immigration policy, it&apos;s good to remember that Democrats were once opposed to illegal immigration not so long ago.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/politics/when-did-democrats-become-so-lax-immigration","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-461135964-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:40:34","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":398779750,"title":"'We May Have Some Good News': Donald Trump Optimistic On Russia-Ukraine Talks","text":"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday struck an optimistic note on efforts to end the Ukraine-Russia war, saying he believes progress is being made and hinting that a diplomatic breakthrough could be near.\n“I think we’re doing very well with Ukraine and Russia,” Trump said as he spoke to reporters.\n“For the first time, I’m saying that, you know, we’re doing.

Cracker Barrel is also still feeling the effects of its disastrous 2025 rebrand efforts, and now customers are turning their ire toward changes in its menu. \n\nIn December, regular diners complained about recent menu changes, including batch‑made cookies instead of freshly rolled dough and green beans and sides prepared in ovens rather than on the stovetop. Some customers have gone as far as bringing their own maple syrup to the restaurant because they disapprove of the new offerings.\n\nThe backlash against the chain began with a botched rebrand that caused Cracker Barrel to lose an estimated $94 million in market value in a single day after the chain unveiled a new logo and branding strategy in August. The company’s removed its longtime mascot, the man leaning on a barrel, known as Uncle Herschel, from its logo as part of a broader minimalist rebrand. \n\nMAGA influencers and conservative commentators branded the redesign as “woke,” and even former President Donald Trump publicly urged the company to revert to its classic look. \n\nAround the same time, Cracker Barrel also announced plans to modernize the interiors of its more than 650 locations, which critics claimed stripped away the chain’s nostalgic identity.\n\nThe company quickly acknowledged the backlash in a statement announcing it would scrap the revamps. \n\n“If the last few days have shown us anything, it’s how deeply people care about Cracker Barrel. We’re truly grateful for your heartfelt voices,\" the statement read. “You’ve also shown us that we could’ve done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.”\n\nIt went on assuring Cracker Barrel diners that \"the things people love most about our stores aren’t going anywhere: rocking chairs on the porch, a warm fire in the hearth, peg games on the table, unique treasures in our gift shop, and vintage Americana with antiques pulled straight from our warehouse in Lebanon, Tennessee.”\n\nLater, Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino said the backlash made her feel “fired by America.”","summary":"The Southern chain has been in turmoil since last year’s failed rebrand","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cracker-barrel-new-rules-restaurant-dining-b2912664.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/30/21/14/Untitled-design.png?crop=900,600,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VTR0rgV8-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:38:47","author":"Erin Keller","authors":["Erin Keller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":398780448,"title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,440  - Haiti Gazette – Daily Haiti News","text":"Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Monday, as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks with the US and Russia, expected to begin on Wednesday.\n\nIn a separate post on social media, Zelenskyy added that a recent “de-escalation” with Russia – an apparent reference to a brief ceasefire in attacks on energy facilities – was helping to build trust in the negotiations.\n\nZelenskyy said in separate remarks that it was realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace, in advance of the next round of peace talks with Russian and US officials in the United Arab Emirates.

Even more surprisingly, the form was submitted in his name. Hundreds of such forms have surfaced in this village as well as certain other villages of this district.

In some cases, voters alleged they were asked to sign hundreds of Form 7 applications and were told the forms were for inclusion of names, not deletion.\n\nAI grounds Boeing 787-8 plane after pilot reports fuel switch malfunction\n\nAn Air India pilot reported an instance of a fuel switch malfunction on a Boeing 787-8 flight from London to Bengaluru after it landed on Monday (February 2, 2026), following which the airline says it has grounded the aircraft and is examining the matter. The switches that supply fuel to the two engines on an aircraft were at the heart of the preliminary report into the Air India AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad last June. The preliminary report into Air India’s Ahmedabad crash, which also involved a Boeing 787 aircraft, said that the switches that supply fuel to the engine shifted or “transitioned” to the CUTOFF position one after another and there was a loss of engine thrust and both engines shut down, precipitating the crash of the Boeing 787-8 aircraft which killed at least 269. While the report didn’t specify whether this was an inadvertent or deliberate action, a tiny fragment of the exchange between the two pilots reproduced in it sparked a debate on whether the crash was a suicide attempt.\n\nRise in southern States’ share in devolution of funds provides no relief to Tamil Nadu\n\nDespite five southern States being assigned a collectively higher share under the vertical distribution scheme of the 16th Finance Commission (FC) than in the past, Tamil Nadu’s share has seen only a marginal rise. The share of Tamil Nadu, which was 4.079% in the 15th FC, rose to 4.097% now, accounting for a rate of increase of 0.44%. This was followed by Telangana with a rise of 3.43% and Andhra Pradesh with 4.2%. Only Karnataka and Kerala have witnessed a double-digit rate of increase — 13.27% and 23.74%. At the all-India level, Kerala’s degree of rise is only next to Haryana’s 24.52%, while the third slot goes to Karnataka.\n\nSonam Wangchuk incited violence by referring to Nepal, Bangladesh and Arab Spring: Centre tells SC\n\nThe Centre and the Union Territory of Ladakh administration accused detained climate activist Sonam Wangchuk of using the veneer of Gandhian non-violence to disguise actual incitement to the younger and impressionable generations to turn to violence. Appearing before a Bench headed by Justice Aravind Kumar, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta reasoned that Mr. Wangchuk’s instigation even touched upon “self-immolation” and non-cooperation in case of an external aggression.

Over the past two days, the BJP central leadership asked all its legislators as well as alliance partners from Manipur to be present in New Delhi for a crucial meeting. President’s Rule was imposed in Manipur on February 13, 2025 following the resignation of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh and the Assembly was placed under suspended animation.\n\nCongress says government is misusing rules to silence Leader of Opposition from quoting Naravane’s book on China border issue\n\nThe Congress on Monday (February 2, 2026) accused the Narendra Modi Government of “misusing rules to heckle and silence” Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, preventing him from speaking on the 2020 India-China border conflict by objecting to references to former Army chief General (retired) Manoj Naravane’s memoir. Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal, who repeatedly took on the Treasury benches as Mr. Gandhi attempted to raise the issue in the House, said the government was afraid that the “truth of its incompetence” would be exposed.\n\nCEC insulted and humiliated us during meeting: Mamata Banerjee\n\nAccusing the Election Commission of “parroting” the ruling BJP’s line, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee walked out of the EC office on Monday. Ms. Banerjee alleged that she was “insulted and humiliated” by Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar during the meeting. Ms. Banerjee, accompanied by Trinamool Congress MPs and 12 voters from West Bengal — five of whom were declared dead and had their names deleted from the electoral rolls during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) — met the EC to raise objections. The delegation had black shawls on as a mark of protest.\n\nInvestigation into PSLV failures ‘ongoing’, next launch date in June: Minister\n\nThe investigation into the causes behind the consecutive failures of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is ongoing, and an external team is also involved in the probe.

US President Donald Trump on Monday said that the US, “effective immediately”, had lowered tariffs on India to 18 per cent from 50 per cent. This came after India addressed several US demands in the Budget and also began aggressively signing trade deals with other countries, including the UK and the EU. “Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25 per cent to 18 per cent. They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States to zero,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, said: \"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.” Trump said that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and buy much more from the US and potentially Venezuela, and agreed to purchase $500 billion worth of US energy, agriculture, coal and other products under the trade deal. In the run-up to this outcome, there was a significant resetting of trade ties. India stepped up crude oil imports from the US, now nearly comprising 10 per cent of its total oil imports. New Delhi also signed a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) deal where Indian public sector refiners have a one-year pact for American LPG imports. The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, meanwhile, allows private players to enter the operations side of the tightly governed nuclear power sector, fulfilling key US demands. PM’s visit to Washington, marking the start of negotiations Trump had repeatedly targeted India over its high tariffs, even before assuming office. Then Modi met him in February last year and announced the start of the negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) by the end of the year. India thus was among the first countries to start negotiations with the US, but the trade deal comes after much of the world, including China. The first sign of India addressing Trump’s concerns came even before Modi’s visit. As Trump consistently called India ‘tariff king’, talking about American companies such as Harley Davidson failing in India due to high tariffs, India slashed duty on more than two dozen items in the Union Budget. This included a reduction in tariff on motorcycles with an engine capacity above 1,600cc from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. Just days before the PM's visit, the government slashed duty on bourbon whisky to 50 per cent from 150 per cent. The US is the largest producer of bourbon whisky. However, the domestic industry protested against the duty cut, seeking a phased reduction over a period of 10 years rather than immediate steep cuts. US targets high agri tariffs in India & GM regulation; sets 27% ‘reciprocal’ tariffs for the first time Just days after releasing a report on non-tariff barriers that the US faces across the globe, including India, the US on April 3 announced 27 per cent ‘reciprocal’ tariffs on India. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) report on trade barriers criticised India’s high applied tariffs on a wide range of goods, including vegetable oils, apples, maize, motorcycles, automobiles, flowers, natural rubber, coffee, raisins, walnuts, and alcoholic beverages. The USTR report also flagged India’s regulations on the import of milk, pork, and fish products, stating that they require genetically modified (GM)-free certificates “without providing a scientific or risk-based justification.” It reiterated a long-standing American concern over India’s agricultural support programmes, which, according to the US, distort markets. Even with a 27 per cent tariff, India did not seem to have fallen out of favour with the US, as Washington had set steeper tariffs on =Asian competitors. The figure was 54 per cent on China, 46 per cent on Vietnam, 37 per cent on Bangladesh, and 36 per cent on Thailand. Tariffs stood at 32 per cent on Indonesia and 48 per cent on Laos. However, the tariffs on India were higher than the 24 per cent duty on Japan and 25 per cent on South Korea. Duty on the EU stood at 20 per cent, while the UK faced a 10 per cent tariff. India misses 90-pause window; deal takes political turn As the US paused the implementation of the ‘liberation day’ tariffs for 90 days, it raised hopes that New Delhi would use the opportunity to strike a deal and begin attracting investments and export opportunities, moving away from China. However, this marked the beginning of fresh tensions between the two countries that eventually resulted in India facing the steepest tariffs on any country globally. In response to a terrorist attack by Pakistan-based terrorist group “The Resistance Front” (TRF) in Pahalgam, India launched “Operation Sindoor” on May 7–8 , neutralising terrorist installations in Pakistan. Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called the Indian DGMO, and it was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action with effect from 1700 hours Indian Standard Time on May 10. However, the Trump administration claimed that the US used tariff leverage on both countries to stop the war. Later on May 23, US officials defended the use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs in the US Court of International Trade, stating that withdrawal of Trump’s emergency tariff powers would disrupt trade deals the US is pursuing and jeopardise the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, court filings showed. India-US ties worsen, US slaps 50% tariffs on India Despite Trump’s multiple assertions that US tariff threat resulted in a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, New Delhi maintained that the ceasefire followed a call made by Pakistan's DGMO to the Indian DGMO. While Pakistan nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, India refrained from any such gesture. While the US continued to sign multiple trade deals, including with the EU, Japan and Vietnam, a deal with India remained elusive largely due to American demands related to agricultural market access. Ramping up pressure, Trump on August 7 doubled the tariffs on India to 50 per cent. This widened differences between the two countries as the US cited India’s purchase of Russian oil for imposing additional tariffs. This was seen as discriminatory, as China was the largest buyer of Russian oil, at about 2 million barrels per day, followed by India (just under 2 million barrels a day) and Turkey. The US had agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 per cent from 145 per cent in May.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indias-rocky-road-to-us-trade-deal-10510022/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Trump-India-way-ahead.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:34:41","author":"Ravi Dutta Mishra","authors":["Ravi Dutta Mishra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.16},{"id":398780962,"title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,440  - Guyana Inquirer – Daily Guyana News","text":"Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Monday, as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks with the US and Russia, expected to begin on Wednesday.\n\nIn a separate post on social media, Zelenskyy added that a recent “de-escalation” with Russia – an apparent reference to a brief ceasefire in attacks on energy facilities – was helping to build trust in the negotiations.\n\nZelenskyy said in separate remarks that it was realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace, in advance of the next round of peace talks with Russian and US officials in the United Arab Emirates.

It erodes our cultural identity and cohesion,” she continued. \n\n“Multiculturalism is a failed concept. When you start seeing demographic change and clusters of groups of people that are supposed to be a minority, and all of a sudden, we are the minority. It is a problem and a big one. \n\n“All we need to do is looking at Europe, what is happening there, in Germany, the UK and France, and Italy, it is terrifying and we must oppose it with everything we got.”\n\nHave your say in The Great Aussie Debate. Take the survey here:\n\nThe video, watched more than 200,000 times, divided social media followers.\n\nSome agreed with Ms Colecchia’s remarks, with one apparent Victorian who was also at the NYE festivities saying Melbourne no longer felt like “home”.\n\n“If you’d put me in the back of [a] shipping container, drove in circles for 8 hours and opened the door, I’d have thought I was in Malaysia. Sub Indian Continent people are extremely friendly and polite people, however, the migration has happened too rapidly and unfortunately Australia is on the path of losing its Western identity,” he commented.\n\n“How did we let this happen, and in such a short period of time? Western world is finished as we know it I’m afraid,” another user wrote.\n\n“Multiculturalism is a myth and always has been, when a country no longer looks how it should that’s not the original country at all that’s deliberate invasion,” a third added.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Australia Bureau of Statistics, 10.6 per cent of Victoria’s population was born overseas.\n\nThe top five responses were India, followed by England, China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n\nMany social media followers, however, pointed out that Ms Colecchia had an obvious European accent in the video.\n\n“Brown migrant with accent complains about other brown migrants with accents?” a journalist asked in the comment section.\n\n“By the way Australia belongs to Aboriginals. Imagine if they were to walk out on the streets playing the same game as you. I wonder how you would feel?” another chimed in.\n\n“You’ve got a strong accent, and you’re criticising others for coming here? By rights you should be leaving with them if that’s your stance.

She received 8.2 per cent of primary votes, up from 4.8 per cent in 2022. \n\nJulian Hill retained the Victorian seat, in Melbourne’s southeastern suburbs, with a swing of almost 10 per cent to Labor.\n\nMs Colecchia, during the election campaign, was repeatedly asked how, as a migrant, she could represent One Nation, which is demanding to scale back immigration.\n\n“I understand there is a bit of history in the way our leader approached the issue back in the 1990s, but One Nation is not against migration as a whole; we stand for sustainable levels of migration from culturally cohesive countries,” she told the AFR.\n\n“I don’t think migration should ultimately come at the expense of the people who welcome us, and I don’t think there is anything wrong with saying that.”\n\nAccording to a biography on the party’s website, the self-confessed Donald Trump fan is focused on “growing a strong, principled movement that defends our values, protects our heritage and puts everyday Australians first”.\n\n“I am committed to common-sense policies that strengthen our national identity, protect our heritage, and secure a prosperous future for all Australians,” it read.\n\n“My mission is to build a stronger voice for conservative Australians and ensure One Nation continues to stand firm where others have wavered, and finally establishes itself as THE third party alternative to the major parties’ duopoly.”\n\nHanson’s popularity on the rise\n\nThe spat between the former Coalition partners is proving increasingly destructive, as a new poll shows conservative voters are abandoning the Liberal Party and Nationals, while the popularity of One Nation surges.\n\nA new Redbridge Group poll found fewer than one in five people support the Liberals and Nationals, while Opposition Leader Sussan Ley’s personal ratings hit a record low.\n\nAt the same time, core support for One Nation surged to 26 per cent, consolidating Senator Pauline Hanson’s party as the clear second choice of voters behind Labor, while the Liberals and Nationals are trailing at 19 per cent.\n\nThe support for the former Coalition parties was down from 26 per cent in December.\n\nOne Nation, on the other hand, rose from 17 per cent in December.\n\nWhile Labor came out of its turbulent summer largely unscathed, staying steady at 34 per cent, Anthony Albanese took a hit in his personal ratings.\n\nThe poll put Senator Hanson as the most popular potential political leader in Australia.\n\nThe Greens fell 2 percentage points to 11 per cent.\n\nMs Ley will not face a leadership challenge in the first sitting fortnight, Liberal frontbenchers have said, despite conservative forces vying to topple her.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/fury-over-one-nation-staffers-video-of-melbourne-cbd/news-story/a4aedda68d46b255396dee01fdd9c42f","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ba6ebcfead8404d54381b7a4455eef52","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:30:00","author":"David Wu","authors":["David Wu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":398781728,"title":"Noem: Every Homeland Security officer in Minneapolis to be issued body-worn camera","text":"Washington — Every Homeland Security officer on the ground in Minneapolis, including those from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be immediately issued body-worn cameras, Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday, in the latest fallout after the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents.\n\nNoem said the body-worn camera program is being expanded nationwide as funding becomes available.\n\n“We will rapidly acquire and deploy body cameras to DHS law enforcement across the country,” Noem said in a social media post on X.\n\nThe news of the body cameras comes as Minneapolis has been the site of intense scrutiny over the conduct of federal officers after two U.S. citizens protesting immigration enforcement activities in the city were shot and killed.\n\nIt is the latest apparent effort by the Trump administration to ratchet down tensions after the shootings triggered protests and widespread criticism.\n\nThe shooting deaths sparked calls for accountability\n\nIn the immediate hours after ICU nurse Alex Pretti’s death, Noem went on the offensive, saying several times that Pretti “came with a weapon and dozens of rounds of ammunition and attacked” officers, who took action to “defend their lives.” Other administration officials painted a similar picture.\n\nMultiple videos that emerged of the shooting contradicted that claim, showing Pretti had only his mobile phone in his hand as officers tackled him to the ground, with one removing a handgun from the back of his pants as another officer began firing shots into his back.\n\nHomeland Security has said that at least four Customs and Border Protection officers on the scene when Pretti was shot were wearing body cameras. The body camera footage from Pretti’s shooting has not been made public.\n\nThe department has not responded to repeated questions about whether any of the ICE officers on the scene of the killing of 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good earlier in January were wearing the cameras.\n\nThe shootings, and the narrative coming from some in the administration, sparked demands for accountability, including among some Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to take control of operations there, displacing Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has become a lightning rod for criticism in the various operations he’s joined in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nThe Justice Department has also opened a federal civil rights investigation into Pretti’s shooting, which it has not done in the case of Good.\n\nCritics have increasingly called for Homeland Security to require its immigration enforcement officers to wear body cameras.\n\nIn response to Noem’s announcement, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on X that body cameras should have been worn “long before (officers) killed two Americans.”\n\nLawmakers consider restraints in DHS funding bill\n\nNoem’s announcement comes as the administration and Democrats are locked in a congressional battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDemocrats have been demanding changes to rein in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operations. An additional $20 million for body cameras was included in the bipartisan federal funding package that was approved by the Senate late last week ahead of a deadline to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nBut the House has yet to approve the package, launching a partial government shutdown for certain agencies, including Homeland Security, last Saturday. But because many Homeland Security operations are deemed essential, they continue despite the federal funding lapse.\n\nBody cameras have become a flashpoint in previous immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s mass deportations agenda, including during a major operation in Chicago last fall. A U.S. district judge ordered uniformed agents there to wear cameras, if available, and turn them on when engaged in arrests, frisks and building searches or when being deployed to protests.\n\nA 2022 executive order on police reform by President Joe Biden directed federal law enforcement officers to wear body cameras. Trump had rescinded that directive after starting his second term.\n\nTrump backs body-worn cameras\n\nNoem’s move comes after Trump over the weekend endorsed the idea of body cameras for immigration officers.\n\nAfter Noem’s announcement Monday, Trump said the decision was up to the secretary but said that he thought it was generally good for law enforcement to wear cameras.\n\n“They generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can’t lie about what’s happening,” he said in the Oval Office Monday, adding, “If she wants to do the camera thing, that’s OK with me.”\n\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, an advocacy group, said Noem didn’t need to wait for more money to enforce the new policy nationwide, pointing to the massive immigration enforcement funding measure that Congress passed last summer that gave ICE nearly $30 billion for “enforcement and removal operations” including spending on information technology.\n\n“That buys a lot of body cameras,” he said.","summary":"Critics have increasingly called for ICE agents to wear body cameras.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2026/02/noem-every-homeland-security-officer-in-minneapolis-to-be-issued-body-worn-camera.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/XDIRWJKEANHIJNVW4XST7GMIVQ.jpg?auth=f1574420d4ad5eb6904a9f04505617e043907d96f38b29662b0eb320519e55a1&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:28:08","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":398779720,"title":"Trump launches $12 billion minerals stockpile to counter China","text":"APUS President Donald Trump\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced plans on Monday to launch a strategic stockpile of critical minerals backed by $10 billion in seed funding from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. \"For years, American businesses have risked running ‌out of critical minerals ‌during market disruptions,\" Trump said during an Oval Office event.Budget 2026 Highlights: Here's the fine print \"Today, we're launching what will be known as Project Vault to ensure that ‌American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage.\" Washington has been moving to offset what policymakers view as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals which are vital to making electric vehicles, high-tech weaponry and many other manufactured goods. That has stymied U.S. mining companies for years. The project will combine $2 billion in private funding with a $10 billion loan from the EXIM Bank to acquire and stockpile minerals for automakers, technology companies and other manufacturers, ‌Trump said. ‍The export bank said it approved the loan on Monday.Live Events Rare earth and critical ‍minerals stocks, including MP Materials and USA Rare Earth Inc, rose ‌on media reports that an announcement on the $12 billion initiative was imminent. General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra and mining billionaire Robert Friedland, who represent both producers and users of critical minerals, attended the Oval Office event. The project has attracted interest from a wide range of U.S. auto and technology companies. Commodities trading firms Hartree Partners, Traxys North America and Mercuria Energy Group would manage the procurement of raw materials for the stockpile, a Trump administration official familiar with the plan told ‍Reuters. Project Vault is intended to help the U.S. auto industry while letting companies keep related risks off their balance sheets, the official said, comparing the logistics of ‍the project to a ⁠Costco membership that allows ⁠for buying in large volumes. Another goal is to maintain a 60-day supply of minerals for emergency use, the official said, adding that mineral stockpiling was already under way. An executive structure is expected to be set up for the project and EXIM is likely to have a board seat, the official said. Last month, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill to create a $2.5 billion stockpile of critical minerals, aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

Jan Schakowsky representing parts of Chicago’s North Side as well as north and northwest suburbs, two candidates began 2026 with more than $1 million in their political bank accounts, and four others had at least $500,000 ready to spend in the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe nearby, northwest suburban 8th Congressional District features eight Democrats running to replace incumbent U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is seeking to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin. A former member of Congress was the fundraising leader in that race, followed by an entrepreneur, a progressive who ran against Krishnamoorthi four years ago and a member of the Cook County Board.\n\nIn the 7th Congressional District, which runs from downtown Chicago west to suburban Hillside, 13 Democrats are fighting it out to replace U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, who is retiring as the longest-serving current member of Illinois’ congressional delegation. Nearby, the 4th Congressional District race, which runs from Chicago to the west suburbs, does not have a competitive primary to replace the retiring U.S. Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García.\n\nBut in the 2nd Congressional District that runs from Chicago’s Far South Side to Danville, as U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly takes on Krishnamoorthi for the Senate, 10 Democrats have together raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to fill her seat.\n\nA dozen Republicans are also running for the five seats but have raised less cash so far. At the same time, a divide within the Democratic Party has begun to show as a handful of candidates have called out their competitors for seemingly receiving much of their support from people who have also supported Republicans or outside groups — in particular, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, as progressives increasingly reject that organization following Israel’s actions during the war in Gaza.\n\nHere’s a look at the fundraising picture across Chicagoland so far.\n\n9th Congressional District\n\nIn one of the most competitive and highest-fundraising races in Illinois, state Sen. Laura Fine of Glenview saw a surge in contributions in the final three months of 2025 as she raised nearly $1.3 million and had $1.4 million on hand in her bid to succeed Schakowsky.\n\nBut she wasn’t alone in reporting a million-dollar-plus war chest in the race. Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who received Schakowsky’s endorsement shortly after the end of the reporting period, also had nearly $1.4 million on hand after raising about $659,000 in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nProgressive political commentator Kat Abughazaleh of Chicago both raised big — nearly $1.2 million — and spent big, with $810,000 on hand.\n\nFormer FBI agent Phil Andrew raised about $485,000, including a $200,000 loan from himself, and had $961,000 to start 2026. State Rep. Hoan Huynh of Chicago also boosted his campaign with a $200,000 loan and had about $738,000 on hand, while Gen Z Skokie school board member Bushra Amiwala had about half a million dollars in the bank at the end of the year.\n\nIn recent months, Fine has seemingly received the tacit support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and many of its previous donors, though she has denied seeking the group’s endorsement. State Sen. Mike Simmons of Chicago, who had about $135,000 at the end of the quarter, criticized Fine this week for receiving significant backing from people who had also supported President Donald Trump or AIPAC, which advocates for Israel’s interests and supports both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n“If people who donate to AIPAC are donating to me, it’s because of the fact that they appreciate what I have done and my accomplishments, and they have faith in my candidacy, but I’m pretty darn independent,” Fine said Monday.\n\nAbughazaleh chalked up her spending in part to large initial advertising buys, adding she’s “not trying to save up a war chest for another campaign.”\n\nEconomist Jeff Cohen had more than half a million dollars in the bank and Army veteran Sam Polan had about $139,000, though the majority of each of their contributions throughout the election cycle had come in the form of loans to themselves.\n\n8th Congressional District\n\nIn the 8th Congressional District race, Melissa Bean, who held the office for three terms until 2011, led all candidates with about $1 million on hand to begin 2026, including a nearly $300,00 loan to her campaign.\n\nFollowing her were Junaid Ahmed, who previously challenged Krishnamoorthi, with about $835,000 in his campaign fund, entrepreneur Neil Khot with $573,000, and U.S. Army Reserve Judge Advocate Dan Tully with $412,000. Cook County Board Commissioner Kevin Morrison had roughly $233,000 while Hanover Park Trustee Yasmeen Bankole had $171,000 in his campaign fund. Everyone else had less than $100,000.\n\nKhot loaned his campaign $405,000 in the most recent quarter in addition to an even larger loan in the previous quarter, and Bankole loaned herself $136,000 at that time.\n\nAmong Republicans, entrepreneur Jennifer Davis led in cash on hand with almost $488,000, trailed by energy business founder Mark Rice with $173,000.\n\n2nd Congressional District\n\nCook County Board Commissioner Donna Miller pulled ahead in the 2nd District’s fundraising race this quarter, raising more than $1 million and keeping nearly that much on hand in the district stretching from the South Side to downstate Danville.\n\nState Sen. Robert Peters of Chicago was the second-highest fundraiser with $263,000 in the bank. Jesse Jackson Jr., the former representative for the district who’s trying to launch a comeback after resigning years ago amid a corruption probe, raised $111,000 and had about $90,000 in the bank.\n\nState Sen. Willie Preston of Chicago and Matteson Village Clerk and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Board Commissioner Yumeka Brown each raised five-figure sums last quarter.\n\nEchoing criticisms among candidates in the 9th District, Peters’ campaign called out Miller in a news release Monday for receiving support from donors who had previously given to Trump or to AIPAC and its affiliated super PAC.\n\n7th District\n\nIn the 7th Congressional District, state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who has served in the Illinois House for nearly 20 years and is being endorsed by outgoing incumbent Davis, raised nearly $150,600 in the final three months of 2025 and had more than $307,000 on-hand to start the year. Ford took out a $100,000 personal loan last quarter for his campaign.\n\nThe fundraising front-runner is a repeat from last quarter.\n\nJason Friedman, former president of the property and management company Friedman Properties, leads the contenders in money raised, with $304,000 raised in the fourth quarter. The political outsider candidate has a little over $1 million in his campaign account.\n\nChicago Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, who finished runner-up to Davis in 2024, and former U.S. Department of Justice attorney Reed Showalter both raised six-figure amounts in the fourth quarter. Conyears-Ervin had more than $215,000 in cash on hand, while Showalter had $134,000 left in his campaign account.\n\nA University Medical Chicago Medical Center emergency medical doctor and author, Dr. Thomas Fisher, ended the fourth quarter with nearly $250,000 raised and $455,000 in his campaign bank account. Former Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin raised nearly $200,000. Anabel Mendoza, a Gen Z progressive, quadrupled her fundraising from under $24,000 in the third quarter to nearly $120,000 in the fourth.\n\nActivist Kina Collins, who is making her fourth bid for the 7th District seat after losing the primary in 2022 by six percentage points to Davis, did not report her fundraising on time but in a phone interview, said her reports will be up within the next two days.\n\n4th District\n\nGarcia’s controversial last-second retirement announcement paved the way for his chief of staff Patty Garcia to be the only Democrat on the primary ballot. Patty Garcia, no relation to the congressman, raised $122,500 last quarter.\n\nThough they won’t be challenging Patty Garcia on the primary ballot, independent Mayra Macías, Latino Victory Fund political director, outraised Patty Garcia at $125,000. Democratic Socialist Chicago Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez also announced his independent campaign last week. He reported raising $7,000 so far.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/02/02/illinois-congressional-fundraising-2025/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ctc-l-editorial-9th-distri8795316-e1770070586575.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:24:51","author":"Jack O'connor,Olivia Olander,Robert McCoppin","authors":["Jack O'connor","Olivia Olander","Robert McCoppin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":398779900,"title":"NATO launches long‑term “Arctic Endurance” exercise in Greenland, Denmark says","text":"A major multinational military exercise known as “Arctic Endurance” has begun in Greenland and will continue through the end of 2026.\n\nSoldiers from several NATO member states — including France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Iceland and Belgium — have been in Greenland over the past few weeks conducting preparatory work for the drills.

Reyes of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia pauses Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s termination of TPS for Haitians, \"pending judicial review.\" \"During the stay, the Termination shall be null, void, and of no legal effect,\" Reyes wrote. \"The Termination therefore does not affect the protections and benefits previously conferred by the TPS designation, including work authorization and protection from detention and deportation, and the valid period of work authorization extends during the stay.\" The judge also denied the government's motion to dismiss the case against government's termination of TPS without prejudice. The White House and DHS did not immediately reply to a request for comment following Monday's ruling. TPS allows foreigners to remain in the United States when they might not be able to return to their own country safety and often applies to countries experiencing war, strife or natural disasters. It was set to expire for Haitians Tuesday night. The news came as Haitians across the country were worried about the possibility of immigration enforcement actions, particularly in some communities such as Springfield, Ohio. Haitians and Springfield were thrust into the center of the turmoil over President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement policies when then-candidate Trump repeated unfounded claims on the 2024 campaign trail that Haitian immigrants \"are eating dogs and cats\" and \"eating people's pets,\" which was repeated by then-presidential candidate JD Vance. Local police and the city’s manager refuted the claims saying there was no evidence to support them. Haitians have endured other insults and hostility from Trump, including in 2018 when he referred to Haiti, El Salvador and African nations as “sh--hole countries.” Trump had tried to end Temporary Protected Status for Haitians last summer, but legal challenges forced the administration to set this year’s Feb. 3 deadline. In an email statement on Monday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that “TPS was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.\" “We encourage individuals with TPS to take advantage of the Department’s resources for departure,\" adding that they will be subject to deportation unless they have another lawful basis to remain in the U.S. According to the National Immigration Forum, about 330,000 Haitians were in the U.S. with TPS as of March 2025. Haiti was designated for TPS by then-President Barack Obama in response to the January 2010 magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated the country, killing and wounding more than half a million people and crippled its government. The protection, which is usually in place for a year or more, was extended repeatedly as the country was hit with more natural disasters and political upheaval. In some years, Haiti was re-designated for TPS, opening the protected status to newcomers. Trump tried to end TPS for Haitians in his first term, but court battles kept it from taking effect before he lost re-election in 2020.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-judge-postpones-trump-admins-termination-tps-haitians-rcna257105","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-02/260202-haiti-vigil-tps-vsb-1638-4f8d2c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:22:37","author":"Gary Grumbach,Suzanne Gamboa","authors":["Gary Grumbach","Suzanne Gamboa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":398781666,"title":"Bill, Hillary Clinton agree to testify in US House Epstein probe","text":"Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify in a US House investigation in connection with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesman for the ex-president said early Tuesday (IST).\"The former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,\" Angel Urena said on X.The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein. “After defying lawful subpoenas, Bill and Hillary Clinton are trying to dodge contempt by requesting special treatment. The Clintons are not above the law,” the Oversight Committee posted on X.Clintons had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the disgraced financier.They have now agreed to testify in the US House Epstein probe.The Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.Democrats say the probe is being weaponized to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump -- himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify -- rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.Democratic divisionsNeither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.Republicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in?person questioning under oath.Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.Bill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.The contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats.Some Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein's crimes.But others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump's past contacts with Epstein.The Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.(With inputs from

The reports will all be reviewed to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation.\n\n\"As with any matter, if new and relevant information is brought to our attention we will assess it, and investigate as appropriate.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, who fired Mandelson from his ambassadorial job over earlier revelations about his Epstein ties, is now urging him to quit politics altogether and testify in the US about what he knew of the financier's activities.\n\nStarmer urged Mandelson on Monday to resign from his lifetime seat in the House of Lords _ the UK Parliament's upper chamber - and to give up his noble title, Lord Mandelson.\n\nIf he does not voluntary quit, the alternative would be a lengthy process requiring Parliament to pass legislation.\n\nREAD MORE: US Justice Department says it's taken down Epstein-related files that may have had victim information﻿\n\nNew allegations over Epstein ties\n\nThe latest release of Epstein files includes hundreds of text and email messages exchanged between Mandelson and the financier, revealing the British politician's warm relationship with the man he called \"my best pal\" in 2003.\n\nSeveral documents seem to refer to payments from Epstein to Mandelson or his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. What appear to be bank statements from 2003 and 2004 suggest an Epstein account sent three payments totalling US$75,000 to accounts connected to Mandelson.\n\nMandelson has questioned the authenticity of the bank statements. In a letter to Labour resigning from the party, Mandelson said he had no recollection of receiving that money and would investigate.﻿\n\nThe documents also include an email exchange from 2009 in which Mandelson, then a UK government minister, appeared to tell Epstein he would lobby other members of the government to reduce a tax on bankers' bonuses.\n\nDocuments also suggest Mandelson sent details of sensitive UK government discussions to Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nREAD MORE: Son of Norway's crown princess arrested before rape trial\n\nStarmer on Monday ordered the civil service to conduct an \"urgent\" review of all of Mandelson's contacts with Epstein while he was in government.\n\nAlso among the files is a photo of Mandelson in a shirt and underwear, standing near an unidentified woman in a bathrobe.\n\nWho is Peter Mandelson﻿?\n\nMandelson, has been a major, if contentious, figure in the centre-left UK Labour Party for decades.\n\nHe was an architect of the party's return to power in 1997 as centrist, modernising \"New Labour\" under prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nMandelson served in senior cabinet posts under Blair between 1997 and 2001, and under prime minister Gordon Brown from 2008 to 2010. In between, he was the European Union's trade commissioner.\n\nMandelson twice had to resign from government during the Blair administration over allegations of financial or ethical impropriety, acknowledging mistakes but denying wrongdoing.\n\nHe later returned to government, and was back on the political front line when Starmer named him to the key post of ambassador to Washington at the start of US President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nMandelson's trade expertise and comfort around the ultra-rich were considered major assets with the new US administration. He helped secure a trade deal last May that spared Britain some of the tariffs Trump has imposed on countries around the world.\n\nBut Starmer fired him last September after emails were published showing Mandelson's friendship with Epstein continued even after the financier's 2008 guilty plea.\n\nNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.\n\nDownload the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/epstein-files-peter-mandelson-faces-scrutiny-over-links-to-pedophile/b989f316-780f-4dd2-aff0-b0d7ed9e079e","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/leNfWOKB6dM60GfYUKNo2CoVCWk=/924x490:3754x2082/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F3842aceb-c41d-4aee-82d7-f53671a6f742","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 01:21:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":398781664,"title":"Gold, silver rates today: Gold rises 4%, silver surges 8% after falling four straight sessions","text":"Gold, silver rates today: Gold and silver prices resumed their bull-run on Tuesday, February 3, recovering part of its recent losses after a sharp reversal from a record-setting downward trajectory.Spot gold surged as much as 4% to $4,830 an ounce, meanwhile, spot silver also climbed nearly 8% to $82.74, on Tuesday.Spot gold prices tumbled almost 10% on January 30, marking their sharpest decline since 1983. The drop pushed prices below the landmark $5,000 per ounce level reached just days earlier and erased a large portion of the year’s gains. Silver plunged even worse, falling 27% in the same session—its steepest single-day fall on record.In the past two trading sessions, gold has slided over 13%, while silver has slumped nearly 34%, in the international markets.What's driving the rally in gold and silver?Analysts believes, as quoted by Reuters, that the decline in precious metals came after an overstretched rally, which lifted prices to a record high of $5,594.82 before pulling back to around $4,700—almost $900 lower. The move was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, followed by CME Group’s decision to hike margin requirements for precious metals futures.WisdomTree analysts was quoted as saying by Reuters that the correction may curb speculative buying and open the door for long-term strategic investors to rebalance their positions.Meanwhile, markets are pricing in two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, a factor that should remain supportive for non-yielding gold.Precious metals had surged to all-time highs last month in a swift run-up that surprised even experienced traders. Strong investor demand was driven by renewed fears around geopolitical tensions, currency debasement, and concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence. Heavy buying by Chinese speculators amplified the rally, but momentum reversed on Friday as the US dollar strengthened.According to Bloomberg report, the degree to which Chinese investors step in to buy on declines will be crucial in shaping market direction. Over the weekend, crowds poured into Shenzhen’s largest bullion hub to purchase gold jewellery and bars ahead of the Lunar New Year. China’s markets will shut for a little over a week starting February 16 due to the holiday.Experts still bullish on GoldApurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research, SAMCO Securities, believes that gold has witnessed sharp volatility in recent weeks, with narratives quickly emerging to explain the pullback.“From a price action perspective, the larger trend in gold remains clearly intact. The long-term structure continues to show higher highs and higher lows, and the recent decline looks more like a pause within an ongoing uptrend rather than the start of a reversal. Importantly, prior breakout zones are holding, suggesting that strong hands are still willing to accumulate on dips,” Sheth said.Meanwhile, on the technical outlook, Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said that COMEX Gold is trading near the $4,580–$4,700 key reference zone, cooling off after the sharp spike above $4,900. While the broader market trend remains constructive, the recent vertical rally pushed momentum indicators into overbought territory, leading to heat-driven profit booking and mild price digestion from elevated levels.“Despite this, prices continue to hold above major moving averages, indicating that the ongoing correction is technical and orderly rather than trend-reversing. Strong buying interest is emerging in the $4,500–$4,400 support band, reinforcing this zone as a critical demand base. A sustained consolidation above this area could set the stage for the next leg higher, with a decisive move above $5,000–$5,100 reopening upside toward prior peaks,” Ponmudi said.On the silver outlook, Ponmudi added that COMEX Silver is trading around key consolidation points in the $75–$85 zone, after testing record highs above $121.6. The metal remains within a broader rising structure, but the recent move left prices overbought, resulting in sharp rise–sharp fall price action driven by aggressive profit booking.“Importantly, prices are holding above key moving averages, suggesting the current pause is a healthy consolidation rather than trend exhaustion. Support is placed in the $73–$75 zone, and a sustained breakout above $88–$90 could trigger the next impulsive move toward $100–$105 over the intermediate term. Structural supply deficits and steady industrial demand continue to underpin the bullish bias,” he said.Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.
