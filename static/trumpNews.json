Michael Luttig — who former President George H.W. Bush nominated to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991 — said he was \"struck\" how the colonists' 27 grievances against the British Crown closely resembled Trump's second term. The conservative jurist noted that he wrote about the similarities on Constitution Day last month as a \"sequel\" to a July 4 post comparing Trump to George III, and wrote 26 grievances against Trump in the same vein as the colonists' grievances.\n\n\"The parallels were astonishing and they were striking,\" Luttig said. \"Every person in America should read the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence, and every American will be struck by the grievances then, and the grievances that America has today against the president of the United States.\"\n\nMSNBC host Alicia Melendez asked Luttig about one particular grievance, in which Luttig wrote that Trump has \"enthralled our Supreme Court, spellbinding it into submission to him and his will rather than to the Constitution and its will, and our Supreme Court has favored him with its affirmation and its acquiescence in his lawlessness.\" The judge responded that he chose the word \"enthrall\" specifically because of its use as a word describing \"slavery or bondage.\" \n\nLuttig observed that former President Abraham Lincoln called on Americans to \"disenthrall themselves from the dogma of the past\" in an 1862 speech prior to his issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation. According to Luttig, the Supreme Court has become inexorably tied to Trump, and that the two institutions now effectively act as one unified force.\n\n\"[Lincoln] was saying to Americans that they needed to disenthrall themselves from the dogma of the past and recognize that the moral thing to do was to release slaves from bondage,\" Luttig said. \" ... So to answer your question, how does the Supreme Court become disenthralled from the president? I don't believe that it wants to.\"\n\nThe former appellate judge went on to say that the Supreme Court was in the midst of a \"crisis\" of legitimacy. He argued that while lower court judges have abided by their oaths to the Constitution and written \"unassailable opinions of law and of Constitutional law almost all ruling against Donald Trump,\" the Supreme Court has disregarded those rulings with \"emergency docket\" (also known as \"shadow docket\") rulings that offer no rationale or explanation for doing so.\n\n\"When the Court acts that way — and it has never acted that way in all of American history — it is squandering itrs own legitimacy,\" Luttig said. \"And as long as the court continues to 'decide' cases this way, its legitimacy will continue to plummet in the eyes of the American people.\"\n\nWatch Luttig's segment below:\n\n - YouTube www.youtube.com","summary":"One retired federal judge is urging Americans to read the Declaration of Independence and note the similarities between King George III and President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a Wednesday interview on MSNBC's \"The Weeknight,\" J.

Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,” Department of Homeland advisor Corey Lewandowski said during an interview aired Wednesday with Benny Johnson’s The Benny Show.\n\n“We will find you,” he continued. “We will apprehend you. We will put you in a detention facility, and we will deport you. So know that that is a very real situation under this administration, which is completely contrary to what how it used to be.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted the NFL for comment.\n\n“There is no safe haven for violent criminal illegal aliens in the United States,” a DHS spokesperson told The Independent when asked if immigration agents would be at the game. \n\nThe comments came as Lewandowski was discussing the selection of Bad Bunny to play the halftime show during the bowl match-up, set to take place at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. \n\nDuring a recent interview with i-D magazine, the artist, one of the most popular singers in the world, said one reason he avoided U.S. stops on a recent world tour was out of fear his fan base would be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate—I’ve performed there many times,” said, adding, “But there was the issue of—like, f***ing ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”\n\nAt the time of Bad Bunny’s comments, Homeland Security officials dismissed the notion of immigration agents showing up at a concert in the U.S.\n\n\"Bad Bunny is either seriously misinformed about ICE operations or is using law enforcement as an excuse because he won't be able to sell tickets in the United States,” a DHS official told NPR. “ICE is not raiding concert venues. Pop stars choosing to fearmonger and demonize ICE law enforcement are contributing to the nearly 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE officers.”\n\nOutside of the immigration comments, some on the right have taken issue with Bad Bunny’s selection as the half-time performer, pointing to his past criticisms of Donald Trump, his mostly Spanish-language songs, and his choice to defy gender norms through fashion.\n\nJohnson, in previous comments, called Bad Bunny a “Massive Trump hater” and an “anti-ICE activist,” whose selection showed the NFL was “self-destructing.”\n\nMeanwhile, Robbie Starbuck of the conservative Heritage Foundation accused the NFL of “pushing left-wing social issues.” \n\n“Is it that hard to pick a unifying music act who doesn't want to peddle woke propaganda? Does this guy really scream American football to anyone? Be for real with me,” Starbuck said. “No one thinks he does. This isn't about music, it's about putting a guy on stage who hates Trump and MAGA.”","summary":"Selection of Puerto Rican rapper has outraged prominent Trump supporters, who take issue with singer’s past criticism of president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-super-bowl-bad-bunny-trump-b2837710.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/30/15/BAD_BUNNY_80793.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PO78cYye-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-02 00:51:53","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":365349548,"title":"A Papal Intervention and a Canceled Award: What (If Anything) Did Pope Leo XIV’s Comments Have to Do with Sen. Durbin’s Decision?","text":"It all went down with breakneck speed: a papal intervention into a weekslong controversy in the Pontiff’s home city, followed just hours later by the abrupt end of the controversy in question. The next day, Catholics are still trying to understand what just happened.\n\nA tumultuous five hours on Tuesday began at about 2 p.m. ET, when an EWTN Vatican journalist asked Pope Leo XIV to address the ongoing controversy over Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich’s plan to give a “lifetime achievement award” to Sen. Dick Durbin, a baptized Catholic who has long advocated and voted for legalized abortion.\n\nBack home in the U.S., the controversy had dominated headlines for nearly two weeks. Eight sitting diocesan bishops had publicly asked Cardinal Cupich to rescind the award over concerns that it would compromise the Church’s pro-life witness, a rarity for a group of men who tend to keep their disagreements private. \n\nFurthermore, the story was front and center for Catholic media outlets across the ecclesial spectrum. It had even been picked up by secular media, including The Associated Press. \n\nThe Pope’s Response\n\nEWTN Vatican’s query was the last of several questions posed to Pope Leo by members of the media during what have become regular weekly conversations between the Pope and the press as he arrives at Castel Gandolfo, where he typically spends his Tuesdays. \n\n“I wanted to ask one thing that has become a divisive subject in the U.S. right now, with Cardinal Cupich giving an award to Sen. Durbin,” asked the reporter, Valentina Di Donato. “Some people are having a hard time understanding this because he is for legalized abortion. How would you help people of faith right now decipher that, feel about that, and how do you feel about that?”\n\nIn his response, Pope Leo XIV began by noting that he was “not terribly familiar with the particular case” before adding that “it’s important to look at the overall work that a senator has done during, if I’m not mistaken, in 40 years of service in the United States Senate.”\n\n“I understand the difficulty and the tensions,” said Pope Leo XIV. “But I think as I myself have spoken in the past, it’s important to look at many issues that are related to the teachings of the Church.”\n\nThe Pope continued: “Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion’ but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,” the Pope explained. “Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”\n\n“So they are very complex issues, and I don’t know if anyone has all the truth on them,” he said, “but I would ask, first and foremost, that they would have respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, and in that case as American citizens and citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics, to say that we need to be close to all of these ethical issues. And to find the way forward as a Church. The Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear.”\n\nStrong Reactions\n\nPope Leo’s response sparked strong reactions back home in the United States. Some suggested that by emphasizing the need to look at all aspects of the Church’s social teaching, Pope Leo was clearly giving reason to question the logic of honoring a pro-abortion senator. \n\n“The question is whether Durbin is pro-life,” wrote Phil Lawler at Catholic Culture. “By the Pope’s own statement, he is not. … Therefore Durbin should not be honored by a Catholic institution. Case closed.\"\n\nBut others contended that by shifting the focus to self-identified pro-lifers who don’t follow Church teaching on immigration or the death penalty, the Pope was giving cover for the award. \n\nFor instance, a headline from Politico read: “Pope Leo defends Church honoring Durbin.” \n\n But just hours after the Pope’s comments hit the wire, the debate over the meaning of his words was diverted. Because at about 7 p.m. ET, Cardinal Cupich announced that Durbin “had decided not to receive” the award. “While I am saddened by this news, I respect his decision,” said Cardinal Cupich in a two-page statement, adding that the award had been meant to recognize the Illinois Democrat’s “singular contribution to immigration reform and his unwavering support of immigrants.” Cardinal Cupich also lamented that neither major political party in the U.S. embraces the totality of the Church’s social teaching, adding that his outreach had been an attempt to encourage Durbin to “extend [his] good work to other areas and issues.” \n\nLingering Questions\n\nThe immediate controversy seems effectively over. But in the aftermath, people are still wondering what, if anything, Pope Leo’s comments and the subsequent announcement of Durbin’s decision had to do with each other.\n\nDid Pope Leo XIV request that Cardinal Cupich’s award to Sen. Durbin be spiked? Or was the fact that the senator declined the award mere hours after the Pope’s comments purely coincidence?\n\nDespite speculation being rife on social-media platforms like X, these, and other related questions, remain unanswered. But other relevant facts have emerged that add some important context.\n\nAt the end of last week, multiple sources had told the Register that the only likely “off-ramp” for Cardinal Cupich to not go through with giving the award would be for Durbin to decline it, given that the Chicago cardinal had already doubled down on his intent to give the award despite criticism. \n\nFurthermore, The Pillar reported late last night that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was preparing to release a statement on the Durbin-Cupich situation, after several bishops had written into the conference requesting that the controversy be addressed. The report indicated that the apostolic nuncio, Cardinal Christoph Pierre, had been made aware of the development. Citing unnamed bishops, The Pillar also suggested that Cardinal Cupich may have shut down the award so as not to be seen as opposed by the USCCB, or because the nuncio had urged him to do so.\n\nBut while the controversy over the Durbin award might be over, what isn’t is the deep-seated divergence between some U.S bishops on the priority abortion should or should not have in their advocacy. \n\nIn November 2023, the USCCB voted to reaffirm that abortion is their “preeminent priority,” given its scope and the fact that it targets the most vulnerable members of the human family. \n\nBut a minority of bishops, including Cardinal Cupich, have long advocated for removing the “preeminent” language, arguing that in a polarized society, it undermines advocacy on other issues like immigration or care for creation.\n\nThis divide between the bishops will likely be in the background next month at the USCCB’s November meeting in Baltimore. \n\nSo, too, will questions of Pope Leo’s own priorities as they relate to the Church and society in the United States, especially considering that the bishops are set to elect a new conference president to a three-year term.\n\nAs Pope Leo has said in a Sept. 14 interview, he wants to influence American politics and society by engaging “with the bishops primarily,” as opposed to the more direct approach Pope Francis often took with figures like President Donald Trump. To do so will require good bilateral relations between the Pope and the bishops’ conference of his native land. That relationship will be defined in a major way at the upcoming USCCB meeting, which will now be colored by the dispute American Catholics just saw play out between their bishops.","summary":"news","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/news/liedl-cupich-durbin-situation-aftermath","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20251001161020_c211ff8b5910ea6e29e1f422cb3993767369f943e83850b49b4f10e5e62f3995.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 00:47:08","author":"Jonathan Liedl","authors":["Jonathan Liedl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":365349052,"title":"Bondi and Hegseth rally federal agents and troops in Memphis as part of crime task force","text":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Wednesday rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force that has begun operating in Memphis as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting plan for the city.The officials met with Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican who has supported the project, before touring a staging area for the Memphis Safe Task Force and then speaking to a group of federal, state and local law enforcement officers and Tennessee National Guard members.Miller called the task force an “all of government, unlimited support operation” that would make the city “safer than any of you could ever possibly imagine.” He predicted that “businesses and investment are going to pour in, and Memphis will be richer than ever before.”“We’re not here to second guess you,” Hegseth told them. “We’re here to have your back — to unleash you to do your jobs so you come home safely.”Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, who represents Memphis in Congress, said he was disappointed to learn about the visit in the media. In a letter to Hegseth and Bondi, he urged them to be more collaborative and expressed concern about the “wartime rhetoric” coming from the Trump administration.“Memphians are not enemies; they are Americans,” Cohen said. “They are entitled to constitutional rights, not their government working to ‘intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill’ them. We are not a training ground or target practice.”The task force is part of a larger effort by Trump to use National Guard troops and surge federal law enforcement in cities, particularly ones controlled by Democrats. Following troop deployments in the District of Columbia and Los Angeles, he referred to Portland, Oregon, as “war-ravaged” and threatened apocalyptic force in Chicago. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, Trump proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.RELATED STORY | Trump ally Gov. Landry urges National Guard deployment across Louisiana citiesBondi said in a social media post earlier in the day that the task force has made more than 50 arrests over a two-day period. More than 200 officers have been deputized, including personnel from immigration and drug enforcement. They are serving criminal arrest warrants and teaming with state agencies on traffic stops.Memphis should expect to see an increase in warrant enforcement, especially for violent criminals, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Ryan Guay said in an email. The Marshals Service will release periodic updates that include arrest numbers, types of charges and participating agencies, he said.Tennessee National Guard troops will help Memphis Police, Lee has said, but it is unclear how soon that will begin. Lee does not expect more than 150 National Guard members to be sent to Memphis. The city has said there will be no tanks, and the governor said troops will not make arrests or be armed unless local authorities request it.Memphis has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted decreases this year in some crime categories.Opponents of the deployment say it is an unnecessary federal occupation of a majority-Black city that instead needs more funding to address poverty and other drivers of crime. Supporters see it as a welcomed infusion of law enforcement for a city that still needs help battling violence.Across the country in Oregon, meanwhile, members of that state's National Guard reported for duty Wednesday. The troops were “preparing to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property in Oregon,” the Pentagon said in a statement.It could be several days before they are deployed to federal buildings, the Oregon Military Department’s director for government and legislative affairs, Russell Gibson, told state lawmakers Tuesday. The troops will come from a military police company and an infantry company, he said.Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is attempting to block the deployment, with a hearing in the case scheduled for Friday.Federal agents have conducted hundreds of immigration arrests in Chicago since last month, primarily through traffic stops and targeting day laborers and homes in predominantly Latino and immigrant-heavy neighborhoods.At least 37 people were arrested early Tuesday at an apartment building in the predominantly Black South Shore neighborhood. The location was chosen due to alleged connections to the Tren de Aragua gang, the Department of Homeland Security said.Immigrant rights activists called it further escalation of an operation that has seen armed Border Patrol agents make arrests at famous downtown landmarks. Illinois leaders say they are also bracing for the administration to dispatch military troops.","summary":"Trump administration officials on Wednesday rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force that has begun operating in Memphis, Tennessee.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/bondi-and-hegseth-rally-federal-agents-and-troops-in-memphis-as-part-of-crime-task-force","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5196f91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3525x1851+0+312/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd8%2Fc3%2F0e6906694d23ad44788dd09dca55%2Fap25274815681594.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 00:46:19","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":365349024,"title":"Activists say Israeli navy has begun intercepting Gaza-bound aid flotilla","text":"Article content\n\nJERUSALEM — Activists on board a flotilla of vessels sailing toward Gaza said late Wednesday that the Israeli navy had intercepted three of its boats as they approached the besieged Palestinian territory. Israeli authorities said the activists on board, including Greta Thunberg, were safe and being transferred to Israel.\n\nThe Global Sumud Flotilla, composed of nearly 50 boats and 500 activists, is carrying a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The Sirius, Alma and Adara boats were intercepted some 70 nautical miles (80 miles) from the coast of Gaza, according to organizers who shared live positions of the flotilla. The group, which includes Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Mandla Mandela, former Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau and several European lawmakers, said it remained undeterred in its mission to break the Israeli blockade and bring aid to Palestinians.\n\nGreg Stoker, an American veteran aboard the Ohwayla, one of the boats in the flotilla, said that around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached it. “They are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,” he said in a shaky video posted on Instagram. Israeli authorities used water cannons against some of the boats, Stoker and other activists reported on social media.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing Thunberg sitting on a ship’s deck being handed a water bottle and raincoat. “Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,” it said.\n\nItaly’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said the Israeli operation was expected to take 2-3 hours. He told state TV Rai that the boats would be towed to Israel’s port of Ashdod and the activists would be deported in the coming days. He also said Israeli forces have been told “not to use violence.”\n\nTurkey’s Foreign Ministry condemned Israel’s interception of the boats denouncing it as an “act of terrorism” and severe breach of international law. In a statement, the ministry said it was taking initiatives to ensure the immediate release of Turkish citizens and other passengers detained by the Israeli forces.\n\nFlotilla enters ‘danger zone’\n\nThe vessels were sailing in international waters north of Egypt and had entered what activists and others called a “danger zone.” While still in international waters, it is an area where the Israeli navy has stopped other boats attempting to break its blockade in the past and which the flotilla has been warned not to cross.\n\nAfter a tense encounter with two Israeli military vessels in the early hours of Wednesday, activists had resumed their journey and were broadcasting their voyage on livestreams from several of the boats. Some activists held up messages of solidarity with people in Gaza and chanted “Free Palestine!” on camera. Music could be heard playing in the background.\n\nAs night fell, they detected via radar several unidentified vessels approaching them and put their life vests on ahead of the Israeli military’s imminent arrival. Some activists were able to broadcast the moment Israeli forces approached them live from their smartphones before tossing their devices into the water.\n\nThe flotilla, which began its journey from the Spanish port of Barcelona a month ago, was to reach the shores of Gaza by Thursday morning, organizers had said earlier.\n\nActivists had acknowledged that scenario was unlikely and were expecting Israeli authorities to try to stop them at any moment, as they have done in past attempts.\n\nBut this flotilla, with dozens of boats, was the largest attempt yet to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza strip that has been ongoing for 18 years.\n\nIsrael, other governments warned them to turn back\n\nThe Israeli navy had reached out to the flotilla earlier Wednesday warning them that they were approaching an “active combat zone” and asking them to change course, the Israeli foreign ministry said, reiterating its offer to transfer the aid to Gaza through other channels. Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the flotilla a provocation.\n\nIsrael’s government has accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Activists have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.\n\nEuropean governments, including Spain and Italy, which had sent their navy ships to escort the flotilla during part of its journey, urged the activists to turn back and avoid confrontation. But while Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday the flotilla’s actions risked undermining U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent proposal for resolving the war in Gaza, Spain’s prime minister defended them.\n\n“We must remember it is a humanitarian mission that wouldn’t be taking place if the Israeli government had allowed for the entry of aid,” Pedro Sanchez told reporters on Wednesday. Spaniards taking part would benefit from full diplomatic protection, he added.\n\n“They present no threat nor danger to Israel,” he said.\n\nWhat international maritime law says\n\nThe U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state only has jurisdiction up to 12 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from its shores. In general, states don’t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception to this.\n\nYuval Shany, an expert on international law at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said that as long as Israel’s blockade of Gaza is “militarily justified” — meant to keep out weapons — and the ship intended to break the siege, Israel can intercept the vessel after prior warning. Whether the blockade is militarily justified and the legality of the blockade is a point of contention.\n\nBut the flotilla argues they are a civilian, unarmed group and that the passage of humanitarian aid is guaranteed in international law.\n\nOmer Shatz, an Israeli international law expert who teaches at Sciences Po University in Paris and co-litigated a previous flotilla case before the Israeli supreme court, told The Associated Press that even if the disputed siege of Gaza was considered lawful, “international law paves a humanitarian road from the high seas to Gaza — both in international and national waters off Gaza,” he said.\n\n“If the basic needs of the population are not provided by the occupying power, there is a right to provide humanitarian aid, albeit under certain conditions,” Shatz said. Israel, for example, would have a right to board and search the vessels carrying aid to verify its cargo, similarly to what it does with aid trucks crossing into Gaza by land.\n\n Share this Story : Activists say Israeli navy has begun intercepting Gaza-bound aid flotilla Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","summary":"JERUSALEM &#8212; Activists on board a flotilla of vessels sailing toward Gaza said late Wednesday that the Israeli navy had intercepted three of its boats as they approached the besieged Palestinian territory.

In the announcement, the President claimed there may be a connection between paracetamol use during pregnancy and what he referred to as an \"autism epidemic.\" \"Don’t take Tylenol\", he said \"Fight like hell not to take it,\" he added. His comments have quickly drawn criticism from health professionals, scientists and families of autistic children who say the claim is not only unfounded but harmful. HELLO! speaks to the experts about these claims. \n\nIs there a link between Tylenol and autism?\n\nThe suggestion that Tylenol, known in many countries as paracetamol, could cause autism has been around for more than a decade. While a handful of observational studies have explored the possibility, experts are quick to clarify that there is no proven cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nAssociate Professor Vinay Rane, an Australian doctor and lawyer, has worked extensively in women’s health. He says: \"The American President recently raised the idea of a link between Tylenol use in pregnancy and autism. These sorts of concerns are not new. For more than a decade researchers have examined whether paracetamol, also known as Tylenol, could be associated with conditions such as autism or ADHD when used in pregnancy. A small number of observational studies have hinted at a possible connection, but they do not prove causation. They simply highlight patterns that may be influenced by many other factors.\"\n\nAccording to Vinay, paracetamol continues to be one of the most trusted medications used during pregnancy. \"Paracetamol remains one of the most widely used medications in pregnancy, largely because alternatives carry greater risks. Its record of safety stretches across generations and continents.\"\n\nHe explains that the real challenge for researchers is separating the effect of the drug from the reasons it is taken. \"Pregnant women may use paracetamol to treat fever, infection or significant pain. Those conditions alone can affect pregnancy outcomes and child development. That is why large reviews and health authorities consistently advise that paracetamol, used in moderation and only when needed, remains the safest option available.\"\n\nWhat the experts advise\n\nWhile science continues to evolve, doctors agree that alarmist claims can do more harm than good. For Vinay, the greater danger is not Tylenol, but the fear surrounding it.\n\n\"The greater danger lies not in the careful use of Tylenol but in the fear that surrounds it. If expectant mothers are discouraged from treating fever or severe pain, both mother and baby may face real harm. Uncontrolled fever has been linked to preterm labour, birth complications and long-term developmental risks,\" he says.\n\n\"The science is evolving and will continue to be debated. But the discussion is not new. For now, the most reliable advice remains unchanged. Tylenol, taken at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary time, is safe in pregnancy. Alarmist claims risk doing more damage than the medicine itself. If you have pain or fever in pregnancy, please seek treatment.\"\n\nA mother’s perspective on autism\n\nFor families already dealing with an autism diagnosis, Trump’s comments have landed like a punch to the gut. Tanya Forster, a psychologist and the CEO of the Macquarie Health Collective, is also the mother of a young autistic boy. She says the former President’s remarks are not only misleading but emotionally damaging.\n\n\"As a psychologist and also as a mum of a little boy with autism, I find Donald Trump’s claims about paracetamol and autism pretty mind blowing,\" she says. \"Research has not demonstrated a singular cause for autism. It’s a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with a strong genetic basis, often running in families or associated with broader genetic conditions. To suggest that one over-the-counter pain reliever is responsible is far too simplistic and not supported by credible large-scale studies.\"\n\nBut it is the impact on parents that Tanya finds most concerning. \"What worries me most about these kinds of statements is the damage they do to families. Parents of autistic children already feel enormous pressure and guilt. To imply that they ‘caused’ their child’s autism because they took Panadol is not just wrong, it’s incredibly unfair.\"\n\nWhy autism diagnoses are increasing\n\nTrump also claimed there is an \"autism epidemic,\" a term that has been widely criticised by experts and advocates. Forster believes what we are really seeing is something far more hopeful.\n\n\"This so-called autism epidemic that Trump refers to? What we’re really seeing is the result of more awareness, less stigma, and better access to assessment,\" she explains. \"More children being diagnosed earlier is actually a good thing. It means they can access support sooner, and we know early intervention changes lives.\"\n\nWhat parents need to hear \n\nIn the face of panic-inducing misinformation, Tanya wants to reassure parents who may be feeling confused or fearful.\n\n\"I want parents to know this: autism is not something to be ashamed of. It’s not something caused by anything you did or didn’t do. Your child’s brain simply works in a different way. What changes outcomes isn’t blaming or stigmatising. It’s support, love and early intervention.\"\n\nShe believes public figures have a responsibility to lead with care and compassion, especially when discussing complex medical topics that touch so many lives. \"These comments are upsetting, but they do not define your child, your parenting, or your family. What matters most is creating a world where autistic children are understood, accepted, and supported to thrive. We should be focusing on supporting families and creating a more inclusive society, not fuelling fear with unfounded claims.\"\n\nStick to the science\n\nWhile the current administration may amplify theories with little scientific merit, health professionals are urging parents to stay calm and informed. Paracetamol remains the most widely recommended pain relief option in pregnancy, and leading researchers agree that using it in moderation is safe. The suggestion that Tylenol causes autism is not backed by reliable evidence. For those with questions, always speak to your GP, rely on evidence-based advice, and try not to let fear outweigh the facts.\n\nExpert bios\n\n Tanya Forster is a psychologist and CEO of the Macquarie Health Collective\n Associate Professor Vinay Rane is an Australian doctor and lawyer.

They played it on repeat in the White House briefing room, though Vance promised that the “sombrero memes will stop” when the government reopens.\n\nJeffries responded with a meme of his own superimposing an image of Vance with a fat head and curly, long hair. “JD Vance thinks we will surrender to the Republican effort to gut healthcare because of a Sombrero meme. Not happening Bro,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X.\n\nVance said he couldn’t predict how long the shutdown might go on, but also said he didn’t believe it would be lengthy because some moderate Senate Democrats might soon vote with GOP colleagues to restore funding.\n\n“Let’s be honest, if this thing drags on for another few days or, God forbid, another few weeks, we are going to have to lay people off,” Vance said.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that Trump has refused to negotiate in good faith and that the claims of Democrats closing the government for immigrants in the country illegally is a lie.\n\n“Donald Trump says it loud and clear: He is using the American people as pawns, threatening pain on the country as blackmail,” Schumer said.\n\nRoughly 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired. Many offices were being shuttered, perhaps permanently, as the Republican president vows to “do things that are irreversible” to punish Democrats.\n\nThe White House’s key policy priorities, including an aggressive deportation agenda, may continue with few disruptions. But education, environmental and other services may eventually sputter. The economic fallout could further imperil an already weakening job market, as a jobs report Wednesday by payroll processor ADP showed that private employers cut 32,000 jobs last month.\n\nThe Trump administration has also begun targeting funding projects in Democratic states.\n\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought announced Wednesday a hold on roughly $18 billion in payments to build the Hudson Rail Tunnel and the Second Avenue subway line in New York City, two projects dear to Schumer. He later announced that almost $8 billion in green energy projects would be withheld for 16 states, all states represented by two Democrats in the Senate.\n\nMixed polling\n\nThe last government shutdown came in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump’s first administration. It centered on a fight between both parties over funding for a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border and lasted more than 30 days. But Congress had already passed separate funding measures then that ensured that shutdown only partially affected government services, and wasn’t as widespread as this one might be.\n\nTrump took most of the blame for the last shutdown, with an AP-NORC poll conducted during it, showing about 7 in 10 Americans said Donald Trump had “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility.\n\nThis time, about two-thirds of registered voters in a recent New York Times/Siena poll conducted before the shutdown said the Democrats should not allow the government to halt even if their demands were not met.\n\nStill, Republicans as the party in power could also face blowback. About one-quarter of registered voters in that poll said they would blame Trump and the Republicans in Congress if a shutdown happened, while about 2 in 10 said they would place blame on congressional Democrats. About one-third said they’d blame both sides equally.\n\nShutdown starts taking hold\n\nFederal courts will remain fully operational at least through Oct. 17, and potentially life-saving forecasting by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its National Weather Service haven’t been disrupted.\n\nBut tours of the Liberty Bell were scrapped, and St. Louis’ Gateway Arch and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston closed. Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Hawaii began Wednesday shuttered, though officials were working with nonprofit partners to get it reopen.\n\nAt Acadia National Park in Maine, which gets 4 million visits a year, would-be hikers in search of trail maps checked empty receptacles outside the closed visitors center. With no park rangers in sight, Jim Feather of Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, and his wife were unsure about trying to tackle Cadillac Mountain, with its panoramic views of the North Atlantic coast.\n\n“It’s frustrating that they’re playing politics in D.C.,” Feather said. “Their job is to pass a budget. And if they’re not doing their job, what are they doing down there?”\n\nAssociated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst and Darlene Superville in Washington, Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu, Alexa St. John in Detroit and Robert F.

'But now that we're empty nesters it's like, well, what are we going to talk about? We're together all day.'\n\nMichelle said often if either of them have a story, they'll save it to share over dinner to keep the conversation alive then.\n\nBut she also admitted to other problems at the dinner table, expressing sometimes she wants to 'smack' Obama in the head because of the way he chews food.\n\n'The way you're chewing makes me want to smack you up the head. Why is your chewing annoying me so much?'\n\nWhile her comments appeared lighthearted and prompted a warm response from Dr Guralnik, Kelly said she was gobsmacked by the revelation.\n\n'She cannot stand him,' Kelly said on her own podcast after Michelle's had aired.\n\n'First of all, she had a couple's therapist, which is very interesting, her selection of guests, and Barack wasn't there.\n\n'She says it like we're all gonna relate to sitting there at the dinner table with daggers in your eyes towards your husband or your mate, like he's disgusting.'\n\nKelly went on a tangent speaking negatively about Michelle's hair before returning to the Obama's relationship to close out the discussion: 'These two can't stand each other. That's the bottom line.' \n\nOver the past few months they have faced ongoing rumors about their marriage.\n\nThe rumor mill swirled after her decision to skip both Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration - but Michelle insisted both snubs were about putting herself first. \n\nHer absence at the high-profile political events stoked divorce rumors, as did Obama's admission in April that he was in a 'deep deficit' with his wife.\n\nSpeaking with historian David Olusoga in London last week, Obama fueled rumors further when he admitted he had spent the last few years 'digging myself out of the hole I found myself with Michelle.\n\n'Now I'm at about level ground.'\n\nIn July, they addressed divorce rumors on the podcast. \n\n'There hasn't been one moment in our marriage where I thought about quitting my man,' Michelle said passionately about Barack.\n\nShe continued: 'And we've had some really hard times. So we had a lot of fun times, a lot of adventures, and I have become a better person because of the man I'm married to.","summary":"Michelle Obama invited Dr Orna Guralnik onto the podcast she co-hosts with her brother, Craig Robinson, to discuss marriage and relationships.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15153851/megyn-kelly-michelle-obama-marriage-orna-guralnik.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/01/23/102624831-0-image-m-85_1759358732614.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:41:35","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":365346640,"title":"Trump freezes $26 Billion as shutdown battle hits $1.7 trillion budget fight","text":"On Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s administration froze $26 billion for Democratic-leaning states. This included $18 billion for transit projects in New York and $8 billion for green-energy projects in 16 Democratic-run states such as California and Illinois. Vice President JD Vance warned that if the shutdown lasts more than a few days, the administration might expand its purge of federal workers.Trump’s moves showed he was serious about using the shutdown to punish political opponents and take stronger control of the $7 trillion federal budget, even though the U.S. Constitution says Congress controls the budget. The shutdown is the 15th since 1981. It stopped scientific research, financial oversight, environmental cleanup, and many other federal activities, as per the report by Reuters.Federal workers hit by shutdownAround 750,000 federal workers were told not to work. Troops and Border Patrol agents had to keep working but without pay. The Department of Veterans Affairs said it would still do burials at national cemeteries but would not put up headstones or mow the grass. Vance said if the shutdown goes on, the government will need to make layoffs, adding to the 300,000 federal workers already scheduled to lose their jobs by December. Previous shutdowns did not include permanent layoffs. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said it would lay off about 1% of its 14,000 workers, according to an internal letter seen by Reuters. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said freezing New York’s subway and harbor funds would throw thousands of people out of work. Political blame game in shutdownSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump was hurting regular people just to win politically. He said, \"He is using the American people as pawns, threatening pain on the country as blackmail.\" Republican Senator Thom Tillis said the freeze could make it harder to end the shutdown. He said, \"They need to be really careful with that, because they can create a toxic environment here\", as stated by Reuters report.Live EventsRepublican Senate Leader John Thune dismissed those concerns. He said, \"Well, vote to open up the government and that issue goes away, right? I mean, it's pretty straightforward.\" Jeffries said Democrats have had no contact with the White House since meeting Trump earlier in the week. He told CNN, \"We haven't heard from the White House since the White House meeting on Monday. Clearly, they wanted to shut the government down.\"The Senate again failed to pass measures to reopen the government. A Republican plan to fund the government until November 21 was rejected, and a Democratic plan that added health benefits also failed. Republicans hold a 53–47 majority in the Senate, but they need at least seven Democrats to reach the 60-vote requirement for spending bills.Fight over $1.7 trillion budget and shutdown blameThe main fight is over $1.7 trillion for agency operations, which is about one-quarter of the yearly federal budget. Most of the rest of the budget goes to health, retirement programs, and interest on the $37.5 trillion U.S. debt. During the Senate vote, a bipartisan group of senators tried to find a solution. Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia said, \"I want to see that a deal is a deal, and I would like to see the Republicans make a commitment to work with us on health care\", as per the report by Reuters.Democrats also want guarantees that Trump cannot ignore spending bills he signs into law. They said he has ignored them repeatedly since coming back to office. Both sides blamed each other for the shutdown, hoping to gain an edge before the 2026 midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Democrats argued that Republicans are responsible because they control power in Washington. Republicans said Democrats were just refusing to support Trump, even though they had backed similar spending bills in the past. They also repeated a false claim that the Democratic plan would give health coverage to undocumented immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office clarified that the Democratic plan would only restore coverage to some legal immigrants, including asylum seekers and people with work visas. Several federal agencies posted notices on their websites blaming the \"radical left\" for the shutdown. Experts said this may violate the Hatch Act, which is supposed to keep government services non-political. The longest shutdown in U.S. history lasted 35 days in 2018–2019 during Trump’s first term. It ended partly because flight delays grew after air traffic controllers started calling in sick, according to the report by Reuters.FAQsQ1.

You have a great staff and your writers and your show are absolutely fantastic. And I mean that. I'm not just saying that because we're on TV and I hope you know that. And I think you're a great person,\" Kimmel told Colbert, 61.\n\n \"But I will say, the first 10 members of your staff came right up to me and said, 'I will leave today if you hire me,' \" he added.\n\n Colbert took the comment in stride, smiling as his audience laughed along. \"As well they should,\" he said of his staff.\n\n \"Matter of fact, are you hiring? Because I'm available in June if you need. I'll be Guillermo's sidekick if that's OK,\" he joked. \"Happy to do that.\"\n\n Elsewhere during their discussion, Kimmel told Colbert that what happened to his staff was \"terrible\" and a \"shame,\" noting that they \"do such a great show and people love the show.\"\n\n Colbert added that the Late Show team is the \"greatest group of people I've ever worked with\" and that it took \"20 years to put this team together.\"\n\n The banter between Kimmel and Colbert comes over two months after Colbert revealed his Late Show would be wrapping in May. He made the announcement during his July 17 episode. CBS told PEOPLE in a statement at the time that the move — which came days after Colbert slammed CBS’ parent company Paramount for giving Donald Trump $16 million in a settlement — was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\n The Trump settlement occurred while Paramount was in the midst of a merger with the entertainment company Skydance, which required approval from Trump's administration. That merger was completed on Aug. 7.\n\n Kimmel has since supported Colbert amid the news, writing on his Instagram Stories, \"Love you Stephen. F--- you and all your Sheldons CBS.\" He also encouraged Emmy voters to vote for Colbert in the Outstanding Talk Series category by putting up a billboard in L.A. Colbert's show won the Emmy on Sept. 14.\n\n Elsewhere during Kimmel and Colbert's late-night appearances on Tuesday, Kimmel shared some more insight into his own show's temporary hiatus for a week, as Colbert shared his admiration for his friend.\n\n \"I'm so happy that your show is back on the air,\" Colbert said. \"Because we've known each other for 20 years but we've only really gotten to know each other well the last few years.\"\n\n \"And I just gotta catch up on getting to know you because the more I get to know you, the more I admire you as a leader, I know you as a friend and, here's something I didn't know, is that you're funny.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n The Late Show will end in May 2026 after 10 seasons.

However, the show’s suspension later drew widespread discussion over free speech.\n\nWhen Kimmel was off the air, Fallon addressed the situation on The Tonight Show at the time, saying, “I don’t know what’s going on — no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he is a decent, funny and loving guy. And I hope he comes back.”\n\nThough Fallon tries to limit his political commentary on his show, he still occasionally gets dragged into the conversation by President Donald Trump, who has said he wants The Tonight Show host fired as well.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nRosario Dawson\n\n‘Charlotte’s Web’ Review: Amy Adams and Elijah Wood Lead HBO Max’s Middling Adaptation of a Timeless Kid-Lit Classic\n\nNielsen Kicks Off Big Data Era With Revamped Weekly Ratings Reports\n\nWhy ‘The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox’ Ended on an Ambiguous Confession\n\nThursday Night Football\n\nHow to Watch ‘Thursday Night Football’ Without Cable\n\nMoney Heist\n\nMad About Madrid: How the Spanish Capital Became a Global Screen Hub\n\nFriends and Lovers\n\nEric Jerome Dickey’s ‘Friends and Lovers’ to Be Adapted as Two-Part Lifetime Movie (Exclusive)\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

(Photo by TheStewartofNY/FilmMagic)\n\nLewandowski told right-wing podcast Benny Johnson there is “nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally, not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,” posing a warning to those living in the U.S. illegally that ICE will “apprehend you and put you in a detention facility and deport you.”\n\nLewandowski said the NFL is “so shameful” for picking Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime performer, characterizing the rapper, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, as “somebody who seems to hate America.”\n\nThe Trump adviser suggested a different act could have been chosen for the halftime show, telling Johnson there are other entertainers “who could be playing at that show that would be bringing people together and not separating them.”\n\n“I don’t care if it’s a concert for Johnny Smith or Bad Bunny or anybody else,” Lewandowski added, saying, “We’re going to do enforcement everywhere.”\n\nJohnson blasted Bad Bunny this week in a tweet calling him a “massive Trump hater” and an “anti-ICE activist” who has “no songs in English.”\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhy Is There Backlash Over Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Selection?\n\nCritics of the rapper have pointed to his criticism of Trump and his administration, as well as his anti-ICE activism. Bad Bunny did not incorporate U.S. stops on his current world tour out of concern for potential ICE raids that could occur during shows, saying “f——- ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.” Bad Bunny has also called ICE agents “motherf—ers” and “sons of bitches” in an Instagram post from June. One of the rapper’s songs, “NUEVAYol,” pokes fun at the president, featuring a Trump-like voice that says “this country is nothing without the immigrants.” Bad Bunny came to the defense of his homeland last year after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden. The rapper later posted a video celebrating Puerto Rican culture, captioning the video “garbage” and saying Puerto Ricans have been “fighting since day one of our existence, we are the definition of heart and resistance.”\n\n18 million. That is how many streams Bad Bunny received Monday, the day after he was announced as the next Super Bowl halftime performer, representing a 31% surge week-over-week, according to Billboard.\n\nKey Background\n\nNot much is known about what Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance will entail. However, the rapper said in a statement the show is “for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.” Bad Bunny’s selection as halftime performer is likely informed by his massive popularity. The rapper has three Grammy Awards under his belt and was Spotify’s most-streamed artist from 2020 to 2022, ranking in the top three of most-streamed artists every year since then. Debí Tirar Más Fotos, his most recent album, is currently No. 1 on Billboard’s Independent Albums chart.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show Sparks Right-Wing Backlash Over Rapper’s Anti-ICE Activism (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has pushed for the release of the Epstein files, had said he was looking forward to Grijalva’s arrival.\n\n“I encourage Speaker Johnson to follow applicable laws and House precedent to ensure Rep.-elect Grijalva is sworn in at her earliest eligibility,” Massie said in a statement provided to the AP. _______ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

They played it on repeat in the White House briefing room, though Vance promised that the “sombrero memes will stop” when the government reopens.\n\nJeffries responded with a meme of his own superimposing an image of Vance with a fat head and curly, long hair. “JD Vance thinks we will surrender to the Republican effort to gut healthcare because of a Sombrero meme. Not happening Bro,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X.\n\nVance said he couldn’t predict how long the shutdown might go on, but also said he didn’t believe it would be lengthy because some moderate Senate Democrats might soon vote with GOP colleagues to restore funding.\n\n“Let’s be honest, if this thing drags on for another few days or, God forbid, another few weeks, we are going to have to lay people off,\" Vance said.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that Trump has refused to negotiate in good faith and that the claims of Democrats closing the government for immigrants in the country illegally is a lie.\n\n“Donald Trump says it loud and clear: He is using the American people as pawns, threatening pain on the country as blackmail,” Schumer said.\n\nRoughly 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired. Many offices were being shuttered, perhaps permanently, as the Republican president vows to “do things that are irreversible” to punish Democrats.\n\nThe White House's key policy priorities, including an aggressive deportation agenda, may continue with few disruptions. But education, environmental and other services may eventually sputter. The economic fallout could further imperil an already weakening job market, as a jobs report Wednesday by payroll processor ADP showed that private employers cut 32,000 jobs last month.\n\nThe Trump administration has also begun targeting funding projects in Democratic states.\n\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought announced Wednesday a hold on roughly $18 billion in payments to build the Hudson Rail Tunnel and the Second Avenue subway line in New York City, two projects dear to Schumer. He later announced that almost $8 billion in green energy projects would be withheld for 16 states, all states represented by two Democrats in the Senate.\n\nMixed polling\n\nThe last government shutdown came in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first administration. It centered on a fight between both parties over funding for a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border and lasted more than 30 days. But Congress had already passed separate funding measures then that ensured that shutdown only partially affected government services, and wasn't as widespread as this one might be.\n\nTrump took most of the blame for the last shutdown, with an AP-NORC poll conducted during it, showing about 7 in 10 Americans said Donald Trump had “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility.\n\nThis time, about two-thirds of registered voters in a recent New York Times/Siena poll conducted before the shutdown said the Democrats should not allow the government to halt even if their demands were not met.\n\nStill, Republicans as the party in power could also face blowback. About one-quarter of registered voters in that poll said they would blame Trump and the Republicans in Congress if a shutdown happened, while about 2 in 10 said they would place blame on congressional Democrats. About one-third said they’d blame both sides equally.\n\nShutdown starts taking hold\n\nFederal courts will remain fully operational at least through Oct. 17, and potentially life-saving forecasting by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its National Weather Service haven't been disrupted.\n\nBut tours of the Liberty Bell were scrapped, and St. Louis' Gateway Arch and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston closed. Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Hawaii began Wednesday shuttered, though officials were working with nonprofit partners to get it reopen.\n\nAt Acadia National Park in Maine, which gets 4 million visits a year, would-be hikers in search of trail maps checked empty receptacles outside the closed visitors center. With no park rangers in sight, Jim Feather of Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, and his wife were unsure about trying to tackle Cadillac Mountain, with its panoramic views of the North Atlantic coast.\n\n“It’s frustrating that they’re playing politics in D.C.,” Feather said. “Their job is to pass a budget.

But a recent internal memo, obtained by Bloomberg News, says HUD investigators should no longer consider how financial firms behave in particular neighborhoods, focusing instead on how the companies treat individuals.\n\nThe shift nearly eliminates the chances the department will pursue new redlining cases under the Trump administration, experts say.\n\nFor communities with high concentrations of racial or ethnic minorities, that means the federal government will not keep close tabs on whether they have equal access to well-priced mortgages, affordable home insurance and other financial services. Most lenders are unlikely to change their current practices, for fear that a future Democratic administration would reverse course and resume enforcement. But for the next few years at least, redlining no longer appears to be a federal priority.\n\n“Under the guise of redefining what is a protected class, the administration is trying to rewrite the fair housing laws to say that you can no longer look at the obvious consequences of what a bank does — where it chooses to lend and where it chooses not to lend — when you’re opening an investigation,” said John Relman, founder of the Washington law firm Relman Colfax and a specialist in housing discrimination cases.\n\nA HUD spokeswoman said redlining remains “an area of investigation” for the agency. But the Sept. 16 memo says guidance issued to investigators under previous administrations “muddled” the meaning of anti-discrimination laws by “asking staff to assess the racial composition of neighborhoods.”\n\n“The Fair Housing Act plainly prohibits discrimination against individuals based on protected characteristics, yet notably does not divide Americans into protected minority and unprotected majority groups,” says the memo from John Gibbs, HUD’s principal deputy assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity.\n\nThe memo’s existence was first reported by The New York Times. The new directive at HUD comes as President Donald Trump pivots away from policies seeking to protect minorities from discrimination, arguing that such policies promote race-based favoritism.\n\nHUD has already slashed spending on fair housing enforcement and reassigned lawyers and other career employees once focused on it. Staff in the fair housing division are telling some potential plaintiffs to withdraw their complaints because they won’t receive a full and fair hearing, according to a HUD attorney who was not authorized to speak about the memos. The agency has also throttled work by field offices across the country by requiring even voluntary settlements to be approved by top personnel.\n\nThe new, written guidance on redlining will further limit staff investigations, experts warn.\n\n“Before now we had not had that in written form. But I can tell you it’s already dragging things to a halt,” said Sasha Samberg-Champion, special civil rights council for the nonprofit National Fair Housing Alliance and HUD’s former deputy general counsel for enforcement and fair housing under President Joe Biden.\n\nRepresentatives for the American Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America declined to comment.\n\nLori Sommerfield, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke in Washington who specializes in helping financial firms deal with regulators on fair housing and lending issues, said it was unlikely banks would change their behavior, despite HUD’s shift.\n\n“Any bank would be foolhardy to think that they now have a free ticket to engage in redlining,” she said. “If there was an administration change to a Democratic administration, one would assume that redlining investigation and enforcement actions would be back on the front burner.”\n\nRedlining in its most explicit form was key to Congress’s passage of fair housing and lending laws. Early in the 20th Century, financial firms and government officials across the US used color-coded maps of over 200 different cities, issued by the government-sponsored Home Owners Loan Corporation, that separated neighborhoods into categories according to who lived in them. They used the maps to determine which neighborhoods would get an array of services, from loans to home insurance to trash collection.\n\nIn his memo, Gibbs declared that a 2014 directive to HUD staff laying out how investigators should look at redlining — by determining whether a particular person or group of people had been denied loans or insurance policies based on the locations of their homes — was “legally unsound and will not be used” by HUD’s investigators. He added that officials were still working on a “full review” of fair housing enforcement procedures.\n\n“The Biden administration created a massive backlog of cases by pursuing dubious legal theories and speculative harm of discrimination that allowed legitimate complaints to languish,” said HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett. She added that HUD’s inspector general had recently chastised the agency over the backlog. “We are undoing that backlog by prioritizing cases where there is evidence of intentional discrimination as defined by federal civil rights law,” she said.\n\nRedlining is an example of disparate impact, the legal theory that a policy can have a discriminatory effect even if that is not its stated aim. The US Supreme Court affirmed in 2015 that the Fair Housing Act indeed applies to such cases. But banks and other financial firms have argued that it was unfair for the government to punish them for outcomes they did not intend to create.\n\nHousing advocates say the memo’s directives could apply to a much broader group of federal officials than just HUD employees themselves, since other departments rely on HUD’s interpretation of the Fair Housing Act. Such agencies could include the Department of Justice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said Samberg-Champion, the civil rights lawyer. “It’s going to matter to all the institutions that are charged with combating redlining,” he said.\n\nThose agencies already seem to have embraced the philosophy. The CFPB, for instance, tried and failed to overturn a recent redlining settlement it had reached with Chicago mortgage lender Townstone Financial, Inc., a case opened during Trump’s first presidential term. The Justice Department has also sought to end court-imposed monitoring and remediation programs on banks recently accused of redlining.\n\nGibbs’s memo describes the changes as being part of an effort to reduce HUD’s caseload, saying the department was spending time and effort on cases it should not pursue. But agency attorneys say they’re required to investigate every claim they receive, with no authority to prioritize one kind of case over another. Moreover, the department’s new approval process has led to a bottleneck: A field officer said HUD staff have recently had to ask complainants for damages worksheets to justify agreements that have been awaiting signatures from headquarters for months.\n\nIn a second memo issued on Sept. 17, Gibbs detailed a list of HUD advisories to lenders and other financial firms that the department now sees as “inconsistent” with the text of the Fair Housing Act. Several were published under former President Joe Biden, but others had been in place for longer, including one issued during Trump’s first term protecting people with service animals. The oldest piece of guidance on the list was from 2007, when George W. Bush was president. It lays out protections for non-English speakers receiving federal housing assistance.\n\nHUD staffers told Bloomberg they had used the rescinded advisories to resolve a large portion of complaints they received.","summary":"The new directive at HUD comes as President Donald Trump pivots away from policies seeking to protect minorities from discrimination.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/01/huds-redlining-retreat-gives-mortgage-lenders-a-reprieve/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-Z-HUD-REDLINING-1005.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:11:10","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":365339022,"title":"Kemi Badenoch vows to cut energy bills by scrapping Net Zero if she becomes Prime Minister","text":"Kemi Badenoch has vowed to cut energy costs and revive British industry if she becomes Prime Minister by scrapping Ed Miliband's Net Zero drive.\n\nIn a major policy move, she said a Conservative government would replace Labour's Climate Change Act with a strategy putting cheap and reliable power first.\n\nThe Tory leader attacked the legislation – passed by current Energy Secretary Mr Miliband in 2008 when he was a minister under Gordon Brown – for introducing legally binding targets and burdensome regulations, leading to higher bills.\n\nIt is blamed for increasing the cost of gas boilers by forcing families to buy heat pumps and for making ministers support the controversial Drax power station, which claims to produce eco-friendly electricity by burning wood pellets.\n\nMrs Badenoch also pledged to abolish the Climate Change Committee, a quango which urges Britons to eat less meat and take fewer flights to cut carbon emissions.\n\nIt comes on top of her previous pledges to scrap the 2050 Net Zero target and encourage companies to extract all available oil and gas from the North Sea.\n\nShe said on Wednesday night: 'We want to leave a cleaner environment for our children, but not by bankrupting the country.\n\n'Climate change is real.

Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has been thundering for two years against Israel’s alleged efforts to destroy the Palestinian populace, yet now she wants the bloodshed to continue: “Trump and War Criminal Netanyahu, perpetrators of the genocide, do not get to decide the future of Gaza,” she insists; “Palestinians get to determine the future of Palestine.”\n\nBut she plainly means that Hamas gets to decide. \n\nThat is: Tlaib finds the peace plan unacceptable, even though it would immediately stop the “genocide”; she’d rather Hamas keep fighting and ensure more civilian deaths.\n\nHere in New York, “pro-Palestine” rabblerouser Nerdeen Kiswani condemns the peace plan because removing Hamas from power is just “the next phase of genocide.”\n\nMakes no sense, until you realize that Kiswani defines “genocide” as “Whatever Israel is doing.” \n\n“Peace” activists have also retreated from their calls to end the war now that it entails the removal of Hamas: Medea Benjamin of Code Pink, for example, demands that the war continue until the Palestinians have “real peace: justice, freedom, and security.”\n\nNobody in the Arab world has justice and freedom . . . well, no one except the Arabs of Israel.\n\nAnd, for what it’s worth, the Trump plan points toward more “real peace” than Gaza has seen since Israel pulled out of the territory back in 2005.\n\nBenjamin apparently just wants Hamas to continue its savagery: War is the real peace? \n\nAll this lays bare the true motives of the anti-Zionist left.

Chicago is the company’s second headquarters after Boston.\n\nNexamp opened its office in the Loop in January 2024, and its latest expansion nearly triples its space at 101 N. Wacker Dr. It now has more than 80 employees, after adding 25 workers since early last year.\n\nThe company is one of the largest solar energy companies in Illinois. It chose Chicago as its second headquarters because of the state’s favorable clean energy policies under Gov. JB Pritzker’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The 2021 law set a goal to fuel the state entirely by clean energy by 2050.\n\n“For Nexamp, Illinois represents more than just opportunity — it’s a state that shares our vision of a clean energy future built on innovation, a skilled workforce and energy,” CEO Zaid Ashai said.\n\nNexamp has invested half a billion dollars in Illinois since 2018 and plans to scale up to $3 billion, Ashai added.\n\nThe company’s expansion is a “testament to the values we have in common,” including “creating jobs and economic opportunity and transitioning away from fossil fuels,” Angela Tovar, chief sustainability officer for Chicago’s Department of Environment, said. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Pritzker are unwavering in their commitment to clean energy, Tovar said at the opening of Nexamp’s expanded office on Wednesday.\n\n“As solar energy companies like Nexamp expand throughout the midwest, we see a ripple effect of job creation and skills-building,” Pritzker said last year when Nexamp announced Chicago as its second base.\n\nNexamp was founded in 2007 by two U.S. Army veterans. It entered Illinois in 2018 following the Future Energy Jobs Act, which jumpstarted community solar and accelerated decarbonization, Ashai said. Nexamp first came to Chicago in 2019 with five employees.\n\nThe Future Energy Jobs Act was signed in 2016 by former Gov. Bruce Rauner and set a deadline to reach 25% renewable energy by 2025.\n\nCommunity solar, or “shared solar,” allows individuals, companies or municipalities to subscribe to solar farms, receive credit for the energy generated and save on electricity bills. Savings particularly benefit low- to moderate-income residents facing high energy costs, according to Nexamp.\n\n“We want people in Illinois to benefit from this,” Ashai said. “Energy is a fundamental right for all of us.”\n\nAbout 17,000 customers in Illinois are enrolled in community solar with Nexamp.\n\nThe company last year completed and switched on 19 new solar farms across the state, generating approximately 65 megawatts of energy. It has 49 operating projects in Illinois with 91 more projects under way. Construction of their solar farms creates hundreds of contractor jobs, Nexamp said.\n\nAcross the U.S., Nexamp has more than 300 solar projects in a dozen states, generating more than one gigawatt of energy. It has another 175 projects under construction.\n\nBut many clean energy sectors are threatened by new federal policies that cut incentives such as tax credits. Tariffs have also increased costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nForecasts after the passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill show the U.S. is on track to lose up to 55 gigawatts of solar by 2030. That includes a 14% collapse in Illinois, the nation’s 10th largest solar market, according to a September report from the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nBecause of Trump’s tax and spending bill, signed into law on July 4, more than 830,000 clean energy jobs nationwide could be lost by 2030, a September report from nonpartisan business group E2 said.\n\nFor commercial solar projects to be eligible for a 30% federal tax credit, construction must start by July 4, 2026, or start operating by the end of 2027.\n\n“Sudden policy reversals can disrupt momentum in an industry that needs consistency to keep scaling and investing,” Ashai said.\n\nBut Nexamp had anticipated many policy changes, so it adapted approaches to financing, procurement and construction, he noted. The company has raised record levels of financing to continue progress on projects. It partnered with U.S. manufacturers to secure supply chains of solar panels and equipment. Nexamp also streamlined processes to speed up construction.\n\nLast month, Nexamp secured $350 million in financing from Macquarie Asset Management for construction of its first large-scale solar and battery storage projects. It also raised additional capital from Nomura for earlier-stage project development.\n\n“One of the biggest challenges facing energy developers today is time. Demand for electricity is rising faster than expected,” Ashai said. “That pressure is forcing companies like Nexamp to shorten development cycles and rethink traditional approaches to project delivery.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/energy/2025/10/01/solar-energy-group-nexamp-loop-office","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3745a4/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3360x2240+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd9%2F5a%2F867ebd584da3a2a494fa5a8b6a76%2Fnexam","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:07:20","author":"Amy Yee","authors":["Amy Yee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.151},{"id":365334410,"title":"What Jane Goodall Said About Donald Trump","text":"Jane Goodall, the iconic British primatologist and conservationist who died Wednesday at age 91, once compared President Donald Trump’s behavior to that of “a male chimpanzee,” while also expressing deep concern for the “divisiveness” in America.\n\nGoodall, renowned for her chimp field research and environmental advocacy, in 2022 told MSNBC’s Ari Melber that Trump displays “the same sort of behavior as a male chimpanzee will show when he’s competing for dominance with another.” \n\n“They’re upright, they swagger, they project themselves as really more large and aggressive than they may actually be in order to intimidate their rivals,” Goodall said. \n\nGoodall died while on a speaking tour in California, the Jane Goodall Institute announced Wednesday. \n\nWhy It Matters \n\nGoodall also spoke about the state of American politics during the MSNBC interview. “I’m not an American and I’m not a politician, but looking at it from outside, I see that the divisiveness that’s being created in your America is a tragedy, and it’s a tragedy that can have a ripple effect around the world,” she said. \n\nGoodall’s comments highlight the escalating concerns about polarization in U.S. politics.\n\nJane Goodall attends the TIME100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 23, 2019, in New York City. (Photo by: NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\nWhat To Know \n\nGoodall made similar comments to The Atlantic shortly before Trump won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. \n\n“In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,” Goodall said. “In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.” \n\nGoodall’s discoveries over her career “revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” her institute posted on Instagram. \n\nThe trailblazing anthropologist documented chimpanzees using tools and performing other activities previously believed to be exclusive to humans. She also documented the chimps’ distinct personalities. \n\nPoliticians from around the world are paying tribute to Goodall. \n\nFormer Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “heartbroken” to hear about Goodall’s death. \n\n“She was a pioneer whose research and advocacy reshaped our understanding of the natural world. Her wisdom and compassion will live on in every act of conservation. All of us who were so greatly inspired by her will miss her deeply,” Trudeau wrote on X. \n\nAntónio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, said he was “deeply saddened.” \n\n“She is leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity & our planet. I’m grateful for her lifelong environmental protection efforts & her strong support for the @UN,” Guterres wrote on X. \n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, on X: “Thank you Jane Goodall for a lasting legacy of conservation, service to all of us, and for always being brave.” \n\nColorado Governor Jared Polis, in a statement: “Dr. Goodall’s advocacy has made a difference and inspired countless others to follow in her footsteps. I had the great privilege of visiting with Jane several times including while she was here in Colorado, and my heart goes out to her son and grandchildren, and all the humans and chimpanzees who knew and loved her. Our world has lost a truly great person. Jane will be greatly missed, and her legacy will live on and continue inspiring the next generation.”\n\nDo you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?

General Assembly about the 'con job' of global warming. \n\nTrump has long been a critic of climate science and polices aimed at helping the world transition to green energies like wind and solar power.\n\nLeo quoted Francis´ follow-up encyclical, published in 2023 , in which the Argentine pope shamed and challenged world leaders ahead of a U.N. conference to commit to binding targets to slow climate change before it´s too late.\n\nCiting Francis´ text, Leo recalled that some leaders had chosen to 'deride the evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them most.'\n\nLeo called for a change of heart to truly embrace the environmental cause and said any Christian should be on board.\n\n'We cannot love God, whom we cannot see, while despising his creatures. Nor can we call ourselves disciples of Jesus Christ without participating in his outlook on creation and his care for all that is fragile and wounded,' he said, presiding on a stage that featured a huge hunk of a melting glacier from Greenland and tropical ferns.\n\nLeo has strongly taken up Francis´ ecological mantle, giving his blessing to a Vatican plan to turn an agricultural field north of Rome into a vast solar farm. \n\nOnce it is up and running, the farm is expected to make the Vatican City the world´s first carbon-neutral state.\n\nLeo also weighed in on the abortion debate, as he was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Senator Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. \n\nThe plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops given the powerful Democratic senator´s support for abortion rights.\n\nLeo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.\n\n'Someone who says `I´m against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty´ is not really pro-life,' Leo said. 'Someone who says that `I´m against abortion, but I´m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,´ I don´t know if that´s pro-life.'\n\nLeo, whose words echoed a common Catholic argument often made in discussions about abortion, spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.\n\nChurch teaching forbids abortion but it also opposes capital punishment as 'inadmissible' under all circumstances. \n\nU.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to 'welcome the stranger.'\n\nShortly after his election, Leo XIV issued a pointed one-word response when asked if he had anything to say to America.\n\nThe newly-elected leader was peppered with questions on Monday as he moved through a crowd in the Vatican, including one from NewsNation's Robert Sherman. \n\n'Any message for the United States?' he asked. \n\n'Many,' the pope - Chicago-born Robert Prevost - quickly responded. \n\nHe added: 'God bless you all.' \n\nMany took the response to be an opening shot from Leo against Trump, with the new pope having made his disapproval of his policies clear on his social media. \n\nA retweet on April 14 slams the administration's deportation of undocumented migrant and Maryland father-of-three Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, to El Salvador.\n\nThe post reads: 'Do you not see the suffering? Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?'\n\nThe 69-year-old also shared several articles that address Catholic JD Vance's stance on immigration. One of them is titled: 'JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.'\n\nPope Leo also shared a post in 2018 that read: 'There is nothing remotely Christian, American, or morally defensible about a policy that takes children away from their parents and warehouses them in cages. This is being carried out in our name and the shame is on us all.' \n\nThe first American born Pope, Prevost emerged victorious in the Conclave as he was reportedly seen as 'the least American of the Americans' in the Church's leadership, and as a silent reformer who would carry on much of the work of Pope Francis.","summary":"The American pontiff slammed skeptics who 'ridicule those who speak of global warming,' as he strongly embraced Pope Francis´ environmental legacy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15154005/Woke-American-Pope-Leo-blesses-ice-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/01/23/102624537-0-image-a-8_1759359570179.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/13/4423850956890029693/1024x576_MP4_4423850956890029693.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:05:44","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

We're going to respect and honor free speech and our faith, and we're going to do it as publicly and valiantly as we can.\" Following Kirk's killing, Fox Digital reported young conservatives were harassed at on-campus memorials, as professors across the country faced firings over insensitive public posts condoning the activist's murder. At Clemson alone, three professors were terminated after allegedly celebrating Kirk's death. Mace said young members of the Clemson College Republicans and the Clemson TPUSA chapter worked together to ensure the public, elected officials and President Donald Trump were aware of the professors' comments, and were instrumental in booting them from campus. UNIVERSITIES CRACK DOWN ON EMPLOYEE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS CELEBRATING, DEFENDING KIRK'S DEATH \"They made a difference where it mattered, because those who are promoting murder, inciting murder, shouldn't be teaching our kids. Regardless of your politics or what your beliefs are, you shouldn't be near students or indoctrinating them,\" she said. \"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of students on every campus across the country who are with you. When we speak up in numbers, we can't be defeated.\" She added her message to parents concerned about leftist indoctrination on college campuses is one of hope. \"I have never been more proud and had more confidence in a generation than I do today, because these young men and women have stepped up in the wake of Charlie Kirk's tragic murder, and they have stepped up to fill in the gap, and it is an inspiration,\" Mace said. ‘FEARLESS’ TOUR TAKES CHARLIE KIRK’S FREE SPEECH MISSION TO COLLEGES NATIONWIDE The university also came under fire in April after Mace revealed Clemson had a health portal form that listed 15 gender identity options, excluding male and female. Though the form was eventually taken down, Mace noted school officials \"deflected any and all blame.\" \"I expect better than that, and even when these professors came forward, we saw a slow response from Clemson,\" she said. \"Luckily, the Board of Trustees held an emergency meeting and did the right thing, so we are going to have to continue to have eyes on and put pressure on Clemson to do the right thing.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mace said amid the chaos, it is important lawmakers and the courts step in to protect free speech, and continue to honor Kirk's mission. \"The First Amendment is a right established by our founders, and when we need to step in, we should absolutely do that,\" she said. \"That's what you saw happen in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. You saw lawmakers step up, come forward, and protect the free speech of students on campuses everywhere.\" Fox News Digital's Jasmine Baehr contributed to this report.","summary":"Following Charlie Kirk&apos;s fatal shooting at Utah Valley University, Rep.

His comments follow Trump’s recent suggestion that cities like Chicago could serve as “training grounds” for the US military, a remark that has sparked widespread backlash. What Is the 25th Amendment? The 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1967, deals with presidential succession and the transfer of power in cases of death, resignation, removal, or incapacitation. It includes four sections: Section 1 confirms that the Vice President becomes President if the sitting President dies, resigns, or is removed from office. It was famously invoked after the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. Section 2 outlines the process for selecting a new Vice President if the position becomes vacant. It has been invoked most recently to install then-Congressman Gerald Ford as the Vice President to President Richard Nixon after Vice President Spiro Agnew's resignation. Section 3 allows the President to temporarily transfer power to the Vice President (e.g., during surgery or medical treatment). It has been invoked several times, most recently by former President Joe Biden in 2021. Section 4 is the most controversial. It allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the President unfit to carry out the duties of the office. This section has never been invoked. If the President contests this declaration, Congress must decide the matter, requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers to permanently remove the President. Could It Actually Be Invoked Against Trump Now? Legally, yes, but practically, it's a long shot. Vice President JD Vance and the majority of the Cabinet are staunch Trump allies and have now shown any signs that they disagree with the President or any of his policies.

But Labour’s laws tied us in red tape, loaded us with costs, and did nothing to cut global emissions.\n\n“Previous Conservative governments tried to make Labour’s climate laws work – they don’t.\n\n“Under my leadership we will scrap those failed targets.\n\n“Our priority now is growth, cheaper energy, and protecting the natural landscapes we all love.”\n\nMrs Badenoch has previously said it is “impossible” for the UK to meet its net zero targets and pledged to scrap them and “maximise extraction” of oil and gas in the North Sea.\n\nIn an interview with The Spectator, she said she had discussed the issue with Donald Trump at the recent state dinner at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe US president praised a speech she made about it in Aberdeen, where he owns a golf course, and told her: “I hear me and you agree on so many things,” Mrs Badenoch said.\n\nMinisters have to do “lots of stupid things” that are unaffordable or impractical to hit the net zero target target mandated by the Act, she said.\n\n“We need to do what we can sensibly to tackle climate change but we cannot do it alone. If other countries aren’t doing it, then us being the goody-two-shoes of the world is not actually encouraging anyone to improve,” Mrs Badenoch said.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage has also vowed to fast-track North Sea oil and gas licences and scrap net zero targets if the party wins the next election, claiming it will save £30 billion a year.\n\nThe Tory announcement comes just hours after Mr Miliband – who passed, with near-universal support from MPs, the landmark climate legislation in the same role as part of Gordon Brown’s Labour government in 2008 – doubled down on clean energy and pledged to permanently ban fracking at his party’s conference.\n\nHe said: “This desperate policy from Kemi Badenoch if ever implemented would be an economic disaster and a total betrayal of future generations.\n\n“The Conservatives would now scrap a framework that businesses campaigned for in the first place and has ensured tens of billions of pounds of investment in homegrown British energy since it was passed by a Labour government with Conservative support 17 years ago.\n\n“This anti-jobs, anti-worker, anti-young people lurch is nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a culture war which the British people do not want.”\n\nWhen the Climate Change Act was introduced, it was a world-first for climate legislation, although many countries have since followed suit and nations agreed the world’s first comprehensive treaty to curb global warming in Paris a decade ago.\n\nScientists warn the world must cut rapidly emissions to zero to prevent global temperatures rising to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which worsening sea level rises, severe storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts and the collapse of natural systems such as coral reefs will occur.\n\nBut political division has grown over the measures needed to tackle climate change, even as the costs of clean energy have plummeted and the impacts of rising temperatures such as heatwaves and wildfires have become more severe.\n\nThe Conservatives claimed the Act has forced ministers to bring in regulations that pushed up energy bills, hit growth and supported wood-burning power stations such as Drax, and shifted British industry abroad.\n\nWhile UK emissions have halved since 1990, global climate pollution has increased and countries such as China have not followed Britain’s lead, the party said.\n\nClaire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, said: “Despite our efforts, emissions around the world are rising.\n\n“When things aren’t working, we should say so.\n\n“Our priority will be to make energy cheap, double down on innovation and protect nature.”\n\nFriends of the Earth chief executive Asad Rehman said the move would put the Tories in the company of “climate denialists, conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists” who want to ignore the effects of climate change.\n\nHe said: “For a mainstream political party to turn its back on the science in a desperate race to the bottom with those being bankrolled by discredited billionaires and dirty business, who want to stop climate action because it threatens their profits, is political suicide.”\n\nEd Matthew, UK programme director for the independent climate change think tank E3G, said: “The Climate Change Act was a world first for the UK government and has cleaned up our air, created hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy, saved households hundreds of pounds on their energy bills, and increased investment in measures to protect people from flooding.\n\n“Repealing this Act would be a monstrous act of economic and environmental vandalism and sends a clear signal that the Conservatives care far more about the profits of oil and gas companies than they do about the British people.”\n\nSimon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said there is “no way to lower bills or energy security by prolonging our dependence on gas” and that doing so would “increase the misery of people unable to afford the sky-high prices”.","summary":"Plans by the Conservatives to replace the Climate Change Act come as divisions over emissions-cutting measures widen.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-tories-ed-miliband-aberdeen-labour-b1250763.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/10/02/00/4d616c5e44919384fa9e1659c6d316a0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5NDE5Mjc3-2.80984728.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:01:00","author":"Helen Corbett","authors":["Helen Corbett"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":365341542,"title":"NATO allies clash after Russian jets breach airspace, testing alliance resolve","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Recent Russian incursions into NATO airspace have sharpened divisions inside the alliance over how to respond, exposing both the strength and the limits of collective defense. Secretary General Mark Rutte clashed with Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal last week after Estonia invoked NATO’s Article 4 clause, which triggers consultations when a member feels its security is threatened. According to three European officials granted anonymity to speak freely, Rutte argued that repeated invocations risked diluting the treaty’s force. One source said he even raised his voice at Michal, warning that NATO must be cautious about how often it signals alarm. Rutte argued that if Article 4 were invoked every time Russia violated sovereignty — through drone incursions, fighter jets, cyberattacks and more — it would quickly lose impact, according to the officials. DENMARK CONSIDERS TRIGGERING NATO ARTICLE 4 AFTER DRONES FLY OVER AIRPORTS A NATO spokesperson confirmed Rutte and Michal spoke Friday and said the secretary general \"has supported Estonia throughout the process.\" Rasmus Ruuda, director of the Government Communication Office of Estonia, told Fox News Digital Rutte \"expressed support for Estonia and the Prime Minister thanked NATO for its actions.\" \"Article 4 is just a signal that we’re taking note of what happened,\" said Giedrimas Jeglinskas, a Lithuanian member of parliament and former NATO assistant secretary general. \"We can be invoking Article 4 every week, and I think that only weakens us, because we're unable to truly respond to that aggression that Russia is sort of throwing at us.\" The tension comes after a series of provocative moves by Moscow. Last month, missile-carrying Russian MiG-29s flew into Estonian territory, following an earlier breach of Polish airspace by 19 drones and repeated incursions over Romania. In Poland, jets scrambled to intercept the drones, shooting some of them down. It marked the first time since World War II that Polish armed forces mobilized to engage an airborne threat over their homeland. The Russian jets in Estonia were eventually escorted out of its territory by Italian F-35s. Estonia’s Article 4 request followed Poland’s own invocation days earlier, prompting another round of consultations in Brussels. Since its creation in 1949, Article 4 has been triggered only nine times. NATO’s warning to Russia after the Estonian request was blunt: any further breaches would be met with \"all means\" of defense. Estonia's defense minister said his nation was prepared to shoot down Russian planes violating airspace \"if there is a need.\" But Jeglinskas said signaling without consequence risks leaving the alliance trapped. \"We’re happy to do Article 4 every other day, but so what? What’s next?\" he said. \"The real question is what happens when the jets actually enter our airspace.\" The debate cuts to a deeper question: what constitutes a \"need\" to shoot down Russian jets? How can Russia be deterred without stumbling into direct war? \"The last thing we want is to have NATO get drawn into a war with Russia,\" a senior State Department official told Fox News Digital. \"God knows how that ends.\" \"Almost all wars … they don't necessarily start with a big bang,\" the official went on. \"They start with an escalation, and then somebody feels they need to respond to this, and then you just get in a toxic spiral.\" 'PUTIN IS PUSHING THE LIMITS’: EASTERN ALLIES WARN TRUMP NOT TO PULL US TROOPS The United States has promised to defend \"every inch\" of NATO while pressing Europe to bear more of its own defense burden. Washington’s mixed signals have only complicated matters. Trump administration officials long favored reducing the U.S. troop presence in Europe. But President Donald Trump recently delivered one of the starkest warnings to Moscow, declaring that NATO states should shoot Russian aircraft down if they incur on their territory. Jeglinskas said the statement resonated across the Baltic States. \"What was really helpful was that President Trump was very clear,\" he said. \"That gives us confidence we’re on the right track, and we really appreciate the support.\" Still, allies remain divided on whether to escalate. Some warn that Eastern Europe cannot credibly threaten retaliation without an American security guarantee. Others argue that deterrence depends on showing Russia its incursions carry a cost. \"If we really want to send a proper message of deterrence to Russia, we need to be prepared to use kinetic force,\" Jeglinskas said. \"That means neutralizing those jets — shooting them down or finding other ways to impose consequences — so Russia actually feels the cost of its incursions. That hasn’t happened yet, and it leaves us vulnerable.\" The airspace disputes now extend beyond fighter jets. European Union members are meeting in Copenhagen this week to discuss shoring up air defenses after a wave of drone sightings. Denmark briefly shut down its airspace following mysterious drone activity, while Lithuania’s Vilnius airport and Norway’s Oslo airport also reported disruptions. Drones have even been spotted over Germany’s northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. \"We are not at war, but we are no longer at peace either. We must do much more for our own security,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Düsseldorf. NATO jets scrambled to intercept drones over Poland, but the response underscored a growing mismatch: deploying multi-million dollar fighters to counter small, unmanned aircraft is neither efficient nor sustainable. RUSSIA SHIFTS FROM TALK TO ACTION, TARGETING NATO HOMELAND AMID FEARS OF GLOBAL WAR \"NATO remains the most crucial element of our security equation,\" Jeglinskas said. \"It’s the backbone through which our security is viewed. There’s really no doubt about NATO’s political will and its capability to defend its territory, but warfare is changing — and the question now is, has NATO adapted to the new way of war that is seeping through the borders of Ukraine?\" Jeglinskas warned that neither NATO nor the Baltic States have done enough. \"The Polish incursion signified that NATO is not fully ready to counter these threats,\" he said. \"Scrambling jets is a tremendous economic mismatch. If these kinds of attacks become swarms, it’s not sustainable.\" To address mounting threats, NATO last month launched Operation Eastern Sentry, reinforcing its presence on Europe’s eastern flank. Jeglinskas welcomed the move but said gaps remain. \"Jets are very important, but more jets don’t mean we’re more secure from low-altitude drones,\" he said. \"The question is: do we have sensors that can detect what’s happening from the ground up to a kilometer into our airspace? We don’t see that. It’s like a dead space.\" Jeglinskas called for stronger short- and medium-range radar, as well as layered defenses akin to Israel’s Iron Dome, capable of intercepting drones with both kinetic and electronic means. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"NATO’s response is commendable,\" he said, \"but it’s not enough. You need technical know-how, the right capabilities, and systems that are truly integrated if you want to make this work.\" For now, NATO remains caught between signaling resolve and acting on it. As Russia continues to test the alliance’s borders, Jeglinskas and other Eastern European officials warn that credibility is at stake. The next incursion, they argue, may demand more than words.","summary":"Russian incursions into NATO airspace are fueling divisions among allies, with some warning that repeated Article 4 signals risk weakening deterrence without real action.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nato-allies-clash-after-russian-jets-breach-airspace-testing-alliance-resolve","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/russian-jets-victory-day-parade.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380229833112","publish_date":"2025-10-01 23:00:39","author":"Morgan Phillips","authors":["Morgan Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":365337912,"title":"JD Vance Taunts Hakeem Jeffries Over Claim That Trump AI Video Is Racist: 'Is He a Mexican-American?'","text":"Vice President JD Vance taunted House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries after he called an AI-generated video posted by President Donald Trump that showed him wearing a sombrero racist.\n\n\"On the sombrero thing, Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist.

This week, the Google-owned platform paid $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump after the company suspended his channel six days after the January 6 riot at the Capitol. At the time, YouTube said it was “concerned about the ongoing potential for violence.” (Trump’s account was eventually reinstated in March 2023.) The terms of the settlement will direct $22 million to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit group that is raising money to finance an addition to the White House. Most creators are lucky if they get a gold plaque from YouTube; Trump’s getting a new ballroom.\n\nThis is just the latest example of major tech companies bowing to Trump. Earlier this year, Meta and X settled similar lawsuits with Trump over suspending his accounts, paying $25 million and $10 million, respectively. These three companies alone have collectively paid Trump and his associates $59.5 million for the sin of enforcing the rules of their own privately held companies. There’s also Amazon, which made a reported $40 million deal with Melania Trump on a documentary project. Plus personal donations to Trump from various tech CEOs, including Apple’s Tim Cook, who gave $1 million to his inaugural fund.\n\nAll of this amounts to a rounding error for the tech giants—averaged out, YouTube made more than $107 million from ad revenue every single day last quarter—but these are still acts of profound obsequiousness and corporate cowardice. There are any number of reasons they may have chosen to pay up: Perhaps the tech elite have become genuinely red-pilled, fear regulation, or don’t want to lose out on government contracts. They have good reason to worry about personal retribution (last year, Trump accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of plotting against him in the 2020 presidential election and said that he would “spend the rest of his life in prison” if he did so again). But in any case, by settling with Trump over these suspensions, the companies are effectively arguing that their content-moderation decisions following the insurrection were wrong. They are also arguing, in effect, that the government has the right to tell business owners what they can and cannot allow on their own platforms—a weak stance generally, and a weak stance on free speech specifically.\n\nThis is embarrassing for them, but they get something out of it, too. By settling, the companies can pivot toward dispensing with the work of moderation altogether. The decision to suspend Trump can serve for them as a cautionary tale of what happens when the platforms are made to make difficult editorial decisions. They’re given an excuse to take a lighter touch. They double down on the idea that they aren’t truly publishers, which reinforces their long-standing arguments that the owners of social platforms should not be held liable for what happens on the sites they run. And they attempt to do so with a straight face even as they tune their algorithms to alter what content users see.\n\nThis is precisely what Meta, X, and now YouTube appear to be doing. In January, Zuckerberg announced a plan to return “to our roots around free expression” by replacing Facebook and Instagram fact-checkers with a system of community notes. Under Musk, X has turned into a white-supremacist-friendly free-for-all of AI slop, Nazi propaganda, and autoplaying murder videos. (Community notes have been useful in some cases, but they’re not exactly consistent or fully adequate.) Last week, Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, said it would reinstate the accounts of creators banned for spreading election-denial content and misinformation about COVID. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse,” the company wrote in a recent statement to Congress about the decision. The New York Times recently reported that the platform would loosen rules around content, provided the videos “are considered to be in the public interest.”\n\nMultiple things are happening here. The first is that demonstrably false beliefs that were once considered fringe or outrageous are now ideological pillars of the current administration: The 2020 presidential election was stolen; vaccines are very dangerous; January 6 was a civil gathering of patriots. This has led many authority figures in Silicon Valley (who were quite vocal at the time about the need to combat disinformation) to feel sheepish about difficult but quite rational decisions made during the pandemic and the aftermath of the 2020 election—a time of mass death followed by a crisis in which the peaceful transfer of power was horrifically disrupted.\n\nThe second is that the Big Tech platforms have, for years, begrudgingly agonized over content-moderation decisions. Facebook, as I wrote in January, is the prime example of this posture. The history of the company is of Zuckerberg making reactive, often totally contradictory decisions about what’s allowed. Facebook once claimed to be a neutral platform, only to get dragged in front of Congress, where it pledged to “secure elections.” For the better part of the 2010s, Twitter struggled to balance a desire for free-speech maximalism with scattershot attempts to quell harassment on the platform. Despite (and partly because of) its staggering size and reach, YouTube has been drawn into far fewer moderation controversies. But many of its largest moderation decisions—like its decision to take down thousands of bizarre child-exploitation videos in 2017—have been reactive, coming after inquiries from news organizations.\n\nTo better understand the extent of the messaging shift from these technology companies, it is worth revisiting their reactions after January 6. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a note to employees just after the riots that “the lawlessness and violence occurring on Capitol Hill today is the antithesis of democracy and we strongly condemn it.” Four years later, Pichai stood on a dais to watch Trump take the oath of office.\n\nTestifying before Congress in March 2021, Zuckerberg argued that Facebook did its part “to secure the integrity of our election,” and then “President Trump gave a speech,” he added, referencing when the president told his supporters, “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” and urged them to head to the Capitol building, where lawmakers were certifying the results. “I believe that the former president should be responsible for his words and the people who broke the law should be responsible for their actions.” Zuckerberg also attended Trump’s 2024 inauguration. Musk didn’t own Twitter in 2021, but in a blog post at the time, the company called the insurrection “horrific” and was unequivocal in its justification for banning Trump, noting that his posts were “likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.”\n\nYou might notice that these statements and justifications are unusually clear and direct for tech companies and their executives. They aren’t full of vague bromides about community or civic discourse. They reflect the gravity of the moment they are describing—a violent mob smashing windows, assaulting police officers, and breaking into the Capitol building to attempt to overturn the results of a presidential election. Twitter’s statement—a dispatch from a company that no longer really exists—is perhaps the most revealing in that it connects actions on the platform to real-world harm. By settling their lawsuits with Trump, the companies are insinuating that these statements and corresponding enforcements were part of some kind of collective hysteria. In reality, they were the opposite: a rare moment of clarity—a realization that their actions and inactions have consequences for their users and the world.\n\nThe job of content moderation at Facebook, YouTube, or even X scale is extremely difficult, bordering on impossible. It requires a level of monitoring that only finicky and error-prone automated systems can handle. It must take place on a global scale and require immense resources. Even then, the systems and people working inside them will make honest mistakes. Most important, it means having to come up with a set of rigid ideological principles and rules and enforce them consistently, making difficult calls on nuanced edge cases involving high-stakes actors and events. It’s grinding work that can require exposing low-paid moderators to the absolute worst of humanity. Sometimes there is no clear, right answer on a given ruling. None of this is easy or fun, but it is the work of governance, of responsibility. It is what the money is for, and it comes with the territory of the heady mission statements that tech companies embrace: organizing the world’s information or connecting the world or becoming the global town square. It’s precisely the work these companies would rather not have to do.\n\nIn her best-selling memoir this year, the former Facebook employee Sarah Wynn-Williams wrote of the company’s executives that “the more power they grasp, the less responsible they become.” These words are also as good an epigraph for the Trump era as any. Rereading them in light of Big Tech’s full capitulation to the current administration makes clear that, although these about-faces are politically convenient, they reflect a broader harmony between the tech platforms and the MAGA movement. So much of Trump’s core appeal to his supporters is that he offers permission to behave in his image—to live shamelessly but also to enjoy a life of impunity and operate without having to realize that one’s actions have broader consequences for others. It is, in other words, an invitation to simultaneously grow more powerful and less responsible.\n\nBig Tech’s MAGA pivot is cynical, cowardly, and self-serving. It is also a perfect match.","summary":"Welcome to the era of Big-Tech capitulation.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/youtube-trump-settlement/684431/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/e8C_hky2GJDjGTJu0G0iPoMDMbs=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/newsletters/2025/10/2025_10_01_youtube_mpg/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 22:58:00","author":"Charlie Warzel","authors":["Charlie Warzel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":365336620,"title":"Courts pause anti-Trump civil lawsuits during shutdown","text":"Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a two-page standing order on Wednesday granting blanket deadline extensions for most civil cases involving the federal government. The goal, Boasberg said, is to preserve the court’s “scarce judicial resources” and preempt a flood of case-specific motions to delay proceedings.\n\n“The Court has a need to minimize expenditures of scarce judicial resources on large volumes of case-specific motions to stay or extend pending deadlines,” Boasberg wrote, adding that the lapse in appropriations constitutes “good cause” for extending timelines.\n\nWhile the judiciary itself remains open, the administrative arm of the federal courts wrote in a memorandum Wednesday that current funding reserves will only sustain paid operations through Oct. 17. Courts rely on fee balances and prior-year appropriations during shutdowns, but recent budget stagnation has tightened margins.\n\nThe judiciary’s memo, signed by U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad, assured employees they will receive pay on Oct. 10 and 24. However, if funding runs out after that, essential personnel, including law clerks, probation officers, and court reporters, may be forced to work without pay under the Anti-Deficiency Act. Judges and Supreme Court justices will continue to be paid under constitutional guarantees.\n\nAdditionally, the threat of furloughs for judiciary personnel is slim so long as the shutdown does not persist for weeks. The judiciary was last forced to furlough employees during the shutdown that lasted 21 days between 1995 and 1996 under then-President Bill Clinton, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nChief Judge John McConnell, an Obama appointee in Rhode Island, said if the situation persists, his courthouse will reduce operations to a four-day workweek and close one day weekly.\n\n“It is so burdensome trying to figure out how we operate a co-equal branch of government that has constitutional responsibilities without appropriated funds,” McConnell said, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump DOJ reverses course on immigration courts precedent\n\nBreaking with precedent, the Trump administration said it will continue non-detained immigration court hearings during the shutdown. In its fiscal 2026 contingency plan published Monday, the DOJ cited the “national emergency” declared by President Donald Trump over illegal immigration and emphasized the backlog of more than 4 million pending immigration cases.\n\nImmigration courts are separate from the federal judiciary and are operated by the DOJ.\n\nStill, it marks a departure from prior shutdown responses, where non-detained immigration hearings were routinely suspended. Detained cases will continue consistent with statutory speedy trial requirements and public safety priorities.\n\nCivil suits paused, but criminal cases move forward\n\nUnder the DOJ’s contingency plan, 89% of employees are exempt from furlough in the first five days of a shutdown. Prosecutors are expected to remain focused on criminal cases, but civil enforcement will largely be paused, especially lawsuits against Trump’s policy decisions.\n\nSeveral new cases were already subject to stay motions by the government this week, including lawsuits over voter registration data requests and funding cuts for social programs. DOJ attorneys in multiple filings expressed “regret” for the disruption caused by the funding lapse.\n\nGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: LIVE UPDATES FROM CONGRESS AMID FUNDING STALEMATE\n\nHowever, some courts continued work on Trump policy-related suits after the government shutdown on Wednesday. In an order from U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, the judge blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke and reallocate $34 million in public transport counterterrorism funds in response to the state’s immigration sanctuary policies. Kaplan, a Clinton appointee, placed a restraining order on reallocating those funds until Oct. 15.\n\nDespite the delays, the Supreme Court is still set to open its new term Monday and proceed with arguments. But lower courts, especially in civil cases involving the federal government, are preparing to downshift dramatically if lawmakers do not break the funding stalemate soon.","summary":"Federal courts are pausing high-profile civil lawsuits against the Trump administration in response to the government shutdown that began early Wednesday, as agencies begin cutting back on non-essential legal work to conserve resources.

These posts coincided with the onset of a government shutdown, impacting federal agencies and workers nationwide. \n\nThe controversy highlights the role of social media and digital satire in shaping perceptions during high-stakes political standoffs, with both parties accusing each other of bad faith and bigotry as essential public services are disrupted.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe U.S. government entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a funding resolution before the September 30, 2025, midnight deadline. \n\nThe deadlock resulted from unresolved disputes over health care provisions, particularly whether to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies in the budget bill. \n\nAs the shutdown loomed, President Trump posted AI-altered videos on social media, showing House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero and mustache, and Schumer in similar satirical depictions. In these memes, digitally generated voices parodied Democratic positions on health care and immigration.\n\nRepublicans have argued over what they characterized as Democratic demands for funding health care benefits for undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr said, “The sombreros will continue until the government reopens” while posting an AI video of Jeffries that the president previously shared, which played during the White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nJeffries called out the president’s videos as “racist” earlier this week, and Vice President Vance reacted to those remarks during the press briefing.\n\n“Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means,” Vance said. “Like, is he a Mexican American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?” The Vice President also said that the president “likes to have a little bit of fun.”\n\nVP Vance on President Trump’s sombrero meme: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means.“Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?” pic.twitter.com/wdxbj3Cqic— Vice President JD Vance (@VP) October 1, 2025\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nFormer Fox News host Geraldo Rivera on X on Wednesday: “Trump’s juvenile joke ridiculing Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries with sombrero and mustache is racist/funny.

Both parties have remained publicly entrenched in their positions, with no compromise immediately in sight.\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated with additional information.","summary":"The controversy highlights the role of social media in shaping perceptions during high-stakes political standoffs.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-says-sombreros-will-continue-amid-government-shutdown-10814813","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238632780.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 22:48:01","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":365334972,"title":"Newsom to decide on renter protections tied to Social Security changes under Trump","text":"By Ryan Sabalow | CalMatters\n\nWith the Trump administration again threatening mass firings of federal employees, Gov. Gavin Newsom must soon decide whether California landlords must accept Social Security benefit delays as an excuse not to evict tenants who fall behind on rent.\n\nEarlier this month, the California Legislature passed Culver City Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan’s Assembly Bill 246. The measure would give tenants legal protections in eviction proceedings if their Social Security benefits are “terminated, delayed, or reduced due to no fault of the tenant” and the federal problems caused them to miss rent.\n\nBryan introduced the bill this spring in the middle of the uproar over President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency campaign to slash the federal workforce and fears that Republicans would cut Social Security payments, which they ultimately didn’t do.\n\n“It’s an assurance that if President Trump does come for our aunties and our granddads and our disabled brothers and sisters that California will be there to protect them and won’t let them slide into homelessness because their Social Security was cut off,” Bryan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July.\n\nNewsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure. Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos declined to comment. He has until Oct. 13 to make a decision.\n\nRecent developments in Washington, D.C.could put fresh pressure on Newsom to sign the legislation. Trump’s top federal budget official, Russ Vought, sent a memo last week to the heads of federal agencies telling them to begin more mass firings of federal workers if the government shuts down because Congress can’t pass a spending bill. It’s not clear what Vought’s proposed cuts would mean for Social Security Administration staffing.\n\nDemocratic and Republican members of Congress are at an impasse on the government funding bill. Democrats are demanding Republicans restore billions of dollars of federal health care funding Republicans cut earlier this year. The federal government could shut down on Wednesday if they don’t reach an agreement. Social Security payments haven’t been interrupted during previous government shutdowns.\n\nBut the administration’s threat of more staffing cuts could pose a separate threat.\n\nThis year, DOGE cut roughly 12% of the Social Security Administration workforce, contributing to backlogs at field offices around the country. Customer service problems at Social Security offices are still happening, The New York Times reported last week.\n\nWhat the bill means for California renters\n\nRoughly 6.5 million Californians receive Social Security benefits. It’s not clear how many of California’s estimated 17 million renters rely on the payments for rent.\n\nBut older people eligible for Social Security benefits are an increasing share of renters. One rental market research company estimated that the number of seniors renting in the U.S. has climbed by 30% over the past decade, including a 31% increase in the Los Angeles area and a 24% spike in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe pending law would give renters in a court eviction proceeding the right to cite delays in Social Security payments to avoid being kicked out of their home or apartment.\n\nIf a renter could prove the federal government was at fault for delaying benefits they use to pay rent, the court would be required to pause the eviction for up to six months. Within 14 days of the Social Security benefits being restored, a tenant would have to pay all past due rent or come up with “a mutually agreed upon payment plan” with their landlord.\n\nThe pending law would be in effect until Jan. 20, 2029, the day Trump leaves office from his second term.\n\nSupporters include organizations advocating for the poor and disabled, such as California Council of the Blind and Disability Rights California.\n\n“Due to recent actions by federal officials, including deep staffing cuts and office closures, any government program is at risk,” including Social Security, Eric Harris of Disability Rights California told lawmakers.\n\nThe influential labor organizations Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association, which donate heavily to legislators, also support the bill. The two labor groups and their affiliate unions have donated at least $27.9 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.\n\nOpponents included the California apartment and building industries’ associations and the California Chamber of Commerce. In total, those three groups have donated at least $13.6 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.\n\nRepublicans, some Democrats oppose\n\nDebra Carlton of the California Apartment Association told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that any delays in rent prevent “senior mom and pop landlords” from paying their mortgages on time.\n\nSen. Roger Niello, a Republican representing the Sacramento suburbs, shared those worries with his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. He also noted that “President Trump, both in his first term, as well as in this term, has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to touch Social Security.”\n\n“If the president is good to his word, this bill will do absolutely nothing,” Bryan replied. “But … Californians can’t afford to trust this president. He’s shown several times early in this administration that he is not good to his word.”\n\nNo Republicans voted for the bill as it made its way through both chambers. Two Democrats also were apparently leery of it and voted against their colleague’s measure – a rarity in the California Legislature. As CalMatters has reported, Democrats vote “no” on average less than 1% of the time.\n\nNorwalk Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta cast the lone Democratic “no” vote for the measure on the Senate floor earlier this month. He didn’t explain his vote at the time, and a spokesperson didn’t return a message from CalMatters.\n\nIn the Assembly, Democratic member Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord also joined Republicans in voting against it when it was before her chamber the final time.\n\nIn an interview last week, Ávila Farías, a former trustee of the California Housing Finance Agency, said she was worried about the bill’s “unintended consequences.”\n\n“There’s the flip side of individuals in the business of being property owners,” she said. “They also have struggles, too, when they are not able to meet their monthly obligations.”","summary":"Gov.

The White House did not release details about the call.\nThe order cites the two countries’ “close cooperation” and “shared interest,” vowing to “guarantee the security and territorial integrity of the state of Qatar against external attack.” “The United States shall regard any armed attack on the territory, sovereignty or critical infrastructure of the state of Qatar as a threat to the peace and security of the United States,” the order says.\n“In the event of such an attack, the United States shall take all lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States and of the state of Qatar and to restore peace and stability.” The order apparently came during a visit to Washington on Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump organized a call by Netanyahu to Qatar during the visit in which Netanyahu “expressed his deep regret” over the strike that killed six people, including a member of the Qatari security forces, the White House said.\nQatari officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s order. However, the Qatari-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera prominently reported about it Wednesday under the headline: “New Trump executive order guarantees Qatar security after Israeli attack.” The true scope of the pledge remains in question. Typically, legally binding agreements, or treaties, need to receive the approval of the US Senate. However, presidents have entered international agreements without the Senate’s approval, like President Barack Obama did with Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\nAnd ultimately, any decision to take military action rests with the president. That uncertainty has clouded previous US defence agreements in Trump’s second term, like NATO’s Article 5 guarantees.\nQatar, a peninsular nation that sticks out into the Persian Gulf, became fantastically wealthy through its natural gas reserves. It has been a key US military partner, allowing America’s Central Command to have its forward operating base at its vast Al Udeid Air Base. President Joe Biden named Qatar as a major non-NATO ally in 2022, in part due to its help during America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nIn the aftermath of the Israeli attack, Saudi Arabia entered a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan, bringing the kingdom under Islamabad’s nuclear umbrella. It’s unclear whether other Gulf Arab countries, both worried about Israel and Iran as it faces reimposed United Nations sanctions over its nuclear program, may seek similar arrangements as well with the region’s longtime security guarantor.\n“The Gulf’s centrality in the Middle East and its significance to the United States warrants specific US guarantees beyond President Donald J. Trump’s assurances of nonrepetition and dinner meetings,” wrote Bader al-Saif, a history professor at Kuwait University who analyzes Gulf Arab affairs.

How does it end?","text":"By MARY CLARE JALONICK\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democrats kept their promise to reject any Republican spending bill that didn’t extend or restore health care benefits, choosing instead to force a government shutdown. Now they have to figure out how to get out of it.\n\nJust hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, “the shutdown could go away very quickly.”\n\nBut that won’t be easy. Republican leaders — Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump — have said that they won’t negotiate or be “held hostage ” by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.\n\nWhile that uncompromising Republican position may not last long — there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday — reaching a deal would be difficult. It’s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.\n\nAt the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer’s home state of New York.\n\n“This Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,” Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.\n\nSome wavering Democrats emerge in shutdown saga\n\nRepublicans were encouraged Tuesday evening when three Democrats voted with them to keep the government open — Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.\n\nRepublicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.\n\nThune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill “when they realize that this is playing a losing hand.”\n\nRepublicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting “no” votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.\n\nBut Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that “I have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I’m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.”\n\nDemocrats at a crossroad: To dig in or dig out?\n\nAs some Democrats are already looking for a way out, others say they need to dig in and fight.\n\n“As Donald Trump’s lawlessness grows during this shutdown, our spines should stiffen, not bend,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a social media post on Wednesday. “Let’s stand for something. The American people don’t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.”\n\nThe divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.\n\n“Standing up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,” said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.\n\nThe politics of health care\n\nDemocrats have demanded that Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies for people who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The expanded subsidies first put in place in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire at the end of the year, raising premium costs for millions of people.\n\nMany Republicans have said they are open to an extension, but they want to see changes. Other Republicans — especially in the House — see it as an unacceptable expansion of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, which Republicans have tried to eliminate or cut back since it was enacted 15 years ago.\n\nJohnson has not committed to talks on the issue and said, “There has to be reform.”\n\nObamacare “is a flawed system,” Johnson said on CNBC.\n\nThune has repeatedly said that Republicans are willing to negotiate on the issue once the government reopens.\n\nEven so, some Republicans began informal talks with Democrats on the Senate floor Wednesday about potentially extending the expanded subsidies for a year and then eventually phasing them out. The idea floated by Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota would likely be rejected by many Republicans, but Democrats said they were encouraged that the two sides were talking at all.\n\n“At least we’re on the same page talking about the same problem,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said after the floor huddle. “So I see that as progress, but it’s a long way from where we have to end up.”\n\nLessons from the past\n\nPast shutdowns show that it’s hard to win major concessions by closing the government.\n\nIn 2018, the government shut down for three days as Democrats, led by Schumer, insisted that any budget measure come with protections for young immigrants known as “Dreamers” under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They voted to reopen after then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised only a vote on the issue.\n\nLater that year, Trump forced a shutdown over funding for his border wall and retreated after 35 days as intensifying delays at the nation’s airports and missed paydays for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and House Republicans triggered a shutdown in 2013 over Obama’s health care law. Bipartisan negotiations in the Senate finally ended the shutdown after 16 days, and Republicans did not win any major concessions on health care.\n\n“I don’t think shutdowns benefit anybody, least of all the American people,” Thune said.","summary":"The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-how-does-it-end/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Government_Shutdown_07781.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 22:40:18","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.113}]}
