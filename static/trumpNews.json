He is fighting charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.\n\nHis case, tied to the Apple Daily newspaper that Lai founded, is widely seen as a measure of press freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.\n\nBeijing promised to retain the former British colony's civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security. \n\nAuthorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of the city's leading activists, including Lai and 45 other democracy advocates who were sentenced on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law. \n\nBeijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Lai requested foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing “under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.”\n\nThey pointed to Lai’s meetings with former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and senior U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the massive anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement.\n\nDozens of people were in line Wednesday morning in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong who arrived around 6 a.m. Wong, 64, said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him.\n\n“I haven't seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,” he said.\n\nThe American and British governments and a group of independent United Nations human rights experts have called for Lai's release.\n\nBefore the U.S. election, President-elect Donald Trump, when asked on a podcast whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release, said “100%, I will get him out.”\n\nHong Kong leader John Lee said mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs. Beijing also criticized some U.S. lawmakers for supporting Lai. \n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai's detention to Xi in a meeting during the G20 summit in Brazil.\n\nHong Kong's security minister Chris Tang on Tuesday maintained the prosecution was based on facts.\n\nLai's son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father's treatment in prison is “inhumane.” “My father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,” he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates “has been made at his own request” and was approved by prison authorities.\n\nThe trial has also drawn criticism from media and right groups. \n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists' CEO Jodie Ginsber said “this show trial must end before it is too late.\"","summary":"The landmark national security trial of prominent Hong Kong activist publisher Jimmy Lai resumes Wednesday, with the founder of the now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily expected to testify in his defense soon","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-hong-kong-beijing-chinese-united-states-b2650204.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/20/01/Hong_Kong_Jimmy_Lai_73004.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:03:13","author":"Kanis Leung","authors":["Kanis Leung"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.158},{"id":265896892,"title":"Morning Joe suffers humiliating defeat as show turns off social media comments after they were brutally roasted for Trump flip-flop","text":"Morning Joe suffers humiliating defeat as show turns off social media comments after they were brutally roasted for Trump flip-flop\n\nREAD MORE: Morning Joe hosts defend Trump Mar-a-Lago meeting after being mocked by media colleagues \n\nFollow DailyMail.com's politics live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy STEPHEN M.

I would call them back... I'd go: 'Are you on Twitter?' And he goes, 'I am.' I'd go 'Well I'm not so we've had a good day.'\n\n'All of us will do the best we can do and we're all working towards a better America.'\n\nThe View's Ana Navarro was one of the media figures who unleashed a blistering on-air tirade in response to the pair's surprise visit to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend.\n\nThe political strategist tore into the married MSNBC anchors over their trip to see Trump, calling it 'opportunistic' during her rant. She asked whether the two had 'change[d] their stripes' because of 'who's in power.'\n\nMSNBC's viewership has already taken a nosedive in the week after Donald Trump's landslide election victory\n\nMedia reporter Aaron Rupar also noted that the show's social media feeds have turned off all comments\n\nOn the MAGA side, Megyn Kelly also went after Scarborough and Brzezinski, telling them to go 'f**k themselves.'\n\nMorning Joe hosts defend Trump Mar-a-Lago meeting after being mocked by media colleagues\n\n'Go f**k yourselves, you dishonest jokes of faux journalists,' Kelly said on Monday, reminding her audience that the Morning Joe hosts initially supported Trump's bid for president in 2016.\n\n'It is nauseating, it's so stomach-turning,' Kelly added. 'They're so disgusting.'\n\nFormer Republican candidate for president Nikki Haley said: 'Let's be clear, Joe and Mika didn't suddenly see the light, they saw their ratings. They realized they needed Trump for their survival.'\n\nAmid the backlash, Morning Joe staffers have insisted the Florida meeting was 'f***ing worth it.' \n\nTrump, on his part, told Fox News that he took the meeting because in order to 'Make America Great Again, it is very important, if not vital, to have a free, fair and open media or press.'\n\nTrump and the 'Morning Joe' stars have had a contentious relationship since the Republican entered politics - with Scarborough leaving the Republican party as a result.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Morning Joe repeatedly denounced Trump as a racist, sexist, fascist, and told viewers he did not deserve to be president. At one point, Scarborough said Trump was acting 'full-on Hitler' and Brzezinski condemned him for echoing the 'dangerous language of infamous fascist leaders.' \n\nJoe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have defended themselves from the backlash after they revealed that they met with Donald Trump\n\nBrzezinski said on Monday they decided to reach out to Trump for 'the opportunity to speak with the President-elect, himself' because their viewers and 'regular citizens' have expressed fear following Trump's election and his recent cabinet selections.\n\nScarborough continued, saying the three 'talked about a lot of issues, including abortion, mass deportation, threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets.' \n\nTrump used to be routine contributor to Morning Joe, and Scarborough was an early cheerleader for the billionaire's maverick bid for the GOP nomination in 2016.\n\nBut relations soured as Trump pulled off a surprise victory in the Republican primaries and began to look like a serious challenger to the Democrats' Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe four-hour morning show became a bastion of the Democratic establishment after Trump's first term, with President Joe Biden routinely tuning in while doing his morning exercises to see his acolytes promote the party's talking points.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Scarborough engaged to co-host Brzezinski he began cementing his show's identity as an outpost of opposition to the new administration.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMorning Joe suffers humiliating defeat as show turns off social media comments after they were brutally roasted for Trump flip-flop\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Morning Joe saw a ratings nosedive after the hosts revealed their secret Mar-a-Lago meeting with Donald Trump , as the show's social channels turn off comments to backlash from fans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14103167/morning-joe-turns-social-media-comments-trump-meeting.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/20/00/92265047-0-image-a-6_1732064272357.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/11/19/5133810174508680999/1024x576_MP4_5133810174508680999.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:01:20","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.\n\nAt the meeting of ASEAN leaders last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was “very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes.”\n\nHe pledged that the U.S. would “continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.”\n\nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said U.S. and other military presences from outside the region were the main source of instability in the sea.\n\n“The increasing military deployment and activities in the South China Sea by the U.S. and a few other non-regional countries, stoking confrontation and creating tensions, are the greatest source of instability for peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Mao said.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the incoming Trump administration will address the South China Sea situation.\n\nAfter Austin’s meetings in Australia, the Defense Department said the U.S., Australia and Japan had agreed to expand joint drills in the region, and announced a defense consultation body among the three countries’ forces to strengthen their cooperation.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday while in the Philippines about whether the strong U.S. defense support would continue for the country under Trump, Austin said he would not speculate.\n\nIt remained unclear whether Austin plans to meet China’s Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the ASEAN meetings, but Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani is expected to meet with Dong to express his concerns over Beijing’s military activities, Japan’s NHK reported.\n\nJapan has protested that a Chinese military aircraft violated its airspace briefly in August, and in September Japan expressed “serious concerns” after a Chinese aircraft carrier and two destroyers sailed between two Japanese islands.\n\nThe meetings are also likely to touch on the ongoing tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East. They also expect to hold talks on a range of issues, including natural disasters, cybersecurity and terrorism.\n\nAnother thorny security issue in the region also includes the civil war and growing humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group’s credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021, and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels.\n\nMore than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate that less than half the country’s territory remains under the army’s control.\n\nMyanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year, the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October.\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.","summary":"VIENTIANE – Southeast Asian defense chiefs and representatives are meeting in the&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/defense-chiefs-from-southeast-asian-countries-convene-in-laos-amid-rising-tensions-in-maritime-disputes-with-china/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Southeast-Asian-defense-chiefs-meet-in-Laos-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:01:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.063},{"id":265896898,"title":"Kevin Rudd breaks silence on President-elect Donald Trump's election win, declaring Australia is ‘ready’","text":"Kevin Rudd has insisted Australia is ready to deal with a second Trump presidency as he outlined the arguments for why the incoming administration should stick to the AUKUS submarine deal.\n\nSpeculation about the former prime minister’s ability to remain ambassador in Washington swirled after a senior aide to Donald Trump posted an animation of an hourglass on social media in reference to Mr Rudd’s previous critical commentary about the Republican.\n\nBut in a video address to a United States Studies Centre conference on Wednesday, Dr Rudd said the embassy team he leads was ready to work closely with the new administration.\n\n“The election of the President of the United States is an important moment for the world.

Leading Chinese semiconductor equipment tool firms Naura Technology Group, 3D NAND flash memory chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, DRAM chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies, and chip designer Huawei Technologies all took part in the three-day event.\nGeopolitics has been one of the key concerns for many at the expo, as China braces for the uncertainty surrounding US policies when Trump returns to the White House for a second presidential term in January. Trump has vowed to increase tariffs on China-made goods by 60 per cent.\n\nHe Weiwei, co-founder and general manager at BASiC Semiconductor, said during a panel at the Expo on Tuesday that the company has poured an extra 20 million yuan to 30 million yuan (US$2.8 million to US$4.1 million) into developing manufacturing facilities and materials in mainland China over fears that US sanctions could cut off supplies.\n“This is a huge burden for a start-up like us,” He said. “We used to buy US materials and have the chips manufactured in Taiwan, and then ship them back to mainland China for packaging.”\nWhen Trump started a trade war with China in 2018, BASiC feared it could be cut off from Taiwanese manufacturing, according to He. Technological decoupling in subsequent years also started to hurt expansion plans for Chinese companies.\n“Some first-tier American carmakers made it very clear that they will not buy products made in China,” He said.\nDong Longfei, co-founder of graphics processing unit (GPU) start-up Moore Threads Technology, said in response to a question at a panel on Tuesday that Chinese firms will eventually find a way to advance semiconductor production.\n“I believe if the government, industry and academics combine their efforts, we will solve the manufacturing problems,” he said. “Unlike smartphone chips, GPUs don’t require the most advanced processing node – there are many ways such as chiplets that can help us make [GPUs].”\nChiplets are modular integrated circuits that can be packed together in chips to make a more powerful device. It has been widely viewed as one way for China to overcome certain manufacturing setbacks from US export restrictions.\n\nMoore Threads was added to a US trade blacklist in October 2023, dealing a blow to its ambitions to take on Nvidia in China. The company – started in 2020 by Zhang Jianzhong, the former head of Nvidia’s China operations – lost access to global foundry services using US technology, including TSMC’s, as have many of its domestic competitors such as Biren Technology and Huawei.\nTSMC has notified some Chinese AI chip designers that it will suspend foundry services for 7-nanometre feature sizes or smaller, as the chipmaker tightens its vetting of customers after some of its integrated circuits were found in a Huawei device.\nFew Chinese companies have disclosed where their chips are processed, but no mainland fabs are capable of matching TSMC in advanced nodes.\nTSMC’s sales coming from Shenzhen have ballooned this year on the back of strong demand from manufacturers of smart hardware, even as the world’s largest contract chipmaker faces US pressure to reduce business in China, Zhao Xiaoguang, research head at Tianfeng Securities, said during the panel.\nDespite US efforts to decouple from China, the world’s second-largest economy still has to keep its market open to global semiconductor companies, according to industry experts.\nLiu Yuanchao, deputy general secretary of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, recently told 11 representatives of South Korean chip firms during the China-Korea Semiconductor Expert Conference that the two countries have great potential to work together because they have complementary industries.","summary":"At the 21st China International Semiconductor Expo, industry experts weighed in on the challenges and opportunities ahead in domestic chipmaking.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3287277/tsmcs-move-cut-chinese-chip-firms-weighs-annual-beijing-semiconductor-forum","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/19/81bc9b56-ca4d-471a-96f9-9687909baeca_96ceb383.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:00:10","author":"Che Pan","authors":["Che Pan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":265896986,"title":"Sarah Harte: Young men need an ideology of ‘positive masculinity’ as guidance","text":"At home, we had UFC trash-talking champion Conor McGregor skipping in and out of the High Court defending a civil action brought by Nikita Hand for alleged rape, but more of him later.\n\n A grenade has been thrown into established norms of behaviour, and misogyny is now officially permissible. Open-mouthed, we wonder how the hell we got to the point where lurid frat-boy culture is mainstream\n\nThe dust has settled, and we can say that the American New Right did a superb job of rallying politically disengaged young men aged 19 to 29 to Trump’s cause, aided by a cadre of male influencers, podcasters, and right-leaning political commentators in an alternative mediascape.\n\nBig names include Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, comedian Theo Von, streamer Adin Ross, wrestler Logan Paul, Andrew Schulz, and the Nelk Boys. These bros are a loose cathedral of people with diverse backgrounds; our sons know who they are. Broadly speaking, they sell a compelling mixture of machismo and disaffection to their loyal male fanbases, peddling the idea that traditional masculine virtues are being assaulted and that men must fight back.\n\nAs they drive mainstream politics right in a culturally conservative, nationalist, and economically populist direction, denigration of women is often part of this schtick, either overtly or covertly.\n\nOn the night of Donald Trump’s election, Elon Musk tweeted: “The cavalry has arrived. Men are voting in record numbers. They now realize [sic] that everything is at stake.”\n\nAlleged sex trafficker, far-right influencer, and misogynist kickboxer Andrew Tate replied: “Its men vs gays n chicks.” \n\nWhen Conor McGregor took to Twitter in September to announce his Irish presidential ambitions, Andrew Tate said he would vote for McGregor. Tate won’t be voting in our 2025 election. He doesn’t have a vote despite what he says because having a grandfather from Limerick doesn’t qualify him to vote. He’s also currently under house arrest while being investigated for a human trafficking case.\n\nHowever, Tate wasn’t the only person who supported McGregor. Last December, when McGregor first floated the idea of running for president, Elon Musk, Donald Trump’s right-hand man, tweeted: “I think you could take them all single-handed. Not even fair.”\n\nMcGregor popped up in several conversations I had last week, with two men coincidentally calling him “an animal”, but they are not the demographic being influenced.\n\nHe is put on a pedestal by young men who are impressed by his faux-gangsta, misogynistic schtick. A former RTÉ Sports Personality of the Year, he has acknowledged his influence over young men: “All of them boys want to be me a little. And it’s true as fuck.”\n\nTo digress for a moment, the GAA must think long and hard about who it puts on a pedestal. Seriously, what kind of role model is Kyle Hayes, with convictions for two counts of violent disorder, yet he gets an All-Star award? Really?\n\nMcGregor has made no secret of his views on women. Two years ago, he posted a picture on Instagram naked from the waist down where he implied he was receiving oral sex on the deck of a yacht with the caption: “If you’re getting it, get it top floor of the triple deck.”\n\nI remember seeing it and thinking this is a new low.\n\nThen there was the Instagram post: “Happy International Women’s Day, everyone! Get your tits out for the lads, ladies. We love you.” In an American cable sports channel interview, he said: “I don’t really have a romantic side. If I’m going in, I’m going in for the kill. You won’t catch me walking down the beach holding hands; you will catch me going deep.”\n\nWith more than 47m followers on Instagram and more than 10m on Twitter, his words have reach.\n\nMcGregor fits the current culture that turns other men into opponents and women into objects. He and Tate both depict a cartoonish, exaggerated on-screen persona that aims to entertain with banter and being outrageous. Both glorify a capitalistic idea of life where the size of a man’s wallet matters, tapping into male insecurities around social standing and economic prospects.\n\nWe’re talking quasi-motivational quotes offering quick fixes to complicated problems, fast cars, and declarations of sexual dominance. Both are patently insecure for whatever reason, but that’s beside the point.\n\n To some young men, they come across as bold mavericks. The problem goes deeper than lack of maturity. However irritating, we must acknowledge that equality has made young men insecure; they are unsure about their role. The bottom line is that we need a new script for masculinity and fast\n\nBeing understanding is hard when you feel punch-drunk. The day after the American election, the American writer Rebecca Solnit tweeted: “They want you to feel powerless and surrender and let them trample everything, and you are not going to let them. You are not giving up, and neither am I. The fact that we cannot save everything does not mean we cannot save anything, and everything we can save is worth saving.” She’s right.\n\nBut salvaging something includes trying to reclaim young men. We need to go back to the drawing board because lecturing young men about toxic masculinity isn’t working. I’m dropping this term from my lexicon and replacing it with ‘positive masculinity’, shifting from what you shouldn’t be to what you could be.\n\nAs boys rehearse their masculinity and figure out what kind of man they will be, I think we have to work out what boys like about some of these guys and find a way to give them the tools to critically analyse them with humour. Being earnest or combative won’t cut it.\n\n We need alternative modelling for boys, which means, as I’ve written before, the good men must stick their necks out and roll up their sleeves because most of this shitshow is on older men in society\n\nSo many good men don’t think this problem warrants their attention; they leave child-rearing to mothers, grandmothers, aunts, and teachers. Here is my message: get up off your asses as fathers, grandfathers, and uncles and help your younger male relatives to find positive paths as men.\n\nOur core message to young men should be: Life is not a fight; it’s a race. We want you to lead a happy, fulfilled life, not just because we want you to treat women better, although that is important. We care about you, we have your backs, and, ultimately, we all rise and fall together.","summary":"We now appear to live in a lurid Marvel universe with blow-hard, misogynist, villainous characters","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41519861.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8769/4384922_7_seoimage1x1_Copy_20of_203d8e9189ac6b484c87cd986e0ea8da8d.jpg.jpg_tn_FILE_channel_PRINT","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Sarah Harte","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Sarah Harte"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":265896896,"title":"Jim Chalmers’ major economic update reveals Budget surplus and days of huge revenue windfalls are over","text":"China’s economic slowdown and a softening labour market has hit Federal coffers, leaving Treasurer Jim Chalmers with a “sliver” of the revenue windfalls that have propped up his Budget bottom line for the past two years.\n\nMr Chalmers delivered a major economic statement in Parliament on Wednesday, setting the scene for next month’s mid-year Budget update and the economic environment that frame the Federal election campaign.\n\nThe Treasurer said he was “confident not complacent” that the worst of the inflation storm had passed but said the task of easing pressure on households and repairing the budget was not “mission accomplished”.\n\n“There’s still more to do and plenty to lose if we don’t do more,” Mr Chalmers said.\n\nLabor has reaped the benefits of a strong labour market and high commodity prices since coming to power in 2022, averaging revenue upgrades of $80 billion in each of its four Budget updates.\n\nThe Federal Government has used the revenue boom to pay down Commonwealth debt, helping to save around $80 billion in interest payments over the decade to 2032-33.\n\nBut the days of huge revenue windfalls are over, at least for now, with Treasury expecting any upgrade in the December Budget update to be just a “sliver” of what was enjoyed in the past.\n\nMr Chalmers said Treasury was also expecting to revise down company tax receipts for the first time since 2020.\n\nHe said a softening labour market had been compounded by China’s economic slowdown, which has caused iron ore prices to tumble 30 per cent since the start of the year.\n\n“As a result of these factors, I can inform the House (of Representatives) that Treasury expects any revenue upgrades in the mid-year outlook will be much smaller,” Mr Chalmers said.\n\nAfter posting back-to-back surpluses for the first two in almost 20 years, Dr Chalmers is staring at sizeable deficits through to 2027-28.\n\nMr Chalmers said Treasury’s latest inflation forecasts in next month’s update would be “broadly in line” with the May budget forecast, which expected prices to grow 2.75 per cent in 2024/25.\n\nThe nation’s anaemic growth is expected to continue at least in the short-term, although the Treasurer cast any progress as positive given other countries are going backwards.\n\nOn the global front, Treasury expects growth of the 3.25 per cent in the next three years — the weakest 36 months of growth since the early 1990s.\n\nWithout naming incoming US president Donald Trump or his trade tariffs plans, Mr Chalmers reiterated that Australia’s trade-exposed economy was vulnerable to global economy headwinds.\n\n“But we are well placed and well prepared to deal with them,” he said.\n\nThe Treasurer earlier this week downplayed the prospect of new cost-of-living relief measures in the December update or any pre-election “spend-a-thon” as the Government tightens it belt to continue containing inflation.\n\nThe budget update will allocate funding for newly announced measures, including $900 million in incentives for the States to boost productivity.","summary":"China’s economic slowdown and a softening labour market has left Treasurer Jim Chalmers with a ‘sliver’ of the revenue windfalls that have propped up his Budget bottom line for the past two years.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-politics/jim-chalmers-major-economic-update-reveals-budget-surplus-and-days-of-huge-revenue-windfalls-are-over-c-16811864","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16811864/173042bc52805c81739e1f7948bf7850b7fd9886-16x9-x0y0w4000h2250.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 01:00:00","author":"Dan Jervis,Dan Jervis-Bardy","authors":["Dan Jervis","Dan Jervis-Bardy"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":265897298,"title":"PAKISTAN’S INTERNET BAN: SILENCING VOICES, STIFLING GROWTH, AND BLOCKING OPPORTUNITIES","text":"By Syed Atiq ul Hassan\n\nIn today’s world, the internet is an indispensable tool for education, communication, business, and innovation. From metropolitan cities to remote villages, people rely on high-speed internet and modern communication tools to connect with global markets, enhance their skills, and improve their lives. For developing nations like Pakistan, where economic challenges are severe and unemployment is rampant, the internet offers a crucial lifeline, especially for the youth. However, current government actions to impose internet restrictions have disrupted lives, stifled freedoms, and jeopardized the country’s promising IT sector.\n\nThe Role of the Internet in Pakistan’s Economy: Pakistan’s economy heavily depends on its IT sector, which is brimming with talent and potential. The country boasts over 300,000 English-proficient IT professionals, 13 software technology parks, and produces more than 20,000 IT graduates annually. Freelancers, small businesses, and startups have leveraged platforms like PayPal, Etsy, Amazon, and global e-commerce websites to connect with international markets and sustain their ventures.\n\nWith unemployment at an all-time high, the internet enables thousands of young professionals to work as independent contractors for overseas companies. This arrangement not only provides livelihoods but also boosts Pakistan’s economy through foreign remittances. Unfortunately, government-imposed restrictions on internet access, either slow down or interrupted for several hours every day, and communication tools like WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook have put these opportunities at risk, leaving many out of jobs.\n\nImpacts of Internet Bans: In the past two weeks alone, internet speeds across Pakistan have dropped by 40%, and access to virtual private networks (VPNs) has been restricted. These measures have disrupted businesses, delayed IT projects, and severed connections with international clients. The impact is particularly devastating for freelancers who rely on uninterrupted access to global platforms for their income.\n\nE-commerce platforms, essential for small-scale manufacturers and entrepreneurs, have also been affected. The inability to access these platforms has resulted in a loss of revenue, compounding the financial woes of businesses already struggling due to the country’s unstable economic climate.\n\nThe internet is not just an economic enabler—it is a fundamental right. Blocking access to information and communication tools undermines freedom of expression, curtails self-expression, and isolates communities. Pakistani expatriates, who rely on these platforms to stay connected with their families, have expressed frustration and concern over the situation.\n\nContradictory Religious Justifications: Government officials, including the Prime Minister and military chief, have attempted to justify these restrictions by declaring certain platforms “haram” (prohibited) under Islamic law. This claim is not only unfounded but also contradicts Islamic teachings. Islam encourages the pursuit of knowledge and the use of tools that benefit humanity. As Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) stated, “Seek knowledge even if it be in China, for the seeking of knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim.”\n\nSuch actions by Pakistan’s corrupt and incompetent ruling mafia reflect a pattern of using religion to justify authoritarian measures, rather than addressing the real issues plaguing the country. This misuse of religion has further alienated the population, particularly the youth, who see technology as a pathway to progress.\n\nBrain Drain and Global Migration: Pakistan’s growing political instability and economic hardships have triggered a mass exodus of skilled professionals. According to official statistics, over 765,000 Pakistanis, including highly educated individuals such as doctors, engineers, and IT specialists, left the country in 2022. This represents a 300% increase compared to the previous year, signalling a severe brain drain. The trend has continued unabated, with thousands more leaving in subsequent years.\n\nThis loss of talent is a significant setback for a nation with immense potential to become a global leader in technology and innovation. Instead of creating opportunities for its citizens, Pakistan’s government has pursued policies that drive its brightest minds away.\n\nPolitical Turmoil and the Role of the Diaspora: The internet bans are symptomatic of a broader political crisis in Pakistan. The government’s treatment of the largest opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and its leader, Imran Khan, has drawn widespread criticism. Khan, a popular figure, has been imprisoned since May 2023 under what many believe are fabricated charges. Protests by PTI supporters have been met with violent crackdowns, with peaceful demonstrators arrested and charged under false pretences.\n\nThis political unrest has galvanized Pakistan’s diaspora, who continue to advocate for democracy and justice. Overseas Pakistanis, despite adopting new nationalities, remain deeply invested in their homeland’s future. They have organized protests in democratic nations like the UK, US, Canada, Australia urging world leaders to pressure Pakistan’s government into respecting human rights and releasing political prisoners. Many are looking toward influential figures, such as US President-elect Donald Trump, to intervene on behalf of the Pakistani people.\n\nThe Path Forward: The potential of Pakistan’s IT sector remains immense. As the fifth-most populous country globally and Asia’s fourth-most populous nation, Pakistan has the workforce and talent to become a leading player in the global tech industry. However, this potential can only be realized if the government prioritizes restoring internet access, lifting unnecessary restrictions, and fostering a supportive environment for businesses and professionals.\n\nInternational organizations like Amnesty International have called on the Pakistani government to uphold human rights and refrain from deploying surveillance technologies that infringe on citizens’ privacy. Democratic nations, such as Australia, UK and the US, must also hold Pakistan accountable for its anti-democratic actions and support its citizens in their struggle for freedom and justice.\n\nThe internet is more than just a tool; it is a gateway to opportunity, a platform for self-expression, and a cornerstone of modern life. For Pakistan to thrive, its leaders must recognize the transformative power of connectivity and embrace it as a force for good.\n\nConclusion: The ongoing internet and communication tools bans in Pakistan have far-reaching consequences, from stifling economic opportunities to eroding fundamental rights. The youth, the country’s most valuable asset, are bearing the brunt of these actions, losing jobs and prospects in a digital world that continues to progress without them. Pakistan’s leaders must take urgent steps to restore internet access, uphold democratic values, and provide the nation’s youth with the tools they need to build a brighter future.

Every holiday season, Americans unite to bring smiles to children in need through Operation Christmas Child. Volunteers fill shoeboxes with essentials, school supplies, and toys for children worldwide, especially those facing war, poverty, or disaster. This year, the organization aims to collect enough shoeboxes to reach 12 million children. Since its inception in 1993, Operation Christmas Child has distributed over 220 million shoeboxes across more than 170 countries and territories.DONALD TRUMP JR., KRISTI NOEM JOIN FRANKLIN GRAHAM IN HELENE-TORN NORTH CAROLINA WITH SAMARITAN'S PURSE \"This project started with just 11,000 shoeboxes in 1993, and this year we hope to reach 12 million children around the world with the hope of Jesus Christ,\" said Rev. Franklin Graham, President of Samaritan's Purse. \"This is only something God could do and we give Him the glory for each and every one of these Gospel opportunities.\" Samaritan’s Purse, based in Boone, North Carolina, faced major challenges after Hurricane Helene devastated the region. The humanitarian aid ministry responded by distributing thousands of heaters, generators, blankets, and winter supplies. Samaritan’s Purse has also completed the largest civilian airlift operation in American history to relieve those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, completing 358 missions so far. Their ministry includes an army of over 30,000 volunteers -- or, \"orange shirts\" – mudding out homes, cutting down trees, and clearing debris.SAMARITAN'S PURSE CONTINUES TO LEAD NORTH CAROLINA RELIEF EFFORTS IN WAKE OF DEVASTATING HURRICANE HELENEHurricane Helene also destroyed thousands of shoeboxes already prepared for children in North Carolina.Despite their losses from these storms, communities remain committed. Families, school groups, and churches continue packing boxes, determined to share the joy of Christmas with children in need. A church in the mountains of North Carolina, where Rev. Graham attends, saw its youth building flooded. Fortunately, the shoeboxes had been packed and moved out just in time. Rev. Graham praised the resilience of the community, saying, \"I’ve never seen anything like the people here. They’ve lost so much, but they continue giving the gift of hope to children around the world.\" Churches and families devastated by Helene have shown incredible determination. Cherry and Mark Brumbelow of Texas, who experienced similar losses during Hurricane Harvey, traveled to North Carolina to encourage others.\"When we saw what was happening here, our hearts were burdened. We prayed to the Lord and asked what we could do to help,\" Cherry Brumbelow said.Their small church of 55 members has already packed 15,000 shoeboxes this year and sent over 1,400 on behalf of storm-affected communities in western North Carolina. One such community is Lake Lure Baptist Church, which flooded during Hurricane Helene. Lynda Poe, the Operation Christmas Child drop-off team leader, described one Lake Lure church member’s harrowing survival story.\"He was trying to stay in the house as long as he could. The river rose faster than he was able to anticipate, so he got in his truck and it started floating away,\" said Poe in a release. \"By the grace of God, it got caught on a rock, allowing him to escape. His house was flooded and they had to tear it down.\"More churches like Spruce Pine First Baptist Church in North Carolina are going above and beyond. In addition to serving as an Operation Christmas Child drop-off location, the church has distributed supplies to those in need and served over 40,000 meals to local residents and volunteers. First Baptist Church in Damascus, Virginia had catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Helene which washed away the Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes that children had been collecting all year.\"I didn’t get to the church until two days after the flood because we had roads washed out. A lot of people couldn’t get out of their houses,\" said Angie Fritz, Operation Christmas Child project leader for First Baptist Damascus. \"Everything was surreal.\"\"God made a way for us,\" said Fritz. \"We’re excited to still get this opportunity to pack Gospel opportunities.\"National Collection Week is still on schedule from November 18–25 despite these devastating storms, with over 4,700 drop-off locations across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. \"I’m grateful to God for each and every person who has been a part of Operation Christmas Child,\" said Rev. Graham. \"One couple said they packed shoeboxes using a candle while their power was out in the storm, and when another woman’s home started to flood, the first thing she ran into her basement to save were her shoeboxes. There are so many stories here of people who love God, love their neighbors, and love children around the world.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSamaritan’s Purse encourages everyone to join this mission of hope by visiting samaritanspurse.org to find a drop-off location near you or learn how to pack a shoebox.","summary":"Despite Hurricane Helene&apos;s devastation across North Carolina and much of the Southeast, communities are stepping up to donate to Operation Christmas Child through Samaritan&apos;s Purse.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/after-losing-everything-helene-survivors-give-operation-christmas-child-during-national-donation-week","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/operation-christmas-child-hurricane-helene.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:58:45","author":"Jasmine Baehr","authors":["Jasmine Baehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.248},{"id":265896626,"title":"Don’t break Senate confirmations, EU may need Trump’s ‘tough love’ and other commentary","text":"Elex desk: Don’t Break Senate Confirmations\n\nDonald Trump’s “demand that the Senate go into recess to allow his top appointees to take office without a confirmation vote would be a complete abdication of the chamber’s constitutional advice and consent responsibility,” thunders Max Stier at The Hill.\n\nYes, “the confirmation system is clearly broken, with the Senate routinely taking far too long to review and vote on presidential appointees.”\n\n“In addition to discouraging qualified nominees from government service, the system does not work for the Senate itself.”\n\nBut abdication’s no answer. “Senators should reduce the number of positions subject to confirmation” and change rules so “a single senator cannot singlehandedly stall the confirmation process.”\n\n“Fixing the current system will best serve the public interest — running roughshod over it will not.”\n\nForeign beat: EU May Need Trump’s ‘Tough Love’\n\n“It’s been another tough year” for Europe, observes Walther Russell Mead at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIts “economies have stagnated,” and its security situation is “dire.” And Europe “will be the biggest loser from Donald Trump’s return to the White House.”\n\nThe “root cause” of its woes? It “failed to build an economy, tech industry, political system or security strategy” that’s “adequate to the demands of the 21st century.”\n\nIndeed, “to much of the world, Europe seems less a model to emulate than an example of what not to do.”\n\nYet its “fragility is a significant factor in the developing world crisis.” Maybe America has been “too much of a helicopter parent,” fostering dependency.\n\nIf so, some “Trumpian tough love may be exactly what Europe needs.”\n\nLiberal: SciAm’s Shameless Trans Coverage\n\nFormer Scientific American Editor in Chief Laura Helmuth, who resigned after posting a rant against Trump supporters on Bluesky, promoted a “political agenda” that “turned the once-respected magazine into a frequent laughingstock,” writes Jesse Singal at Reason.\n\nMost notably, Scientific American “hermetically sealed itself and its readers inside a comforting, delusional cocoon” that claimed “youth gender medicine works” and “only bigots and ignoramuses suggest otherwise.”\n\nHard evidence on that is “scant,” but SciAm often simply took the activists’ word about treatments “and repeated it, basically verbatim, effectively laundering medical misinformation and providing it with the imprimatur of a highly regarded science magazine.”\n\n“Scientific American can right the ship by simply hiring an editor who cares more about science than progressive political goals.”\n\nConservative: Make America Responsible Again\n\nIt’s “absurd” to claim “Americans’ genes have changed in the last half century in such a way as to make Americans gain weight,” sneers City Journal’s Heather Mac Donald.\n\nYet some argue “obesity is a genetic disorder” largely “outside the control of its victims.”\n\n“To make America healthy again,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., if confirmed, “will have to take on this conceit.”\n\nAlas, his “background in environmental litigation” will lead him to focus “obsessively on chemicals.”\n\nA better idea? End “food-stamp subsidies for sodas and prepared food” — and offer “food itself.”\n\n“Blaming corporate or social forces for bad decisions within an individual’s control is a left-wing impulse.”\n\nIf people take personal responsibility, “they can restore their bodies to their proper shape and function.”\n\nCulture critic: Free Speech for Haters, Not Jews\n\n“Less than a week after the pogrom in Amsterdam, UN celebrity Jew-baiter Francesca Albanese was scheduled to speak in London,” groans Commentary’s Seth Mandel.\n\n“The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, a British organization, worked up plans to protest,” but security officials “picked up chatter on social media apps in which locals were very plainly making plans to attack the Jewish demonstrators,” so the group called it off.\n\nThough “Jews nominally have the same rights as anyone, in practice that’s a joke.”\n\n“The enforcement is not through permits, but violence. And that violence goes unprevented and unpunished by the authorities.”\n\nFor Jews, “your speech will always be regulated by other people’s violence. And the enlightened denizens of the free world find no fault in that system.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Donald Trump’s “demand that the Senate go into recess to allow his top appointees to take office without a confirmation vote would be a complete abdication of the chamber’s constitutional advice and consent responsibility,” thunders Max Stier at The Hill.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/19/opinion/dont-break-senate-confirmations-eu-may-need-trumps-tough-love-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-s1dpl2jz0-1732061485477.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1732046167&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:58:02","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":265896300,"title":"G20 Summit: Brazil's president urges developed nations to speed up initiatives on climate change","text":"Brazil's president opened the second day of the G20 Summit by calling for more action to slow global warming, saying developed nations must speed up their initiatives to reduce harmful emissions.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva focused Tuesday's session on environmental challenges, saying developed nations should consider moving their 2050 emission goals forward to 2040 or 2045.“The G20 is responsible for 80% of greenhouse effect emissions,” Lula said. “Even if we are not walking the same speed, we can all take one more step.”During the summit, which was held at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum, G20 leaders gathered to discuss changes in the world order from heightened global tensions to changes on the international political stage.The agenda focused on working to reinforce multilateral cooperation before US President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January.EU leaders also took the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.In a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed France’s commitment to strengthening relations with China and insisted that the two countries shared the same views on promoting peace in Ukraine.\"The world in which we live, as you just reminded us, is made up of instabilities, tensions and growing wars.

back to the future at the UN Security Council this week as an outgoing Democratic administration eyes multilateral opportunities to support its Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.\n\nMembers of Congress from both sides of the aisle should respond with one word President Biden knows well: Don’t.\n\nEight years ago, in the weeks following Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, the outgoing Obama administration shepherded a Security Council resolution that declared Israel’s settlements in Judea, Samaria and parts of Jerusalem — including near the Western Wall — a violation of international law.\n\nThe resolution passed by a vote of 14-0 — and the United States abstained rather than use its permanent member veto.\n\nThe move was intended to box in the incoming Trump administration, limiting it to a failed peace paradigm and pressing Israel to give up territory to the Palestinian Authority, which indoctrinates its children to hate Jews and then pays terrorists to kill them.\n\nThe resolution handed Israel’s detractors a thin veneer of international law to conceal a blatantly antisemitic thesis that Jews have no right to live in their ancestral homeland — even in their eternal capital, including their religion’s holiest site.\n\nTrump, of course, was not constrained by the UN’s lawfare.\n\nHis administration moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, declared that Israeli settlements in disputed territories were not inherently illegal and pressured the Palestinian Authority to end its “pay for slay” terror support.\n\nHe defunded the UN Relief and Works Agency and withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council — two leading promulgators of UN antisemitism.\n\nAnd alongside a maximum pressure campaign on Iran, Trump delivered something historic: Arab-Israeli normalization agreements without a Palestinian state.\n\nThe Biden administration came into office knowing that Trump’s Abraham Accords disproved three decades of Middle East peacemaking strategy — and would soon force the Palestinians to either end their quest for Israel’s destruction, or get left behind by history.\n\nTo return to the failed paradigm, Biden resumed funding to UNRWA despite its close collaboration with Hamas, and rejoined the Human Rights Council.\n\nWorse, having already lifted pressure on Iran and distanced Washington from Riyadh, the Biden administration tied future normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia to Palestinian statehood.\n\nAll this took place before Oct. 7. \n\nThat day should have been a terrifying reminder that there are consequences for subsidizing, incentivizing or enabling those who plot genocide.\n\nBut rather than learning any lessons, the Biden administration doubled down.\n\nWith indisputable evidence that UNRWA operates in Gaza as an arm of Hamas, Congress temporarily banned US funding — but the State Department continues to say UNRWA is indispensable, and pushes allies to fund it.\n\nBiden reversed Trump’s position on settlements, aligning US policy with the 2016 Security Council resolution.\n\nMost alarming, Biden issued an executive order that brought the BDS campaign inside the US government, hitting Israeli individuals, nonprofits and companies with sanctions typically reserved for America’s worst enemies.\n\nNow, with just two months left until Trump returns to office, Israel’s detractors are pushing harder.\n\nThis week, the Security Council is considering a resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional Israeli ceasefire in Gaza, without any requirement for Hamas to release its remaining 101 hostages — and enshrining UNRWA as the “backbone of humanitarian response in Gaza.”\n\nIt should be a no-brainer for Washington to veto this pro-Hamas resolution.\n\nOther resolutions may soon follow: The White House might seek to box Trump and Israel into a Saudi-Israel peace proposal that hinges on unachievable Palestinian demands, or to endorse a resolution giving full diplomatic recognition to the (invented) Palestinian state.\n\nOr, knowing that Trump will rescind his BDS executive order, Biden might sign off on a UN sanctions framework targeting Jews living in disputed territories.\n\nThe Biden State Department would call it a multilateral action to deter “West Bank extremists.” \n\nEveryone else would call it what it is: BDS.\n\nOther shenanigans might emerge inside the General Assembly, where Palestinians hope to strip Israel’s UN credentials.\n\nIf Democrats want to save their party from further drift into the antisemitic abyss, they should call the White House this week and urge Biden to halt all such hostilities toward Israel during his final days in office.\n\nRepublicans should issue warnings to the United Nations as well: A new administration arrives in 60 days with the power to defund and impose sanctions of its own.\n\nWith unified GOP control of the White House, Senate and House, the UN should consider its next moves carefully.\n\nRichard Goldberg is a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.","summary":"The Security Council is considering a resolution demanding an unconditional Israeli

\n\nAnd the thugs’ “violent tendencies” have only grown, warns the memo.\n\nMake no mistake: This is not anti-migrant scaremongering, as the left might claim; it comes from officials at Alejandro Mayorkas’ Department of Homeland Security, the very agency that’s not only failed to keep violent gangs out of the country but has virtually invited them in.\n\nPresident Biden’s come-one, come-all border policies, which DHS oversees, opened the doors to millions of migrants, including gang members entering thanks to the paucity of vetting.\n\nSo much for the countless claims from the prez and Mayorkas that the border is secure or at least “under control”; now even DHS itself admits (to itself, anyway) that migrant crime and violence are exploding.\n\n“As the population of Venezuelan

If anything, I’m the one who could get in trouble,’ Dwanyen claims the agent said.\n\nThat’s when he dared her to defile the former First Lady Michelle Obama’s bathroom with him.\n\n‘We should have sex in Michelle [Obama]’s bathroom, like a mile-high club,’ Dwanyen claims he suggested.\n\nThe Secret Service has confirmed that due to this and several other breaches, ‘Dale’ has been fired. \n\n‘On Nov. 6, 2022, a Secret Service agent involved in protective functions brought an individual who did not have authorized access into a protectee’s residence without permission,’ Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi told ABC News. \n\n‘As soon as the Secret Service became aware of the incident, the agent involved was immediately suspended and after a full investigation, terminated.’\n\nHe added that the Obamas were not present when ‘Dale’ tried to bring Dwanyen for a tryst. \n\n‘Although the protectees were not present at the time of the incident, these actions were an unacceptable violation of our protocols, our protectees’ trust and everything we stand for,’ he added.\n\n‘Dale’ was a serial liar, according to Dwanyen’s book, saying that he lied about not being married and would continuously gossip about information learned from his job guarding the Obamas. \n\n‘There were major red flags—breaches of trust and of his job,’ Dwanyen said. ‘One of my friends has joked, ‘You were a walking national security risk.’\n\nHe would also gossip about some of the other people he was assigned to guard, like Vice President Mike Pence. \n\nDwanyen knew code names, some of Michelle Obama’s private schedule and other ‘things that I should not have been privy to as a civilian.’ \n\nEventually, she blew the whistle and sent an email to ‘Dale’s’ boss after having met him previously and gotten his contact info from the emails he shared with her. \n\nIt’s the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service, after an independent report on the first assassination attempt against Donald Trump concludes it’s likely another incident will happen if there is not a complete overhaul to the agency.\n\nThe four-person panel released a scathing 52-page report Thursday claiming there is a ‘loss of public confidence’ in the group tasked with protecting all current and former presidents as well as major party presidential candidates.\n\nWithout massive reform, the report claims, there will be more incidents like the one at the Butler, Pennsylvania rally on July 13.\n\nThe group appointed by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is just one of the several groups looking into the USSS failures that allowed shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, to get just a few hundred feet within the former president with an AR-15 rifle.","summary":"The ex-girlfriend of a Secret Service agent who got her former lover&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/former-girlfriend-of-secret-service-agent-wishes-stories-about-their-romantic-encounters-at-obamas-beach-house-will-become-a-movie/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Secret-Service-agents-ex-girlfriend-hopes-their-Obama-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:47:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":265895218,"title":"Trump joins Musk for rocket launch as he continues staffing up administration","text":"Trump joins Musk for rocket launch as he continues staffing up administration\n President-elect Donald Trump continued announcing picks for Cabinet positions and administrative roles, including tapping banking CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department.

made-in-China","text":"Wow! Who says election promises don't produce real change?\n\n Candidate Donald Trump had loudly proclaimed that he'd force U.S. corporations to move their Chinese manufacturing jobs back to America. How? By imposing a whopping new tariff on all the made-in-China products they sell to us.\n\n Even he must have been surprised, though, when one major American corporation promptly shouted, \"Yes, sir!\" Only one day after Trump's election, the Steve Madden shoe manufacturer announced it would leave China, where nearly all of its footwear is made. Amazing -- a victory for Trump policy even before he takes office! And a morale boost for American workers.\n\n So, where would Madden relocate? Maybe in the hard-hit industrial Midwest, or maybe such former shoe-making areas as New England and the Southeast. But no. In a less-pleasant surprise to Trump, Madden executives said they would not replant their factories in the USA -- but in Vietnam, Cambodia and Brazil.\n\n Despite appearing to succumb to Trump's anti-China tariff, Madden is making an end run around it, \"leaving China\" by taking China with it. The corporate trick here is the structural reality that not only are U.S. factories located in China but so are the suppliers of the materials manufacturers must buy to make their products. So, Madden can scoot down to Vietnam, thus escaping Trump's China tariff -- but the shoe's components (from laces to soles) will still be Chinese-made. And contrary to Trump's bragging, his policy will not create a single made-in-America job.\n\n Let's remember that corporations are the most aggressively selfish elites in our society, and we should not be duped into thinking that running job-creation policy through them will benefit anyone but them.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATS' RURAL PROBLEM IS THEY'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FARM\n\n As any farmer can tell you, if you want to plant, grow and harvest a crop, you've got to get out of the office and go to work in the field.\n\n Why can't the top political strategists, donors and consultants of the Democratic Party grasp this basic reality when it comes to producing votes? This year was going to be different. Pressed by progressive rural activists, national party leaders proudly declared that they would open a network of get-out-the-vote offices in rural, red areas of battleground states. SPOILER ALERT: In states that Joe Biden won, Kamala Harris won 104,000 fewer rural votes than Biden harvested four years earlier.\n\n What happened? Very little, too late. Opening a campaign office is hardly the same as being there for the long haul, building trust and nurturing local support. Harris was behind from the start, though, since Biden's Democratic Party operation had not bothered to hire any rural staffers or even prepare an agenda. Apparently, their idea of a good rural program was Hee-Haw. \n\n The Harris campaign did put out a plan -- but in September, just two months before the vote! Also, they had too many \"rural strategists\" and too few ground-level organizers at campaign headquarters. Those organizers did their best but were mostly disregarded by campaign consultants. For example, a good list of rural surrogates was recruited but never used. Worse, Harris herself was absent -- she was never scheduled to visit a farm, or even pay a culturally symbolic visit to a state fair.\n\n The Democrats' real problem is not any one campaign but more than a decade of policy and political abandonment of rural communities. Do the smart leaders think people out here don't notice the party's absence and disregard for them? Again, any farmer knows you can't harvest a crop if you don't plant one and cultivate it.\n\nNOW READ: The Democratic Party needs a backbone","summary":"Wow!

The decision formed after it became clear that fellow transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, and not McMahon, would be made commerce secretary. \n\nLutnick, the CEO of financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, was also in the running to become treasury secretary, setting off a fight with Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager. \n\nMcMahon led the Small Business Administration between 2017 and 2019 when she left to head up the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action. \n\nThe 76-year-old is the board chair of the pro-Trump think tank America First Policy Institute, created in 2021 by McMahon and other advisers from Trump’s first stint in the White House, such as Larry Kudlow, the former director of the National Economic Council. \n\nRaising millions since its founding, the America First Policy Institute has served as a home for possible future Trump appointees and advisers, putting forward policies for a second Trump White House. \n\nMcMahon, the wife of Vince McMahon, was previously the CEO of WWE, which she co-founded. She left the role in 2009 after transforming it from a small wrestling entertainment firm to a media giant. \n\nShe ran for senate in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, losing both times. The non-profit Open Secrets which tracks campaign financing found that she spent $50.1m of her own money in 2010 and $48.7m two years later. \n\nIn 2012, Trump donated $5,000 to her campaign. \n\nAccording to Open Secrets, McMahon donated more than $7m to two Super PACs supporting Trump during his first run for president. \n\nTrump has made clear that he wants to abolish the federal Department of Education after accusing it of “indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material.”\n\nBut to axe the department, Trump would probably need the support of at least 60 senators, including some Democrats, who would not vote to abolish the department, which is in charge of funding for public schools, student loans, and programs to aid students with lower incomes. \n\nSimilarly, Trump would struggle to get the House to abolish the department. Last year, abolishing the department was attached as an amendment to a separate bill, and 60 Republicans voted against the measure.","summary":"The former WWE CEO served as the head of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-linda-mcmahon-education-secretary-b2650153.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/19/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZO3Sc04G-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:40:32","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.177},{"id":265894910,"title":"What happens next in Trump's \"hush money\" case?","text":"What happens next in Trump's \"hush money\" case?\n Prosecutors in President-elect Donald Trump's New York City criminal case say his sentencing could be postponed, but will oppose any effort to dismiss the case.

On the outside I was doing a beautiful job but, deep down inside, I was really struggling,' she wrote in her book. \nEven after giving birth to her youngest child, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl recalled feeling consumed by the desire to drink a bottle of champagne that was gifted to her. \nDespite receiving a warning from her two naturopaths that drinking too soon after giving birth would disrupt her hormones, Macpherson admitted that when left alone with Cy in her arms all she 'could think about was that bottle of champagne in the ice bucket.'\nIn order to navigate motherhood and her career, she turned to vodka to relax in the evenings as she desperately tried to maintain her perfect image to the public. \n\nElle Macpherson detailed the depths of her alcoholism and journey to sobriety in a powerful chapter of her memoir, elle: Life, Lessons & Learning to Trust Yourself; seen in July 2022\n\nWhile reflecting on getting clean, the 60-year-old Australian supermodel revealed she frequently got black-out drunk and began drinking 'shots of vodka' after putting her sons Cy, 21, and Flynn Busson, 26, to bed\nAt the time, she was in a relationship with French financier Arpad 'Arki' Busson, who was often away during the week on business. \nThis left her in a difficult position as their son, Flynn, was 'very sick and was in and out of the hospital,' according to Page Six.\nDespite considering going to rehab, she told Arki that she was fine. \nEven after battling pneumonia after Cy's birth, she quickly went back to work, in an attempt to prove to Arki and herself that motherhood hadn't slowed her down. \n\n 'I felt sick to the stomach': Elle Macpherson on when she began relationship with her 'inner self' \n'I loved spending time with Arki and … I wanted to prove to him I would be his partner in fun and business while being the mother of his sons,' she wrote. 'I would go out and drink, party and become sick again. It became a constant repeat: I was in a horrible downward spiral.'\nMacpherson also wrote about experiencing scary blackouts.\n'I would be talking to somebody and then I would forget what I was saying. They would look at my quizzically as if waiting for me to continue,' she wrote.\nStill, she kept on turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism for her anxiety. \n'Often I would drink after I put my children to bed. I would sit down by myself and have shots of vodka and then I’d write to-do lists and letters to my family. I would do he housework, listen to music until around 11 p.m., then go to bed and pass out,' she detailed. \nShe continued: 'I would get up in the morning, run six miles and have a coffee for breakfast... I would sick my fingers down my throat and make sure I vomited three times before I went to sleep. It was always three times.'\n\n'My life looked amazing to everybody. On the outside I was doing a beautiful job but, deep down inside, I was really struggling,' she wrote in her book; seen in 2019\nDespite struggling with her mental health and addiction, Macpherson recalled how people would tell her that she was 'was so organized.'\n'I was really proud of that. I guess I had to be organized because I was drinking and I never wanted anyone to know,' the mother-of-two wrote. 'So I made sure the house was clean and tidy; I made sure I looked great and I made sure the children were perfect.'\nThose closest to Macpherson, however, began to suspect something was wrong. \nHer naturopaths were among the first to suggest rehab.\n\nMacpherson also wrote about experiencing scary blackouts and what led her to go to rehab \n\nThe star was was famously dubbed 'The Body' at 25 (pictured in 1990)\nBefore agreeing to rehab, she insisted on spending the summer in Ibiza with her family, against her therapist's advice.\nAlthough she managed not to drink for the first few weeks, things went south after she was unable to join Arki and their friends on a night out to a trendy club.\nAfter putting her kids to bed, she decided to open a bottle of vodka.\nFollowing a battle to get it open, she smashed off the glass top. \n'I hurriedly poured myself a shot that could have been littered with shards of glass. And I drank it,' she wrote. 'I remember thinking, I love this feeling. I’d missed it, sooooo much.'\n\nLast year, she celebrated 20 years of sobriety\nAt the time, her 'youngest son was only six months old' and her 'eldest was five and a half.'\nOnce in rehab at a facility in Arizona, Macpherson recalled feeling 'humiliated and angry' to be grouped with those struggling with anorexia due to her thinness. \nUltimately, she said the rehab was justified to classify her in that group as she realized she 'was somewhat controlling' with her diet.\nWhile in rehab, she went by 'Mac' to keep a low profile and worried about being recognized. \nLast year, she celebrated 20 years of sobriety. \n\nMacpherson pictured with her son Cy Busson in 2022\n\nThe model seen with her son Flynn Busson in 2018\nPreviously, Macpherson stated that she's 'never regretted' cutting alcohol from her life. \n'I stopped drinking in 2003 because I felt I couldn’t be fully present in my life, and it was a wonderful springboard of getting to know myself on a deeper level,' she told Body and Soul in 2023. 'Although it required discipline and persistence, the bottom line is you can’t be well and present in your life if you’re not present and well, and alcohol doesn’t really support that.'\nShe concluded: 'It’s very difficult to get to know yourself if you’re numbing yourself.'\nMacpherson also insisted that she doesn't preach sobriety to others and is 'not interested in telling other people what to do' with their lives. \nElle Macpherson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nElle Macpherson reveals depths of her alcohol addiction in new memoir as she recalls drinking 'vodka every night'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nI'm A Celeb's Tulisa comes out as demisexual and reveals she's been celibate for over THREE years\n\nNicole Kidman, 57, looks ageless in a statement red dress as she join honourees Jude Law and Richard Gadd at 2024 GQ Men Of The Year awards\n\nEXCLUSIVEMaura Higgins declares she is SINGLE in major slap in the face to love interest Pete Wicks - as bikini-clad reality star finally prepares to start her I'm A Celeb... journey\n\nAMANDA PLATELL: What an utter humiliation for Amanda Abbington this new Strictly revelation will be... it's time to ask her\n\nI'm A Celeb's Coleen Rooney is completely unbothered as she continues her workout in a bikini as two possums invade camp\n\nApp-tastic!

Health Defense.\n\nMr Evans, in a Telegram post on Tuesday, thanked Mr Kennedy for helping to organise the book.\n\n“So please(d) and thankful that Robert Kennedy Jr set this up for me with his Children’s Health Defense team,” he posted.\n\n“Stay tuned for more.”\n\nMr Kennedy, the son of former US Attorney-General and Democratic presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy and the cousin to current

children from potentially catastrophic illnesses, suggesting instead there is a link between vaccines and developmental delays.\n\n“While correlation doesn’t necessarily indicate causation, it’s clear that something is amiss and the health of our children is going in the wrong direction,” the organisation’s website states.\n\n“The only way to stop these troubling health trends is by investigating all possible causes, even if it means re-examining what has ironically been considered ‘settled science’ in mainstream medicine.”\n\nAmbassador Kennedy, in a speech to the National Press Club, warned her cousin’s position on vaccines were “dangerous”.\n\n“I think Bobby Kennedy’s views on vaccines are dangerous but I don’t think that most Americans share them, so we’ll just have to wait and see what happens,” she said.\n\nRFK Jr. endorsed Republican Donald Trump for president, bucking his family’s longstanding ties to the Democratic Party, and President Trump nominated him for the position of health secretary following his emphatic election victory.\n\n“I grew up with him, so I’ve known all this for a long time, and others are just getting to know him,” Ambassador Kennedy said.\n\n“You know, my uncle (Massachusetts Senator) Teddy (Kennedy) spent 50 years fighting for affordable health care in the Senate and it’s something that our whole family is so proud of, that President Obama

Nigeria","text":"Wall Street recorded its biggest one-day jump in four years after Donald Trump was elected U.S president. Major stock markets around the world surged while bitcoin hit an all-time-high.\n\nBut this record rally triggered in advanced economies by the Trump presidency announcement did not trickle down to most emerging and frontier markets.\n\nStrong expectations have been expressed in some quarters that emerging and frontier markets of Africa, particularly Nigeria, could benefit from the prospects of Trump rally, subsequently, as the weeks go by.\n\nFor instance, a senior market analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, had stated that the victory of Donald Trump may pressure oil prices and trigger inflation in a concomitant effect on the local economy in Nigeria.\n\n“Trump’s victory may pressure oil prices as he is seen pushing for a further increase in domestic oil and gas production, leading to increased supply in the long term.\n\n“In addition, his policies could see a boost in US growth, triggering inflationary pressures. Should this prompt the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer, a stronger dollar may drag oil prices lower as a result.\n\n“This could be bad news for major oil producing countries who acquire most of their revenues from oil sales. “For Nigeria, the combination of lower global oil prices and a stronger dollar could add to its woes as it navigates a rough period,” Otunuga had stated in his published forecast.\n\nRegime’s impact\n\nHowever, some other financial analysts insist that Trump’s policies are not likely to have any impact on emerging market like Nigeria.\n\nAccording to them, Trump’s policies will more likely trigger outflow of investments from Nigeria than inflow. Mr. Teslim Shitta-Bey, a financial analyst at Proshare Nigeria, explained that what Trump could do is to cut tax rate and increase tariff on Chinese company products.\n\n“That means companies after tax profits will rise. So America will become more interesting prospects for investors because American companies will now have higher after tax profits, and will also pay higher dividends. “As profits rise in America, dividend will also rise.\n\nIt holds a greater prospects for investors to gain higher dividend yield and higher capital appreciation through share price increases. “So, America could likely see a stronger capital market. I don’t see Nigeria taking any advantage of those situations over America.\n\nNo! So, looking ahead, Nigerian market will likely not gain portfolio inflow. Yes, in a short term. Already all this adjustments have been priced in,” said Shitta-Bey.\n\nOn whether there could be increase in oil prices that may benefit Nigeria, the Proshare analyst said: “If you have a situation where American companies are doing better and growing faster, you should expect the demand for oil will increase and perhaps oil prices could rise marginally.\n\nBut I don’t think that is going to happen. “Don’t forget that the US is the world’s largest oil producer currently.” He pointed out that Saudi Arabia had cut the quantity of oil they produce; they are producing less than 10 million barrel per day, and Russia has done the same, although Russia is selling on black market.\n\nIn any case, Shitta-Bey does not see any much change or impact in a country like Nigeria. Also speaking, analysts at Parthian Partners led by Mr. Nonso Ndunagu argued that Trump’s proposed tax cuts could stimulate the U.S. economy by boosting consumer spending, driving investment, and enhancing corporate profitability.\n\nThis, in turn, would likely lead to higher global demand for oil, pushing prices up. “Being an oil exporting country, Nigeria would benefit from increased oil revenues, which could help bolster the country’s external reserves and support a stronger naira.\n\n“Furthermore, the improved liquidity in global markets could attract more capital inflows into Nigeria’s capital market,” the Parthian Partners analysts stated.\n\nHowever, they noted that the tax cuts may also result in higher fiscal deficits in the U.S., potentially leading to an increase in the national debt and driving up interest rates.\n\n“This could make U.S. assets more attractive to investors, causing capital to flow out of emerging markets, including Nigeria.\n\n“Additionally, the imposition of new tariffs on foreign goods could raise demand for domestically produced items in the U.S., which may strengthen the dollar. “This could exert further pressure on the Nigerian Naira, leading to currency depreciation and higher inflation.\n\nRising business costs and reduced purchasing power would likely hurt corporate performance, ultimately weighing on the performance of the Nigerian stock market,” Parthian Partners lead analyst concluded.\n\n More troubles\n\nAccording to Parthian Partners lead analyst, other Nigerian investment instruments, particularly fixed income investments, could trigger increased debt portfolio.\n\nHe argued: “The potential rise in the U.S. national debt resulting from the proposed tax cuts could lead to higher interest rates in the U.S. This would raise the cost of servicing external debt, prompting the Nigerian government to increase domestic borrowing.\n\n“As a result, heightened government borrowing within Nigeria’s domestic market would likely push up interest rates and yields in the fixed income market.”\n\nHowever, Proshare lead analyst, Mr. Shitta-Bey, noted that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would not likely take any more hawkish approach towards monetary policy. “It has already taken very tight approach towards monetary policy,” he said.\n\nHe disagreed with projections that suggest that with CBN policies Nigeria would likely see growth at 3.1 per cent by end of 2024. “That’s not going to happen. Growth in Nigeria will be less than three per cent in 2024.\n\nThe reason is basically that interest rates are very high. Already we see companies having difficulties in accessing credit. They are also having difficulties in terms of credit rate. “Many companies are folding up.\n\nThose that are not folding up are cutting back on recruitment; they are cutting back on production or quantity of their products because demand for products has started to fall significantly. Inventories of companies have started to grow higher.\n\n“I don’t see the CBN being too enthusiastic, being too much tighter with its monetary policy now than what we have seen. The truth about it all is that we have not seen any significantly sustained reduction in inflation despite the tightening approach.\n\n“We have seen the CBN increase MPR consistently higher and higher but we have not seen the expected reduction in inflation rate. So, it will be a little bit more cautious in pushing up those interest rates going forward,” Shitta-Bey concluded.","summary":"ShareWall Street recorded its biggest one-day jump in four years after Donald Trump was elected U.S president.

Now, Joe Douglas.\n\nWoody Johnson is cleaning house for his woeful New York Jets in what has been a hugely disappointing season.\n\nDouglas was fired Tuesday as the Jets’ general manager, the latest shakeup for a franchise that had Super Bowl aspirations with a healthy Aaron Rodgers at quarterback but has limped to a 3-8 start and appears likely to miss the playoffs for a 14th consecutive year.\n\nThe dismissal of Douglas, who was 30-64 and had no winning seasons in his tenure, came exactly six weeks after Johnson fired Saleh as coach on Oct. 8 after the Jets were 2-3 to open the year.\n\n“Today, I informed Joe Douglas he will no longer serve as the general manager of the New York Jets,” Johnson said in a statement issued by the team. “I want to thank Joe for his commitment to the Jets over the last six years and wish him and his family the best moving forward.”\n\nJohnson also announced that Phil Savage, who has served as a senior football adviser since 2019, will be the Jets’ interim general manager for the rest of the season. Johnson said the team would immediately begin the process of finding a new GM.\n\nDouglas, who was in the final year of his contract after being hired in 2019, was not consulted by Johnson when the owner made the decision to dismiss Saleh and replace him on an interim basis with defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. New York is 1-5 under Ulbrich.\n\nJohnson said at the time he thought the Jets had “one of the most talented teams that has ever been assembled” in his 25 years as owner — and Douglas was largely responsible. But the absence of Douglas’ input in the firing of Saleh was a clear indication that the GM’s job could also be in jeopardy.\n\n“I come in here every day and just want to do whatever I can to help this team reach its goals and reach its destination,” Douglas said two weeks ago when asked if he was worried about his job status. “And whatever happens, happens.”\n\nThe Jets were 3-6 at that time and Douglas insisted the team could turn things around and make a late run.\n\n“Obviously, it starts with me,” Douglas said. “I can look back and there’s quite a few things that I could have done better. Obviously, when a situation happens like what happened four weeks ago (Saleh’s firing), you have a lot of self-reflective moments on the things that you could have done better to keep that from happening.\n\n“But we’ve got an opportunity here with these last stretch of games to change that narrative.”\n\nThe Jets have since dropped two more games, including a humiliating 31-6 loss at Arizona two weeks ago followed by New York blowing a late lead and losing 28-27 to Indianapolis last Sunday.\n\nAnd Johnson apparently thought it was time during the Jets’ bye-week break to complete what is a major overhaul rather than wait until the end of the season — when it appears likely the franchise will extend the NFL’s longest active postseason drought.\n\nJohnson’s future outside of football could also be a factor in beginning the search now. He served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom during President-elect Donald Trump’s first term, when Johnson’s brother Christopher was in charge of the team and hired Saleh. Woody Johnson could potentially fill that role again with Trump elected for the second time, and that would cause him to relinquish day-to-day operations of the team at some point next year.\n\nDouglas was widely celebrated when he swung the trade — with Johnson’s urging — to acquire Rodgers from Green Bay. But the four-time NFL MVP tore his left Achilles tendon four snaps into the 2023 season opener and the Jets never recovered, finishing 7-10.\n\nRodgers entered training camp this summer healthy and with renewed zest for playing — and revived the franchise’s Super Bowl hopes in the process. Instead, the Jets have been arguably the NFL’s most disappointing team — and now the future of Rodgers, who will turn 41 on Dec. 2 and has a year remaining on his contract, is uncertain.\n\nThe failure of Rodgers to produce anywhere close to his usual level while with the Packers will be a stain on Douglas’ resume. The GM’s inability to successfully build a consistently solid offensive line will be another, along with the team’s decision to trade quarterback Sam Darnold to Carolina and draft Zach Wilson as his replacement with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 draft.\n\nBut Douglas also made several key moves to establish a young core, including drafting cornerback Sauce Gardner, wide receiver Garrett Wilson, edge rusher Jermaine Johnson and running back Breece Hall in the first two rounds of the 2022 draft.\n\nSavage has extensive NFL experience as an executive, including front-office stints with Cleveland, where he was the GM for four years in his second stint with the Browns, as well as Baltimore and Philadelphia.\n\nHe was also the executive director for the Senior Bowl for six years, and served as general manager of the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football in 2018 before joining the Jets.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL","summary":"First, Robert Saleh.

I was like, ‘Hey I heard you’re in the trash dumping business. Can I borrow a trailer?’ And he goes, ‘Girl, I got you. You can have it as long as you want it.’”\n\nThe trio heads to the kids’ room, which has teal walls and wood doors adorned with peeling Paw Patrol stickers. There is stuff everywhere — from clothes with tags still attached to toy vehicles, stuffed animals of all kinds, books, balls, and a portable crib packed with items that don’t appear to belong there.\n\nAmy acknowledges all the clutter could indeed be part of a larger problem that runs in the family.\n\n“Our family does have hoarding issues,” she admits. “Grandma hoarded. Mom hoarded. Now, I got hoarding tendencies.”\n\nWith the support of her siblings, Amy plans to break the pattern.\n\nMORE: Jackie O – My ‘soulless’ $11m deal during addiction\n\n“I’m hoping with Tammy and Chris here, I won’t think about it as much,” she says.\n\n“I’ll just be like, ‘OK, throw it away’ — instead of ‘That was Gage’s first toy’ or ‘Gage got that for his birthday.’ You know, I’ll be like, ‘Throw it away. I haven’t seen it in six months. They haven’t played with it’-type deal.”\n\nUnfortunately, that strategy is short-lived. Just as Tammy picks up a ride-upon horse toy, Amy puts it in the “keep” pile.\n\n“Oh, that we got to keep,” she says.\n\n“That’s what you gave Gage for his first Christmas.”\n\nRight after that, Amy holds up a mop and gives the directive that “this stuff can stay.”\n\nCombs comes across a few cleaning accessories inside the boys’ room and asks, “What the hell’s going on with these mop heads?”\n\nBut before he receives an answer, he picks up a sports jersey that Amy promptly grabs from his hands and says she wants to save it.\n\nMORE: Aussies turn odd tip into 8 homes worth $6m\n\nConfused, he reminds his sister he “thought the whole point was to get rid of the clutter.”\n\nUltimately, Combs fills at least one large garbage bag with stuff to dump. He tosses it and the crib into the trailer, which already holds a few discarded boxes. Amy follows suit with a plastic bin full of items she agreed to let go of. However, it’s unclear just how much progress she made cleaning out the clutter in her home — and breaking free from her family’s history of hoarding.\n\nParts of this article originally appeared on Realtor and are republished here with permission.\n\nTLC is available on Foxtel.\n\nMORE: Tradie star’s warning: Don’t trust The Block","url":"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/real-estate/national/wow/500kg-sisters-hoarding-tendencies-exposed/news-story/04879f13ba971d4b6774439f5649f7dc","image":"https://www.realestate.com.au/news-image/w_1024,h_768/v1732039287/news-lifestyle-content-assets/wp-content/production/capi_04879f13ba971d4b6774439f5649f7dc_1b0216c63374deb29f36b37b4828b69b.jpeg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:31:31","author":"James Macsmith","authors":["James Macsmith"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.047},{"id":265893558,"title":"Student survey points to a rise in Islamophobia on California college campuses","text":"Muslim college students across California say they have faced an increase in harassment and discrimination on their campuses in the last year, according to a new report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nThe report from the Muslim advocacy organization, released Tuesday, comes amid heightened tensions at many Bay Area schools in the wake of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Protests at several campuses, including Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Cal Poly Humboldt, resulted in clashes with police in the spring and several student arrests and sparked a flurry of new university rules and policies attempting to crack down on student encampments.\n\n“This past year has been extremely traumatizing for Muslim college students standing against the genocide in Gaza,” said Musa Tariq, policy coordinator at CAIR’s San Francisco Bay Area office. “The levels of…harassment and discrimination Muslim college students have had to face on their campuses throughout the state is unprecedented.”\n\nThe report was conducted in collaboration with CAIR’s Center for the Prevention of Hate and Bullying, an anti-hate organization created by the nonprofit civil rights group in 2021.\n\nAnonymous survey responses from 720 students at 87 public and private higher education institutions during the 2023-24 school year pointed to a pattern of rising harassment, intensified Islamophobic incidents and a lack of support from university administrators.\n\nNearly half of the students who responded said they experienced harassment or discrimination on campus due to their Muslim identity and 92% said they experienced it after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nIman Deriche, a third-year student at Stanford University, recalled a phone call with her father the day after the attack where he told her to stay inside, lock her doors and be careful when walking around campus.\n\n“I didn’t understand at first, but just after one week, his suggestions became a necessary part of my daily routine,” Deriche said.\n\nDeriche said she experienced several incidents of harassment and discrimination due to her Muslim identity last fall. She said she was followed, screamed at, verbally and physically assaulted and threatened by other students.\n\n“Even after reporting these incidents to the university, I – along with many other Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students on campus – felt both invisible…and hyper-visible,” Deriche said.\n\n“The university is committed to providing a safe, supportive, and harassment-free environment for our students,” Stanford said in a statement.\n\nOnly one in four student respondents who said they experienced harassment or discrimination said they reported it to their school administration or law enforcement, but 90% of the respondents who did report the harassment felt that their school’s responses failed to meet their needs.\n\nNearly two-thirds of student respondents said they didn’t report the harassment or discrimination they experienced because they “didn’t think it would make a difference.”\n\nThe report also highlighted several universities with particularly high response rates, including Berkeley with 31 student responses – 85% of whom said they experienced harassment and discrimination on campus due to their Muslim identity.\n\n“UC Berkeley has an unwavering commitment to do all that we can so that every student regardless of their origin, identity or perspective feels safe, respected and welcome at all times,” said Dan Mogulof, the university’s assistant vice chancellor for executive communications. “We urge students who believe they’ve been subject to bias, discrimination or harassment to report that immediately to our Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination and we take those complaints seriously and promise to respond to all reports.”\n\nBut Zaid Yousef, a second-year law student at the university, said dismissive comments from university leaders, like university law school dean Erwin Chemerinsky, whose graduation dinner sparked controversy over a confrontation he had with a pro-Palestinian student, have made Muslim students on campus feel unwelcome.\n\n“Berkeley has failed time and time again to protect its Muslim students,” Yousef said. “The only support we’ve been offered is lip service in the forms of emails and meetings where no serious discussions are had and no meaningful decisions are made.”\n\nTariq, the policy coordinator, said the organization hopes the survey’s findings will hold California colleges and universities “accountable to the very students they are tasked to protect.”\n\nOther reports have also pointed to an “unprecedented” rise in antisemitism across college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAccording to data from the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit “anti-hate” organization that fights discrimination and bias, there has been a 140% increase in antisemitic incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a total of nearly 9,000 incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism across the country.\n\nThe Jewish Community Relations Council did not respond to this news organization’s request for comment but the organization’s CEO has previously pointed to the Bay Area as a “flashpoint” for antisemitism.\n\nTariq said while CAIR is hopeful tensions on college campuses will subside, the organization is bracing for an increase in Islamophobia given the country’s current political climate. Shortly after taking office the first time in 2017, incoming president Donald Trump implemented a travel ban barring people from some predominantly Muslim countries from visiting the U.S.\n\n“Though we are hopeful the climate and our college campuses can improve with time, we remain vigilant,” he said, “especially in the face of the upcoming Trump administration, whose policies may likely promote violent repression of students voices.”","summary":"Students from Stanford and UC Berkeley reported facing harassment, discrimination and safety concerns due to their Muslim identity.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/19/student-survey-points-to-a-rise-in-islamophobia-on-california-college-campuses/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SJM-L-CAIR-1119-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:30:39","author":"Molly Gibbs","authors":["Molly Gibbs"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":265893560,"title":"Letters: Historic result | Dig deeper | Fighting TB | Constitutional authority | Ahistorical reports | Defense nominee","text":"Pleasant Hill election’s\nhistoric council result\n\nPleasant Hill is set to make history following its first City Council race under district elections.

If it exists, please have a discussion about it in this paper.\n\n• If a plan does not exist, this operation should be shut down immediately before it wastes more money as it is destined to be another expensive failure.\n\n• Why were no ideas mentioned for reducing the cost of labor, materials, land, fees, administration, etc.? \n\nThis is just a start and should be obvious if we are serious about reducing our housing problems.\n\nUrge Congress to\npass bill to fight TB\n\nRe: “First known U.S. case of new type of mpox found” (Page A4, Nov. 17).\n\nOnce again Americans are traveling the world, and, like COVID, tuberculosis is easy to bring home, and is an unwanted guest. Even more alarming than mpox, which was recently reported in San Mateo, tuberculosis is the most infectious disease behind COVID, and killed 1.25 million people last year.\n\nThe rate of TB infections has increased in the United States for three years in a row, and it is very expensive to cure. However, TB can be eradicated. The way to fight TB is to eliminate it worldwide.\n\nPlease write to your representatives in Congress, and ask them to pass the End TB Now Act (HR 1776), and save future generations from this terrible disease.\n\nBill Nicholson\n\nCongress must retain\nconstitutional authority\n\nWill Congress stand up to President-elect Donald Trump’s unreasonable request to make recess appointments? That certainly is the test for the Senate at the moment. The outcome will likely help determine whether we can continue to be a government with three co-equal branches or not.\n\nIn a way, the fact that the Republicans control all three branches puts more pressure on them to demonstrate that they truly believe they have any influence on the results.\n\nIf they give up the right to investigate and ratify appointments, then there doesn’t seem to be any reason for them to be there at all, and that failure will not be easily reversed.

This war against the Palestinian people (not just Hamas) started in 1947 when Israel forcefully and through brutal military power and terrorism, removed Palestinians from their homes and thereafter illegally occupied their land and imprisoned those people in Gaza in what became known as the world’s largest outdoor prison.\n\nIsrael has brought shame on Jews like myself who were brought up learning our most common bond as Jews was standing up for the oppressed, not for being the oppressors.\n\nDavid Weintraub\n\nDEI opposition should\nrule out Trump nominee\n\nThe nominated secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, is adamantly opposed to DEI. I see it differently. In America’s armed services, there is a command used at parades,”Officers-Center March.” Officers march out to affirm their allegiance to their commanding officer.\n\nThe enlisted members of the units in the parade remain at attention. They are typical American service members, all colors, young men and women, different heritages, etc. They watch their officers as they march forward. They all deserve the right to see officers who look like them.\n\nThis ceremony dates back to clans and tribes preparing for battle and affirming their loyalty to their commander.\n\nIn civilian terms, this is a “team building” exercise, a traditional ceremony, honoring an obligation to defend their country with their lives, if needed.

They also share some similar challenges.\n\n“This Cascadia corridor is home to nearly 17 million people,” Anderson said. “Our combined GDP is $600 billion. So we are always trying to find ways to increase collaboration and to ensure that there are more opportunities, whether we’re talking about trade, or tourism and learning from one another for some of the challenges that we have, like housing, which is the main focus of this conference this year.\n\n“Conferences like this are incredibly important for the relationship building and the opportunities of more collaboration throughout the Cascadia corridor. And it couldn’t be more important, given the changes in the administration in the U.S., and anticipated changes in policy like 10 per cent tariffs across the board, etcetera.”\n\nA recent report coinciding with the conference estimates 3 million new homes are needed in the Cascadia region over the next two decades.\n\n“Whether you live in British Columbia, Washington or Oregon, you’re seeing it very clearly that we have the same kinds of challenges and then solutions we can all use to address these challenges,” Anderson said. “The focus over the last day or so has been about how we can learn from one another for the common challenges around permitting and zoning.\"\n\nAs always, a proposed high-speed train connecting Vancouver, Seattle and Portland is also on the agenda this year.\n\nThe Cascadia Ultra-High-Speed Ground Transportation Project has been estimated to cost $27 billion and $42 billion. At speeds to 250 kilometres per hour, it would shuttle people between Vancouver and Seattle in one hour.\n\n“This is a region – certainly one that we see as a mega-region – where there would be great opportunity for high-speed rail,” Anderson said. “People could live a little farther from their job, and have more access to affordable housing. It could mean more job growth, it is better for the environment. It is also fantastic for tourism. Think if we had high-speed rail when Web Summit is coming to Vancouver for the next three years, or FIFA in 2026, when we’ve got games up and down the corridor.”\n\nThe Joe Biden administration has earmarked funding for a feasibility study for the project.\n\n“It is interesting to note that the United States is investing in high-speed rail under the Biden administration,” Anderson said. “It’s unclear whether this will be a priority for the new administration.”","summary":"Thought leaders converge at Cascadia Innovation Corridor Conference in Portland","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/bc-washington-oregon-discuss-housing-high-speed-rail-trade-9834706","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/high-speed-rail-cascadia-rail.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:30:00","author":"Nelson Bennett","authors":["Nelson Bennett"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.457},{"id":265893252,"title":"Adam Silver Says Donald Trump, Dodgers, Yankees Eroded Attention on NBA: Report","text":"If the NBA was looking to score a big ratings windfall to kick off a new season, this wasn't it.Viewership for NBA games has dropped by double-digit percentages through the opening weeks of the regular season, according to Sports Media Watch. Compared to the same juncture in the 2023-24 NBA calendar, NBA ratings on ESPN are down 28 percent year over year. Ratings for the 2024 Boston Celtics-Dallas Mavericks Finals were reportedly the lowest the league has seen in three years.More news: Spurs HC Gregg Popovich Revealed to Have Suffered StrokeViewership for most live sporting events has tailed off in the cord-cutting era. Traditional ratings metrics are still instrumental as a determining factor in advertising revenues, even though they fail to capture an audience that increasingly relies on streaming platforms to watch games.Nonetheless, any significant dip in ratings has the attention of the league offices in Manhattan. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has an interesting theory as to why this year's television ratings are down.\"I think we're just looking at a couple weeks of ratings,\" Silver told Front Office Sports. \"There's always some unique things. This year we were up against the World Series, Dodgers-Yankees, two very attractive teams, they brought in a big audience. You had a presidential election which was commanding an enormous amount of attention. So I don't think it has anything whatsoever to do with the style of play on the floor.\"Ratings for the World Series on Fox were the best MLB has seen since 2017. The Los Angeles Dodgers' five-game series victory over the New York Yankees was just the tip of a month-long iceberg. Fox said its coverage of the 2024 baseball postseason averaged 7,485,000 viewers in all — a 42 percent increase compared to last year's average (5,265,000).More news: Blockbuster ESPN-TNT 'Inside the NBA' Trade Terms Leaked in New ReportAny presidential election is an inherently seminal event, guaranteed to deliver ratings for news-focused networks like CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC in early November, as well as the traditional \"Big 3\" networks — CBS, NBC, and ABC. Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris was an event that effectively unfolded over two days (Nov. 5-6) but had viewers tuned in for daily updates much earlier. The new NBA season tipped off Oct. 22.Silver told FOS he is bullish about the league's social media reach, and its potential streaming audience in the wake of a new contract with Amazon Prime set to take effect next year. But is the commissioner correct in laying blame for the NBA's poor ratings on events far beyond the league's control?Time will tell. The second and third weeks of November offered the league a fresh start in the eyes of viewers who were perhaps too consumed with everything else in the world to give a new NBA season a chance.For more NBA news, visit Newsweek Sports.","summary":"In a new interview, the NBA commissioner believes the NBA's poor early-season ratings are owed to factors very far removed from his control.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nba/adam-silver-says-donald-trump-dodgers-yankees-eroded-attention-nba-report-1988641","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2525155/nba-adam-silver.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:28:13","author":"Jon Paul Hoornstra","authors":["Jon Paul Hoornstra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.11},{"id":265896510,"title":"Southeast Asian defense chiefs meet in Laos as maritime disputes with China are flaring","text":"VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Southeast Asian defense chiefs and representatives are meeting in the Laotian capital on Wednesday for security talks at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China in the Asia-Pacific and as the transition to a new U.S. president looms.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was set to join the meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations defense ministers in Vientiane, where many will be looking for assurances ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to power in January.\n\nAustin just wrapped up meetings in Australia with officials there and Japan’s defense minister, where they pledged their ongoing support for ASEAN and their “serious concern about destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, including dangerous conduct by the People’s Republic of China against Philippines and other coastal state vessels.”\n\nIn addition to the United States, other nations attending the two-day ASEAN meetings include Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and China.\n\nAlong with the Philippines, ASEAN member states Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims with China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in entirety as its own territory.\n\nIndonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos make up the rest of the member states.\n\nAs China has been more assertively pushing its claims in recent years, ASEAN members and Beijing have been negotiating a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea for years, but progress has been slow.\n\nOfficials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues, including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has called for more urgency in the code of conduct negotiations, complained at the meeting of ASEAN leaders last month that his country “continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation” by China’s actions, which he said violated international law.\n\nChinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam in October charged that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.\n\nAt the meeting of ASEAN leaders last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was “very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes.”\n\nHe pledged that the U.S. would “continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.”\n\nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said U.S. and other military presences from outside the region were the main source of instability in the sea.\n\n“The increasing military deployment and activities in the South China Sea by the U.S. and a few other non-regional countries, stoking confrontation and creating tensions, are the greatest source of instability for peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Mao said.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the incoming Trump administration will address the South China Sea situation.\n\nAfter Austin’s meetings in Australia, the Defense Department said the U.S., Australia and Japan had agreed to expand joint drills in the region, and announced a defense consultation body among the three countries’ forces to strengthen their cooperation.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday while in the Philippines about whether the strong U.S. defense support would continue for the country under Trump, Austin said he would not speculate.\n\nIt remained unclear whether Austin plans to meet China’s Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the ASEAN meetings, but Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani is expected to meet with Dong to express his concerns over Beijing’s military activities, Japan’s NHK reported.\n\nJapan has protested that a Chinese military aircraft violated its airspace briefly in August, and in September Japan expressed “serious concerns” after a Chinese aircraft carrier and two destroyers sailed between two Japanese islands.\n\nThe meetings are also likely to touch on the ongoing tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East. They also expect to hold talks on a range of issues, including natural disasters, cybersecurity and terrorism.\n\nAnother thorny security issue in the region also includes the civil war and growing humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group’s credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021, and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels.\n\nMore than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate that less than half the country’s territory remains under the army’s control.\n\nMyanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year, the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October.\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.","summary":"VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Southeast Asian defense chiefs and representatives are meeting in the Laotian capital on Wednesday for security talks at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China in the Asia-Pacific and as the transition to a new…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/asia/southeast-asian-defense-chiefs-meet-in-laos-as-maritime-disputes-with-china-are-flaring/article_0e9cde1c-73c8-5765-a116-eba24e879b87.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/7c/c7cd62bf-eba9-50a1-9fe2-05319148bb2a/673d2d884b909.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:27:09","author":"Jintamas Saksornchai The Associated Press,Wire Content","authors":["Jintamas Saksornchai The Associated Press","Wire Content"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.063},{"id":265894408,"title":"Maura Higgins declares she is SINGLE in major slap in the face to love interest Pete Wicks - as bikini-clad reality star finally prepares to start her I'm A Celeb... journey","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Nov 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia starts mass-producing mobile nuclear bunkers capable of housing dozens and protecting against shockwaves and radiation - as Putin lowers threshold for launching nukes\n\nBritain warned to brace for another night of snow carnage: UK weather map reveals worst-hit areas with up to FOUR more inches set to fall tonight after day of chaos saw hundreds of schools close\n\nLiam Payne's funeral to take place tomorrow with all four One Direction bandmates expected to pay their respects\n\nLucy Letby 'likely murdered and assaulted more babies before killing first known newborn in 2015', senior paediatrician tells public inquiry\n\nI was in denial about my drinking until waking up one morning with that awful symptom we all dread.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DOLLY BUSBY SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER IN QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA \n Published:00:00 GMT, 20 November 2024 |Updated:00:26 GMT, 20 November 2024 \n\nIt is the love triangle that has gripped Strictly Come Dancing this year.\nAs reality star Pete Wicks showers affection on both his professional partner Jowita Przystal and his rumoured new girlfriend Maura Higgins.\nBut it appears Mr Wicks's reported 'inability to commit' to either woman has led Ms Higgins to definitively state 'I'm single' when asked whether she was dating him.\nThe rebuff comes just days after Mr Wicks, 36, and the Love Island star, 33, enjoyed a date night last week before she jetted off to Australia ahead of her entry into the I'm A Celebrity jungle on Thursday.\nShe added: 'I'm not [in a relationship with Mr Wicks]. I've been on dates with many people. I mean, I date, but I'm very much single. Everyone goes on dates.'\nLast Monday the pair were seen attending a Ludovico Einaudi performance at the London Palladium and a month before were spotted kissing outside a restaurant in East London.\n\nMaura Higgins has insisted that she's single in an exclusive chat with MailOnline ahead of her I'm A Celebrity debut on Thursday night\n\nThe rebuff comes just days after Mr Wicks, 36, and the Love Island star, 33, enjoyed a date night last week before she jetted off to Australia ahead of her entry into the I'm A Celebrity jungle on Thursday\nThis despite it being reported that the Essex lothario had been 'growing close' to his Polish dance partner, 30, and introduced her to his mum.\nThe Irish beauty had previously said of Mr Wicks: 'I adore him, he's an amazing person. Do you know what's so weird? We met very soon after me coming off Love Island and we just instantly clicked.'\nMs Higgins also revealed to the Mail that she had not spoken to Mr Wicks about her upcoming three-week stint on the ITV show and addressing rumours of him flying out to Australia, she said: 'I know nothing, he's not said that to me anyway.'\nIt was revealed by the Mail that Mr Wicks was planning to make a trip Down Under if he was booted off Strictly early to support his best friend, Sam Thompson, who is presenting the ITV spin-off show, and Ms Higgins.\nThe Irish television personality will enter the I'm A Celebrity jungle on Thursday night as a late arrival alongside the Communards musician turned priest Reverend Richard Coles, joining her friend and former X-Factor judge, Tulisa Contostavlos, 36, and Coleen Rooney, 39.\nAsked who was flying out to Australia to meet her when she leaves the show, Ms Higgins said: 'Some of my friends said they would but I don't know, it'd be a nice surprise whoever's there.'\n\nShe added: 'I'm not [in a relationship with Mr Wicks]. I've been on dates with many people. I mean, I date, but I'm very much single. Everyone goes on dates.'\n\nThe Irish beauty had previously said of Mr Wicks: 'I adore him, he's an amazing person. Do you know what's so weird? We met very soon after me coming off Love Island and we just instantly clicked'\n\nThis despite it being reported that the Essex lothario had been 'growing close' to his Polish dance partner Jowita Przystal, 30, and introduced her to his mum\n\nThe Love Island alum, 33, will make a later arrival in camp alongside Rev Richard Coles , 62\nAligning herself with her future campmate, Ms Higgins insisted she was 'Team Coleen' when it came to the sensational Wagatha Christie trial, in which Rebekah Vardy accused Wayne Rooney's wife of defamation in 2022.\nMs Higgins said: 'I'm excited to meet her [Coleen]. I would do the exact same as what she did. Put up something on my Instagram story and just have certain people view it to catch that person out. That is the way my brain would work.'\nThrowing her support behind Mrs Rooney will undoubtedly annoy Mrs Vardy, 42, who has been outspoken about her nemesis Wag's appearance in the Jungle.\nBut when it came to Wicks, who found fame on The Only Way is Essex, Ms Higgins was less willing to divulge her opinions.\nFor weeks it's been rumoured the reality star was a contestant on the ITV flagship show and Maura has done her best to throw fans off the scent in the past few days\nShe will be joining the likes of Coleen and N-Dubz's Tulisa Contostavlos for three weeks living a diet of rice and beans and camping among spiders and snakes.\nStrictly's Oti Mabuse and McFly singer Danny Jones are among the other signings this year.\nHer whirlwind trip to Las Vegas had fans convinced she wasn't joining this year's I'm A Celebrity as a late entry.\n\nHer whirlwind trip to Las Vegas had fans convinced she wasn't joining this year's I'm A Celeb as a late entry. But MailOnline can reveal Maura Higgins will arrive in Australia 'imminently'\n\nBut in an attempt to squeeze out every last ounce of luxury from her lavish lifestyle, Maura accepted a paid-for trip to Vegas with the beauty brand Space NK\nBut MailOnline can reveal Maura is simply cutting it fine with her partying in Sin City over the weekend.\nAn ITV source said: 'She will be arriving this week, the brand trip was always part of the schedule as Maura had agreed to it and it fit into her arrival dates for the Jungle.'\nIn an attempt to squeeze out every last ounce of luxury from her lavish lifestyle, Maura accepted a paid-for trip to Vegas with the beauty brand, Space NK, which she knew would be cutting it fine when it came to her arrival Down Under.\nStaying at the 500 dollars a night Palazzo at the Venetian Hotel, Maura was joined by the likes of Stacey Solomon and was flown out on Thursday first class to Las Vegas.\nTreated to morning facials and extravagant dinners of calamari at Nobu and lobster at the Bellagio, it's a far cry from what's in store for her in Australia, a diet that will consist of rice and beans.\nAfter watching Adele at her Vegas residency, when the Easy on Me singer even interrupted her song to compliment Maura on her scarlet red suit, the Love Island star went on to party the night away with friends.\nPlaying into how last minute the trip was before the Jungle, Maura teased fans that she was headed to Australia by posting a picture of an aeroplane with the caption, 'Where to?!'\n\nShe will join the likes of Coleen Rooney, Oti Mabuse, and Danny Jones in the jungle as a late entry \n\nWhen she later popped up in Las Vegas, fans who were expecting her to arrive at Brisbane Airport, were sent into a tailspin claiming she had already quit the Jungle.\nBut ITV knows she is too good a signing to let go.\nWhen she entered the Love Island villa in 2019 with her non-nonsense confrontational demeanour, ITV bosses could not believe their luck and the Irish star quickly became a fan favourite.\nAnd the network is no doubt hoping for the same approach from Maura when it comes to the I'm A Celebrity jungle which will make her the perfect late arrival to shake the camp up.\nI'm A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! continues Tuesday at 9pm on ITV1, STV and ITVX\n\nI'M A CELEBRITY 2024: MEET THE ALL STAR LINE UP\n\nOTI MABUSE \n\nOti Mabuse has already two Strictly glitterballs under her belt\n\nOCCUPATION: Professional dancer\nFAMOUS FOR: Oti is best known for being a professional dancer on the British television series Strictly Come Dancing, which she won in 2019 and 2020. \n\nDANNY JONES \n\nDanny Jones is one of the bookies' favourites to win this year's I'm A Celeb\n\nOCCUPATION: McFly singer\nFAMOUS FOR: Danny is one of the lead vocalists and the lead guitarist for pop-rock band McFly. \nHe is also a coach on The Voice UK. \n\nBARRY MCGUIGAN \n\nFormer boxer Barry McGuigan is heading into the jungle\n\nOCCUPATION: Retired professional boxer\nFAMOUS FOR: Barry was nicknamed The Clones Cyclone and held the WBA and lineal featherweight titles from 1985 to 1986. \n\nGK Barry is a TikTok star who recently joined the ITV family on Loose Women\n\nOCCUPATION: TikTok star \nFAMOUS FOR: Grace is known for her comedic commentary on culture, lifestyle, and fashion.

China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.\n\nAt the meeting of ASEAN leaders last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was \"very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes.”\n\nHe pledged that the U.S. would \"continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.”\n\nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said U.S. and other military presences from outside the region were the main source of instability in the sea.\n\n“The increasing military deployment and activities in the South China Sea by the U.S. and a few other non-regional countries, stoking confrontation and creating tensions, are the greatest source of instability for peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Mao said.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the incoming Trump administration will address the South China Sea situation. \n\nAfter Austin's meetings in Australia, the Defense Department said the U.S., Australia and Japan had agreed to expand joint drills in the region, and announced a defense consultation body among the three countries’ forces to strengthen their cooperation.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday while in the Philippines about whether the strong U.S. defense support would continue for the country under Trump, Austin said he would not speculate.\n\nIt remained unclear whether Austin plans to meet China's Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the ASEAN meetings, but Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani is expected to meet with Dong to express his concerns over Beijing's military activities, Japan's NHK reported. \n\nJapan has protested that a Chinese military aircraft violated its airspace briefly in August, and in September Japan expressed “serious concerns” after a Chinese aircraft carrier and two destroyers sailed between two Japanese islands. \n\nThe meetings are also likely to touch on the ongoing tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East. They also expect to hold talks on a range of issues, including natural disasters, cybersecurity and terrorism.\n\nAnother thorny security issue in the region also includes the civil war and growing humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group's credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021, and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. \n\nMore than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate that less than half the country’s territory remains under the army’s control.\n\nMyanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year, the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October.\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.","summary":"Southeast Asian defense chiefs and representatives are meeting in the Laotian capital for security talks at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China in the Asia-Pacific and as the transition to a new U.S. president looms","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/china-ap-japan-beijing-lloyd-austin-b2650198.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/20/00/Laos_ASEAN_44546.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-20 00:26:31","author":"Jintamas Saksornchai","authors":["Jintamas Saksornchai"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.063},{"id":265893046,"title":"Yoon focuses on expanding global solidarity against NK-Russia military ties at APEC, G20 summits","text":"President Yoon Suk Yeol wrapped up visits to Peru and Brazil on Tuesday, where he focused on expanding international solidarity against the deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.\n\nYoon met with leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Lima and joined the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Rio de Janeiro during the six-day trip, his first visit to South America since taking office in May 2022.\n\nHe used the diplomatic stages to issue a stern warning against North Korea's troop deployment to Russia in support of its war in Ukraine, considered a critical escalation in the grinding conflict that has now lasted almost three years.\n\nThe trip followed Yoon's warning that Seoul could reconsider its policy of not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, depending on the level of military activities by Pyongyang and Moscow.\n\nAt the G20 sessions on Monday, Yoon decried the closer military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang. He was joined by leaders from the United States, Japan, Australia and the European Union in condemning the latest developments.\n\nIn Lima, Yoon held a series of bilateral and multilateral meetings with leaders from the US and other partner nations to draw their support and bolster security against threats posed by North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile programs.\n\nOn Friday, Yoon met with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to reaffirm the importance of their trilateral partnership for regional security and announced the launch of a joint secretariat tasked with overseeing the countries' collaboration.\n\nThe move came as Washington's major Asian allies prepare for looming uncertainties surrounding former US Donald Trump's return to the White House in January, with his \"America First\" policy based on a transactional approach to security and trade.\n\nYoon also held a farewell summit with Biden to look back on their partnership over the past 2 1/2 years, and sat down with Ishiba for a discussion on ways to further upgrade bilateral ties, in which they agreed to continue \"shuttle diplomacy.\"\n\nAnother notable diplomatic engagement was Yoon's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has shown signs of uneasiness over the closer alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang, Beijing's two allies.\n\nDuring their first in-person meeting in two years, Yoon asked Xi to play a \"constructive\" role in reining in North Korea's provocations and its deepening military ties with Russia.\n\nXi, for his part, emphasized China does not want escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and expressed hope to improve ties between the two neighboring nations.\n\nOn the margins of the APEC summit, Yoon also held a series of bilateral talks with the leaders of Canada, Vietnam, Brunei and Peru to explore ways to forge deeper economic and security ties in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn Sunday, Yoon traveled to Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit, marking his third consecutive participation in the gathering of the world's major economies.\n\nAt the G20, South Korea joined the establishment of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty and pledged $10 million in humanitarian aid to alleviate the food crisis in Africa.\n\nIn line with South Korea's vision to play a greater role on the global stage, Yoon also reaffirmed Seoul's commitment to carbon-free energy initiatives and financial support for countries vulnerable to climate change.\n\nDuring this year's summits held after Trump's election win, Yoon engaged in a careful balancing act between the US, South Korea's traditional ally, and China, its largest trading partner.\n\nIn an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, Yoon expressed hope for working closely with both the US and China, saying South Korea's approach to relations with the greater powers is not about \"choosing one country or the other.\"\n\nThe notable shift in his tone raised questions over whether Yoon is recalibrating his US-focused diplomatic strategy to a more balanced approach under the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to take a more hawkish stance on Beijing and pressure its allies to pay more on their defense.\n\nYoon's office explained that Seoul has consistently focused on pursuing national interests in both security and economy, stressing the importance of continuing high-level communication to further improve ties with Beijing.\n\nDuring their summit, Yoon and Xi exchanged invitations to visit each other's countries to continue their discussions.
