Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.\n\n\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".\n\n\"Isn't that ironic?\"\n\nAnother Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.\n\n\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.\n\nNot every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.\n\nKory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.\n\nHe told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.\n\n\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.\n\n\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said. \n\n\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"\n\nHe added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".\n\nAsked by reporters what it would take to heal the rift, Ford answered: \"All they have to do is make a phone call.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3gdvv75o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8534/live/dbedae50-2796-11f0-a8fe-791177f62bc5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:53:15","author":"Nadine Yousif","authors":["Nadine Yousif"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":317287914,"title":"Why some Texas residents are wary of Elon Musk's potential SpaceX town","text":"SpaceX is shooting for Mars, with Elon Musk's rocket company racing to bring humanity closer to being a multi-planetary species. Back here on Earth, the leader of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is hoping his company gets a chance to start a government of its own in Texas.\n\nStarbase is where SpaceX researches, launches and tests rockets and it could soon become the newest town in America.\n\nHowever, this wouldn't be your typical town; it would be a company community now filled with mostly SpaceX employees.\n\nIt's less than two square miles in size and it butts right up to a Texas state nature preserve and Boca Chica Beach along the Gulf Shore.\n\nLast year, a petition was submitted to the state of Texas by SpaceX to create a new town; the new municipality would function as its own city with the ability to create its own fire department and emergency services, even a school district.\n\nA few hundred current registered residents, including Musk himself who is registered to vote at an address within the proposed town, are now voting on making it official -- what was once a small, sleepy beach community on the outskirts of Brownsville, Texas, could be officially known as Starbase City.\n\nBrownsville resident Rene Medrano's home sits 20 miles from the coast. Having gone to Boca Chica Beach as a kid and bringing his own family once he got older, Medrano told ABC News it's in his blood.\n\n\"It was called a poor man's beach because you didn't have to pay anything to go to the beach other than just get in your car, get in your truck, round up the neighbors, round up the cousins, round up the aunts and uncles and let's go have fun,\" he said. \"And to see now the way it is…it's just, disheartening is what it is.\"\n\nSpaceX had its first Starship launch in April 2023; successfully coming off and clearing the launch pad, then losing control of its super heavy booster engines. The company said it triggered Starship's flight termination system after the boosters failed to separate and it veered off its planned trajectory.\n\nHowever, the company was laying the groundwork for something much bigger more than a decade ago. Medrano recalled a SpaceX representative going to his wife's school to pitch a \"small test site\" in 2014, but said the person told locals the beach would remain accessible to them.\n\n\"Who would ever think they wanted to go to Mars 10 years later?\" he said. \"I mean, that was never in the formula. You know?\"\n\nSince 2014, SpaceX has had eight launches from Boca Chica with staggered success. Now, the company is asking the FAA to grant permits that would allow SpaceX to launch up to 25 times a year.\n\n\"You have a lot of visitors that go to the island to see the rocket launches. But then those people leave,\" Medrano said. \"We see the spaceship blowups. We see the environments, you know, with all the rocket launches being torn up around that area. We see Boca Chica Beach the way we knew it -- we don't know that place anymore.\"\n\nBekah Hinojosa, who leads a local environmental group, told ABC News that SpaceX has disrupted everyday life in the area.\n\n\"The rocket launches are dangerous. They cause our homes to shake. SpaceX has been caught illegally dumping polluted water onto Boca Chica Beach, into our ecosystems,\" she said. \"The rent is going up. And it's all associated with, you know, SpaceX coming into this area and colonizing the region.\"\n\nIf this area becomes its own municipality, SpaceX wants control of the nearby beach and road that leads to the spaceport. Bills proposed in the Texas legislature would give Starbase the power to close beaches and roads on weekdays.\n\nTexas State Rep. Janie Lopez, who authored a bill related to Starbase, testified during an April 14 committee hearing that it won't take Boca Chica Beach away from the public.\n\n\"All it's doing is, if the people decide on May 3 that they want to make their own municipality, then they will decide who will be their governing board and they will make the decisions on closures based on what the FAA is requiring.\"\n\nThere is real concern at the cost of SpaceX's ambitions for those who call the area home -- Medrano pointed to the state's Open Beaches Act, which guarantees free public access to its sandy shores.\n\n\"Give us the beach … I mean, what's so hard about that?\" he said. \"Go to Mars, do your thing, get your rockets and go. But let us do our thing too.\"\n\nABC News reached out to SpaceX for comment, but has not heard back.","summary":"Elon Musk’s SpaceX already has a footprint in South Texas but now wants to create an official municipality for the launch site called Starbase.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elon-musks-spacex-corner-texas-coast/story?id=121361452","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c70aee5f-f27c-42fd-a849-7cbe4474fb2c/starbase-3-abc-gmh-250502_1746199992834_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:52:18","author":"Jim Scholz,Joe Locascio,Mireya Villarreal","authors":["Jim Scholz","Joe Locascio","Mireya Villarreal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":317288354,"title":"Singapore Votes With New PM Seeking Strong Mandate Amid Tariff Turmoil","text":"Singaporeans cast their votes Saturday in an election where Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition in uncertain economic times for the trade-centred nation.Wong's ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which has steered the island to prosperity while using an iron hand to suppress dissent, is expected to easily retain a clear majority in parliament.Polls opened at 8:00 am (0000 GMT) for 12 hours of voting, with some results expected to stream in around midnight.Popular after leading Singapore's Covid task force, Wong took over last year from his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew who ruled the island state after its bitter break-up with Malaysia in 1965. Wong has repeatedly said he needed a strong mandate to navigate heavily trade-reliant Singapore through economic uncertainty in light of tariffs levied by US President Donald Trump.He has warned Singapore would be hit hard if Trump went ahead with the tariffs he announced and then paused for most countries except China, and needed to stay open and competitive to counter their effects.\"So I say to all Singaporeans, please consider carefully. This is not a gamble. This is your family, your future, our Singapore,\" he said during the campaign.Political analyst Nydia Ngiow said the PAP had long been seen as Singapore's steady hand in crises but that the recent tariff turmoil may not be a big factor for voters yet.\"Given that general elections in Singapore tend to focus on local issues, it is unlikely that geopolitics will shape voters' decisions -- unless Singaporeans feel a direct and tangible impact on their cost of living, job security or the broader economy,\" she told AFP.The overwhelming PAP majority in Singapore's unicameral legislature is such a norm in the wealthy island's political landscape that the opposition and its supporters will consider a few more seats gained as a significant victory, observers said.But the PAP's dominance is increasingly being challenged by a more vocal electorate, especially among younger voters who appear open to alternative political voices.\"Young voters will be a factor in some wards. Unlike the older voters they are prepared to listen to both sides and make an informed decision,\" said veteran former news editor and political observer P.N. Balji.In 2020, the country's largest opposition group, the Workers' Party (WP), made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake -- a significant jump from its previously held four seats.The WP -- which has become politically slicker -- is hoping to build on that momentum with a slate of charismatic candidates, including a top lawyer.The party pulled in massive crowds at its rallies during the campaign, just like in previous elections, but those big numbers have seldom translated into electoral wins in the past.WP candidates have lambasted the government for raising a goods and services tax amid rising inflation and insist the government has not done enough to curb rising costs in one of the most expensive countries in the world.They also say more opposition MPs are needed in parliament so that the PAP does not have a \"blank cheque\" and can be held accountable.The PAP, however, points to the billions of Singapore dollars it has spent in helping citizens cope with rising costs, including via cash handouts and grocery vouchers.Singapore has around 2.75 million eligible voters who will elect 97 members of parliament.","summary":"Singaporeans cast their votes Saturday in an election where Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition in uncertain economic times for the trade-centred nation.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/singapore-votes-new-pm-seeking-strong-mandate-amid-tariff-turmoil-3772335","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4598385/polls-opened-800-am-0000-gmt-12-hours-voting-some-results-expected-stream-around-midnight.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:42:17","author":"Satish Cheney","authors":["Satish Cheney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.09},{"id":317287480,"title":"Trump Addresses Economic Concerns and Disrupts International Elections: Politics Overview","text":"Welcome to the online edition of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that delivers the latest reporting and insights from the NBC News Politics team, covering the White House, Capitol Hill, and the campaign trail.\n\nIn today’s issue, we share the first remarks from Kristen Welker’s exclusive interview with President Donald Trump.

What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” \n\nFollowing up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.” \n\nThe remarks come as analysts on Wall Street are increasingly worried that the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy. \n\n“Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \n\n“There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added. \n\nAccording to initial measurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economy shrunk by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and a boost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs. \n\nOn Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying that it was a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind. \n\n“You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.” \n\nRead more →\n\nAfter Canadian election, Trump could drag down conservatives in Australia too\n\nBy Mahalia Dobson\n\nDays after a Canadian election that hinged on who would best stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump, he is at the center of an election in another liberal democracy.\n\nTrust in the United States is plummeting in Australia, which votes Saturday amid global financial turmoil sparked by tariffs Trump has imposed on trading partners around the world including Australia, a U.S. ally and vital security partner in countering China. \n\nAs in Canada, Australia’s opposition conservative party, the Liberal Party, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump. \n\nA poll released last month by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States — the lowest in the annual poll’s two-decade history.\n\nWhile 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump’s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia’s security.\n\nThose numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.\n\nRead more on Saturday’s election in Australia →\n\nThat’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

In the case of Perkins Coie, the White House cited its representation of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHowell wrote in her 102-page order, “No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.’\"\n\nThe decision was not surprising given that Howell had earlier temporarily blocked multiple provisions of the order and had expressed deep misgivings about the edict at a more recent hearing, when she grilled a Justice Department lawyer who was tasked with justifying it.\n\nSo far, all the firms that have challenged orders against them — Perkins Coie, WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Susman Godfrey — have succeeded in at least temporarily blocking the orders.

Backers of the six-decade-old program, which educates more than half a million children from low-income and homeless families, had been fretting after a leaked Trump administration proposal suggested defunding it. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation and co-authored by President Donald Trump's current budget chief, also called for cutting Head Start.

But the budget summary released Friday, which outlined programs set to receive drastic cuts or boosts, did not mention Head Start. On a call with reporters, an administration official said there would be “no changes” to it. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the budget plan on a call with reporters. Still, teachers, families and advocates remain concerned about the stability of Head Start. The Trump administration is closing several regional offices and laying off the staff who support the program, which has led to funding delays that threatened to close individual pre-schools. A document accidentally emailed to grant recipients this week called for eliminating funding for research on Head Start and other child care programs. And before Trump took office, staffing shortages and rising costs had forced some programs to cut the number of students they served, or shutter altogether.

Advocates say other cuts to education and social-safety-net programs would also hurt families served by Head Start. “While Head Start is grateful that it was not explicitly eliminated in this skinny budget proposal, we are concerned about the significant cuts that threaten access to health services, education, and support for hundreds of thousands of families,” said Yasmina Vinci, executive director for the National Head Start Association, in a statement.

She spoke against “relentless attacks and disregard and disparagement” that judges nationwide, and likely many in the audience, endure regularly, as reported by Politico.\n\n“It seems as though every time I read the news or turn on the television these days, I see the affronts,” Jackson reportedly said.\n\nThe recriminations came during an 18-minute address at the First Circuit Judicial Conference in Puerto Rico, which was not recorded, according to judicial transparency organization Fix the Court.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox. \n\nWhile May 1, is internationally recognized as May Day, a labor holiday, the U.S. has long recognized the date as Law Day.\n\nJackson referenced the latter celebration in her remarks, saying she was “taking this point of personal privilege to reaffirm the significance of judicial independence and to denounce attacks on judges based on their rules,” according to The New York Times.\n\nThe scheduled subject matter of Jackson’s speech was her life and a recent memoir, according to multiple reports. Her comments critical of the environment judges currently face were not off the cuff, but, rather, prepared and written, the Times reported.\n\n“Across the nation, judges are facing increased threats of not only physical violence, but also professional retaliation just for doing our jobs,” Jackson said. “And the attacks are not random. They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity.”\n\nThe attacks in question have come from the president on down in response to what Trump, White House staffers, and other pro-Trump voices see as judicial interference with their political goals.\n\nIn the still-early days of the second Trump administration, numerous policies have been pared down and paused altogether by various federal courts — from the district court level to the Supreme Court itself. In response: a torrent of calls for judges to be impeached.\n\nIn February, three articles of impeachment were filed against two district judges — Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer and Washington, D.C.-based Senior U.S. District Judge John Bates — following goading by Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk and others in posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn March, Trump himself took to social media to suggest D.C.-based Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg be removed from the bench. Two resolutions to sack Boasberg followed that request.\n\nThen, Chief Justice John G. Roberts issued an exceedingly rare public statement. In a terse message relayed by the Supreme Court’s public information office, the George W. Bush-appointed justice — who is widely viewed as relentlessly concerned with the court’s legitimacy and legacy — said “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nJackson’s recent comments make her the second member of the nation’s high court to speak out against the Trump administration — turning the public consternation into a bipartisan affair.\n\nThe latest-minted justice launched into her remarks by referring to “the elephant in the room,” a common metaphor used to describe a problem perceived as both obvious and uncomfortable to discuss.\n\n“The threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy, on our system of government,” Jackson said, according to Politico. “And they ultimately risk undermining our Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nThe Biden-appointed justice bemoaned what kind of society she believed might result with such sustained attacks on the judiciary.\n\n“A society in which judges are routinely made to fear for their own safety or their own livelihood due to their decisions is one that has substantially departed from the norms of behavior that govern a democratic system,” Jackson said during her keynote address, the Times reported. “Attacks on judicial independence is how countries that are not free, not fair, and not rule of law oriented, operate.”\n\nThe comments reportedly received a standing ovation.\n\nIn her remarks, she also offered a glint of hope. The justice referenced prior tough environments for judges during the Civil Rights Movement and Watergate — and how “judges have faced challenges like the ones we face today, and have prevailed,” Politico reported.\n\n“I do know that loneliness. It is very stressful to have to decide difficult cases in the spotlight and under pressure,” Jackson said. “It can sometimes take raw courage to remain steadfast in doing what the law requires.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft: MIAMI, FL-MARCH 10: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson takes&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Justice Jackson Criticizes Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Attacks&#8217; on Judiciary first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/justice-jackson-criticizes-trumps-attacks-on-judiciary/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Justice-Jackson-scorns-Trump-over-attacks-on-judges.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:32:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":317286920,"title":"World News | NYPD Shared Palestinian Protester's Info with ICE, Now It's Evidence in Her Deportation Case","text":"New York, May 3 (AP) New York City's police department provided federal immigration authorities with an internal record about a Palestinian woman who they arrested at a protest, which the Trump administration is now using as evidence in its bid to deport her, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press. The report — shared by the NYPD in March — includes a summary of information in the department's files about Leqaa Kordia, a New Jersey resident who was arrested at a protest outside Columbia University last spring. It lists her home address, date of birth and an officer's two-sentence account of the arrest.

Its distribution to federal authorities offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes cooperation between the NYPD and the Trump administration, and raises questions about the city's compliance with sanctuary laws that prohibit police from assisting with immigration enforcement efforts. Kordia, 32, was among the earliest people jailed in President Donald Trump's crackdown on non-citizens who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

She was detained during a voluntary check-in with immigration officials in Newark, New Jersey, on March 13, then flown to an immigration jail in Texas. Her arrest was announced by the US Department of Homeland Security the next day in a statement that cited an expired visa and her role in “pro-Hamas protests.” It remains unclear how immigration authorities were able to learn about Kordia's presence at the protest near Columbia last April. At the demonstration, police cited Kordia with disorderly conduct. But the charge was dismissed weeks later and the case sealed. City law generally prohibits police from sharing information about arrests with federal immigration officials, although there are exceptions for criminal investigations. On March 14, an NYPD officer generated a four-page report on Kordia and shared it with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson said the department “received a request from a federal agency related to a criminal investigation and shared relevant information in accordance with our sanctuary city policies.” “The NYPD does not participate in programs that are designed for visa revocation or any civil immigration matter,” the statement added. The department declined to say what the investigation entailed. Inquiries to the DHS and ICE were not returned. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates said the document reflected a worrisome level of information-sharing between the city and the federal government, which has conflated criticism of Israel with support for Hamas, a US-designated terror group. “The intention of the sanctuary laws is to protect against this kind of collusion and pretextual information sharing,” said Meghna Philip, the director of special litigation at the Legal Aid Society. “It seems to be a clear violation of the law,” Philip added, “and raises questions about what guardrails, if any, the NYPD has around sharing information with a federal government that is seeking to criminalize speech.” A low-profile protester Kordia grew up in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and moved to New Jersey in 2016 with her mother, an American citizen. She studied English at a local exchange program, but let her student visa expire because she believed her application for permanent residency was sufficient to remain in the country legally, according to her attorneys. Kordia's case stood out among those ensnared by Trump's crackdown. She was not an outspoken activist and had not publicly criticised Israel, either in social media posts or newspaper op-eds. She maintained no social media presence and did not appear on any of the public lists maintained by pro-Israel groups that seek to identify people who participate in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Her name was not mentioned in news reports about the demonstrations. While the Trump administration identified her as a Columbia student, she has never been affiliated with the university and was not enrolled in any college when she joined a protest in 2024 outside Columbia. Her attorneys said she was peacefully voicing her dissent against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which they said has killed over 100 of her relatives. A spokesperson for the NYPD declined to say when they were first approached by federal authorities or whether the March 14 report was the first time they had shared information about Kordia's arrest record. Surveillance and interrogations Beginning in early March, attorneys for Kordia say federal agents began interrogating members of her family and her neighbours. They also subpoenaed records from her MoneyGram account and “established a trace on her WhatsApp messaging account,” her attorneys said in a court filing. “The investigation revealed nothing except that Ms. Kordia sent a single payment to a Palestinian family member in 2022, which itself is protected First Amendment\" rights, the filing states. At an April 3rd hearing, the federal government pointed to Kordia's prior arrest for protesting as a reason she should not be released. An immigration judge found no evidence she had acted violently at the protest and agreed to grant Kordia a USD 20,000 bond, which her family paid. The government has appealed that decision, keeping her detained for now. In a petition seeking her release, attorneys for Kordia, a devout Muslim, said she had been denied halal meals since arriving at the jail. As a result, she has lost 49 pounds (22 kilograms) and fainted in the shower, according to facility records shared with her attorneys. “The government's entire argument that Ms. Kordia is a danger to the United States rests on a single summons for her participation in a demonstration,” Arthur Ago, her attorney, said. “The only reason she's confined right now is because of her political viewpoint.” Mayoral cooperation New York City Mayor Eric Adams has criticized the city's sanctuary protections, while insisting his administration is “meticulously” following the law. When asked by the AP last month if the NYPD could turn over information to its federal law enforcement partners about a summons issued to a protester, the mayor insisted no such request was ever made. “We have no record that this happened,” Adams said. “When I inquired, they said we did not turn over anything and we don't collaborate for civil enforcement. They said that over and over again.” His office did not respond to inquiries Friday.

You can only defy the British people for so long before paying a terrible price - now Farage is on top","text":"The humiliation of the Labour and Conservative parties in Thursday’s elections has been on the cards for years. You can defy the wishes of the British people for only so long before being forced to pay a terrible price.\n\nWe are slow to anger. But when anger kicks in, we quickly reach boiling point. As the two parties which have dominated British politics for so long have now found out to their cost.\n\nThey can’t say they weren’t warned. Their days as the country’s two most powerful political forces could be numbered, even if their leading apologists (now peppering the airwaves with their pathetic excuses for defeat) don’t yet seem to realise it. They’ve not listened so far. Maybe they’ll listen now.\n\nBut maybe it’s too late.\n\nThe British people have made it clear for years they’ve had their fill of mass migration. Other than weasel words of understanding, trying to fool us that they cared, Labour and the Conservatives did nothing about it.\n\nEven after the country voted for Brexit – a clear demonstration of a rising frustration at the scale of the problem – our two biggest parties sat on their hands. Worse than that: net migration reached record levels post-Brexit.\n\nThe British people have made it equally clear they’ve had enough of the political elite’s virtue-signalling obsession with the drive to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions. A middle-class, metropolitan mission financed by the fuel bills of working-class households, which are now among the highest on the planet.\n\nA policy hitherto sustained by a Labour-Tory bipartisan consensus, in which the views of the mere mortals stumping up the cash to pay for it were airily dismissed. In some ways it is a new Brexit, primed to explode.\n\nThere is so much anger with our two biggest parties on so many other fronts, too.\n\nEntrenched anger with the Conservatives for 14 wasted years, which left behind no Tory legacy of note but managed to boost the Left-wing drift it inherited from Labour. Simmering anger with a Labour Party which promised to mend ‘Broken Britain’ only to make things worse. Growing frustration that the higher the tax take, the worse our public services become, turning us into a ‘pay more for less’ nation.\n\nFury at a political class which facilitates hundreds of thousands of fresh arrivals to our country each year yet cannot even build enough homes for those already here.\n\nIncreased fear as so many of our public spaces become marred by unchecked yobbery and unpunished criminality because the Plod is too busy policing our social media accounts like some deranged Twitter Sweeney.\n\nAll culminating in a general despair that nothing works in our country any more, leaving those playing by the rules –doing the right thing, raising their families as best they can, paying their taxes, striving to get on – with an all-pervading sense of unfairness.\n\nIn last July’s General Election voters rightly vented this anger and frustration on the Tories, who went down in flames. But what a difference almost a year makes. On Thursday they took it out not just on the Conservatives but on Labour, too, a party which has managed, in record time, the well-nigh impossible feat of becoming almost as unpopular as the Tories.\n\nA pox on both your houses, said the people, and in Nigel Farage’s Reform Party they have the perfect depository for their disillusionment.\n\nWhen the popularity of a government descends so precipitately, in the normal scheme of things it is the official opposition which tends to benefit.\n\nBut almost everything people are coming to despise about Labour – unaffordable fuel bills, stagnant living standards, uncontrolled immigration, rising taxes, failing public services, economic incompetence – were also dismal features of the recent Conservative government.\n\nSo, understandably, folks are in no mood to switch back to them, which is why the Tories could be condemned to the political wilderness for far longer than they realise. Voters have long memories, especially in matters which hit their wallets.\n\nWhich is where Reform comes in. It is able to hoover up votes from disillusioned Labour and Tory voters alike because it has a clean skin: it can’t be blamed for what makes people angry for the simple reason it’s never been in power. And when you’re angry, you don’t vote for something so much as against what makes you angry. Hence Labour and the Tories on the ropes, Reform on the rise.\n\nBut Reform is more than a protest vote, which is why it is especially dangerous to the mainstream parties. On all the issues which particularly offend voters, Reform already speaks for them.\n\nLess Net Zero nonsense, fewer migrants, a return to more robust policing, no to metropolitan woke, yes to provincial common sense –Reform is already deploying the language of the disillusioned, which is why it poses such a formidable challenge to the established order.\n\nJust how formidable has yet to be grasped by the political elite now under threat.\n\nBut it is significant that, as Labour and Conservative partisans made their zombie-like progress through the broadcast studios yesterday, mouthing meaningless mantras as they went, they all said they had to do better on the issues Reform has been talking about (but not listened to) for ages.\n\nIn other words, Farage and his party are already setting the political agenda – yet another indication that the two-party system which has dominated politics in England (it died long ago in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) is facing its biggest challenge since Labour started replacing the Liberals as the main alternative to the Tories a century ago.\n\nMore serious, even, than when a Social Democratic alliance of moderate Labour rebels and centrists came close to replacing a Labour Party in the grip of the Left and militant unions in the 1980s.\n\nTrue, more Tory than Labour blood was shed on Thursday. But that was because more Tory seats were up for grabs, giving Reform (but not Labour) rich pickings.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats picked over the Tory carcass, too, as the party was devoured in a Reform-Lib Dem pincer movement.\n\nBut Labour suffered the bloodiest nose of the night by losing one of its safest seats, Runcorn and Helsby, to Reform in a by-election. Durham County Council, ruling an area often regarded as the spiritual home of Labour, also fell to Reform; and even where Labour held on to its strongholds, such as North Tyneside and Doncaster, it was by the narrowest of majorities and with a slump in its share of the vote.\n\nFor the Tories it was a drubbing every bit as severe as the one it suffered in last year’s General Election, showing it has managed zero rehabilitation in the eyes of voters since then, with no prospect of an upturn in the foreseeable future.\n\nBut the precipitous fall in Labour support, so soon after a landslide victory, is equally significant and underlines how Reform is just as big a threat to Labour as the Tories – perhaps more so.\n\nLabour Party managers certainly think so. Talk to them and they affect disdain for the Conservatives. Reform is what they want to speak about. But they have no clear idea how to handle it, bar crossing their fingers that Reform and the Tories don’t merge (that, and lying about Reform wanting to dismantle the NHS).\n\nA disunited Right, they think, is Labour’s best chance of re-election. But that is not something they can control. Growing calls for a merger are boosting that agenda in Tory circles. This week I spoke to several mainstream Conservatives, not at all Reform-leaning Tories, who are reluctantly coming round to the prospect.\n\nBut they can’t control that process either and, as Reform becomes increasingly emboldened, it is beginning to think it doesn’t need a merger – that it’s on track to replace the Tories as the main force on the Right anyway. Thursday showed that Reform’s buoyant poll ratings translate into real votes. If anything, it performs better at the ballot box than in the polls.\n\nReform has recently been polling in the mid-20s, either slightly in the lead or nip and tuck with Labour. The Tories now regularly languish in third place.\n\nIt is perfectly possible that, with Thursday’s momentum, Reform’s share of the vote will start to nudge up towards 30 per cent. At which point a ton of seats would start to fall its way. The mirror image of Reform heading for 30 per cent would be the Tories relegated to a vote share in the late teens – teetering on the brink of irrelevance.\n\nWhat need then would Reform have of mergers? A hostile take-over of a Tory Party facing extinction would be far more likely. That would appeal to Farage much more than a merger. Unity on the Right by conquest: Farage’s dream, Labour’s nightmare.\n\nThe significance of that 30 per cent benchmark for Reform cannot be overstated. It will be the key metric in polling in the months ahead.\n\nIn a General Election, 30 per cent wouldn’t give Reform a House of Commons majority. It wouldn’t give Farage the keys to 10 Downing Street. But it would make Reform the largest party and Farage the kingmaker.\n\nNobody else could form a government without his approval. That’s if anybody could form a government at all. Our first-past-the-post voting system produces clear results when only two parties are vying for power. But, catching up with the rest of the UK, England is now a five-party system.\n\nA General Election with Reform winning, say, 30 per cent of the vote, Labour 25 per cent, the Conservatives 20 per cent, the Lib Dems 15 per cent, with the Greens and others on 10 per cent, could produce a distribution of seats so haphazard as to make the country ungovernable.\n\nBut let me come back to that crucial 30 per cent benchmark.\n\nIf that becomes a familiar feature of polls in the months ahead, then Reform’s absorption of the Conservatives (with some Home Counties Tories escaping to the Lib Dems), by force or agreement, would result in a broadly united Right rising well above a 30 per cent vote share.\n\nReform could then be on track to become the largest party in the Commons. Even an overall majority could not be ruled out.\n\nSuch musings would have seemed fantastical only a few months ago. But if the two-party system is about to split asunder under the weight of its own inadequacies then all manner of hitherto outlandish prospects become possible.\n\nReform, of course, is still a long way from power or even being a powerbroker; and even further, in its current state, from being fit for power. But it goes with the grain of enough of the British people to make it the insurgent, defining political force of our time. Now it urgently needs to upgrade the quality of its top activists and the coherence and credibility of its policies.\n\nAs for the dinosaurs, it’s hard to see things getting better for them. Labour has got off to such a lacklustre start it might never recover. The economy is still reeling from Rachel Reeves’s disastrous first Budget and about to be hit by recessionary winds blowing across the Atlantic thanks to Donald Trump’s tariff tsunami.\n\nStagflation – too little growth, too much inflation – looks like being our lot for this year into next. All Labour eyes are currently on Reform. But if the economy tanks, Keir Starmer could also face a threat from the Left, currently a wide-open gap in the political marketplace.\n\nNor is it easy to divine any better news for the Conservatives. Thursday confirmed they remain widely despised. Kemi Badenoch is fighting the good fight but, so far, the country simply doesn’t want to listen to her.\n\nAfter this latest electoral debacle, rumblings about her leadership will emerge. Inevitable, perhaps, but yet another change of leader would only confirm the Tories are past their sell-by date.\n\nAs for Reform, much of the media will continue to dismiss it as a one-man band unfit for government. Farage has always been underestimated by much of the mainstream media and is still regularly treated with contempt by establishment broadcasters. And it’s true. Reform, as currently constituted, is a one-man band.\n\nBut, as Farage knows better than most, Donald Trump was also once a one-man band. And now the Republican Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of his MAGA movement. British politics is currently so febrile only a fool would rule out something equally dramatic happening here.","summary":"The humiliation of the Labour and Conservative parties in Thursday's elections has been on the cards.

Deploying what he sees as the power of the federal purse, he has launched a multi-front battle against the business.\n\nThe targets are the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and, by extension, PBS television network, NPR and 1,500 broadcast outlets across the country, including Chicago’s WBEZ and WTTW. Chicago Public Media owns WBEZ and the Sun-Times.\n\nOpposing views on the issue could not be more clear. Trump’s White House, in announcing his executive order to end federal subsidies for public broadcasting, accused the stations of passing “radical, woke propaganda” as news, a practice it called “madness.” His order said a fragmented media landscape makes the subsidies obsolete.\n\nPaula Kerger, head of PBS, called Trump’s action “blatantly unlawful” and said she’s ready for a fight. She’s previously told Congress, “There’s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress.”\n\nBut from one member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., came this rejoinder, “We believe that you all can hate us on your own dime.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Dick Durbin described Trump’s executive order as “dangerous.”\n\n“As a democracy, we pride ourselves on having a strong freedom of the press. With President Trump’s executive order, we will only backslide. This is dangerous and I implore my Republican colleagues to act to reverse the President’s course — our democracy depends on it,” Durbin said in a statement.\n\nIt’s a controversy still raging from the West Wing to the Capitol. Here’s what it could mean for Illinois.\n\nWhat does Trump’s order say?\n\nIt instructs CPB to cease existing and future funding for NPR and PBS because of partiality. “Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,” the order says. “What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”\n\nAn accompanying statement from the White House cites a litany of broadcasts it deems objectionable, including some it said promoted sexual deviance and anti-American attitudes. It said one NPR story spoke positively about cannibalism.\n\nIs the order legal?\n\nAs with many things in the Trump administration, this question appears headed for the courts. \n\n“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,” said its CEO, Patricia Harrison. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.” She noted that the law bars any federal agency or officer from controlling “educational television or radio broadcasts.”\n\nThe Trump administration counters that the CPB must be nonpolitical and that no form of media has a constitutional right to public money.\n\nSeparately, CPB has sued Trump for firing three of its five board members, appointees of former President Joe Biden and serving six-year terms. The suit says they cannot be arbitrarily removed. \n\nWho has the big money at stake?\n\nCPB may be independent but it passes around about $525 million a year in federal funds. Shutting off the spigot would have an unequal effect on organizations down the line. \n\nFor example, PBS needs the money for about 15% of operations. NPR gets about 1% from the government, but some member stations get their own allocations.\n\nIn most cases, stations CPB supports get the biggest share of funds from audience contributions, philanthropy and corporate underwriting.\n\nWhat about the local stations? \n\nAt WBEZ, a federal allocation of about $1.5 million annually accounts for less than 5% of the revenue. \n\nMelissa Bell, CEO of Chicago Public Media, said the organization is still examining changes it may need to make if funding ends.\n\n“I do believe it’s incredibly important for public broadcasting to have some level of governmental support” for programming tied to both news and education, Bell said. She said unlike WBEZ, many public radio stations serve rural locales and may be the only viable source of coverage in “news deserts.”\n\nAccording to data collected by Heather Norman, president of the Illinois Public Broadcasting Council, TV station WTTW gets an annual federal outlay of about $3.7 million, or 11% of its budget. \n\n“WTTW will continue to monitor, plan and focus on the important work we do in service of the public and our local community,” said a station spokesperson, who called Trump’s order sweeping and a threat to PBS’ mission.\n\nNorman said many downstate outlets rely more heavily on federal money. Among them, based on her data, are WQPT TV in Moline and WEIU TV in Charleston, with federal shares of 50% or more.\n\nThese stations also divvy up about $1.6 million from the state, an amount the council would like to see raised. But it’s a tough request for what analysts say is a cash-strapped budget year with other interest groups that have hands out.\n\nDoes this affect the Sun-Times?\n\nThe Sun-Times is a separate nonprofit under Chicago Public Media and receives no federal money. But difficult finances at the parent organization could have a spillover effect. To help deal with a fiscal cliff, the Sun-Times in March lost 20% of its staff to buyouts.\n\nHow will Congress handle this?\n\nIt’s a good question that speaks to something else Trump could try. He could take his executive order a step further and ask for a rescission, a request to cancel appropriations already approved. \n\n“The Congress has 45 days to consider — or ignore — the president’s request,” said the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “If the Congress votes to approve the request or any portion thereof, the spending is canceled. If not, the president must spend the money.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, during a public event Wednesday, was asked about public broadcasting and did not directly sign on to a funding cutoff. But he said the debate will be healthy. \n\n“And I mean, that’s what the free market is about, and we have to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, recognizing, again, the thing that governs most of the decisions we make is the concern about the financial structure of our house, so to speak, of our country and we we’ve got to spend wisely,” Johnson said.\n\nWhat will these stations do to fight Trump?\n\nBy law, these are nonprofits that are banned from lobbying. However, they can make their case in congressional testimony. They also are using the controversy in fundraising appeals. Supporters of their cause have formed a group, Protect My Public Media, to get people to contact lawmakers.\n\n“They need to tell their stories. They need to be loud about it and in people’s faces,” said Liz Brown-Reeves, who has made the case for public media support in the Illinois General Assembly.\n\nWhat about the bias complaints? \n\nThe answer is somewhere in the eyes of the audience. Conservatives traditionally complain about public media’s alternative viewpoints.

Milliken, University of Texas chancellor, named University of California president","text":"By Jaweed Kaleem, Los Angeles Times\n\nJames B. Milliken, the chancellor of the University of Texas who has led among the nation’s largest higher education systems and navigated GOP politics, has been named the next president of the University of California.\n\nHis appointment, announced Friday afternoon by the UC Board of Regents, comes at a tense time for the state’s vaunted system and elite universities nationwide, which are under attack by President Donald Trump’s actions to purge higher education of what he derides as “woke” and “Marxist” ideologies, while also slashing federal support for medical and scientific research critical to the universities’ mission.\n\nMilliken’s selection culminates a six-month-long search to replace UC President Michael V. Drake, who has been in his role since 2020 and will step down July 31.\n\nUC is “universally regarded as the preeminent public research university in the world, and I am deeply honored to have an opportunity to join the many talented faculty, staff, and campus leaders in their vital work,” Milliken, who goes by “J.B.,” said in a statement. “It is more important than ever that we expand the education, research, health care, and public service for which UC is so widely admired and which has benefited so many Californians.”\n\nMilliken, 68, has led large public university systems for more than 25 years, pivoting to the top roles in deep red and blue states alike. He leaves the 256,000-student University of Texas system of 14 campuses, including seven medical schools — and a Republican state where political leaders are close to Trump.\n\n“Chancellor Milliken embodies the qualities and leadership experiences the University of California community needs at this moment,” Janet Reilly, regents chair, said in a statement. “He understands how critical UC’s contributions are to the state and the country, and he has decades of experience leading public institutions during times of unprecedented change in higher education. Chancellor Milliken is simply the right person for UC at just the right time.”\n\nIn a statement, Drake said Milliken “has the depth of wisdom and experience to handle the challenges and opportunities” of the presidency and will be committed to “the university’s enduring values.”\n\nThroughout his career, Milliken has consistently described his belief in opening access to higher education to low-income and first-generation students, spoken of the importance of immigrant students and diversity in enrollment, and promoted student success in job placement. In interviews while in Texas, Milliken has often talked about how “talent is universally distributed and opportunity is not,” with access to college being an “engine of mobility” for poorer students and immigrant families.\n\nBefore taking the Texas position in 2018, he spent four years as chancellor of the 25-campus City University of New York. A Nebraska native, he served for nearly 10 years as president of the four-campus University of Nebraska system, and six as a vice president of the 16-campus University of North Carolina. He began his academic career in Nebraska, where he worked in external affairs for the university, as secretary to the Board of Regents, and taught law and public affairs. Before entering academia, he was a Wall Street lawyer.\n\nIn August, Milliken will take the UC helm, the nation’s most prominent public university system — a $53-billion enterprise of 299,000 students, 26,000 faculty and 192,000 staff members across 10 campuses, six academic health systems and three affiliated national laboratories.\n\nHe will immediately confront a barrage of investigations and funding threats from the Trump administration that could radically reshape UC’s research, admission practices, free speech policies and diversity initiatives— while Sacramento is also proposing major budget reductions.\n\nMilliken, who will relocate from the Dallas region to the Bay Area this summer, will receive a salary of $1,475,000, compared to Drake’s $1.308 million.\n\nUC campuses have taken an outsize role amid Trump’s higher education targets. The UC system is under federal investigations into alleged antisemitism against employees, stemming from accusations against widespread pro-Palestinian protests and encampments last spring, including a violent melee at a the University of California, Los Angeles encampment. UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley face additional antisemitism probes, and UC Berkeley is under investigation for its use of foreign donations.\n\nThe system’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs face scrutiny as the president broadly declares such efforts to be illegal race-based discrimination. Federal lawyers are probing the selective UC admissions process, claiming it illegally considers race in admission.\n\nCalifornia is also among the Democratic-led states that have sued the administration — with the support of UC and California State University — over cuts to higher education funding, including a slashing of billions in National Institutes of Health grants.\n\nThe UC system, which has lost $300 million in federal awards since January, has instituted a hiring freeze in expectation of further cuts that could dramatically shrink campus ambitions. About $1 billion, or roughly 10%, of the budget at UCLA comes from Washington, a figure that leaders say cannot be made up by endowments or other funds if lost.\n\nFaculty, students and staff have also criticized the university system for not more forcefully defending itself against Trump’s attacks.\n\nMilliken will face financial challenges that pre-date Trump. UC has met growing demands in recent years to open more seats for Californians and plans to add thousands more annually. But it probably faces hundreds of millions of dollars in state funding cuts that leaders say could prompt enrollment reductions. That, along with higher faculty and staff costs, larger retirement plan contributions and more expensive health care, led to projections last year of a UC budget hole of roughly half a billion dollars.\n\nIn Texas, Milliken is not known for significantly challenging Trump and the state’s GOP initiatives to reshape campuses. In recent interviews, including one published by Gallup last summer during the presidential campaign, he has delicately handled questions about Trump, opting instead to tout his belief in the unifying role of education.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Texas system — which has a budget of roughly $18 billion — has achieved record enrollment, increased transfers from community colleges, and set up a $300-million endowment to cover full tuition for in-state students from families making under $100,000.\n\nThe system has also launched a $16.5-million mental health initiative to address student needs and created a partnership to provide free professional certificates to students from Microsoft, Google and other major companies. Milliken also championed the launch of UT’s Education and Research Center at Laredo, an academic health research hub in south Texas.\n\nIn 2024, the year after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs at state colleges, Milliken testified at the state house that UT closed 21 DEI offices, removed 311 DEI-related jobs and canceled more than 600 contracts connected to diversity issues. The moves allowed for $25 million that was shifted to other programs, he said.\n\n“You may not like the law, but it is the law,” Milliken said at the time.\n\nDuring the same May 2024 hearing, the UT chancellor also answered a question from a state senator who asked whether pro-Palestinian protests were “anti-Jewish in their very nature.”\n\nMilliken replied that there were “elements” of protests that were “fairly anti-Jewish and antisemitic” but said protests were not all antisemitic.\n\nThe system’s flagship Austin campus is battling accusations that it illegally considers the race of applicants in admissions. The university is being sued by Students for Fair Admissions, the same group that won its affirmative action case against Harvard at the Supreme Court in 2023. A federal appeals court held a hearing on the UT case Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, UC Regent Carmen Chu, who chaired the selection committee, nodded toward Milliken’s experiences amid challenging political terrains.\n\n“As the University evolves, it is critical we engage leaders adept at navigating change and positioning the institution for long-term success,” she said.\n\nUC Faculty Academic Senate chair Steven W. Cheung added in a statement that Milliken’s “talent for building consensus serve him well as we enter a time of great change in higher education.”\n\nMilliken is a lawyer by training who rose through university ranks not via academic credentials but by developing a reputation for skilled government relations and management, working at times with competing constituencies — students, parents, faculty, taxpayers and politicians.\n\nSpeaking to Texas Monthly shortly after beginning his University of Texas role in 2018, Milliken also addressed his take on his new home when an interviewer asked, “What does the UT System need to do to catch up with UC?” The journalist cited UC campuses regularly appearing in top national rankings.\n\n“I don’t look at the world through the UC prism. In my view it isn’t about catching up with UC — there are many things going on in Texas that I much prefer to California,” Milliken said.\n\n“You measure success by looking at what you want to achieve. Which elements of those highly rated California institutions are meaningful to Texas? Do we want to increase our research productivity? Do we want to enhance our programs to attract the best scholars and give the best education. Yes, we certainly do. Do we want to measure ourselves by the percentage of students that we reject? I have a bit of a problem with that,” he said.\n\nIn the same interview, the incoming chancellor addressed another subject familiar to California: looming budget cuts. “I do firmly believe that we need to offer public higher education in Texas that will allow students to succeed and allow the state to thrive,” Milliken said. He described college as “one of the best investments that states can make. It’s an investment in the future of their people.”\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Milliken was at CUNY, where the diverse population includes a significant number of immigrants with and without legal documentation.\n\nShortly before the president’s first inauguration, Milliken released a statement urging Trump to “retain the humane and beneficial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” program and said the university would “take any steps available under the law to protect and support its undocumented students.”\n\nThe theme of educating immigrants also rose during Milliken’s tenure in Nebraska. Writing to state legislators in 2011, Milliken defended a state law that was under attack for giving undocumented students in-state tuition.\n\nHe also spoke out against a 2008 Nebraska ballot initiative that won approval and banned affirmative action in public education and employment.\n\n“If we are to prepare our students to be successful in a global economy, we should offer an educational environment that reflects the diversity of the world,” Milliken said at the time.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

While it is assured of victory, its support is being chipped away by dissatisfaction over a high cost of living. Widening income disparity and increasingly unaffordable housing have also loosened the PAP’s grip on power.\nSingapore was named as the world’s most expensive city to live for the second year in a row by international bank Julius Baer in a 2024 report on global wealth.\nAccording to an April poll by Blackbox Research of 1,506 people, the government’s ratings on 26 issues were at the lowest level, but still net positive, for its handling of cost of living (52 per cent), goods and services tax (55 per cent), inequality (57 per cent), car prices (58 per cent) and housing affordability (59 per cent).\nIn the 2020 election, the PAP’s share of popular support slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent, down from nearly 70 per cent in 2015. The PAP kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, but it ceded more seats to the opposition, which won 10 seats, the most ever.\n\nThe opposition has acknowledged it cannot unseat the PAP but is appealing to voters for a stronger voice in parliament.\nWong, who is also the finance minister, warned this would only weaken the government as it navigates economic turbulence amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The government has lowered its growth forecast, and warned of a possible recession.\n“If the PAP has a weakened mandate, you can be sure there will be people tempted to push us around. It will be harder for us to advance Singapore’s interest. But with a clear mandate from you, my team and I can speak up for Singapore confidently,” Wong said while campaigning this week.\nThe PAP has fielded many new faces to refresh the party. Wong offered cash handouts, vouchers and other goodies in this year’s national budget, and sought to engage younger voters in developing a more balanced and inclusive Singapore. A strong PAP performance would help seal Wong’s leadership and determine whether the one-party dominance in Singapore could endure over the next decade.\n\nThe Workers’ Party (WP), led by Pritam Singh, is the biggest opposition party and it has fielded only 26 candidates in this election.\nSingh has said even if the WP won all 26 seats, it would not hamper the PAP but lead to a more balanced political system and greater accountability. The remaining seats are contested by nine smaller opposition parties and coalitions, as well as two independent candidates.\n“The opposition makes its contribution by checking the government of the day, the same thing Lee Kuan Yew did when he was in opposition,” Singh told a campaign rally on Thursday, referring to Singapore’s founding father.\nReporting by Associated Press, Reuters","summary":"The race will be closely watched as a gauge of public confidence in Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s leadership.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3308920/singaporeans-vote-election-overshadowed-cost-living-pressures","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/03/ffc1262d-5672-4f67-ab93-54d3f780a868_a0f685e4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:05:48","author":"Agencies","authors":["Agencies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":317281674,"title":"Settlement close in wrongful death suit of Ocean Beach woman shot in U.S. Capitol breach","text":"A settlement is in the works in the wrongful death lawsuit brought on behalf Ashli Babbitt, a San Diego woman who was shot and killed when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol building more than four years ago, one of the plaintiffs said Friday.\n\n“The settlement has been reached in principle, and we hope to have it finalized within the next few weeks,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, which sued the federal government last year on behalf of Babbitt’s husband and her estate.\n\n“Any settlement would be a key development in terms of justice for Ashli Babbitt,” Fitton said Friday. He declined to comment on details of the proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Post following a hearing Friday in a Washington, D.C., federal courtroom. The complaint, filed in January 2024, sought $30 million.\n\nBabbitt, 35 and a resident of Ocean Beach, was fatally shot by a Capitol police officer as she climbed through a broken window into the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021, the day that Trump supporters who believed that the 2020 presidential election had been “stolen” stormed the Capitol.\n\nShortly after taking office for his second term in January, Trump granted clemency to supporters who were prosecuted for storming the government building. At least eight people from San Diego or with strong ties to the area benefited from the pardons.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice did not respond Friday to a request for comment regarding whether a settlement deal is in the works in the Babbitt case.\n\nIn court documents filed in February, attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a joint statement noting that both sides “have agreed to work in good faith to narrow or resolve issues in this case.”\n\nIn a news release a few days later, on March 3, Judicial Watch said the “wording is the first to suggest settlement negotiations are underway” in the suit.\n\nBabbitt was an Iraq war veteran who spent four years on active duty in the Air Force and another 10 in reserves. She made the cross-country trek to attend a rally at which Trump spoke the morning of the insurrection, then joined fellow Trump supporters as they walked to the Capitol Building.\n\n“Ashli did not go to Washington as part of a group or for any unlawful or nefarious purpose. She was there to exercise what she believed were her God-given, American liberties and freedoms,” the complaint reads.\n\nA status hearing in the Babbitt case is slated for Tuesday.

His administration is expected to appeal.\n\nAs part of Judge Howell’s order, the Trump administration must cease any investigations of Perkins Coie, restore any rescinded services and allow the law firm to resume its “ordinary course of business” with the government.\n\nIn her full 102-page ruling, Judge Howell spelled out her rationale, declaring Trump’s executive order represented “an unprecedented attack” on the country’s “foundational principles”.\n\n“No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit,” she said in her opening lines. “In purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.'”\n\nTrump’s executive order, she added, offers a new twist on that Shakespearean phrase: “Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like.”\n\nThe case began on March 6, when Trump published Executive Order 14230 under the title, “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP”.\n\nCiting the law firm’s work with Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, the executive order suspended the law firm’s security clearances, limited its access to government buildings and ordered agencies to terminate contracts with Perkins Coie when possible.\n\nA handful of other law firms were also targeted with executive orders, including WilmerHale, Paul Weiss and Jenner & Block. Many had either represented causes unfavourable to Trump or had employed individuals with whom the president had expressed open displeasure.\n\nBut the idea that the president could withdraw services, security clearances, and even building access — simply because he disagreed with a law firm — raised questions about the constitutionality of those orders.\n\nCritics pointed out that the First Amendment of the US Constitution protects individuals and companies from facing government retaliation for their free speech. The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, meanwhile, protect the right to due process and the right to seek legal counsel from law firms like Perkins Coie.\n\nMany of the law firm’s clients had cases intimately involved with the inner workings of the government. Perkins Coie even said in its filings that its lawyers had to “necessarily interact with the federal government on behalf of their clients”.\n\nIt also added that some of its clients had started to reconsider working with Perkins Coie, in light of the executive order’s restrictions.\n\nIn April, more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief in support of Perkins Coie, arguing that Trump’s actions “would threaten the survival of any law firm” — and scare away clients.\n\nJudge Howell validated those concerns in her ruling, saying that the law firm had “shown monetary harm sufficient to establish irreparable harm”. She also called the executive order an “overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints”.\n\nBut rather than face such punitive action, several high-profile law firms decided to cut a deal with the White House.\n\nPaul Weiss was believed to be the first to strike a bargain, offering the administration $40m in pro bono legal services. Others followed suit: The firms Skadden, Milbank and Willkie Farr & Gallagher each agreed to perform $100m in free legal services.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Howell warned that Trump’s executive orders against law firms could have a chilling effect on the entire profession and were tantamount to a power grab.\n\n“Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the path to more power,” she wrote.\n\nThe Constitution, she added, “requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with ‘tolerance, not coercion'”.","summary":"A federal court has declared Trump&#039;s attacks on law firms an &#039;overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/judge-strikes-down-trumps-executive-order-targeting-law-firm-perkins-coie?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25122035083447-1746229480.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:01:16","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":317290262,"title":"Trump's proposed budget is a 'roadmap of destruction'","text":"Donald Trump released his budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year on Friday, which asks Congress to slash more than $163 billion in domestic spending on everything from education funding to medical research to environmental protection.\n\nIf enacted, the president’s proposed budget would leave domestic spending at its \"lowest level in the modern era,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nAmong the cuts demanded in Trump’s budget: $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $3.5 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will hamper medical research and efforts to prevent chronic diseases.\n\nRelated | Your camping plans may be kaput as Trump targets national parks\n\nThe draconian budget also calls for axing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income Americans pay their heating and cooling bills; slashing $900 million from the National Park Service, which is already short-staffed due to co-President Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency cuts; and stripping more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which would make weather forecasting less accurate—and everyone in the path of a storm less safe.\n\nTrump also wants to cut $980 million from the federal work study program that helps students pay for college, calling it a “handout to woke universities;” $75 million from the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program, which helps provide childcare services to parents attending college or university; and $49 million from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which helps advocate for millions of students with disabilities to get access to public education. \n\nBut Trump is also asking for more money for the Secret Service, which has to protect him during frequent trips to his personal properties so he can golf; a $43.8 billion increase to the Department of Homeland Security to help him carry out his evil immigration policies; and an additional $134 million for “fair trade and trade enforcement” to help carry out his economically destructive tariffs.\n\nSycophantic House Speaker Mike Johnson loves the proposed budget, calling it a “bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American strength and prosperity.”\n\n“Our country cannot continue to bear the hard consequences of years of runaway spending under Democratic leadership, and this budget makes clear that fiscal discipline is non-negotiable,” Johnson added. “President Trump’s plan ensures every federal taxpayer dollar spent is used to serve the American people, not a bloated bureaucracy or partisan pet projects.”\n\nHowever, even some powerful Republican committee chairs are not pleased, and are already saying some of the budget proposals are DOA in Congress—which has to pass a funding bill by Sept. 30 or else face a government shutdown.\n\nSen.

To subsequently win a plurality of seats and be in position to govern is the sort of stuff they make movies about.\n\nThere were some unique circumstances in that election. Replacing the shop-worn increasingly toxic Justin Trudeau with a prominent and serious household name in Mark Carney was a big part of the story, but normally that would be enough to just limit the loss rather than completely turn the tide.\n\nThe big assist was US President Donald Trump and his full-frontal attack on Canadian sovereignty. Carney was able to capture the anti-US sentiment that followed much more effectively than his opponent Pierre Poilievre, and the job was done.\n\nPoilievre’s mistake turned out to be to style himself too much on being the Canadian version of Trump. That worked for him right up until January, because Trump seemed to represent the political zeitgeist, a new and successful brand of radical populist conservative politics.\n\nHowever, Canadians soured on Trump once he started musing about Canada as the 51st state and making it clear that under his rule everyone else but the United States could get stuffed. \n\nThat quickly morphed into a rejection of all things remotely Maga, including Poilievre.\n\nSo much for Canada.\n\nAustralians vote in their federal election this weekend and it is always dangerous writing about an election before it happens. \n\nWhat does appear clear though is that the Albanese Labor Party, which just months ago risked being the first single-term federal government in ages, has consolidated significantly. It is now odds on to win at least a minority government tonight.\n\nIf he does lose the election, Opposition leader Peter Dutton too is likely to rue hewing too close to the Trump populist model. It seems that even being a watered-down version of Trump does not play as well now outside the United States.\n\nOr possibly even within it. The Maga movement’s popularity is declining rapidly as the real impacts of Trump’s bumper sticker slogans on the economy become more apparent. \n\nWith due deference to the President’s claim that pollsters, with mainstream journalists, the swamp, and the elite are all conspiring against his wonderfully popular Government, he’s tanking with the American public.\n\nTo me, the only way back will be to continue his screeching economic policy U-turns until there is pretty much nothing left. At which point only extreme loyalists will be able to convince themselves the whole policy platform was part of a fiendishly clever triple-feint master plan, while the rest of the world will wonder what the point of it all was.\n\nI think what we are seeing unfold is a political lesson for the political right which was only recently also dealt to the political left. That lesson is that, despite appearances, social media isn’t the real world, and you can’t govern as if it is.\n\nThe left’s moment of learning came in the mid to late 2010s leading up to 2022. This was the period where identity politics was all the rage, and the phrases “pile on” and “being cancelled” entered the lexicon. \n\nAcross the social media platforms and especially on Twitter, the identity trolls ruled the roost, and woe betide anyone who thought outside the mandated social construct.\n\nLeft-leaning parties virtue-signalled their way to electoral success. \n\nThis was the time of the Trudeaus and the Arderns; where being kind meant identifying with some views, and being intolerant of everyone else.\n\nThe key point is that this was fed by the social media echo chamber which looks like the mainstream, but isn’t. The left, and many journalists, made the political mistake of thinking the views of Twitter were shared by everyone. \n\nThey lost touch with middle voters and, as a result, for the most part were unceremoniously booted out.\n\nThe Maga movement is in part a reaction to identity politics, but I think it, too, is making the same mistake.\n\nIn 2022 Elon Musk took over Twitter, rebranded it to X, and it has quickly become the echo chamber of the populist right, a mirror image of what Twitter was to the left. \n\nTrump unashamedly plays to that social media/Fox News crowd, giving voice to every bar room expert’s unfettered opinions.\n\nIndeed, he reminds me of that loud mouth at the bar who has a simple answer to everything, from “building a wall” to charging foreigners for the privilege of trading with his country. \n\nThe only trouble being that the simple solutions often don’t stack up in a complex world. At which point you start to lose the quieter crowd, who are just trying to pay the bills and get ahead.\n\nAs in many things, social media is a magnification and acceleration of what used to happen in real-life forums. When I went into politics, I learnt that the National Party membership and activist base did not accurately represent the broad middle of New Zealand voters, and if you follow their policy prescription exactly, yours would be a long, pure, and unsuccessful political life on the opposition benches.\n\nThe same applies to the Labour Party, I’m sure. Their most vocal active partisans are not likely to be mainstream in their views, because they are, by definition, more motivated than most in rejecting the status quo.\n\nIn our case, we learnt to respect the views of party members and the sense of direction they provided, but understand that the path to political success was through the median voter.\n\nI don’t think that’s changed. Just substitute social media tribes for political party membership. The trick, as always, is to govern from the political centre, or at least the centre-right or centre-left.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you don’t try new or even radical policy directions. Just that the path to acceptance of those policies is by convincing the majority, and not just winning the applause of social media denizens. \n\nAnd by remembering always that most people don’t ever post on Twitter/X, which is in the end no more than the citizen band radio of our times.\n\nPlaying to the narrow base in politics is never durable, wherever they hang out. Politicians either learn that lesson themselves, or the less visible but more numerous ordinary voter teaches it to them.","summary":"Canada's Liberal Party made a stunning comeback, winning a plurality of seats.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/elections-in-canada-and-australia-signal-shift-away-from-trump-style-politics-steven-joyce/C5ZJRF6VGJAVDB5ZARYAIGXKSM/","image":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/PLHW35ZNYZADJCVG36HMV2TJB4.jpg?auth=0456d39c3f00fd0f6a7508d46da15fc55172972c2dea4bee2755f7ce23635383&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:00:00","author":"Steven Joyce","authors":["Steven Joyce"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"nz","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":317288656,"title":"Trump ends tariff exemption, prompting retail exits from U.S.","text":"LONDON >> With the end of a U.S. tariff exemption for small parcels today, some retailers have stopped selling to customers in the United States while others are seeking temporary workarounds in the hope the tariff rate may be reduced.\n\nThe removal of “de minimis” — duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 — for products originating from China and Hong Kong exposes those goods to tariffs of 145% on most Chinese goods following President Donald Trump’s decision last month. The move upended global trade and triggered retaliation from Beijing.\n\nBritish beauty products retailer Space NK has paused e-commerce orders and shipping to the United States “to avoid incorrect or additional costs being applied to our customers’ orders”, the company said in a notice on Wednesday.\n\nIt is not alone. Understance, a Vancouver-based company that sells bras and underwear manufactured in China, told customers in an Instagram post that it would no longer ship to the United States due to the tariffs, saying it will resume once there is clarity.\n\n“We’re going from zero to 145%, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether,” she added.\n\nPRICE HIKES UNDERWAY\n\nPlayers willing to continue to access the U.S. market are forced to hike their price tags.\n\nOh Polly, a British clothing retailer, has increased prices in the U.S. by 20% compared to its other markets, and may have to consider further price increases because of the higher tariffs, said managing director Mike Branney.\n\nSingapore-based fast-fashion giant Shein sought to reassure customers in a post on its U.S. Instagram account on Thursday, saying: “Some products may be priced differently than before, but the majority of our collections remain as affordable as ever.” Shein sells clothes mostly manufactured in China, and the U.S. is its biggest market.\n\nTemu, the international arm of Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, prominently featured products already in U.S. warehouses on its website, labelled ‘Local’, and a pop-up informed customers there would be no import charges for local warehouse items.\n\n“All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,” Temu said in a statement, adding that its pricing for U.S. customers “remains unchanged”.\n\nBut items imported before the May 2 change will eventually run out. Both Shein and Temu have slashed their U.S. digital advertising spending in the past weeks as they prepared for the change that is likely to hit their sales.\n\nShein did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\n“E-commerce companies have had it really good for a really long time, and this is a seismic shift in how trade works,” said Hugo Pakula, customs expert and CEO of trade automation platform Tru Identity. “If your inventory is not already in the U.S., selling to the U.S. is going to hurt.”\n\nDe minimis was initially introduced to smooth international trade, but became the target of bipartisan criticism due to its role in facilitating smuggling of fentanyl ingredients from China and fuelling a surge in imports of cheap clothes, toys, and furniture made in China through online platforms like Temu, Shein, and Amazon Haul.\n\nDe minimis has also been a channel for counterfeit goods. In 2024, de minimis shipments accounted for 97% of the intellectual property infringement-related cargo seizures made by Customs and Border Protection.\n\nWithout de minimis, sellers of goods made in China have to provide U.S. customs with more detailed information about where each component of their product is made, an increased administrative burden that, along with the huge tariff cost, is dissuading small retailers.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome said on Tuesday that many of the delivery firm’s small to medium-sized business customers source 100% of their goods from China.\n\nU.S. online marketplace Etsy said in a notice to sellers earlier this month that it was making it easier for them to clarify the country of origin of their products, as tariffs are applied based on where a good is made rather than where it is dispatched from.\n\nWhile disruptive to ecommerce, the end of de minimis treatment of Chinese goods could give a boost to retailers less reliant on ecommerce or on Chinese manufacturing.\n\nBritish fast-fashion retailer Primark, which sells clothes to U.S. customers only through its stores across the country, not online, said it could benefit from the change.\n\n“With prices going up from this part of the trade, I wonder if some Americans might start going back to shopping centres to find value there,” George Weston, CEO of Primark owner Associated British Foods, told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nAdditional reporting by Amy Tennery, Lisa Baertlein, James Davey.","summary":"LONDON >> With the end of a U.S. tariff exemption for small parcels today, some retailers have stopped selling to customers in the United States while others are seeking temporary workarounds in the hope the tariff rate may be reduced.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/02/breaking-news/trump-ends-tariff-exemption-prompting-retail-exits-from-u-s/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/web1_20250502_brk_par01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 00:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":317283734,"title":"Birthday howls!

The poll had a margin or error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress and Trump's Cabinet are forging ahead on key agenda items, including a GOP-led budget resolution, immigration and border security.What To Know Much of Greene's criticism in her lengthy X (formerly Twitter) post centered on foreign policy issues.The Georgia representative started her post by writing, \"I represent the base and when I'm frustrated and upset over the direction of things, you better be clear, the base is not happy.\"Iran \"I campaigned for no more foreign wars. And now we are supposedly on the verge of going to war with Iran,\" she wrote.A fourth round of nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran, originally scheduled for Saturday, has been postponed amid rising tensions and the threat of military action from Trump.The postponement follows fresh U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil networks and warnings from Washington about Tehran's alleged support for Yemen's Houthi forces. Iran has criticized the U.S. for what it describes as contradictory and provocative behavior.The Houthis have been attacking ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza amid Israel's ongoing military actions against Hamas. Since mid-March, the U.S. has launched over 1,000 airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Iran says the group acts independently and has denounced the strikes as destabilizing.\"I don't think we should be bombing foreign countries on behalf of other foreign countries especially when they have their own nuclear weapons and massive military strength,\" Greene wrote, likely referencing the belief that Israel possesses a nuclear weapon.UkraineThe Republican lawmaker then turned to Ukraine and the recent minerals deal Washington struck with Kyiv after months of tense negotiations.Greene repeated a slew of falsehoods about the Russia-Ukraine war and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Trump and far-right Republicans have pushed, writing on X: \"We have signed a deal for mineral rights in Ukraine, in order to pay us back for the hundreds of billions of dollars that we gave Ukraine and they used for money laundering, sold the weapons we gave them to our enemies, and their leader is a dictator who canceled elections, was involved of the first impeachment of Trump, and campaigned for Biden.\"Trump told NewsNation the minerals agreement with Ukraine ensures that that the U.S. gets \"much more\" than the $350 billion he argues the U.S. has provided Kyiv, though most estimates put the actual figure as closer to $130 billion.Greene on Friday compared the minerals deal to the Iraq War, writing: \"Didn't we learn our lesson when we went to war in Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein because of 'weapons of mass destruction?'\"The lawmaker went on to argue for a more \"America First\" approach, writing: \"Why don't we just mine our own rare earth minerals that are tied up on federal lands that the government confiscated years ago?\"She also voiced frustration over other policy issues, including the COVID-19 vaccine, which she has frequently railed against, the \"rogue judicial system\" and the lack of congressional rescissions, among other things.What People Are Saying U.S. President Donald Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday: \" ALERT: All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW! Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form. Thank you for your attention to this matter\"Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrote in an X post on Wednesday: \"Message to IRAN: We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing. You know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of — and you were warned. You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing.\"Scott Bessent, US Treasury secretary said in a statement the Ukraine minerals deal \"signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term\".What Happens NextBoth the U.S. and Ukraine expressed optimism about the recently-struck minerals deal. While it does not include any security guarantees from the U.S., those in Kyiv have been cautiously optimistic that Washington will help ward off further Russian aggression out of its own self-interest if it's invested in Ukraine. Negotiations for a lasting peace deal remain ongoing.Meanwhile, Iranian officials have said the next round of nuclear talks would be rescheduled \"depending on the U.S. approach.\" Omani officials, who have been mediating the discussions, said the most recent postponement was for logistical reasons.","summary":"Greene, a staunch supporter of President Trump, said she is \"frustrated\" with the administration in a lengthy social media post.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-rebukes-trump-losing-base-2067567","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638021/mgt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:56:48","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":317283584,"title":"Federal Judge Blocks Trump’s Order Against Perkins Coie Law Firm","text":"U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on May 2 struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order on revoking government contracts of law firm Perkins Coie.

It was the first time a judge had decided the legal merits of executive actions targeting lawyers and law firms involved with Trump’s political opponents and investigations against him.\n\nThe Department of Justice is able to appeal the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nIn 2016, Perkins Coie LLP, representing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, played a part in the production of the Steele dossier, an intelligence document used at that time to push allegations that Trump had colluded with Russia to steal the presidential election.\n\nThose allegations were later disproven, as Trump had maintained all along, but the reputational damage was already done.\n\nIn court, Howell questioned government attorney John Lawton for two hours about the constitutionality of the executive order, which she characterized as “retaliation” for the firm’s role in creating the dossier.\n\nHowell said that nine other law firms had made deals with the Trump administration to avoid the scrutiny Perkins Coie was facing. In one case, she said, the firm Paul/Weiss had an executive order against it rescinded, after agreeing to provide $40 million in free legal work to the administration.\n\nShe repeatedly questioned Lawton about details of those agreements, but he said he was not privy to those discussions.\n\nHowell compared the revocation of the security clearances to the “Red Scare,” a period in U.S. politics when some were punished based on the accusation of being communist.\n\n“Is this a callback to the McCarthy era?” she asked.\n\nLawton said the president has “inherent discretion” regarding the firms the government contracts with and who should hold security clearances.\n\n“The essential factor is trust in the holder” of those clearances, he said.\n\n“And $40 million in legal services is enough to gain that trust?” the judge asked.\n\nShe also took issue with the government’s accusation of “racist hiring practices” and its decision to launch an Equal Opportunity Employment Commission review of Perkins Coie.\n\n“Why does the administration view those three words as dirty?” she asked, referring to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nHowell also said the timing of the review was suspect, noting that it was launched after Perkins Coie decided to sue rather than make a deal as other firms had done.","summary":"The firm had participated in the production of the Steele dossier, which was used to push the disproven Trump–Russia narrative in 2016.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-order-against-perkins-coie-law-firm-5846533","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/03/20/id5828400-Trump-signs-executive-orders-GettyImages-2203670506-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:55:05","author":"Stacy Robinson","authors":["Stacy Robinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":317285828,"title":"Gutfeld Says Democrats Turned Abrego Garcia Into ‘Rosa Parks With Tats’ To Push Narrative","text":"Fox’s Greg Gutfeld said Friday that Democrats are turning illegal migrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia into “Rosa Parks with tats” to push their narrative to voters.\n\nDemocrats have rallied behind Abrego Garcia after the Trump administration deported him to El Salvador’s mega-prison in March. While discussing allegations tying Abrego Garcia to MS-13 and human trafficking, Gutfeld said Republicans deserve credit for their “unbelievable patience.”\n\n“Look, Abrego is a Maryland man, right? Ted Bundy is a dating expert. The Unabomber is a pen pal. Charles Manson, family man. I think Republicans and other sane people should be credited with unbelievable patience,” Gutfeld said. “As we had to sit through the endless lionizing of a thug, they turned him into, I don’t know, Rosa Parks with tats.”\n\n“We knew it was inevitable. It was just like Jussie Smollett, where we had to bite our tongues and let the Dems work through their five stages of performative outrage,” Gutfeld added. “But we knew it was going to happen. It was just going to take time. Then what’s going to happen? They’re going to pivot. Suddenly it’s not about the Maryland dad at all. It’s about all of us.”\n\nFollowing pushback from Abrego-Garcia’s deportation, the Trump administration brought his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, with original court filings admitting the administration deported Garcia by error but said his alleged connection to MS-13 should keep him in El Salvador. (RELATED: Dem Policies Might Make It Tough For ICE To Get Its Hands On Illegal Migrant Who Allegedly Raped Corpse)\n\nThe Department of Justice later released documents on April 16 detailing his alleged ties to MS-13. Alongside resurfaced reports of prior allegations, new information emerged showing Abrego Garcia was once pulled over while driving a vehicle registered to a convicted human smuggler.\n\n“No, it’s not about all of us. You made it about the Maryland dad. This is the hill you chose to die on, and you’re going to die on it. They always seem to pick the wrong side on the wrong hill,” Gutfeld said. “Trans athletes, left-wing congressmen who let dogs die, a guy who assassinates a CEO, pro-Hamas protesters, BLM rioters, looters who are only trying to get bread, the wife-beating gangbanger. If you want to find a scumbag, just look for the Democrat that’s defending him.”\n\n“Meanwhile, who do they demonize? Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Daniel Penny, men who actually try to do good,” Gutfeld said.\n\nOn Thursday, Tennessee state law enforcement released 2022 traffic stop footage involving Abrego Garcia, who was seen with eight other men in his vehicle. State troopers later contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but ICE agents failed to take Abrego Garcia into custody, according to Fox News Digital.\n\n“But I don’t believe that the Dems actually ever cared about this guy,” Gutfeld said. “They don’t really care about the victims at all. What they care about is themselves and how to score virtue signaling points and political points. Who is the real victim? They don’t care unless it’s them, unless they get mugged, unless they get carjacked.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

So long Tesla.

And right now, this organism that we live on is being disregarded, particularly by this administration,’ Crow noted.\n\n‘Let’s face it: I may not be here to see my kids teach their kids how to leave the campground nicer than they found it. And who knows what the campground’s gonna be like when they get it. That concerns me.’\n\nAs it was the Power of Women: Nashville edition of the magazine, the You and Me Time songstress had heavy praise for colleagues like P!NK, Chappell Roan, Olivia Rodrigo, and Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift, Brandi Carlile, and Courtney Barnett.\n\n‘These women are not just in the studio throwing in a lyric — they play,’ Sheryl gushed.\n\n‘For a long time, there was a dearth

by judge","text":"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday blocked a White House executive order targeting an elite law firm, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump’s campaign of retribution against the legal profession.\n\nU.S. District Beryl Howell said the executive order against the law firm of Perkins Coie violated multiple provisions of the Constitution and ordered that it be immediately nullified.\n\nThe order sought to punish the firm by stripping the security clearances of its lawyers, blocking its employees from accessing federal buildings and canceling federal contracts involving the firm.\n\nIt was one in a series of similar executive actions aimed at punishing some of the country’s most prestigious law firms, in some cases over prior legal representations out of favor with the Trump administration or because of their associations with prosecutors who previously investigated Trump. \n\nIn the case of Perkins Coie, the White House cited its representation of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHowell wrote in her 102-page order, “No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.’”\n\nThe decision was not surprising given that Howell had earlier temporarily blocked multiple provisions of the order and had expressed deep misgivings about the edict at a more recent hearing, when she grilled a Justice Department lawyer who was tasked with justifying it.\n\nSo far, all the firms that have challenged orders against them — Perkins Coie, WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Susman Godfrey — have succeeded in at least temporarily blocking the orders. But other major firms have sought to avert orders by preemptively reaching settlements that require them, among other things, to dedicate tens of millions of dollars in free legal services in support of causes the Trump administration says it supports.","summary":"U.S. District Beryl Howell said the executive order against the law firm of Perkins Coie violated multiple provisions of the Constitution and ordered that it be immediately nullified.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/02/us-news/trumps-order-stripping-elite-law-firm-behind-steele-dossier-of-security-clearances-is-tossed-by-judge/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-6ssvwa24b-1746229470115.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1746215093&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V2gCck1N-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:45:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":317283586,"title":"Democrats Decry Spending Cuts in Trump’s 2026 Budget Proposal","text":"WASHINGTON—Democrats expressed their objection to President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal, criticizing the proposed big cuts to social spending programs.\n\nThe Trump administration on May 2 published an extract of the president’s recommendations to Congress for Fiscal Year 2026, which is the first step in the process of funding the government for that period.\n\nOther entities—such as the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the latter for a “Make America Healthy Again” initiative—will gain funds, with the net reduction in spending being $163 billion, or 22.6 percent below previous levels.

Polling stations on the eastern coast of the country, which includes Sydney and Melbourne, opened Saturday at 8 a.m. local time and close at 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET on Saturday). In Western Australia, which includes Perth, the poll closing time comes two hours later.Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where Mr. Trump's influence was also felt. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney — whose numbers spiked as he pushed back against tariff threats and Mr. Trump's jibes about annexing Canada into a \"51st state\" — crushed Pierre Poilievre's hopes to return the Conservative Party to power after a decade of Liberal Party rule. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia led the polls for nearly a year and had seemed to be on a path to form a government. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, however, the coalition's support has plummeted, and it now trails the Labor Party by 4.4 points, according to YouGov.Opposition leader Peter Dutton has run a campaign echoing Mr. Trump's messaging focusing on the economy. His Liberal Party, whose motto is \"Let's get Australia back on track,\" proposed cutting government waste and mandating federal workers return to the office. \"It was literally as if Dutton was copying what the United States government was doing, and I think as such, that ended up being enormously unpopular,\" Alan Tidwell, a professor of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific studies at Georgetown University, told CBS News on Friday.The economic downturn in Australia in recent years in the wake of the pandemic initially threatened center-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects of remaining in power. But Dutton's similarities to Mr. Trump and the U.S. president's growing unpopularity among the Australian public seem to have boosted Albanese's chances.Still, Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Mr. Trump, refraining from criticizing him directly. When asked during a debate last month whether he trusts Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Albanese said he had \"no reason not to\" trust either leader and said in a separate radio interview that he would speak with Mr. Trump after the election, should he win.\"I assure you I'm not staying up at night trying to ring anyone at the moment,\" Albanese said.But Tidwell told CBS News that even if tariffs were reversed, Mr. Trump's unpopularity in Australia would still impact the election. \"It's not saving Labor to the point where they can win an outright majority, but I think that they will win office with a minority government,\" he said.Australia is among several nations with which the U.S. does not have a trade deficit, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The two nations signed the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2004, and it took effect on Jan. 1, 2005. Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, asked U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer why Australia was included on Mr. Trump's tariff list.\"The idea we are going to whack friend and foe alike undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward,\" Warner said.The U.S. was Australia's second-largest trading partner after China in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While it is unclear if American tariffs would prompt China to fill the gap, Beijing's increased presence in the Indo-Pacific is considered a national security threat by Canberra.The Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security partnershipAustralia and the U.S., along with the U.K., also share a close national security relationship, known as AUKUS, which was formalized in 2021. The trilateral security partnership also allows Australia to obtain Virginia-class nuclear submarines, which are expected to join the Royal Australian Navy's fleet by the early 2030s.Nishank Motwani, senior fellow and director of alliance strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute USA in Washington, D.C., told CBS News that AUKUS matters a lot to Australia's defense capability, but it needs to show the Trump administration how Canberra is being a responsible ally when it comes to defense spending to counter China.\"With a more influential China, which is more coercive and aggressive in the way in which it is just carrying out its affairs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia needs to do more as a way to push back against China's ability to carve out its sphere of influence,\" Motwani said.As the Trump White House redefines America's leadership role abroad and imposes tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. \"to act responsibly in the world,\" according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, whose survey in April also noted this was a \"new low in two decades\" of its polling.\"The level of distrust has certainly shot through the roof,\" Tidwell said. \"But I think that Donald Trump's launch of the trade war and his other comments about Canada and the Panama Canal and Greenland have all really upset the apple cart, and Australians are really wondering, what does the future hold?\"","summary":"Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where President Trump's influence was also felt.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/australians-voting-national-election-trump-influence-looms/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/02/13464b49-cad9-4a1e-bfd2-8e3e41e02713/thumbnail/1200x630/6a6ea98db50ecb1070fd1e8d917303dc/gettyimages-2212207320.jpg?v=7c5acc180b39394767372ab4e02619ce","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3725810_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:43:15","author":"Ibrahim Aksoy","authors":["Ibrahim Aksoy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":317284708,"title":"9 ways federal judges are 'throwing up increasingly fierce resistance' to Trump","text":"Despite the high-profile deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia dominating the news cycle, President Donald Trump’s push to remove immigrants and legal residents is getting overwhelmingly blocked by judges, reports Politico.\n\n“A POLITICO review of hundreds of lawsuits reveals that despite Trump’s aggressive border crackdown, he’s been largely stymied on the other planks of his immigration agenda,” Politico reports. “Courts are throwing up increasingly fierce resistance to his efforts to swiftly detain and deport migrants living in the United States.

The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on \"the autocratic threat to our nation.\"The president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called \"USD1\" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.World Liberty has ties to the president and his sons.The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company.According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens –- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.Details of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction.In a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.The White House responded to a request for comment by telling CBS News to \"report on something people actually care about.\" A spokesperson provided links to several White House technology initiatives.As the president's investments in crypto have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since his inauguration, a CBS News analysis found.\"The bottom line is it appears like he's profiting off of his public office,\" said Virginia Canter, State Democracy Defenders chief counsel for ethics and anticorruption. Canter, who co-authored the new report, served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations. \"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts,\" Canter said. \"President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry.\"The report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazine article that reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth.Crypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products. Canter says this makes it more difficult to identify potential conflicts of interest. \"In his first administration, we could see who was walking in and out of the Trump hotels,\" she said.Trump hopes U.S. will be the \"crypto capital of the world\"The president, who as recently as 2021 described crypto currency as a \"scam,\" has since embraced digital currency, saying he hopes to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the world.\"Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses. He has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, including one that seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies and another that instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Mr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to a report by Reuters. The value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts.The value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted \"I Love $TRUMP– SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!\" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24.Whether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. A Reuters analysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading.World Liberty Finance: The Trump family's crypto exchangeAside from meme coins, the Trump family's more recent foray into cryptocurrency may become its most profitable. In October, then-candidate Trump helped launch World Liberty Finance, a decentralized or \"defi\" cryptocurrency exchange. Its website, which heavily features the president's image, offers users the opportunity to buy into the exchange using $WLFI tokens. \"Good News, the World Liberty Financial token is now live. Crypto is the future, let's embrace this incredible technology and lead the world in the digital economy. Go to World Liberty Financial.com,\" Mr. Trump posted on X in October, before the presidential election. The website says World Liberty is \"inspired by Donald J. Trump\" and Mr. Trump is listed as chief crypto advocate. His sons, Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, are all listed as Web3 ambassadors. Donald Trump Jr. promoted World Liberty Financial in March, at the D.C. Blockchain conference, where crypto industry insiders rubbed shoulders with members of Congress and the administration.\"I'm just super excited about what this can mean for the future of banking for the future of financial systems,\" said Trump Jr., who joined World Liberty's panel remotely. Founders Chase Herro, Zak Folkman and Zach Witkoff appeared on stage to promote World Liberty's stablecoin offering.\"We want Republicans, Democrats, whether it be black, blue, brown, white, to be using our stable coin,\" said Zach Witkoff, the son of Steven Witkoff, the White House special envoy to the Middle East. \"We think it democratizes finance.\" World Liberty says it has raised more than $550 million from investors who purchase the $WLF governance token. The majority of these investors remain anonymous to the public. For now, these $WLFI tokens are non redeemable, meaning that once they are purchased, users cannot exchange them. World Liberty denied CBS' multiple requests for an interview.Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire famous for buying and eating a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to the wall, is one of World Liberty's few publicly known investors. Sun, who was being investigated for securities fraud in the Biden administration, said he invested $30 million shortly after Mr. Trump's election, at the time claiming in a post on X to be World Liberty's\"largest investor.\"Days before Mr. Trump's inauguration, Sun said he invested another $45 million, which he also disclosed in a post on X. A few weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission reversed itself and asked the judge to grant a stay in Sun's case, citing \"public interest.\" The pause in Sun's case was part of a larger push by the SEC to dismiss cases against crypto companies. A spokesperson for Sun and the SEC declined to comment. Last month, Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee sent a letter to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the potential for conflict of interest as the Trump administration considers regulations of companies like World Liberty Financial.\"President Trump's involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence…presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system,\" said the letter, which was signed by five Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen. World Liberty Financial says 85,000 investors have gone through a standard Know Your Customer process to determine \"participation eligibility,\" and the company says it is arranging for a third-party accounting firm to audit its new venture into the U.S.-debt-backed stablecoins. As president, Mr. Trump is not subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest law. But he is required to disclose his assets and income under the Ethics in Government Act, including his crypto assets. The next financial disclosure report deadline for the president is May 15.","summary":"As the Trump family's crypto ventures increase their wealth, the president's administration pauses a dozen federal crypto probes.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-family-net-worth-crypto-investments/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/02/0621314e-9b1e-4773-86f0-823d41f5dee3/thumbnail/1200x630g2/50aa1ed5c994eb7a3ee3bde1a0a2b377/gettyimages-2194369823.jpg?v=7c5acc180b39394767372ab4e02619ce","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3727634_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:41:20","author":"Madeleine May","authors":["Madeleine May"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":317283596,"title":"Veteran federal prosecutor to lead U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit - Detroit Free Press","text":"Interim U.S. Attorney Jerome F.

You better do it, because you’re not going to get federal funding … Your population doesn’t want men in women’s sports.”\n\n“We’ll see you in court,” Mills replied.\n\n“Good. I’ll see you in court. I’ll look forward to that. That should be a real easy one,” Trump said. “And enjoy your life after, governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nIn the ensuing lawsuit, Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the state of violating Title IX, the 1972 civil rights law prohibiting sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.\n\nMaine violated the law by “discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports,” according to Bondi’s lawsuit.\n\n“By prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine's policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and psychological harm,” the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order to end the “dangerous and unfair participation of men in women’s sports” by directing federal law enforcement agencies to take “immediate action” against schools and associations that “deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms,” according to a summary from the White House.\n\nDuring a signing ceremony surrounded by young girls, Trump claimed that the “radical left” had “waged an all-out campaign to erase the very concept of biological sex and replace it with a militant transgender ideology.”\n\nThe order followed a sweeping executive order impacting virtually every aspect of public life for trans Americans by erasing “gender” as a concept across federal agencies and effectively denying the existence of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people.\n\nSeparate executive orders have targeted access to gender-affirming healthcare for trans people under 19 and have sought to ban trans service members from the U.S. military.\n\nThe lawsuit followed a letter to the state from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on April 2, which Mills likened to a “ransom note” written by a child in her remarks on Friday.\n\n“A demand letter that was outrageous at the time and remains outrageous today,” she said Friday.\n\nOn April 11, District Judge John Woodcock Jr. ordered the USDA to immediately unfreeze any withheld federal funding to the state.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations,” Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a statement. “But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-unfreeze-maine-funding-trans-233443979.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/6bebb3e71a233724102b271a2160e97c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:34:43","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.02},{"id":317283214,"title":"Now a trusted ally, 'Little Marco' gets Trump's big jobs","text":"WASHINGTON - Top diplomat, foreign aid chief, national archivist and now national security adviser.

Kelly, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, rejected those claims, both procedurally and for their legal arguments.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\n“For one reason or another, Plaintiffs’ claims are likely to fail,” the judge writes. “Some falter on standing—a prerequisite to success on the merits—and others on the underlying First and Fifth Amendment claims.”\n\nThe majority of the court’s opinion strikes a blow for the long-aggressive nature of Article III standing, which is widely understood by legal scholars as “conservative standing doctrine.”\n\nThis judicial theory was created in two cases from the 1920s by conservative judges who sought to restrain the use and limits of constitutional redress. In other words, standing doctrine was created – and has over time been honed and sustained – to limit citizens from suing the government over perceived violations of their rights. While technically procedural in nature, as opposed to relying on underlying arguments in a dispute, standing arguments are fact-intensive.\n\nKelly, for his part, quickly dispenses with how he views the facts in the case brought by the nonprofit organizations.\n\n“For half the challenged provisions, Plaintiffs fail to establish a prerequisite to success on the merits: standing,” the opinion goes on. “Presidential directives to subordinates that inflict no concrete harm on private parties—or at least not on these parties—do not present a justiciable case or controversy.”\n\nIn the present case, the judge found many of the challenged provisions had to do with changing the government’s own behavior, and do not result in what, in standing doctrine legalese, is known as an “injury in fact.” This state of affairs, rather, turns the plaintiffs into “at most ‘concerned bystanders’ to internal Executive Branch processes.”\n\n“Everything is intra-governmental,” the judge muses.\n\nIn sum, Kelly found four of the challenged provisions asked “nothing from Plaintiffs—no compliance, no changed behavior, nothing at all” because those provisions are “not aimed at them” but instead tell “only the agencies to do something.”\n\nFor the remaining four challenged provisions, however, the court determined the plaintiffs did, in fact, have standing.\n\nBut the court still rejected their arguments as legally deficient.\n\n“Plaintiffs have not shown that the provisions threaten a protected liberty or property interest—a threshold requirement for due process claims,” Kelly’s opinion continues. “And even if they had, Plaintiffs’ vagueness challenge fails for independent reasons. The First Amendment claim, moreover, clashes with two settled rules: the government does not abridge the right to free speech by choosing not to subsidize it, and that right does not permit Plaintiffs or anyone else to violate federal anti-discrimination law.”\n\nOne of the major problems, the court says, is that the plaintiffs argued a bit too much, resting their claims on so-called “facial rather than as-applied challenges.”\n\nIn lawsuits, government action can be challenged facially, meaning in general, or as-applied, meaning in a specific circumstance.\n\nIn the present case, Kelly suggests the plaintiffs would have been better off limiting their claims to more specific problems. Instead, they argued, as the judge framed the issues, that each of the challenged anti-DEI provisions “is unconstitutional in all its applications.”\n\nThat “is a big claim,” the judge says – one that “comes at a cost.” The cost, in this case, is to show “an interest that due process protects but that the remaining Challenged Provisions threaten.”\n\nAnd there, the judge says, the plaintiffs wholly failed.\n\n“Plaintiffs have not come close to showing that most applications of the remaining Challenged Provisions will implicate protected property or liberty interests,” Kelly observes. “Indeed, they have not really tried to. All they say is that ‘a protected liberty interest . . . can’ flow from terminated contracts or grants. But they never explain how terminations under the Challenged Provisions would implicate that interest for Plaintiffs or anyone else.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump observes the formal swearing-in of Paul Atkins as the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Gains Support from Groups Contesting Anti-DEI Mandates first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/trump-gains-support-from-groups-contesting-anti-dei-mandates/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump-wins-over-groups-who-challenged-anti-DEI-orders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:30:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":317288322,"title":"Mexico welcomes US decision to waive tariffs on auto parts under USMCA","text":"Mexico City, May 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) Mexico has welcomed a US decision to exempt Mexican auto parts from tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), calling it a major breakthrough for the country's manufacturing sector.\n\nSecretary of Economy Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday that the exemption was confirmed in new US customs guidance published on Thursday, reaffirming that Mexican auto parts will be treated as if they originated in the US and will enter duty-free, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\n\"This is a significant step forward,\" Ebrard said during the government's daily press briefing.\n\n\"Mexican auto parts, and those headed to Canada as well, will continue receiving the preferential treatment guaranteed by our treaty.\"\n\nEbrard, who has led negotiations with US officials, said the development reflects progress in avoiding new trade barriers and protecting cross-border supply chains.\n\nHe added that President Claudia Sheinbaum has made the issue a top priority.\n\n\"You can't slap a 25 per cent tariff on auto parts, plus another 25 per cent on steel, aluminum, and final products -- that would wipe out entire companies,\" he said, referring to ongoing talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nThe tariff suspension follows the sixth phone call between Sheinbaum and US President Donald Trump, during which both agreed to keep working toward solutions on trade and other bilateral issues.\n\nAt a press briefing on Friday, Sheinbaum said the decision was \"good news\".\n\n\"There's a preferential treatment for everything that is produced within the trade agreement, and in particular for auto parts, which have zero tariffs,\" she said, noting that she and Trump spoke by phone on Thursday.\n\n\"We continue working together, and if you've noticed, we keep getting better conditions compared to what the situation was previously.\"\n\nMexico continues negotiations with the US to prevent the implementation of Trump's broader executive orders targeting key industrial sectors.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Mexico City, May 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) Mexico has welcomed a US decision to exempt Mexican auto parts from tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), calling it a major breakthrough for the country's manufacturing sector.

Previously, the Army’s birthday festivities did not feature such a large parade, which officials estimate will cost several tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHowever, President Trump has desired a military parade for some time, leading to discussions with the Pentagon about organizing one as part of the anniversary celebrations, which began less than two months ago.\n\nThe Army 250th birthday happens to coincide with Trump’s 79th birthday on June 14. In a statement Friday, Army spokesman Steve Warren said the Army’s birthday celebration will include “a spectacular fireworks display, a parade, and a daylong festival on the National Mall.”\n\nThe pricey parade comes as Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, run by Elon Musk, have slashed federal government departments, personnel and programs, with thousands of workers losing their jobs, including civilians in the Defense Department.\n\nIn comments to Fox News Digital, White House officials confirmed a commemorative parade would take place and said it would be one of the first events to kick off a yearlong celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary.\n\nWhen asked about the parade Thursday, the White House did not respond, and Army officials said no decision had been made. While officials said there has now been a formal decision to proceed with the parade, there is still no specific cost estimate.\n\nWarren said that given the significance of the Army birthday, they are looking at options “to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.” \n\nArmy planning documents, obtained this week by the AP and dated April 29 and 30, said the parade will include soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. They said it would involve a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.\n\nThe plans note that while the parade will begin near the Pentagon, the heavy, tracked vehicles — which would include the Strykers — would be stationed near the Lincoln Memorial and join the procession there, so they will not go over the bridge from Virginia\n\nCity officials, including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14. At the time, she said that tanks rolling through the city’s streets “would not be good.”\n\n“If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,” she said. \n\nThe Army birthday festival has been planned for more than a year and is slated to include displays of Army equipment, military demonstrations, musical performances and a fitness competition on the National Mall.\n\nThe late afternoon parade would be followed by a parachute jump by the Golden Knights, a concert and the fireworks. The planning documents also suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.\n\nAccording to the plans, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThat plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs — with one estimate of a $92 million price tag — and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.\n\nTrump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – On Friday, the Army confirmed that a military parade is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Army&#8217;s 250th Anniversary Parade Scheduled on Same Day as Trump&#8217;s Birthday first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/armys-250th-anniversary-parade-scheduled-on-same-day-as-trumps-birthday/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Military-parade-to-celebrate-the-Army039s-250th-anniversary-will-be.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:28:36","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":317280970,"title":"All Living Former Weather Service Directors Oppose Trump Staff Cuts","text":"The five former directors of the National Weather Service (NWS) over the past 37 years released an open letter Friday expressing their alarm at the Trump administration's deep staff cuts to the service and the agency that houses it, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\"We know firsthand what it takes to make accurate forecasts happen and we stand united against the loss of staff and resources at NWS and are deeply concerned about NOAA as a whole,\" the former NWS directors wrote. \"Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life.\"The former NWS directors include three doctorate-level scientists, two retired Air Force brigadier generals and a retired Air Force colonel. They served as NWS directors under six presidents, three Democratic and three Republican. Their joint letter marks the first time all of them have come together to issue a public appeal.President Donald Trump's administration and the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk have eliminated hundreds of positions from NWS and NOAA by firing recently hired staff and offering buyouts to workers with longer tenure. The proposed budget released by the White House on Friday would reduce NOAA staff by nearly 30 percent, according to the former NWS directors.\"All of a sudden we find ourselves with an organization that looks like Swiss cheese, there's holes throughout it,\" former NWS director and letter co-author E.W. \"Joe\" Friday told Newsweek.Friday said the loss of electronic technicians and personnel to launch weather balloons has already started to degrade forecast capability and the ability to function in emergencies.Friday also emphasized the highly integrated nature of work that happens across NOAA and said that the NWS forecasting depends on work performed by other NOAA programs that also face cuts.Advances made by NOAA researchers allowed for dramatic improvements in tornado warning time, he said, greatly expanding the number of tornadoes detected and adding valuable time for people in their path to prepare.NOAA offices operate the system of satellites and ocean buoys that provide critical data, he said, and the National Climatic Data Center houses long-term climate information that supports weather models.\"That database is obviously a crown jewel,\" Friday said. \"Unfortunately, the administration is considering eliminating it because it has the word 'climate' in it.\"Friday served as NWS director from 1988 to 1997 under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and he described himself as a lifelong conservative. He said previous reductions in NOAA staff, like reforms to the agency that took place in the 1990s, were done in a way meant to minimize disruption to the public service. Now, however, he said he thinks the opposite is happening.\"If I were a cynic, I would suspect that the administration is deliberately doing this to make the organization work poorly, so that people would no longer support it and no longer be interested in whether or not the taxpayer funded it,\" he said.The other former NWS directors who cowrote the letter are Louis Uccellini, retired Air Force Colonel Jack Hayes, and retired Air Force Brigadier Generals D.L. Johnson and John J. Kelly Jr.They concluded their letter with recognition of the public servants employed at NOAA, and they recounted times staff had stayed at their stations during hurricanes and tornadoes even when the extreme weather affected their own homes and families.\"They aren't nameless, faceless bureaucrats,\" the former directors wrote. \"They are the everyday heroes that often go unsung.\"","summary":"Five former Weather Service directors who served under presidents of both parties said their \"worst nightmare\" is that staff cuts could lead to loss of life.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/all-living-former-weather-service-directors-oppose-trump-staff-cuts-2067576","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638027/national-hurricane-center-weather-service-noaa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:28:24","author":"Jeff Young","authors":["Jeff Young"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":317278640,"title":"Australians vote in election, with high prices and housing shortage major issues","text":"MELBOURNE, Australia — Polls opened in Australia's general election on Saturday with high costs of living and a shortage of housing major issues in the campaign.\n\nVoting across the nation the size of three times zones spanning two hours will continue from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. in eastern Australia. The polls open and close two hours later on the West Coast. Authorities said 8.6 million ballots from Australia's 18.1 million registered voters had already been cast, but not counted, before Saturday since early and postal voting began on April 22.\n\nAustralia is among the few countries where voting is compulsory, a system that leans toward creating centrist governments. At the last election in 2022, 90% of eligible voters cast ballots.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term.\n\nHis opponent, conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, wants to become the first political leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression.\n\nThe election is taking place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis.\n\nSoaring prices are a big headache\n\nAnnual inflation peaked at 7.8% a year after Labor was elected in 2022. The central bank's benchmark interest rate rose from a record low 0.1% to 0.35% two weeks before the government changed. The rate has been raised a dozen times since then, peaking at 4.35% in November 2023.\n\nThe central bank reduced the inflation rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank's next board meeting on May 20 due to international economic uncertainty generated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.\n\nHousing prices and rents have also soared as builders have gone broke because of inflation absorbing profit margins.\n\nCould the election produce a minority government?\n\nGoing into the election, Labor held a narrow majority of 78 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties form governments. There will be 150 seats in the next parliament due to redistributions.\n\nDutton's conservative alliance of parties known as the Liberal-National Coalition held 53 seats in the last parliament, and a record-high 19 lawmakers were not aligned to either the government or the opposition.\n\nMonash University political scientist Zareh Ghazarian said the major parties were gaining a smaller proportion of the votes at each election in recent decades, which was benefitting independent candidates and those representing minor partes.\n\nIf the trend of votes shifting away from major parties that was evident at the 2022 election continued at Saturday's election, the result could be a rare minority government.\n\nThere was a minority government during World War II and the next was during a three-year term after the 2010 election.\n\n\"This election's going to be a real test of whether what we saw in 2022 is a sign of things to come, or whether the '22 election was just a one-off flash in the pan,\" Ghazarian said.\n\nParty leaders usually concede defeat and claim victory on election day. But in the last minority government, key independent lawmakers announced they would support a Labor administration 17 days after the polls closed.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nBoth campaigns have focused on Australia's changing demographics. The election is the first in Australia in which Baby Boomers, born between born between the end of World War II and 1964, are outnumbered by younger voters.\n\nBoth campaigns promised policies to help first-home buyers buy into a property market that is too expensive for many.\n\nA major point of difference is energy. The opposition has promised to build seven government-funded nuclear power plants across Australia that would begin generating electricity from 2035.\n\nGas-fired electricity would fill the gap between aging coal-fired plants closing and nuclear generators taking their place.\n\nLabor plans to have 82% of Australia's energy grid powered by renewables including solar and wind turbines by 2030 and to rely less on gas.\n\nWikiLeaks founder endorses Albanese\n\nOn the eve of the election, Albanese received the endorsement of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said the Labor leader \"did more to secure my freedom than any other politician or public figure,\" including the late Pope Francis.\n\nThe remarks, posted to the social platform X by Assange's brother Gabriel Shipton, were his first on Australian domestic matters since he was released from a British prison last June and returned to his homeland after a plea deal that ended U.S. prosecutors' attempts to extradite him for publishing military secrets.\n\nAlbanese \"stood up to\" the U.S. over the case, Assange said, and his government had \"proven itself unusually capable of rescuing Australians caught up in sensitive political situations.\"\n\nThe endorsement was unusual from Assange, who has been scathing about Australian politicians before. Albanese Friday night downplayed the endorsement, saying it was \"a matter for Mr. Assange\" and that it was \"a good thing\" the WikiLeaks founder was now able to be with his family.","summary":"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor Party is seeking a second term.

Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power — and the credibility of our commitments — are appropriately resourced.\"\n\nNASA moon program slashed, but focus still on Mars\n\nThe proposal seeks to axe key parts of NASA's moon program with a $US6 billion cut for the space agency's 2026 budget, but provides a boost to the Mars-focused agenda pushed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe plan cancels NASA's over-budget Space Launch System, a gigantic rocket built by Boeing and Northrop Grumman, and its Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule after their third mission in 2027 under the agency's Artemis program.\n\nCutting 24 per cent of NASA's current $US24.8 billion budget, the proposal also threatens to cancel major science programs affecting thousands of researchers worldwide. \n\nIt would also up-end active contracts defended for years in Washington by an array of established NASA contractors and overturn missions and programs in which US allies play key roles, such as the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.\n\nNearly all parts of NASA face deep cuts except for its human exploration portfolio, in which the administration proposed a $US1 billion boost for \"Mars-focused programs.\" \n\nThis portends a major revision to the Artemis effort that leans toward SpaceX CEO Musk's vision to send humans to the Red Planet, amid a US push to first return humans to the moon before Chinese astronauts get there in 2030\n\nA White House budget summary called SLS and Orion \"grossly expensive\" projects that have far exceeded their budgets. Critics called the cuts, including a 47 per cent cut to NASA's science budget, \"a historic step backward\" for the country's space efforts.\n\nPlanned downsizing of US spy agencies\n\nThe Trump administration's budget proposal plans significant personnel cuts at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other major US spy units, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe CIA plans to cut 1,200 positions, along with thousands more from other parts of the US intelligence community, the newspaper reported.\n\nThose proposed cuts come a day after the CIA distributed two Chinese-language videos aimed at enticing officials in China to leak sensitive information to the US, in the latest public-facing effort by American government agents to increase the gathering of information on Beijing.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies said in March that China remained the top military and cyber threat to the US, noting that China had the ability to hit the United States with conventional weapons, compromise US infrastructure through cyber attacks and target its assets in space.\n\nMore cuts coming to transport safety body\n\nThe White House plans to cut funding for the US Transportation Security Administration by $US247 million, while boosting spending on rail and air safety.\n\nThe budget proposal seeks another $US360 million for the Federal Aviation Administration to support air traffic controller hiring and salary increases and updates to its outdated telecommunications systems, and $US400 million in new rail safety and infrastructure.\n\nIt also calls for cutting funding by $US308 million for Essential Air Service, which subsidies commercial air service to rural airports.\n\nA persistent shortage of controllers has delayed flights, and many controllers are working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks. The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels.\n\nIn its proposal to cut TSA officer levels, the White House said: \"TSA has consistently failed audits while implementing intrusive screening measures that violate Americans' privacy and dignity.\"\n\nBig contributions to development fund for world's poorest countries\n\nDespite all of the domestic cuts to government departments planned by President Trump, his budget proposal plans to ask Congress to approve $US3.2 billion in contributions to the World Bank's International Development Association — which provides low- or zero-interest loans to the world's poorest countries.\n\nInternational finance experts hailed the sum, to be paid over three years, as a welcome surprise, given recent worries that Mr Trump could skip making any contribution to IDA.\n\nThe new funding will help the World Bank get close to its goal of raising $US100 billion for IDA by leveraging countries' contributions.\n\nThe budget proposal, however, also cuts foreign aid by $US49 billion, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget told reporters.","summary":"US President Donald Trump wants to decrease governmental spending by almost 23 per cent amid a sweeping restructure of domestic priorities, but will seek approval for a boost to defence.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-03/donald-trump-budget-proposal-plans-billions-in-domestic-cuts/105246982","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ded3647076eb5e124df76b3b5fdd90c7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2807&cropW=4991&xPos=0&yPos=126&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:19:19","author":"Luke Cooper","authors":["Luke Cooper"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":317277500,"title":"Wall Street has been ‘underestimating’ the strength of the economy: John Carney","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Markets May 02, 2025 05:06 \n\n Wall Street has been ‘underestimating’ the strength of the economy: John Carney \n Breitbart economic and finance editor John Carney discusses the April jobs report and President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags MARKETSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESWHITE HOUSETRANSPORTATION","summary":"Breitbart economic and finance editor John Carney discusses the April jobs report and President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6372246658112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/8991797e-f27c-4500-8e06-9764861d7b29/43d41fa4-ddda-45b5-b77c-2cb91adb2219/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 23:18:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.218},{"id":317279412,"title":"US Approves Potential $3.5 Billion Missile Sale To Saudi Arabia Ahead Of Trump’s Visit","text":"US Saudi Arabia Missile Deal: The United States State Department has approved a potential foreign military sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, involving AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and related support, the Pentagon announced in a statement released Friday.\nThe proposed sale, valued at an estimated $3.5 billion, includes 1,000 AMRAAMs, 50 AMRAAM guidance sections, missile containers, spares, and a range of logistical and support services.
