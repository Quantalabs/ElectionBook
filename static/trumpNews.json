The Ivy League school's federal money came from the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA used a sport-by-sport approach to allowing transgender athletes to participate, deferring to an individual sport's national governing organization, international federation or prior established International Olympic Committee criteria.\n\nThomas competed under those guidelines, which allowed female transgender swimmers who had completed one year of hormone replacement therapy to compete.\n\nThe NCAA changed its policy the day after Trump signed an executive order on Feb. 5 that was intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls and women's sports. That ended its sport-by-sport practice in favor of a blanket policy that only allows athletes assigned female at birth to participate in women's sports.\n\nThe Education Department also opened reviews of San Jose State University volleyball, Denver Public Schools, Portland Public Schools, Oregon School Activities Association and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.\n\nIt also sued the state of Maine to force it to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports or face prosecution.\n\nRepublicansLia Thomas\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump gives Penn ultimatum to wipe trans swimmer Lia Thomas from women's record books and apologize\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump is giving the University of Pennsylvania 10 days to make amends for a 2022 decision allowing a transgender swimmer to complete on the school's women's team and use team facilities.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14657813/Donald-Trump-Penn-trans-swimmer-Lia-Thomas.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/29/01/97804325-0-image-m-20_1745887383302.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 01:01:03","author":"Alex Raskin,Associated,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Associated","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.253},{"id":315821968,"title":"Charlamagne tells Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer to 'cut it out' over hypocritical oligarchy concerns","text":"Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. \"I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy,\" Charlamagne said on \"The Breakfast Club\" Monday. \"Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors.\" \"So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?\" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. \"I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack,\" Charlamagne joked. \"So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\" He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer \"Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate,\" and said that he was \"even less inspiring.\" Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be \"thrown out of office.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE On Sunday, Jeffries, along with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

I wanted the Liberals to go, but in the end, I'll vote for Carney because he is a strong, serious man and that's what the country needs to face Trump,\" the 28-year-old engineer told AFP.\n\nIn Canada's largest city Toronto, Conservative supporter Chad McCann said the Liberals \"hadn't really done much for us\" over their decade in power.\n\n\"I think for a strong change, there is no better time than today,\" the 37-year-old told AFP. \n\nFor first-time voter Hilary Recker, getting to the polls was a priority. \n\n\"I'm just excited to vote,\" the 19-year-old Toronto resident said. \n\n\"Hopefully it doesn't end up like the (United) States and I don't get disappointed.\"\n\nHistoric turnaround?\n\nIf the Liberals win, it would mark one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.\n\nOn January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls.\n\nBut Carney replacing Trudeau, combined with nationwide unease about Trump, transformed the race.\n\nPublic broadcaster CBC's poll aggregator's final update late Sunday put the Liberals' national support at 42.8 percent, with the Conservatives at 39.2 percent. \n\nThe performance of two smaller parties -- the left-wing New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois -- could be decisive as strong showings by both parties in past votes have curbed Liberal seat tallies.\n\nNearly 29 million of Canada's 41 million people are eligible to vote in the massive G7 country. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.\n\nCanadians will elect 343 members of parliament, meaning 172 seats are needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.","summary":"Polling stations across the Canada spans six time zones have started to close, with results from smaller eastern provinces trickling in","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/canada-election-results-vote-counting-poilievre-carney-april-29-2025/article69503684.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/cwlei3/article69503685.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Canada_Election_49438.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:57:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.066},{"id":315820958,"title":"Canadians head to the polls amid new Trump annexation bid","text":"Canadians on Monday cast their votes for their new Prime Minister, who, after Justin Trudeau's decade-long rule, will be tasked with tackling soaring costs and housing shortages at home, along with Donald Trump's trade war and renewed push for the US to annex its resource-rich neighbour.\n\nVotes were being counted Monday in a Canadian election that will choose a leader to confront Donald Trump's trade war and annexation threats, which the US president renewed in an election day message.\n\nThe Liberal Party, led by new Prime Minister Mark Carney, was trailing Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives until Trump's attacks on Canada sparked a wave of patriotism and a sudden reversal in poll forecasts.\n\nTrump inserted himself into Canadian politics again on election day with a social media post saying Canada would face \"ZERO TARIFFS\" if it \"becomes the cherished 51st state.\"\n\nPoilievre, criticized during the campaign for his at-times muted anger towards Trump, hit back firmly.\n\n\"President Trump, stay out of our election,\" he posted on X. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.\"\n\nCarney also weighed in, saying on X: \"This is Canada and we decide what happens here.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old has never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month.\n\n\"Today, we leave everything on this ice,\" he said on social media before voting near his Ottawa home.\n\nRead more on FRANCE 24 EnglishRead also:Trump overshadows final day of Canada's federal election raceCanadian PM Mark Carney calls snap elections amid Trump threats","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/canadians-head-polls-amid-trump-005545366.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/france_24_english_articles_100/7cb35f0512da7604b728f2fb76dc89da","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:55:45","author":"France 24","authors":["France 24"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":315820368,"title":"Dame Helen Mirren, 79, urges people in midlife not to 'fear' ageing as she encourages them to embrace exercise as part of new campaign","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Net Zero to blame for Spain blackout chaos?

Many will start to be treated differently, which can not only be very upsetting but also unfair.' \n'Everybody, regardless of their age, should feel included and valued and that is what Age UK is striving to achieve.'\nShe concluded with: 'This is an ambitious but truly important challenge, as things need to change and it’s in all our interests to ensure that older people are respected and treated as the individuals that they are.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDame Helen Mirren, 79, urges people in midlife not to 'fear' ageing as she encourages them to embrace exercise as part of new campaign\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The first results are coming in. Voters can still cast their ballot if they are in line when polls close.\n\n A record 7.3 million people had already cast their ballots in advance polls before election day, according to Elections Canada. Canada has 28.9 million eligible voters.\n\n Donald Trump threatened Canada’s independent sovereignty on the eve of the election, describing the border between the two nations as an “artificially drawn line from many years ago”. In a Truth Social post, the US president urged Canada to become the 51st state of the US, claiming it would bring tax cuts, and increased military power.\n\n Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre responded to Trump’s threat by urging him to “stay out of our election”. “Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state,” the Conservative leader posted on X.\n\n Liberal leader Mark Carney, also in an apparent reference to Trump, said “this is Canada – and we decide what happens here.” In a video posted on X, the Liberal leader referred to a “crisis” in the US and reminded voters of the threat to Canada’s economy posed by Trump’s tariffs.\n\n Election day falls on a day of mourning after 11 people were killed and dozens of others injured when a driver ploughed a car into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver on Saturday evening.\nKey events49m agoFollow our election tracker1h agoSummary of the day so far2h agoFirst polls close2h agoHow Trump dampened Quebec separatist movement – for now3h agoWhat do the polls say?4h agoOttawa voters head to polling stations after months of political turbulence6h agoWhat have the key players promised?7h agoWho are the main candidates?7h agoHow does Canada's federal election system work?9h agoSummary of the day so far11h agoConservative Pierre Poilievre tells Trump 'stay out of our election'12h agoElection sees record high early voting12h agoTrump urges Canadians to make their country the 51st state of the US in election intervention14h agoCanadians head to polls in election upturned by Trump14h agoWelcome and opening summary …MP Wayne Long, who was the first Liberal to call for Justin Trudeau to resign as leader last year, says Mark Carney has been “the difference maker” as CBC declared he had held onto his riding of Saint John-Kennebecasis in New Brunswick with 61.5% of the vote.Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and of England, was a “great blood pressure lowerer” Long told the national broadcaster, adding “I heard it at door after door”.He mentions the tariffs which were imposed on Canada by Donald Trump as also being extremely influential at the ballot box – Saint John was listed by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce as being the most vulnerable to their impacts.A few minutes ago CBC declared its first flip of the evening, as the Conservatives took the riding of Long Range Mountains in Newfoundland and Labrador from the Liberals.Conservative Carol Anstey took the seat with 53%of the vote, while Don Bradshaw of the Liberals trailed on just 39%. Liberal MP Gudie Hutchings had won the seat in 2021 with 44%.Here’s a snapshot of what voters are thinking, courtesy of AFP:\n With warm spring weather, Canadians lined up outside schools, community centers and other venues in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto to cast ballots.\n Montreal resident Hamza Fahri, who planned to vote after work, described the election as “unique.”\n “I wanted to vote for change in Canada. I wanted the Liberals to go, but in the end, I’ll vote for Carney because he is a strong, serious man and that’s what the country needs to face Trump,” the 28-year-old engineer told AFP.\n In Canada’s largest city Toronto, Conservative supporter Chad McCann said the Liberals “hadn’t really done much for us” over their decade in power.\n “I think for a strong change, there is no better time than today,” the 37-year-old told AFP.\n For first-time voter Hilary Recker, getting to the polls was a priority.\n “I’m just excited to vote,” the 19-year-old Toronto resident said.\n\n “Hopefully it doesn’t end up like the (United) States and I don’t get disappointed.”\nPeople line up outside a polling station to vote in Toronto. Photograph: Arlyn McAdorey/ReutersCBC’s decision desk has called another five seats. Canada’s national broadcaster declared that the Liberals had held the ridings of Avalon, Acadie-Bathurst, Cape Spear and Beauséjour while the Conservatives have held the seat of Central Newfoundland.MP Clifford Small, a Conservative who first won Central Newfoundland in 2021 and won 60% of the vote this time round, told the broadcaster he expected the Conservatives to double their seat count and said the “blue wave had started”.The Elections Canada website appears to be unavailable right now.The Toronto Star reports that it has confirmed technical problems and that official results being used by news websites via a back-end process are still operational.The agency responsible for administering the country’s elections says it is working to restore full access as soon as possible.At 8.15pm in Ottawa just over 11% of the vote has been counted and we have the Liberals leading – not officially elected – with a projected 14 seats in the House of Commons and the Conservatives on 11.You can follow all the latest results on our election tracker here.CBC has declared its first winner of the evening, with Philip Earle of the Liberals winning the riding of Labrador in the east of the country with almost 62% of the vote.His nearest rival, Ella Wallace of the Conservatives, won just 31%.This is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong.Polls are beginning to close in Canada as voters nationwide headed to the polls to decide whether to extend the Liberal party’s decade in power or hand control to the Conservative party.Here’s a recap of the latest developments:\n\n Polls have now closed in Newfoundland, Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

In a Truth Social post, the US president urged Canada to become the 51st state of the US, claiming it would bring tax cuts, and increased military power.\n\n Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre responded to Trump’s threat by urging him to “stay out of our election”. “Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state,” the Conservative leader posted on X.\n\n Liberal leader Mark Carney, also in an apparent reference to Trump, said “this is Canada – and we decide what happens here.” In a video posted on X, the Liberal leader referred to a “crisis” in the US and reminded voters of the threat to Canada’s economy posed by Trump’s tariffs.\n\n Election day falls on a day of mourning after 11 people were killed and dozens of others injured when a driver ploughed a car into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver on Saturday evening.\nThe polls have now closed in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.Prime minister and Liberal party leader Mark Carney is reminding voters that they can still cast their ballot if they are in line when polls close.“Your vote matters,” Carney writes in a post on X.People wait in line to register to vote at a polling station for Canada's federal election, in Toronto, Ontario.

For weeks, the separatist party in Canada’s Francophone province had been campaigning hard to steal an electoral district in Montreal long held by the Liberals.When the trickle of votes finally stopped on that September evening, the Bloc’s Louis-Philippe Sauvé had emerged victorious by a narrow margin of 200 votes.Chastened by the loss, the then prime minister, Justin Trudeau, admitted his Liberals had “a lot of work to do”. The defeat reflected a governing party in tatters and a leader losing his grip on power. And to party faithful, the Bloc’s win reflected an excitement that the separatist movement was once again in ascendance.Six months later, the heady days of the Bloc’s growing popularity are over. Donald Trump’s effort to trash his country’s relationship with Canada has led to a dramatic realigning of allegiances, with a swell in Canadian pride washing over regional differences.How Trump’s Canada threats dampened Quebec separatist movement – for nowRead moreUntil February, the Conservatives enjoyed a 25 point lead over the Liberals.Pollsters gave the Tories a 99% chance of winning if an election were called at the time with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in decades.But Donald Trump’s aggressive posture towards Canada has scrambled the stakes of the election: the Conservative’s dominant lead has disappeared and now they find themselves trailing in the twilight of the campaign.Of the 12 polling firms in Canada surveying voters, all of them show the Liberals leading to the extent that a majority government is the most likely outcome.The math looks even more dire for the Conservatives, with the Liberals enjoying a domain lead in the most vote-rich parts of the country.Only one Canadian adult is legally barred from voting from today’s federal election: Stéphane Perrault, the country’s chief electoral officer and the head of Elections Canada.According to Elections Canada:\n The Chief Electoral Officer is responsible for the administration of elections, referendums and other important aspects of our electoral system.\nPerrault was appointed to the post in 2018.Canada’s former prime minister Jean Chrétien has predicted the Liberals will win a majority government after polls close tonight.Chrétien, 91, said he expects “to celebrate the majority government of the Liberal party” during a rally for Ottawa Centre Liberal incumbent Yasir Naqvi, the Canadian Press reported.“Monday is going to be a Liberal sunshine,” he said, drawing cheers.Chrétien led three majority Liberal governments between 1993 and 2003 and has campaigned for the party in dozens of 30 electoral districts across the country as the party seeks to match – or even eclipse – his 1993 landslide victory.The nation’s capital has braved more political turbulence than most can recall in decades with internecine feuds, threats to Canadian sovereignty and political resurrections.But perhaps more devastating for residents of Ottawa has been the cruelty of a drawn out winter, with spring snow squalls and persistently grey skies.And so even on the day of what party leaders have billed as the most important election in a generation, many voters in Ottawa seemed more excited by the weather.On a disconcertingly pleasant spring day that has many celebrating the return of the sun, Liberal leader Mark Carney cast his ballot in the Ottawa neighbourhood where he’s lived for the last 10 years, walking past sprouting daffodils and cautiously flowering trees to a nearby polling station with his family.Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, also cast his ballot in Ottawa with his family, where he looks to defend the electoral district he’s held for the last seven terms.But, in protest of the country’s “first past the post” electoral system, activists have added 90 names to the ballot- making the ballot more than a metre long and creating headaches for Elections Canada and the scrutineers.Vote-rich Ontario and neighbouring Quebec promise to be battlegrounds where both parties are looking to either confirm – or rebut – polling that has the Liberals favoured to emerge victorious.Election day in Canada falls on a day of mourning after 11 people were killed and dozens of others injured when a driver ploughed a car into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver on Saturday evening.The festival, known as Lapu-Lapu Day, is also widely celebrated in the Philippines and honors Datu Lapu-Lapu, the Filipino chieftain who famously defeated Spanish forces in 1521.Many across Canada have set aside time today not only to vote, but to mourn and visit makeshift memorials in honor of the victims.Mourners leaves flowers at a memorial site for the victims of an incident where a car drove through a crowd killing multiple people in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Photograph: Andrew Chin/Getty ImagesThe Public and Private Workers of Canada (PPWC), a trade union based in British Columbia, urged people to “get out and vote” as it says the rights of Canadian workers are “under threat”.“Big corporations and wealthy elites are working harder than ever to influence policy in their favour, often at the expense of working families,” the statement says. “If we stay silent, we risk losing the gains we fought so hard to achieve. If we act, we can elect leaders who will invest in social services and good paying jobs, strengthen labour laws, tackle the climate crisis, and ensure dignity for every worker.“The stakes are too high for any of us to sit this election out.”Prime minister Mark Carney is posting hockey-themed campaign videos on social media, including using the phrase “Elbows up”, a hockey reference describing players using their his elbows to defend themselves and now used to as a pro-Canada sovereignty slogan, as well as a post saying: “Today, we leave everything on the ice.”He also included a video featuring actor Mike Myers in an ice hockey rink.‘Elbows Up!’ Mike Myers and PM Mark Carney’s message to Canada and Trump.

Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. \n\n“In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight. She will be missed beyond measure.”\n\nBut in a bombshell interview with British newspaper The Sun, Ms Louden said she found the explanation surprising.\n\n“When I got the phone call, I was like, are you joking? Because there was no sign that was something she was considering,” Ms Louden said.\n\n“We’ve got big question marks over it.”\n\nIn late March, Ms Giuffre shared an image of her heavily bruised face to social media, saying she’d had a head-on collision with a bus and suffered severe injuries, including renal failure.\n\nShe wrote: “This year has been the worst start to a new year … when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110kmh as we were slowing down for a turn, that no matter what your car is made of, it might as well be a tin can.”\n\nShe said doctors had given her days to live, sparking global news headlines.\n\nShock turned to confusion when Ms Giuffre was later released from hospital and police said they had only received a report a day after the crash and that it was deemed minor with no injuries.\n\nSwirling questions about the collision and her condition went unresolved.\n\nMs Giuffre was still recovering a month on, Ms Louden told The Sun.\n\n“She was in a lot of pain but she was looking forward to things in the future,” she said. “She wanted to renovate [her] house and all sorts of things like that.\n\n“The family said what the family has said, but I’m not going to speculate whether it was suicide or accidental.\n\n“There’s suicide and then there’s misadventure.”\n\nFor several years, Ms Giuffre has alleged one of the men Epstein and Maxwell trafficked to her to was Prince Andrew – a claim he has strenuously denied.\n\nShe alleged she was forced to have sex with him on several occasions in London, New York and on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean when she was 17.\n\nIn 2022, the controversial royal paid to settle a civil suit brought by Ms Giuffre to the tune of £12 million (AU$25 million), according to UK reports at the time.\n\nAs part of the settlement, which did not include any admission of liability or truth, Prince Andrew committed to demonstrating “his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting victims”.\n\nHe has yet to honour that commitment.\n\nEpstein died in prison while awaiting trial in 2019, in what was ruled a suicide. Maxwell was tried and sentenced for sex trafficking and conspiracy and jailed for 20 years.\n\nAs indicated in Ms Giuffre’s post about the bus crash, it had been a challenging few months for the mother of three.\n\nShe and her husband of two decades Robert separated in mid-2023. In February, he accused her of breaching a family violence restraining order.\n\nThe matter was heard in court in April but adjourned until June 11.\n\nFollowing her death, Ms Giuffre’s final social media posts were unearthed, including a link to the haunting Gotye song ‘Somebody That I Used To Know’ and a black screen with broken heart emoijis.\n\nDespite the emphatic statement from her family, conspiracy theorists – including prominent allies of US President Donald Trump – quickly spread a host of wild theories.\n\nLaura Loomer, an influential confidant of Mr Trump, took to X and wrote: “I don’t believe Virginia Giuffre committed suicide. Just like I don’t believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. First she gets in a car crash, now they say she killed herself? Sounds like someone wanted her dead.”\n\nRepublican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene further fanned the flames by posting on Instagram that “the truth needs to come out – no matter who is responsible”.\n\nIn recent, an eerie 2019 post by Ms Giuffre has resurfaced and gone viral, in which she wrote that “in no way, shape or form am I suicidal”.\n\n“I have made this known to my therapist and GP. If something happens to me … [for] the sake of my family do not let this go away and help me to protect them. Too many evil people want to see me quiteted (sic).”","summary":"The barrister representing Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre has sensationally cast doubt on the trafficking survivor’s cause of death.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/virginia-giuffres-lawyer-makes-bombshell-claim-about-her-shock-death/news-story/b73aa2adc96ddd6d97040453af1c8835?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1b57552277c9542a949346d6fc00a5be","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:48:38","author":"Copy Link","authors":["Copy Link"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":315818218,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: April 29, 2025","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nTOKYO - Japan is considering allowing more imported cars to qualify for a simplified safety and environmental screening process in a bid to win concessions in tariff negotiations with the United States, sources close to the matter said Monday.\n\nThe idea to enhance Japan's Preferential Handling Procedure, a system applied to imported vehicles sold in small quantities in the country, may be discussed along with a proposal to increase U.S. farm imports during the second round of tariff negotiations with the United States planned in the coming days.\n\nNEW YORK - Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya on Monday called for \"dialogue and collaboration\" to advance nuclear disarmament toward a key U.N. conference next year, highlighting efforts by an atomic bomb survivors' group that received the Nobel Peace Prize for conveying the horrors of the destructive weapons.\n\n\"The cry that the tragedies of nuclear weapons must never be repeated and the call for achieving a 'world without nuclear weapons' are now louder than ever,\" Iwaya said in a speech in New York at a preparatory committee meeting for the 2026 review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nTOKYO - International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and U.S. Sen.

The results coming in from Newfoundland and Labrador, where polling stations closed at 7 p.m. ET, are providing early insight into the mood of the electorate. Polls also closed at 7:30 p.m. ET in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\nDespite the initial returns, polls remain open across much of the rest of the country, including in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia—key battlegrounds that will be crucial in determining the final outcome of the election.\nCanada Election 2025: A Remarkable 36-Day Campaign\nThe 36-day campaign leading up to this moment has been extraordinary, with intense competition between the two leading candidates: Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.\nJust a few months prior to the election, public opinion polls had strongly favored Poilievre, suggesting that the Conservative leader was on the verge of securing a long-awaited majority government. This was largely driven by a growing dissatisfaction among Canadians with former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nHowever, a dramatic series of events in early January significantly shifted the dynamics of the race. Trudeau's unexpected resignation, combined with U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade tactics, including the imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods, threw a wrench in the political landscape. Trump's repeated remarks about potentially making Canada the 51st state added further fuel to the fire, reshaping the election's focus.\nCanada Election 2025: A Campaign Shaped by Global Uncertainty\nAs a result, the election campaign increasingly became a referendum on which leader is best suited to navigate the global uncertainty created by Trump's trade war and his unpredictable policies. Both Carney and Poilievre have faced tough questions about how they would handle the increasingly tense relationship with the United States.\n\"With the escalating tensions surrounding the trade war, it’s more crucial than ever to have a leader who understands the complexities of global economics and international relations,\" Carney remarked during a campaign event.\nPoilievre, on the other hand, has capitalized on Canada's frustrations with Trump’s tariffs and trade restrictions. \"Canada needs a leader who will stand up to foreign powers and protect our interests on the world stage,\" Poilievre asserted in a recent rally.\nPolls Narrow, but Liberals Remain Favored\nDespite the tightening race in the final stretch of the campaign, polls indicate that the Liberal Party still holds a narrow edge in key regions such as Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and the Atlantic provinces. According to CBC’s Poll Tracker, the Liberals are expected to win the most seats when all the votes are counted.\nHowever, as both Carney and Poilievre have emphasized throughout the campaign, the only poll that truly matters is the one on election day. With the nation’s political fate still hanging in the balance, the results from the Atlantic provinces provide only a small glimpse of what’s to come in the hours ahead.\nAlso Read: When Will Canada Election 2025 Results Be Announced?

Still hurts, though,\" Ivanka replied to an X post from Barkley, which featured a picture of the three of them together. Barkley was with many of his teammates, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, general manager Howie Roseman and head coach Nick Siriani, among others, at the White House on Monday. Trump praised Barkley’s abilities to help the Eagles lift the Lombardi Trophy at the end of their season, especially his backward leap over a Jacksonville Jaguars defender during the regular season. Barkley, though, had to defend his time with Trump prior to the celebration, as they were spotted at the 47th president’s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. \"lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,\" Barkley tweeted on Monday. \"Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand.

Marco Rubio (R-FL), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump has continued to suggest tariffs could substantially reduce or take the place of income taxes. This time he has targeted Americans earning less than $200,000 per year for relief. If that sounds like political alchemy—turning economic policy lead into tax policy gold—that’s because it is.\n\nTariffs Are Just Taxes in Disguise\n\nSetting aside the sheer logistical impossibility of financing the federal government through tariffs alone, it is unclear what exactly would be achieved. Even if we assume, against all empirical evidence, that the numbers pencil out—factories immediately booming, jobs multiplying, and tariff revenue flowing—it simply means the source of government revenue would change without the amount significantly changing. Today, taxpayer checks are made out to the Internal Revenue Service—under President Trump’s vision, those checks would simply be made out to skyrocketing store shelf prices and import tariffs. Different ink, same debit from the bank account.\n\nEconomically, tariffs function as a consumption tax. They raise the cost of imported goods and, in so doing, increases prices for consumers. This disproportionately burdens lower- and middle-income Americans—precisely the voters President Trump is intending, at least rhetorically, to help. Tariffs are taxes, just hidden in the checkout line instead of being spelled out on a W-2.\n\nDifferent Bill Collector, Same Bill\n\nThere is little to gain here save for symbolism. President Trump appears to believe that Americans dislike the act of paying taxes more than they are struggling with the cost of living. By shifting the burden invisibly into everyday transactions, perhaps the logic goes, the tangible pain of an April 15th tax bill is disaggregated into a series of small, deniable pains and externalizable pains at the grocery store. Out of sight, out of mind—or so the political calculation appears to go.\n\nHistory, however, offers a warning. In the late 19th century, the US government was indeed funded primarily through tariffs—exactly the economic system President Trump appears to intend to recreate. It was an era marked by economic inequality, crony capitalism, and periodic economic depressions. The income tax, first temporarily introduced by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and later permanently established with the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, arose precisely because tariffs were seen as both regressive and economically unstable.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft Confirms $1.50 Windows Security Update Hotpatch Fee Starts July 1\n\n‘It’s Imminent’—U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock\n\nGoogle’s Gmail Upgrade—Why You Need To Change Your App\n\nPerhaps more to the point, from a revenue standpoint, tariffs are relatively unreliable. A modern economy as large and complex as America’s likely cannot be funded through border taxes alone—and relying on them places the ability for the government to raise revenue squarely in the hands of the very same foreign powers the tariffs are intended to punish.\n\nEven if the White House slapped tariffs on every imported good—and Americans paid them without cutting consumption and exporting countries continued shipping goods without abatement—it would still fall hundreds of billions short of what’s needed to finance Social Security, defense, Medicare, and everything else Washington funds.\n\nTrump’s vision risks recreating the problems that prompted the income tax’s creation in the first place—like the world’s least clamored-for sequel to Groundhog Day. Meanwhile, the so-called “external revenue service” that would oversee these tariffs would in fact be external only in geographical terms, not in cost. Whether the government takes its cut from your paycheck or your grocery bill, you are still footing the bill.\n\nTrump’s Tax Swap Is All Pain, No Gain\n\nThere is a deeper political message here. It is better to have Americans grumbling about high prices at Target than to organize against the IRS directly or, even worse, demand tax policy changes and for the rich to pay their fair share. It’s a clever sleight of hand, but one that fails to address the root concern: Americans are angry about the cost of living, not the particular shape their taxes take.\n\nIn short, even if Trump’s income tax cut funded by tariffs could work—and it cannot—it wouldn’t solve any of the problems it claims to address. It would merely rearrange the scenery on an economic stage whose production costs are unavoidable.\n\nA serious and policy-driven tax reform conversation would focus not just on how taxes are paid, but who is paying them—or, more importantly, who is not paying them. Until then, replacing a direct tax with an invisible one only makes accountability harder and does little to make prosperity easier.\n\nWhether your dollars are siphoned off by tariffs, taxes, tolls, or fees, the government gets paid—the only real question is whether you notice when it happens.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The list includes plans to advance remediation and cleanup efforts for PFAS in drinking water, ramp up research and testing and designate an agency lead to oversee it all. The announcement does not name the person who will oversee this work, a timeline for action or a number of other specifics.\n\nThe announcement also fails to mention last year’s landmark EPA standard on PFAS in drinking water, which the chemical industry and water utilities sued over. The Trump administration has until May 12 to decide whether it will continue to defend the Biden-era rule—which was accompanied by a $1 billion investment in state-level water testing and treatment—in court. EPA did not answer questions from Inside Climate News about the rule, the litigation or Monday’s announcement.\n\n“We are tackling PFAS from all of EPA’s program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and providing certainty for passive receivers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “This is just the start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water.”\n\nThis comes after President Donald Trump’s administration has already begun dismantling environmental protections across multiple agencies, including for clean air, public lands, waterways and wastewater. The administration has also eliminated future funding for climate and health research and canceled grants for research on environmental health, including millions of dollars in research on PFAS accumulation in the food chain. \n\n“Based on the prior Trump administration and based on the current Trump administration’s gutting of environmental protections across the board … I’m skeptical,” said Dana Sargent, executive director of Cape Fear River Watch in North Carolina, a group that advocates for clean water in a region heavily contaminated with PFAS and that sued the EPA over these impacts.\n\nSargent and other advocates also noted that the announcement seems to lack teeth.\n\n“There’s a lot of words in here that don’t really mean very much,” Sargent said. “The proof of their commitment would come out in any actionable regulation and polluter accountability.”\n\nLinda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and a long-time advocate for PFAS awareness, echoed this sentiment. \n\n“On face value, it’s encouraging to see the support of the Trump EPA to express their concerns about PFAS,” Birnbaum said. “The question is always, what are the devils in the details.”\n\nPFAS are toxic, long-lasting chemicals that are found in drinking water, soil, food, household products and more, and can come from everyday items like food packaging, clothing or cookware. They are called “forever chemicals” because they can take over a thousand years to break down. \n\nAlmost all Americans have PFAS in their blood, and nearly half the country is drinking PFAS-contaminated water. PFAS exposure has been linked to severe health harms like cancer, reproductive problems, low birth weight, high cholesterol, developmental issues, decreased immunity and thyroid problems. \n\nAdvocates flagged some of the word choices in the EPA’s announcement, pointing out potential openings for industry actors, who have lobbied hard against PFAS regulations.\n\nMelanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said the announcement suggests the EPA will delay compliance obligations and provide exemptions for polluters. \n\nBenesh pointed to a promise in the announcement to address “compliance challenges” for PFAS in drinking water, noting that water utilities have often asked for more time to comply with health-related rules. \n\n“One way that the EPA could say that they are addressing compliance issues, quote-unquote, is through delays, by giving those utilities additional time,” Benesh said. \n\n“If you’re going to be claiming that you need more research on PFAS while you’re defunding research on PFAS, then you’re being beyond disingenuous, you’re being dangerous.”\n— Dana Sargent, Cape Fear River Watch\n\nBirnbaum expressed similar concerns about the mention of compliance issues, as well as the EPA’s reference to reporting rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The announcement emphasized not “overburdening” small businesses and companies importing chemical substances into the U.S, which she said could signal further exemptions and delays.\n\nSargent said that the announcement’s focus on research fits into a playbook of delay tactics: Regulators say they’ll study the matter to signal productivity while failing to take tangible action to decrease pollution exposure. \n\n“If you’re going to be claiming that you need more research on PFAS while you’re defunding research on PFAS, then you’re being beyond disingenuous, you’re being dangerous,” Sargent said. \n\nDuring the first Trump administration, EPA staffers were prevented from alerting lawmakers to a loophole in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that allowed companies to avoid disclosure for some PFAS discharges, The Hill reported. \n\nEPA closed this loophole during the Biden administration, but Monday’s announcement specifically mentioned the 2020 NDAA, which Sargent said she found concerning.\n\n“That’s an improper definition of PFAS,” Sargent said. \n\nSome advocates also raised concerns about the announcement’s emphasis on protecting “passive receivers”—like water utilities—that don’t produce PFAS but receive them through contaminated water. Loosening up standards on passive receivers could pose serious health risks, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the grassroots group Clean Cape Fear and another anti-PFAS advocate.\n\n“This is just a non-starter for us,” Donovan said. “There doesn’t need to be a carveout [for passive receivers]—that’s a slippery slope.”\n\nDonovan added that advocates and others are paying close attention.\n\n“The voters that I’ve talked to … they want the drinking water standard,” Donovan said. “This is one piece that if it was taken away from Americans, it’s not about government efficiency and it’s not about protecting health, it would absolutely be about allowing billionaire corporations to keep making more profit at our expense.”","summary":"As the Environmental Protection Agency works to roll back multiple public-health protections, it announced Monday that it intends to take action to combat toxic forever chemicals.

Shari Redstone’s Big Decision","text":"That ticking noise that begins every 60 Minutes segment? Turns out that’s not a stopwatch. It’s a time bomb.\n\n At least that’s how it’s sounding lately, like the illustrious citadel of American broadcast journalism is on the brink of blowing up. Last night, in the latest shudder suggesting an imminent explosion, correspondent Scott Pelley ended the show with a “Last Minute” segment that all but declared open rebellion against 60 Minutes’ corporate overlords at Paramount and raised a fist in solidarity with longtime executive producer Bill Owens, who just days earlier had bolted CBS in protest over what he called editorial meddling by management.\n\n “No one here is happy about it,” Pelley informed viewers, perched on a stool before a backdrop of the program’s iconic ticking timepiece. “But in resigning, Bill proved one thing — he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.”\n\n What’s got everyone so worked up, of course, is the $20 billion lawsuit — that’s billion with a “b” — President Trump lobbed onto the 60 Minutes‘ set last year, claiming that the show had perpetrated “election interference” by editing a videotaped interview with Kamala Harris from its original 45 minutes to a more broadcast-friendly 21 minutes. You know, the same way 60 Minutes had, without complaint, edited Trump’s interview from 45 to 20 minutes during the 2020 campaign. The way, in fact, TV news has been editing interviews since Edward R. Murrow was cutting them on kinescope.\n\n Nobody is taking Trump’s lawsuit seriously — probably not even Trump. It has next to no chance of prevailing in court. But what is being taken seriously — especially by Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, which owns CBS, which produces 60 Minutes — is the fact that Redstone is trying to sell her company for $8 billion to Skydance Media. That deal requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which has the authority to review transfers of broadcast licenses, a necessary step for Skydance and Paramount to complete their transaction. And, of course, the FCC is now run by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, who has not-so-subtly hinted that certain complaints against 60 Minutes are “likely to arise” and that if Redstone wants the deal to go smoothly she should probably settle the $20 billion suit with the guy in the Oval Office.\n\n In other words, nice little merger you’ve got here. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n The stakes involved are obviously incredibly high — not just for 60 Minutes but for all of news broadcasting and the whole notion of a free press. This isn’t, after all, the first time Trump has strong-armed a major media outlet, not even in the last six months. Last December, he got ABC to pay him $15 million to settle an only slightly less flimsy defamation suit (this one against George Stephanopoulos, who supposedly slandered the president by referring to what Trump did to E. Jean Carroll as “rape” when technically the court had deemed it “sexual abuse”). That corporate capitulation was troubling enough. But if Redstone were now to settle the even-easier-to-beat 60 Minutes suit, it would shred the show’s long tradition of editorial integrity and send a deep, muzzling chill through all of journalism, not to mention torch Redstone’s own reputation.\n\n But, alas, it’s starting to look like that’s precisely what she’s about to do.\n\n One of the reasons Owens’ departure was so shocking was that it seemed to signal Redstone was on the verge of caving. In truth, the reasons for Owens’ exit may have been more nuanced, possibly having something to do with the return of former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky, who assumed an oversight role after 60 Minutes took heat for a segment on Israel’s war in Gaza. Still, the snowballing narrative is that Owens sacrificed himself in a desperate warning to Redstone not to sink 60 Minutes over her Skydance deal. That’s more or less how Pelley presented it at the end of 60 Minutes last night. And it was certainly how a slew of headlines played it, as well (“Woman Who Destroyed CBS News,” “60 Minutes Sacrificed for Sale,” and “Redstone Greed Ending Legacy,” among them). It was also Jake Tapper’s take during a seven-minute Redstone rant on CNN just hours after Owens announced he was quitting.\n\n “It seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle,” Tapper said with an angry frown. “Hope the money’s worth it, Shari!”\n\n Of course, Tapper’s right, the money isn’t worth it. Sure, the Skydance merger would conceivably add hundreds of millions of dollars to Redstone’s personal fortune, but she’s already likely worth half a billion if not more. There isn’t a whole lot on planet Earth that she can’t already afford. Still, Redstone’s own bank account isn’t the whole point; she’s also trying to protect the media empire her father built and that she took over just before her father Sumner Redstone died at 97 in 2020. And after years of cable-TV declines, missed streaming opportunities and less-than-blockbuster feature releases, a cash-infusing merger, particularly with another family-run firm that’s promised to keep Paramount intact, may well be the company’s best, if not only, hope for a future.\n\n Most of the other suitors circling Redstone a few years ago — Warner Bros., Sony, Barry Diller and Byron Allen, to name a few — wanted to carve up Paramount, keep what they liked and sell the rest for scrap. Skydance, though, run by billionaire Larry Ellison’s son David, was reportedly the only one to assure Redstone that Paramount would be kept whole. Whether Skydance keeps its word about that is TBD — as far as anyone knows there isn’t anything in writing — but at least, as kin themselves, the Ellisons can theoretically appreciate Redstone’s impulse to safeguard her father’s legacy. (Unless, that is, they decide they can make even more money by breaking their word).\n\n The point here is this: Redstone is trapped in a lose-lose situation. If she fights Trump on the 60 Minutes suit, it could blow up the Skydance deal, leaving her company bleeding on the floor. If she caves to Trump and settles, it could blow up 60 Minutes — the crown jewel of Paramount’s news division and one its few truly trusted global brands — leaving the company bleeding on the floor.\n\n Come to think of it, that ticking sound may not be a stopwatch or a bomb. It could be something worse: Donald Trump counting down the seconds until the free press runs out of time.","summary":"The Paramount mogul is stuck in the middle of an impossible choice.

Bossie at The Washington Times. Trump “has been laser-focused on the major structural reforms that will save our country for future generations.” He addressed “the shameful situation at our open border” and is pushing to cut “taxes and regulations” to boost the economy. “With the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration has shown fantastic initiative to get federal spending under control.” And he fortified our national security by “getting dangerous diversity, equity, and inclusion policies out of the armed forces and rebuilding the warrior ethos.” It’s “refreshing to have a president who is focused on what’s truly important — putting America first.”\n\nFrom the right: Red Alert for ActBlue\n\nTrump’s executive order taking aim at the Democratic Party’s online fundraising platform ActBlue is “long overdue,” argue the Washington Examiner’s editors. “Investigations by House Republicans revealed anomalies” on the platform like “sudden and frequent donations from elderly citizens, uncharacteristic donations from voters registered for one party but voting for another, and unusually large donations from voters with little money.” And even before the order, ActBlue began to fall apart, losing top execs and seeing its “last remaining lawyer feel the need to remind everyone of whistleblower protection policies.” “The public deserves to know what happened at ActBlue.” Those behind any wrongdoing “should be brought to justice. Trump has not just a right but a duty to make sure the nation’s campaign finance laws are being followed.”\n\nCulture critic: We Failed Shapiro — and Balmer\n\nDays after Cody Balmer’s mother tried “to initiate a psychiatric evaluation, he allegedly scaled the gates of Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro’s estate and firebombed his house,” notes City Journal’s John Hirschauer about a man with a history of violence, “schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.” Balmer’s case is a familiar one: “Loved ones seek involuntary treatment” of a mentally ill relative or friend only to be denied on the grounds there’s no imminent danger—until someone “snaps, harms himself or someone else, and only then is sequestered and treated.” Modern commitment laws try “to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and protect individuals’ civil liberties.” But “the status quo is failing people like Balmer” and “the cost of doing nothing is growing ever steeper” for the rest of us.\n\nEcon desk: Gavin Newsom’s Tariff Lies\n\n“Fifty-four percent of Californians say things in the state are generally going in the wrong direction” — up 14 points from when Gavin Newsom became governor, scoffs The Wall Street Journal’s Allysia Finley. “But by his telling, everything in the Golden State is going swimmingly, or was until Donald Trump started his tariff barrage.” No: Tariffs aren’t why “filling up a Jeep will cost you $100.” Or why “Pacific Gas & Electric recently proposed another rate increase, following six last year.” Or why, to afford “a typical home in the state,” Californians “need to earn nearly $200,000.” The basic idea of the progressive agenda “is that an enlightened liberal government can direct private resources to better social purposes and create a utopia. California shows otherwise.”\n\nBorder watch: Dems’ Deportation ‘Resistance’\n\n“Most Americans support the deportation of people living in the U.S. illegally,” notes David Catron at The American Spectator, but “when a Wisconsin judge was arrested for aiding a ‘migrant’ in his effort to escape immigration officials,” the Democrats backed the alleged criminals: Judge Hannah Dugan and Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, “a Mexican national living in the country illegally.” Dugan and other judges acting lawlessly on immigration issues “see themselves as part of ‘the resistance.’ But what are they resisting? It isn’t just Trump or even the will of the people. It’s the rule of law. The Democrats insist that no one is above the law. But neither Judge Dugan nor her fellow travelers really believe it.” This “hubris” is “worse than a crime — it’s a blunder.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"A look at President Donald Trump's first 100 days back in the White House for his second term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trumps-first-100-days-wins-red-alert-for-actblue-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/trump-opinion-hp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1745863657&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:12:45","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":315814722,"title":"Dem senator says Abrego Garcia situation 'not going to end well' for Trump, argues he's 'undermining' freedom","text":"Democratic Oregon Sen.

Yet in the drive for US supremacy in artificial intelligence – signalled by the $500bn (£375bn) Stargate project announcement in the White House and an executive order to integrate AI into public education, beginning in kindergarten – there is a hidden irony,\" he wrote.\n\nSlobodionn argued, \"If their vision for our economic future is realised, IQ in the sense that they value will lose its meaning.","url":"https://www.alternet.org/donald-trump-iq/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=51716119&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C106%2C0%2C107","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:08:50","author":"Ailia Zehra","authors":["Ailia Zehra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.269},{"id":315820366,"title":"Dua Lipa looks sensational in a sheer black mesh dress as she poses up a storm at the 50th Chaplin Award Gala in New York","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Net Zero to blame for Spain blackout chaos?

Hochul is blaming Republicans in Congress for potential federal cuts to Medicaid, but the state’s spending on the program is off the charts and could well use some guardrails.\n\nThe best way for Congress to curb federal costs? Rewrite the law so that states like New York have more of an incentive to control growth rather than balloon it.\n\nIndeed, New York spends a jaw-dropping $124 billion on the program, more overall and per capita than any other state.\n\nWhat can Congress do? It can fix the formula that forces Washington to pick up half of New York’s costs for the program, letting Albany game the system.\n\nRemember, Medicaid was meant as a safety-net program to cover basic medical costs for poor and disabled folks who couldn’t afford care on their own. \n\nBut over the years, enrollment and services in New York have expanded far beyond their original intent. \n\nThat’s partly because the law allows to boost costs, with Uncle Sam picking up a share of the increase.\n\nCalifornia, New York, and other states have learned tricks to expand the program, pleasing the health-care lobby and far-left progressives, while shifting costs to DC, but also hiking their own outlays.\n\nToday, the feds foot 50% of New York’s Medicaid bill; the state pays 34%, and local districts — New York City and the 57 counties — cover 16%.\n\nThe Empire Center’s Bill Hammond has followed the money: New York’s high Medicaid costs are driven largely by its generous benefits, high enrollment (including of New Yorkers who aren’t poor), and nation-leading reimbursement rates to providers. For example:\n\nEmergency Medicaid for illegal immigrants in New York covers more than 480,000 enrollees, or 7% of enrollment.\n\nSpending on emergency Medicaid has more than tripled, from $207 million in 2014 to $639 million in fiscal 2024.\n\nObamacare allowed Medicaid coverage for a million New Yorkers whose earnings were above the Medicaid poverty line cut-off, which, by court order, enrolls another 500,000 noncitizens.\n\nOver the past decade, New York has awarded $4.3 billion in health-care grants to failing hospitals that don’t even see many patients because people won’t go to them.\n\nAbuse runs rampant, such as with the purchase of Medicaid-funded air conditioners supposedly only for people with certain conditions, like asthma.\n\nUnlike every other state, New York’s Medicaid program covers infertility treatment (as opposed to diagnosis and testing).\n\nOh, and enrollment in the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program — expensive 24/7 home care for the elderly and disabled — has exploded. \n\nThe irony is that, while Hochul blames Republicans, President Donald Trump just repeated his vow to veto any bill that cuts Medicaid benefits. So don’t expect any real pain.\n\nBut a funding shift that removes states’ incentives to continue bloating the system would save both federal and state taxpayers a bundle.\n\nIn New York’s case, in particular, it’s long overdue.","summary":"Remember, Medicaid was meant as a safety-net program to cover basic medical costs for poor and disabled folks who couldn't afford care on their own.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/opinion/new-yorks-outrageous-medicaid-spending-needs-a-reset-by-trump-and-the-gop-congress/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/new-york-gov-kathy-hochul-103498548.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:05:47","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":315812754,"title":"Ross Douthat: Why is Trump struggling? His adminstration is too ‘black-pilled’","text":"If a striking thing about the period just before Donald Trump’s second inauguration was the feeling that America was genuinely shifting to the right — wokeness crumbling, more minority voters and elite factions joining the GOP, every branch of government in conservative hands — a striking thing about the Trump administration is that it has governed as though none of this were the case.\n\nInstead, its approach belongs to a world where both the conservative position and the wider American situation are simply desperate and there’s only the narrowest of windows to wrench the country away from some apocalyptic fate.\n\nThe best term for this mentality is “black-pilled,” an online reference, based on a famous scene in “The Matrix,” to different pills that awaken people to hidden realities. A red pill lets you in on secret right-wing truths. A white pill persuades you that the world situation is better than you thought. And a black pill lets you know just how doomed we really are.\n\nA merely red-pilled Trump administration would still be doing much of what the actual one is doing — pushing the envelope on executive power, making a bid to revive American manufacturing, trying to find ways to increase deportations, picking fights with Ivy League universities.\n\nBut the black pill helps explain the hyperactivity with which Elon Musk’s DOGE project set about cutting jobs and programs — no pause for assessment, just the chainsaw.\n\nOr the chaotic haste that yielded a list of sweeping demands being sent to Harvard apparently by mistake.\n\nOr the no-pain-no-gain maximalism of Trump’s trade war.\n\nOr the impulse to engage in brinkmanship with a conservative Supreme Court.\n\nOr the seeming lack of concern for whether newly Republican constituencies might be alienated or freaked out.\n\nThe administration’s mentality exists in symbiosis with its most fervent online supporters, who have responded to each new foray with all-or-nothing takes. “If we can’t bring all the jobs back/deport all the illegal immigrants/smash the Ivy League, we don’t have a country.”\n\nLet me take one illustration of this mentality, from a commentator who goes by the nom de guerre FischerKing and has more than 200,000 followers on X. Calling the American situation an “emergency,” with an added expletive, he writes: “The USA has elected a series of administrations from both parties who have given us a $37 trillion national debt, probably 30-50 million illegal aliens, woke ideology, and a series of pointless wars. But we’re supposed to care about ‘norms.’”\n\nI like this post because it lets me make two points about the problem with the black pill.\n\nFirst, it overstates the direness of the situation. The United States almost certainly does not have 30 million to 50 million illegal immigrants. A high-end estimate from an anti-immigration advocacy group puts the figure at 18 million to 19 million. That’s a big number; it makes a case for deportations. But it’s far less transformative than 50 million would be.\n\nThe 21st-century United States has indeed been embroiled in “a series of pointless wars.” But the debacles of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya are in the past, and U.S. foreign policy has turned in a more realist direction under Democrats as well as Trump. Even if you take a maximally skeptical view of our support for the Ukrainians, the war in Ukraine is a classic proxy conflict, not another Iraq or Vietnam.\n\nMeanwhile, the peak of woke ideology is, for now, in the past: Today, Ibram X. Kendi is increasingly a punchline, the British Supreme Court is vindicating JK Rowling, and affirmative action, as well as DEI, is on the ropes.\n\nSo at the very least, some “emergency” aspects of our situation are less grim than the black-pilled view would suggest. But just as crucially, many norm-busting responses of the Trump administration are either nonresponsive to the alleged emergencies or arguably counterproductive.\n\nThe national debt is a real problem. But the Musk attack on federal spending has savaged important programs for the sake of trivial savings, and the profligate budgets being pushed through the House and Senate will very likely swamp any savings.\n\nOn immigration, the bitter fights over sending alleged gang members to a Salvadoran prison are not necessarily relevant to the White House’s ability to carry out deportations on a larger scale, since the administration desperately needs more resources for that project, not just more authority.\n\nIn the culture war, conservative success in the struggle against wokeness depends on continuing to convert centrists and even liberals to the cause, and the administration’s all-or-nothing strategy risks making liberal academia sympathetic — a truly counterproductive feat.\n\nFinally, the trade war looks like a debacle. Full stop.\n\nBetter for the critics to meet the black-pilled halfway — with the suggestion that even in a dire situation, you still need a response calibrated to reality, rather than a furious flailing that most likely guarantees defeat.\n\nRoss Douthat writes a column for the New York Times.","summary":"The best term for this mentality is “black-pilled,” an online reference, based on a famous scene in “The Matrix,” two different pills that awaken people to hidden realities.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/28/ross-douthat-why-is-trump-struggling-his-adminstration-is-too-black-pilled/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AP19131622414586.jpg?w=1024&h=617","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:05:26","author":"Ross Douthat","authors":["Ross Douthat"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":315813400,"title":"Bill O’Reilly’s new book takes on the worst of the worst","text":"Beware those ‘Evil’ pols\n\nComing — so unexpectedly — another Bill O’Reilly book.

This means that when a privileged resolution like the Paul-Wyden legislation is brought to the floor, the stature that requires a vote after 15 legislative days would never take effect. The rule has been placed into a must-pass budget bill that would take effect once the legislation is signed into law.\n\n\"I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority,\" Johnson said of the rule. \"It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices.

After uploading her post earlier this week, influencer and jewelry expert Julia Chafe shared an Instagram video calling out the the SKIMS founder flaunting her exorbitant wealth\nSince then, she has been far more reserved about displaying pricey jewels in public. \nHowever, she made a surprisingly timed departure from that in recent Instagram posts show her family's getaway to a tropical locale.\nAfter uploading her post, influencer and jewelry expert Julia Chafe shared a video calling out the the reality star for flaunting her exorbitant wealth on Instagram. \n\n Kanye West banned from Twitch seven minutes after joining the platform \nWhile many overlooked the luxe accessories wrapped around the SKIMS founder's ankle, Chafe pointed out that 'cost more than' a house.\n'She stacked four anklets on top of each other, added a tennis anklet, a pink sapphire and diamond anklet that gave off major Princess Diana vibes, each sapphire probably around three carats, which is bigger than a lot of engagement rings out there,' Chafe claimed.\nChafe continued, saying the audacity of wearing the expensive jewelry on the beach is part of what makes the mother-of-four such a rare and remarkable person. \n'The sheer audacity of wearing this much money on your foot at the beach is what makes Kim K so fabulous,' Chafe said. \nChafe went on to share that she admires Kim's jewelry evolution over the years.\n\nWhile many overlooked the pricy accessories wrapped around the reality star's ankle, Chafe pointed out that 'cost more than' a house \n\nHer latest post also included photos of her on vacation with her kids and her younger sister Khloé Kardashian for some rest and relaxation\n'Kim getting into pink sapphires? Love it. She’s been all about diamonds and emeralds for so long, so it's exciting to see her shift to sapphires now.'\nOthers in the comment section, however, called out the reality star for her tone-deaf behavior. \n'Remember when she said she wasn’t going to post her jewelry on social media bc she was robbed in Paris……..neither does she,' one wrote. \n\n 'Ringleader of Grandpa gang' accused of robbing Kim Kardashian is '80% disabled' \nAnother joked: 'I’m waiting for a meme of her losing an anklet to show up.' \nA third stated that there was nothing 'admirable' about 'someone flaunting that much money on a beach while people are literally starving.' \nHer latest post also included photos of her on vacation with her kids and her younger sister Khloé Kardashian for some rest and relaxation\nShe captioned her post, 'the things we do on vacation' and included shots of her zip lining, doing a puzzle with Khloé, and pics of her kids enjoying shaved ice and fishing. \nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson commented on her post, writing, 'Beautiful. It’s Maui time! I’m coming to sing to the kids (in keys that don’t exist) Enjoy the mana!'\n\nShe captioned her post, 'the things we do on vacation' and included shots of her zip lining, doing a puzzle with Khloé, and pics of her kids enjoying shaved ice and fishing \n\nKanye and Kim share four children together: North, 11, Saint, nine, Chicago, seven, and Psalm, five \nThe Hawaii trip comes as Kim is set to give testimony in the trial over the October 2016 robbery in which Kim was held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel as masked thieves stole $9 million worth of jewelry from her.\nAmong the jewels stolen was Kim's 18.8 carat diamond and platinum engagement ring from Kanye West.\nMeanwhile, Kim's volatile ex-husband Kanye West is still stirring up trouble for her.\nMost recently he went on a rant on Twitch about Kim, saying he should have had kids with Paris Hilton instead. \nThe 47-year-old rapper — who recently went a month-long retreat that saved his marriage to Bianca Censori — made the wild claims in a rant on a livestream for a new Twitch channel which has since been banned.\nHe appeared on the stream and was speaking to someone on the phone when his shocking rant began.\nKanye had referenced how his ex Kim, got her start in the limelight by acting as Paris' assistant.\nHe said: 'Kim was Paris Hilton’s assistant. I should’ve had babies with Paris Hilton over Kim Kardashian!'\n\nSaint seen smiling above in one of his mom's pictures \n\nKanye and Kim share four children together: North, 11, Saint, nine, Chicago, seven, and Psalm, five.\nCould you imagine if I had kids with Paris Hilton? How many hotels I would have right now? Think about that. The Hilton. The Hilton s***.'\nKanye was swiftly banned from Twitch as his channel went down just 10 minutes after he started streaming\nSocial media account Drama Alert were among the outlets to have reposted the shocking footage as their comments section was filled with many disgusted by Kanye's comments.\nOne wrote: 'Bro saying he regretted having his own kids'\nAnother was worried about Kim and Kanye's children and how they would take their father's comments if they ever came across them.\nThey said: '\"I had a baby with an assistant\" [two crying emojis] bro imagine Kanye kids watching this s*** [skull emoji].'\nKanye WestKim Kardashian\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKim Kardashian to play major role in Paris trial over 2016 armed robbery as she flashes jewels in public\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Both the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched investigations into possible violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The investigations were launched in response to information both federal agencies received about policies and practices for journal membership as well as article selection that may violate Title VI. In a press release, HHS claimed the Harvard Law Review’s editor reportedly wrote that it was \"concerning\" that \"four of the five people\" who wanted to reply to an article on police reform were \"white men.\" TRUMP FROZE FUNDING FOR HARVARD. MONEY TO THESE UNIVERSITIES MAY ALSO BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK HHS also said another editor at the Review suggested \"that a piece should be subjected to expedited review because the author was a minority.\" Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal funding. Any violations of Title VI could result in the loss of funds from the federal government. \"Harvard Law Review’s article selection process appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission,\" HHS Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said. \"Title VI’s demands are clear: recipients of federal financial assistance may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin. No institution—no matter its pedigree, prestige, or wealth—is above the law. The Trump Administration will not allow Harvard, or any other recipients of federal funds, to trample on anyone’s civil rights.\" TRUMP ADMIN SLASHES OVER $2.2B IN FUNDING TO HARVARD AFTER SCHOOL DEFIES DEMANDS In a statement to Fox News Digital, the school stated, \"Harvard Law School is committed to ensuring that the programs and activities it oversees are in compliance with all applicable laws and to investigating any credibly alleged violations. The Harvard Law Review is a student-run organization that is legally independent from the law school. A claim brought in 2018 was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\" The investigations come as the Trump administration continues to feud with elite education institutions, announcing earlier this month it would be cutting off over $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard University while threatening cuts to another $1 billion of its federal grants and funding. After Harvard refused to comply with a series of requests from the Trump administration to reform various practices on campus, the administration revealed April 18 that it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding for the institution. HARVARD WON'T COMPLY WITH TRUMP ADMIN'S DEMANDS AMID THREATS OF CUTTING FEDERAL FUNDING Harvard University President Alan M. Garber said in a statement that President Donald Trump's administration tacked on additional requests that go beyond addressing antisemitism on campus, and the institution would not comply because the demands were unconstitutional. Garber said the new requests \"direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard,\" including auditing viewpoints of student, faculty and staff members on campus and eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices and initiatives at Harvard. \"It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner,\" Garber wrote. \"We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration launched the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism in February, which aims to eradicate bias on campuses that have experienced incidents targeting Jewish students since October 2023. \"It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,\" the task force said in a statement.

But, in what was something of an obvious oddity compared to past events, there were more phones being held up by invited guests memorializing the event than there were Eagles players and coaches coming down those stairs. White Celebration Great In Most Aspects This celebration of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship was great, by the way. That needs to be said. But there was stuff missing. That was clear, too. President Donald Trump, by all accounts, was an enthusiastic and welcoming host, joking with and complimenting the players and their accomplishments. And at a distance, the Eagles were keen and appreciative guests – gifting the president with a signed helmet and a No. 47 jersey. And, afterward the team released a statement of appreciation from Eagles chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie. But, make no mistake, there was something off from this visit. Eagles Statement Does Not Mention Trump That's because about one-quarter of the 53-man roster decided to skip the event. And when it was done, the team statement, whether by innocent omission or intention, did not mention Trump at all. Lurie said, in part, \"We are grateful for the hospitality we were extended and appreciate the opportunity to celebrate this special team alongside the hundreds of fans that joined us on the South Lawn.\" Not mentioning the host who extended the invitation and ordered the hospitality is a lapse. You know what wasn't a lapse? Players opting out because they wanted not to be seen with Trump, or tied to his administration, or the White House. That was on purpose. Jalen Hurts Leads In Opting Out The list is kind of long but for an abridged version featuring the stars: Quarterback Jalen Hurts. Wide receiver A.J. Brown. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith. Defensive lineman Jalen Carter. And close to a dozen others. The White House publicly took the stance that a vast majority of the players attended and those who didn't had \"scheduling conflicts.\" Yeah, maybe that is completely correct for some of the players not present. But clearly not all. What we saw was players mostly making personal decisions about not being around Trump. Let's call it what it is. The team decided to attend, but on this day, those who didn't show up acted as individuals. And, whatever, it's a free country. Trump Endorses The Tush Push But freedom includes people having opinions about other people who make personal statements. So the political right will express disappointment in players who didn't show up as surely as the political left will express disappointment in players who did show up. Thankfully, for the sake of optics, this wasn't a wide-ranging boycott. Coach Nick Sirianni was there. He walked out of the Oval Office astride with Trump. And when Trump said the NFL should not ban the Tush Push and added, \"I like the play,\" Sirianni thanked him for his \"endorsement.\" By the way, the NFL is working hard to ban the play. It's a behind-the-scenes plot that is currently going on, led by commissioner Roger Goodell, who dislikes the play, and so Trump's endorsement might not move the needle. So much for Trump being the dictator some people would have you believe he is, because dictators typically get their way. Trump hit the right chords during the ceremony. Big Dom Gets A Shoutout From Trump Trump acknowledged Big Dom DiSandro before anyone else. Of course he did, because DiSandro has a reputation that precedes him and some Eagles employees joke he actually runs the place in Philly (no, he doesn't). Anyway, the dude is awesome and Trump clearly got that memo. Trump loved on right tackle Lane Johnson, who at 6-foot-6 and 310 pounds, dwarfed the 6-3 President. And Lurie was given the microphone to say a few words as well. \"Thanks, Mr. President,\" Lurie began. \"You know it's truly an honor to be here. I remember, as a little boy, the championship teams that came to the White House and I never dreamed we'd be able to have a team and be as good as this. \"And this was a dominant team with incredible culture – everything we all believe in as the best human values. Selflessness, humility, teamwork, talent, discipline. Everything that we all strive for, this team incorporated. Thank you for the hospitality today and Go Birds.\" Eagles' Ricks Really Likes Ivanka It's clear the players who attended seemed to enjoy themselves. Mekhi Becton, who played on the Eagles last year but has signed with the Los Angeles Rams now, gleefully posted a photo of himself inside the White House. And backup defensive back Eli Ricks apparently fell in love. He saw Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and was instantly smitten. Unfortunately for him, Ivanka Trump is married. The players who attended this ceremony probably made themselves a memory they'll be able to share with their grandchildren. And those who opted out, well, they can tell their grandchildren tales of their \"scheduling conflicts.\"","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/eagles-white-house-visit-great-attendees-multiple-star-players-opted-out","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2212457178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:00:42","author":"Armando Salguero","authors":["Armando Salguero"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.027},{"id":315818778,"title":"Worried About Tesla's Brand Issues? These 3 Words From the Company's First-Quarter Earnings Call Should Put Your Fears to Rest.","text":"It's been a rough start to 2025 for megacap technology stocks. As of market close on April 24, each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" has generated a negative return so far this year.\n\nAmong this list of artificial intelligence (AI) darlings, none has fared worse than electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (TSLA 0.53%). As I write this, shares of Tesla have dropped by an abysmal 36% on the year.\n\nOne of the biggest factors driving the sell-off in Tesla stock is perceived damage to the company's brand. Let's explore why investors have been concerned about the brand of late, and more importantly assess why these fears may be overblown.\n\nThe Tesla brand is under some intense scrutiny right now, but...\n\nBrand equity is one of the most valuable assets a company can have. There are very few businesses in the world that can command immediate recognition of their products. Apple, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Nike are in rare company when it comes to building a brand moat.\n\nI'm not sure I would place Tesla at the top of most-recognized brands in the automobile industry. However, in the EV subsector of the broader industry, I think it takes the throne (or close to it).\n\nFor most companies, achieving a level of global scale and brand recognition would require billions of dollars for sales and marketing. While Tesla does invest in advertising to some degree, the company has one thing no other automobile business can claim: an outspoken CEO named Elon Musk.\n\nAs I wrote a year ago, Musk more or less serves as his company's primary marketing tool. Thanks to social media, he has an enormous reach around the world and can market the latest and greatest at his company with the touch of a button. The thing is, his influence can be both an asset and a liability. Let's explore what I mean by that.\n\nDuring the final phases of the 2024 presidential election, he emerged as a significant financial supporter of GOP nominee Donald Trump. Following his victory on Nov. 5, 2024, Trump ended up appointing Musk to lead a new program called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe primary goal of DOGE is to identify areas of wasteful spending in the federal budget in an effort to reduce the U.S. deficit. At a high level, a lot of people may not see such a problem with that goal.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with Musk, he has made DOGE into a major publicity campaign. Nearly every day, it posts on social media what contracts it has canceled, why it canceled them, and how much money those deals were worth.\n\nThese actions have caused a stir with some political activists, leading to a chain reaction in the form of protests at many of Tesla's dealerships. As Musk said during the first-quarter call recently, \"The natural blowback from that is those who were receiving the wasteful dollars and the unfortunate dollars will try to attack me and the DOGE team and anything associated with me.\"\n\nThe fission that has resulted from Musk's political ties has some investors worried that consumers may buy alternative EVs and pass on a Tesla for fear of being falsely labeled a supporter of Musk or any number of polarizing political figures.\n\nAs a result, the company's growth prospects have really started to come into question.\n\n... it may not be as damaged as you think\n\nConsidering Trump will be in the Oval Office for another three-and-a-half years, a bearish investor might think Tesla's best days are in the rearview mirror and the company won't be able to recover anytime soon. Luckily, during its first-quarter earnings call, management dropped a breadcrumb that has me (a longtime Tesla investor) slightly more optimistic.\n\nDuring the call, one executive said that the company witnessed \"a record number of test drives globally in Q1 as well. So interest remains high. And so right now, we continue to see good interest still.\" Musk followed this comment up by saying, \"as far as absent macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.\"\n\nThe three words that personally put me at ease are \"interest remains high.\"\n\nShould you buy Tesla stock right now?\n\nDuring the call, Musk alluded to the fact that he is going to scale back on his time at DOGE. I think this will be a benefit in the near term, but at a higher level, such a move may not even be necessary. I am cautiously optimistic that the company's long-term growth remains intact given management's assurance that demand levels remain robust.\n\nWhen you layer on top of strong EV demand the fact that Tesla has a number of AI-powered products and services that should scale up over the next couple of years, the stock still appears to be a solid opportunity for those who can handle some volatility and uncertainty here and there.","summary":"One of the biggest factors fueling the sell-off in Tesla stock is concern around the company's brand.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/28/worried-about-teslas-brand-issues-these-3-words-fr/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=89f266f2-9f82-4889-b618-6c6227a2b472","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F816049%2F4-teslas-in-a-line-at-a-charging-station.png&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:00:00","author":"Adam Spatacco","authors":["Adam Spatacco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":315812866,"title":"Daredevils soar over valley on high-altitude swing in Chinese mountains","text":"TylaDonald Trump sparks outrage with ‘disgraceful’ act at Pope’s funeralThe US president attended the funeral alongside his wife, First Lady Melania Trump\n\nLadBibleLip reader 'reveals five word warning' Donald Trump gave to Emmanuel Macron during meetingThe US leader had an impromptu meeting with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy after\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nCosmopolitanPrince William Could “Barely Contain His Fury” When Naked Pics of Kate Middleton LeakedPrince William could barely contain his furious reaction to nude photos of Kate Middleton leaking.\n\nTylaConspiracy theorists spot ‘clue’ that Melania Trump ‘body double’ was used at Pope Francis’ funeralMelania Trump and her husband, Donald, attended the funeral over the weekend (26 April)\n\nSportBibleJamie Vardy's future takes surprise twist as 'dream' transfer revealed after Leicester City exitShock transfer development as Leicester's Vardy era comes to an end\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nUNILADDonald Trump speaks out on death of Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre after she dies aged 41The president has addressed Virginia Giuffre's passing following her death on Friday (April 25)\n\nPeopleWhy Did Prince William Wear a Blue Suit to Pope Francis' Funeral?The Prince of Wales and President Donald Trump were among those not in traditional black at the pope's funeral\n\nHello!Prince William's 'perfect king' moment at Pope Francis’ funeral moves royal fansRoyal fans praise Prince William’s dignified appearance at Pope Francis’ funeral.\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nUNILADMan hit with huge ‘nonsense’ fine after holding sign that sent simple warning to other driversDaniel Gehlke said he was simply trying to help other drivers\n\nThe Daily BeastWhy Prince Andrew Is Finished After Virginia Giuffre’s DeathSign up here to make you you never miss our weekly updated on the best soap opera anywhere: The ups and downs of the British royals.

Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, initially criticized Trump’s tariff policy, saying that it would end up raising prices on things like groceries, cars and home heating, as well as jeopardize jobs in her state.\n\nEarlier this month, however, she appeared to have softened her stance, saying, “I understand the motivation behind tariffs,” but calling them “a blunt tool.”\n\nShe also said she agreed with Trump on the “need to make more stuff in America.”\n\nLast weekend, a group of Americans opposed to Trump’s international trade policies organized a protest in Michigan, rallying at the three international bridges crossing from the U.S. into Ontario, U.S. media reported.\n\nOther reports have highlighted the drop in Canadian border crossings since Trump’s re-election and the negative effect it has had on Michigan’s local businesses and the tourism industry.\n\nBut Trump’s tariffs have received a ringing endorsement from the powerful United Auto Workers union, which said the policy marked “the beginning of the end of a thirty-plus year ‘free trade’ disaster” that has devastated the working class and the auto industry.","summary":"The state of Michigan represents an interesting tariff test case.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/trump-to-celebrate-first-100-days-with-rally-in-canadian-border-state/article_20e06bf9-32a8-4fe1-a8a9-158b8b094a16.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b5/fb5fe67c-9416-5473-9dd4-2381a69d6496/6810160a07671.image.jpg?crop=1761%2C925%2C0%2C126&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:00:00","author":"Allan Woods","authors":["Allan Woods"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":315814498,"title":"Tesla May Dodge More Than $1 Billion in Fines Over ‘Full Self-Driving’ Claims","text":"Elon Musk once said he could save taxpayers $2 trillion by slashing away at government agencies with his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Then it was $1 trillion. Most recently, he has revised that estimate significantly downward to $150 billion. And even if he could prove he has reduced the federal budget by that amount (which he hasn’t), it doesn’t account for the nearly equal wasteful expenditure that his rampage has incurred, including legal fees arising from hundreds of lawsuits against DOGE.\n\n But it seems that Musk, for all the mayhem and suffering he has visited upon Washington and the country, managed to look out for his own bottom line. \n\n On Monday, Democrats holding the minority position in the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led by ranking member Sen. Richard Blumenthal, issued a report estimating that at the time of President Donald Trump‘s 2025 inauguration, Musk’s corporate entities were facing at least $2.37 billion in liabilities stemming from “at least 65 actual or potential actions by 11 different federal agencies.” These included everything from an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation into racial harassment at a Tesla facility to a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into allegedly misleading statements about product risks from the biotech outfit Neuralink. Such enforcements and fines are highly unlikely to move ahead now that DOGE has infiltrated the agencies responsible, with Trump’s blessing. In February, for example, the Department of Justice dropped a discrimination case against Musk’s SpaceX, sparing it up to $46 million in civil penalties, according to the congressional report. Early in the second Trump administration, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee warned that DOGE was specifically targeting regulators that oversaw and often investigated various parts of Musk’s business empire.\n\n The biggest-ticket item on the PSI list concerns technology that Musk has long held up as critical for Tesla and the future of the automotive industry: “Full self-driving,” or FSD, a software system that allows a car to pilot itself autonomously, without the need for an attentive human ready to take control of the wheel. Musk is known for promising, year after year, that fully autonomous Teslas are just around the corner, only to inevitably extend the timeline yet again, even as rivals like Google‘s Waymo have unveiled driverless robotaxi services in several metro area markets. In the meantime, he and Tesla have aggressively marketed less advanced driver-assistance features called “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” — the latter was renamed “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” — earning criticism from safety advocates who argue that these are misleading terms which have led customers to overestimate the tech’s capabilities, causing preventable accidents.\n\n In 2022, it emerged that the DOJ had opened a criminal investigation into the way Tesla and Musk had advertised Autopilot and FSD, exposing them to possible charges of wire and securities fraud related to misleading consumers and investors about their technology as far back as 2016. The PSI memo notes that violations of these federal statues can be held criminally liable for “twice the gross gain” associated with the offense. FSD is a subscription service for Tesla customers, and the company reported $596 million in revenue from the feature for the 2024 fiscal year — which means, the Senate Democrats noted, that it could be on the hook for a minimum of $1.19 billion were the DOJ to bring and win a fraud case. Of course, this is an improbable scenario under Trump’s DOJ and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has been more focused on going after people alleged to have damaged Tesla properties in recent months as “domestic terrorists.”\n\n By 2023, the DOJ had reportedly expanded their Tesla probe and subpoenaed records to examine “personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range and personnel decisions” at the company, it said in a quarterly SEC filing that year without offering additional details. Tesla has also been the subject of multiple investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pertaining to FSD as well as issues with “loss of steering control,” “sudden unintended acceleration,” “steering wheel detachment,” “unexpected brake activation,” and whether a mandated recall had remedied the Autopilot problem it was intended to address. The Democrats on the Senate subcommittee who submitted the memo on the prospective savings for Musk’s companies thanks to lax regulation did not speculate on the amount of fines he might have successfully dodged in those matters.\n\n “While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drasticallyunderstates the true benefit Mr. Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of hisposition in government,” they wrote. “In addition to the 25 pending matters the Subcommittee has not yet been able to quantify, Mr. Musk and his companies could gain millions or even billions more simply by avoiding the time, legal fees, and risk of being ordered to undertake remediation efforts or change labor practices.” The senators added: “The truth is that the breathtaking scope and scale of benefits Mr. Musk is gaining from his present position may never be known, and that is by design. The silence is strategic, and it is dangerous.”\n\n While a billion dollars in savings is nothing to sneeze at, it may not be enough for Tesla to weather the storm ahead. Beset by a falling stock price, plunging sales, and mounting competition, it has become a focus of backlash and protest thanks to Musk’s toxic political presence on the national scene, which has alienated a liberal customer base. The company is meanwhile at risk from Trump’s chaotic tariffs policy. Last week, it reported a 71 percent drop in quarterly earnings compared to the same period last year, only eking out a profit by selling carbon emissions tax credits to other automakers. On that earnings call, Musk once again teased a “pilot” Tesla robotaxi program to be rolled out in Austin, Texas, in June, using upgraded Model Y vehicles as opposed to the two-door “Cybercab” model he unveiled at an event last fall. While he remained light on specifics, he offered typically unrealistic predictions, envisioning that there “will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously — fully autonomously — in the second half of next year,” and that Tesla will take “90-something percent” of the rideshare market.\n\n During that same call, Musk announced that his “time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly” in the weeks ahead so that he can devote more attention to Tesla, no doubt pleasing investors alarmed by its dismal performance since Musk threw himself into the project of gutting the U.S. administrative state. Yet his ongoing association with Trump and role as key GOP megadonor are bound to hamper the brand even if he puts some distance between himself and the White House. Whatever regulatory headaches he has spared his businesses in the short term, the public may not be so quick to forgive and forget.","summary":"Whether or not Elon Musk scales down his role in Washington, it appears his empire stands to gain from his meddling in federal agencies","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-cars-fine-1235326861/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/doge-tesla-fine.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 23:59:30","author":"Miles Klee","authors":["Miles Klee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":315813396,"title":"Trump is restoring merit — by slaying rules that enforce reverse discrimination","text":"Measured in Trump time, it took eons to announce — but the White House has finally taken the most important step it can to restore meritocracy to American society: eliminating disparate-impact theory from civil-rights analysis and enforcement.\n\nDisparate-impact theory holds that if a neutral, color-blind standard of achievement or behavior has a disproportionately negative effect on underrepresented minorities (overwhelmingly, on blacks), it violates civil-rights laws.\n\nIt has been used in hundreds of cases, all across the country, to alter our society in profound ways.\n\nDisparate-impact analysis has invalidated literacy and numeracy standards for police officers and firefighters in places like Durham, NC, and South Bend, Ind.\n\nIt has watered down cognitive-skills and basic-knowledge tests for teachers in New York City.\n\nIt has eliminated the use of SATs in many states’ college admissions, removed grades from a medical licensing exam, penalized credit-based mortgage lending, curtailed the ability to discipline insubordinate students and discouraged criminal-background checks for employees and renters.\n\nProgressive district attorneys invoke disparate impact to stop prosecuting shoplifting, turnstile jumping, resisting arrest and other crimes; activists use it to rein in police tactics such as proactive stops (otherwise known as stop, question and frisk) and to purge safety technologies like ShotSpotter from police departments.\n\nIn none of those cases has it ever been demonstrated that the disfavored standard was implemented to exclude minorities from a position, opportunity or right.\n\nThe genius (if a diabolical one) of disparate-impact theory was that it obviated any need to show discriminatory intent on the part of a targeted employer or institution.\n\nDiscrimination was inferred simply by the effect of the color-blind standard, and by an institution or employer’s failure to devise an alternative standard on which minorities would do better.\n\nDisparate-impact theory preserved the hegemony of the civil-rights regime long after the original impetus for that regime had all but disappeared.\n\nOne would be hard-pressed today to find any mainstream institution that discriminates against black Americans in admissions, hiring or promotion.\n\nThe reality, in fact, is the opposite: Every mainstream institution is desperate to hire and promote as many remotely qualified blacks as possible; it is white males who are disfavored and excluded from positions based on their skin color.\n\nDisparate-impact analysis was the linchpin of the “systemic racism” argument, since the only present-day proof of racism in American society is the underrepresentation of blacks in the professions and their over-representation in the criminal-justice system.\n\nMeantime, the real cause of disparate impact — yawning gaps in academic skills and crime — was kept assiduously offstage.\n\nNow all that may be changing.\n\nPresident Trump’s Executive Order of April 23, 2025, “Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy,” sets out the policy of the United States to “eliminate the use of disparate-impact liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible.”\n\nTo that end, it starts the process of repealing disparate-impact regulations accreted to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by subsequent administrations and requires the cataloguing of state laws that impose disparate-impact liability.\n\nMost momentously for law enforcement, the executive order initiates the review of federal consent decrees that rely on disparate-impact analysis (i.e., almost all of them), with the implied goal of dissolving those decrees. (A consent decree is a negotiated settlement, overseen by a judge and his representative, binding a government entity to an elaborate set of reforms.)\n\nThis will liberate police departments from a costly yoke of superfluous red tape — and will also defund the federal-monitor racket, whereby monitors earn millions of dollars declaring for years on end that the overseen police department has yet to comply punctiliously with hundreds of mandated reforms, often regarding paperwork.\n\nLeft-wing groups are understandably up in arms, charging the administration with a “fundamental shift in legal philosophy.”\n\nTrue, but it was disparate-impact theory itself that constituted a radical departure from the premises of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe president has merely restored the 1964 law to its original understanding.\n\nThat pioneering legislation banned intentional discrimination.\n\nDisparate-impact theory was a judicial amendment made six years later — because even in 1971, invidious intentional discrimination was too rare to satisfy the advocates.\n\nThe left complains as well that Trump’s executive order embraces a “formalist, color-blind conception of equality.”\n\nYes — and so does the Constitution.\n\nBut Trump must move quickly. His executive order can be reversed by a hostile successor.\n\nTrump needs to persuade Congress to clarify that civil rights means freedom from discrimination. The legislature must amend 1960s-era statutes to confirm explicitly their original color-blind intent.\n\nThat will trigger a long-overdue debate: Is the United States still disfigured by systemic racism that requires the dismantling of meritocratic standards?\n\nOr are we ready to live in a nation where we can be confident that the doctor who walks through an emergency room door is there because of his medical expertise, not his race?\n\nHeather Mac Donald is the Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of “When Race Trumps Merit.” Adapted from City Journal.","summary":"President Trump ordered an end to disparate-impact analysis, which profoundly altered our society by claiming that a \"disparate outcome\" is enough to prove illegal discrimination.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-restores-merit-by-slaying-reverse-discrimination/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/2025-orders-focused-aspects-education-103185278_81ba63.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 23:56:55","author":"Heather Mac Donald","authors":["Heather Mac Donald"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":315814152,"title":"Trump Disses Taylor Swift–Again–During Eagles White House Visit","text":"President Donald Trump took another jab at Taylor Swift Monday when welcoming the Philadelphia Eagles at the White House. \n\nWhile celebrating the Eagles’ 2025 Super Bowl win against the Kansas City Chiefs–who boast Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce as their tight end–Trump turned his attention to the pop star during his speech.\n\n“I watched in person,” Trump recalled of the Super Bowl. “I was there along with Taylor Swift, how did that work out?”\n\n“How did that one work out?” he repeated. \n\nThe president has taken repeated jabs at Swift ever since she publicly endorsed his former presidential opponent Kamala Harris in September 2024. \n\nAt the time, Trump reacted to the singer’s endorsement by writing on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” \n\nHe also remarked on her endorsement in an interview with Fox & Friends that same month where he claimed Swift would “pay a price” for her presidential pick. \n\n“It was just a question of time.
