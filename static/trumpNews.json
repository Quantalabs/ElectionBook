After that hearing, the judge will sentence him at a date yet to be determined.\n\nUS authorities accuse Ovidio and his three brothers of leading Los Chapitos, a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel designated by the Trump administration as a global \"terrorist\" organisation.\n\nThe United States accuses the four of trafficking fentanyl into the United States, where the opioid epidemic is linked to tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nOvidio Guzman was extradited to the United States in 2023 to face narcotics charges, joining his father, one of the world's most infamous drug traffickers, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel is one of six Mexican drug trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by US President Donald Trump.\n\nAnother son, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, was arrested after arriving in the United States last July in a private plane with cartel co-founder Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, who claimed he had been kidnapped.\n\nThe arrests sparked cartel infighting that has left more than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missing in Sinaloa state, located in northwestern Mexico.\n\nOn Monday, the bodies of 20 people, several of them decapitated, were found on a highway bridge in a part of Mexico where factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel are fighting, authorities said.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/son-kingpin-el-chapo-plead-guilty-drug-trafficking-us-5214951","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--753B0TBX--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/mexico_sinaloa_cartel_65041.jpg?itok=yOE6k7P-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 01:16:16","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"SG","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":337274598,"title":"Love Island fans insist they know the 'real reason' Dejon is flirting with new stunning bombshell Bilikis despite being with Meg from day one","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jul 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove Island fans insist they know the 'real reason' Dejon is flirting with new stunning bombshell Bilikis despite being with Meg from day one\n\nHave YOU got a story?

Aid seekers killed The Red Cross warned that Gaza's few functioning medical facilities were overwhelmed, with nearly all public hospitals \"shut down or gutted by months of hostilities and restrictions\" on supplies.\"The International Committee of the Red Cross is deeply alarmed by the intensifying hostilities in Gaza City and Jabaliya, which have reportedly caused dozens of deaths and injuries among civilians over the past 36 hours,\" the ICRC said in a statement.Gaza's civil defense service said 16 people were killed near aid distribution sites in central and southern Gaza on Tuesday, in the latest in a spate of deadly attacks on those seeking food, with 10 others killed in other Israeli operations.Commenting on the incidents, the Israeli military told AFP its forces \"fired warning shots to distance suspects who approached the troops\", adding it was not aware of any injuries but would review the incidents.Referring to an incident in Rafah, it said the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters (yards) away from the aid distribution site\", which was \"not operating\".Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by rescuers. Aid reform call A group of 169 aid organizations called Monday for an end to Gaza's \"deadly\" new US- and Israeli-backed aid distribution scheme which they said was leading to civilian deaths.They urged a return to the UN-led aid mechanism that existed until March, when Israel imposed a full blockade on humanitarian assistance entering Gaza during an impasse in truce talks with Hamas.The new scheme's administrator, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has distanced itself from reports of aid seekers being killed near its centers. Netanyahu's US visit Netanyahu announced he would visit Trump and senior US security officials next week, amid mounting pressure to end the devastating fighting in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home.Trump, while visiting a migrant detention center in Florida, said Netanyahu \"wants to end it too.\"Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP the group is \"ready to agree to any proposal if it will lead to an end to the war and a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal of occupation forces\".\"So far, there has been no breakthrough.\"","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/02/trump-urges-60-day-gaza-ceasefire-deal-ahead-of-netanyahu-visit","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-08/21eeb803-fa0e-45e2-a427-7043726efdc1/trump

Worries over future US tariffs are clouding the outlook for factories across much of the United States, Asia and Europe, according to surveys released on Tuesday which nonetheless showed some were able to shrug off the uncertainty and keep growing.\n\nAmong the bright spots, Japan’s manufacturing read-out showed growth for the first time in 13 months, South Korea’s activity contracted at a milder pace and China’s Caixin PMI index also expanded in June - confounding an official survey that showed activity shrinking for a third straight month.\n\nIn Europe, Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands were among the star performers even as the wider euro zone read-out was broadly flat and Britain continued to contract, albeit more slowly. \n\nAnalysts said the underlying softness in surveys highlights the challenges facing businesses and policymakers as they try to navigate US President Donald Trump’s moves to shake up the global trade order with sweeping tariffs. “We must recognise that the external environment remains severe and complex, with increasing uncertainties,” said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group. The Caixin/S&P Global survey showed Chinese manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations in a Reuters poll.\n\nJapan’s final au Jibun Bank PMI rose to 50.1 due to an upswing in output, but overall demand remained weak as new orders shrank on concern over US tariffs. \n\nFactory activity in South Korea contracted for the fifth straight month though the pace of decline eased on relief over a snap presidential election on June 3 that ended six months of uncertainty. In manufacturing, India was a significant outlier in the region last month, as activity accelerated to a 14-month high, driven by a substantial rise in international sales that helped spark a record-breaking spurt in hiring.\n\nThat said, US activity contracted for a fourth straight month in June, the Institute for Supply Management reported, joining housing spending unemployment\n\nNegotiators from major US trading partners are rushing to reach deals with Trump’s administration by a July 9 deadline to avoid import tariffs jumping to higher levels.\n\nWhile China is continuing its negotiations for a broader trade deal with the US, Japan and South Korea have so far failed to win concessions on the tariffs imposed on their mainstay export items like automobiles. \n\nThe 27-member European Union is embarking on new talks in Washington later this week. The euro zone HCOB manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by S&P Global, edged up to 49.5 in June from 49.4 in May, its highest level since August 2022 - but still remaining below the 50 mark denoting growth in activity. \n\nMoreover, national surveys revealed stark differences across the currency bloc. Ireland recorded the highest PMI at a 37-month peak of 53.7, while Greece, Spain, and the Netherlands also posted readings above 50.\n\n“We seem to be in a sweet spot at the moment where it’s domestic activity that’s driving the index,” John Fahey, senior economist at AIB, said of the Irish read-out. “There may be some level of activity and investment that was postponed for two or three years, and you’re just at the point now where that has to happen, even though there’s a more uncertain global backdrop.” While Germany’s manufacturing PMI reached its highest in nearly three years, it still indicated contraction. France, Italy and Austria on the other hand registered faster declines in manufacturing conditions. \n\nIn Britain, outside the European Union, the manufacturing sector showed some signs of turning a corner in its long slump.\n\n“That said, any hoped for stabilisation remains fragile and subject to potential headwinds that could severely impact demand, supply chain reliability and future growth prospects,” said Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n\nSpeaking at the start of a central bankers’ annual get-together in Sintra, Portugal, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the global environment had changed fundamentally since the inflation spurt of the pandemic years.\n\n“The world ahead is more uncertain – and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile,” Lagarde said. Data on Tuesday showed euro zone inflation last month stood at the ECB’s 2% target, confirming that the era of runaway prices is over.\n\nIn the US, ISM reported its manufacturing PMI edged up to 49.0 from 48.5 in May thanks to a bit of shortening in long delivery times. Nonetheless, its measure of new orders fell for a fifth straight month, factory employment dropped and input prices ticked higher.","summary":"WASHINGTON/ LONDON/ TOKYO: Worries over future US tariffs are clouding the outlook for factories across much of the United States, Asia and Europe, according to surveys released on Tuesday which nonetheless showed some were able to shrug off the uncertainty and keep growing.\n\n\n\nAmong the bright spots, Japan’s manufacturing read-out showed growth for the first time in 13 months, South Korea’s activity contracted at a milder pace and China’s Caixin PMI index also expanded in June - confounding an official survey that showed activity shrinking for a third straight month.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands were among the star performers even as the wider euro zone read-out was broadly flat and Britain continued to contract, albeit more slowly. \n\n\n\nAnalysts said the underlying softness in surveys highlights the challenges facing businesses and policymakers as they try to navigate US President Donald Trump’s moves to shake up the global trade order with sweeping tariffs. “We must recognise that the ex","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40370566/tariff-risks-muddy-global-outlook-for-factories","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/07/68644678099ac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 01:01:37","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.148},{"id":337275982,"title":"Trump escalates feud with Musk","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that Elon Musk’s companies receive from the federal government, in an escalation of the war of words between the president and the world’s richest man, one-time allies who have since fallen out. \n\nThe feud reignited on Monday when Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump’s re-election, renewed his criticism of Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla, the leading US EV maker. \n\n“He’s upset that he’s losing his EV mandate and … he’s very upset about things but he can lose a lot more than that,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.

The bill now heads back to the House of Representatives for final approval. \n\nTrump has pushed lawmakers to get it to his desk to sign into law by the July 4 Independence Day holiday. Trump’s Republicans have had to navigate a narrow path while shepherding the 940-page bill through a Congress that they control by the slimmest of margins. \n\nWith Democrats lined up in opposition, Republicans have had only three votes to spare in both the House and Senate as they wrangled over specific tax breaks and healthcare policies that could reshape entire industries and leave millions of people uninsured. \n\nYet they have managed to stay largely unified so far. Only three of the Senate’s 53 Republicans joined with Democrats to vote against the package, which passed 51-50 after Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote. \n\nThe vote in the House, where Republicans hold a 220-212 majority, is likely to be close as well. \n\n‘NOT FISCAL -RESPONSIBILITY’ \n\nAn initial version passed with only two votes to spare in May, and several Republicans in that chamber have said they do not support the version that has emerged from the Senate, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $800 billion more to the national debt than the House version. \n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of hardline conservatives who repeatedly threatened to withhold their support for the tax bill, is pushing for more spending cuts than what the Senate offered. \n\n“The Senate’s version adds $651 billion to the deficit — and that’s before interest costs, which nearly double the total,” the caucus posted online on Monday, “That’s not fiscal responsibility. It’s not what we agreed to.” \n\nA group of more moderate House Republicans, especially those who represent lower-income areas, object to the steeper Medicaid cuts in the Senate’s plan. “I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams our hospitals rely on,” Representative David Valadao, a California Republican, said during the weekend debate. \n\nStill, House Republicans are likely to face enormous pressure to fall in line from Trump in the days to come. \n\nTAX BREAKS, IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN, TIGHTER BENEFITS The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would make permanent Trump’s 2017 business and personal income tax cuts, which are due to expire at the end of this year, and dole out new tax breaks for tipped income, overtime and seniors that he promised during the 2024 election. It provides tens of billions of dollars for Trump’s immigration crackdown and would repeal many of Democratic President Joe Biden’s green-energy incentives. \n\nThe bill would also tighten eligibility for food and health safety net programs, which nonpartisan analysts say would effectively reduce income for poorer Americans who would have to pay for more of those costs. \n\nThe CBO estimates the latest version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the $36.2 trillion debt pile. That increased debt effectively serves as a wealth transfer from younger to older Americans, nonpartisan analysts say, as it will slow economic growth, raise borrowing costs and crowd out other government spending in the decades to come. \n\nThe bill also would raise the nation’s borrowing limit by $5 trillion, postponing the prospect of a debt default this summer that would roil global markets. Republicans rejected the cost estimate generated by the CBO’s longstanding methodology. Nonetheless, foreign bond investors see incentives to diversify out of US Treasuries as deficits deepen. \n\nRepublicans say the bill will help families and small businesses and put benefit programs like Medicaid on a more sustainable path, and they have broadly agreed on its main contours. But they have struggled to agree on the Medicaid funding mechanism and a tax break for state and local tax payments that is a top priority for a handful of House Republicans from high-tax states including New York, New Jersey and California. \n\nOthers worry that a crackdown on a funding mechanism for the Medicaid health program could lead to service cutbacks in rural areas.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The Republican-controlled US Senate passed President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill on Tuesday, signing off on a massive package that would enshrine many of his top priorities into law while adding $3.3 trillion to the national debt.

That works out to 88 deaths every hour, according to the tracker. After USAID was gutted, several other major donors, including France, Germany and the UK, followed suit in announcing plans to slash their foreign aid budgets. \n\nThese aid reductions, particularly in the European Union, could lead to “even more additional deaths in the coming years,” study co-author Caterina Monti of ISGlobal said.","summary":"PARIS: More than 14 million of the world’s most vulnerable people, a third of them small children, could die by 2030 because of the Trump administration’s dismantling of US foreign aid, research projected on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe study in the prestigious Lancet journal was published as world and business leaders gather for a United Nations conference in Spain this week hoping to bolster the reeling aid sector.\n\n\n\nThe US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided over 40 percent of global humanitarian funding until Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. \n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, Trump’s then-close advisor — and world’s richest man — Elon Musk boasted of having put the agency “through the woodchipper”.\n\n\n\nThe funding cuts “risk abruptly halting — and even reversing — two decades of progress in health among vulnerable populations”, warned study co-author Davide Rasella, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).\n\n\n\n“For many low- and middle-income countries, the resul","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40370666/over-14m-people-could-die-from-us-foreign-aid-cuts","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/07/686480a3e01b6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 01:01:36","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":337276158,"title":"Oil rises on signs of strong demand","text":"NEW YORK: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as investors took stock of positive demand indicators, while also treading cautiously ahead of an OPEC+ meeting to decide the group’s August output policy.

Four OPEC+ sources told Reuters last week that the group plans to raise output by 411,000 bpd next month when it meets on July 6. “All eyes will be on OPEC+’s decision over the weekend, when the group is expected to add another 411,000 bpd of production in an effort to gain more market share, primarily over the US shale producers,” StoneX energy analyst Alex Hodes wrote to clients. \n\nBesides gaining market share from US shale producers, which pumped oil at a record pace in April according to official data released on Monday, the group has also been trying to punish overproducing members. OPEC+ member Kazakhstan, one of world’s 10 largest oil producers, raised oil production last month to match an all-time high, a source familiar with the data told Reuters on Tuesday. \n\nSaudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the OPEC+ group, raised its June crude oil exports to the fastest rate in a year, data from Kpler showed. “These exports are flooding out even faster than the OPEC+ deal implies during the summer when peak domestic demand typically keeps oil supplies closer to home,” Hodes said. \n\nInvestors are also watching trade negotiations ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline of July 9. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that countries could be notified of sharply higher tariffs despite good-faith negotiations as that deadline approaches, when tariff rates are scheduled to revert from a temporary 10% level to the ones Trump announced on April 2 and then suspended. The European Union wants immediate relief from tariffs in key sectors as part of any trade deal with the US due by the July 9 deadline, EU diplomats told Reuters.","summary":"NEW YORK: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as investors took stock of positive demand indicators, while also treading cautiously ahead of an OPEC+ meeting to decide the group’s August output policy.

US District Judge Richard Leon in Washington ruled that Trump violated federal law when he appointed Pete Marocco the new head of the US African Development Foundation, or USDAF, because Marocco was never confirmed by Congress. Also Read | Rajnath Singh Speaks to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Appreciates 'Unwavering Support' in Fight Against Terrorism. As a result, Marocco's actions -- terminating most of the agency's employees and effectively ending the agency's grants -- are void and must be undone, the judge found. Congress created USADF as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the US Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated USD 46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries. Also Read | 'Elon Musk May Have To Close Up Shop, Head Back Home to South Africa Without EV Subsidies': Donald Trump Issues Deportation Warning for Tesla and SpaceX CEO. On February 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the US Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. Trump also fired the agency's board members and installed Marocco as the board chair. Two USDAF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF sued on May 21, challenging Marocco's appointment and saying the deep cuts to the agency prevented it from carrying out its congressionally mandated functions. The staffers and consulting firm asked the judge for a preliminary injunction, saying Marocco's “slash-and-burn approach” threatened to reduce the agency to rubble before their lawsuit is resolved. They said the Federal Vacancies Reform Act prohibited Marocco's appointment to USADF, and that the same law requires that any actions done by an unlawfully appointed person must be unwound. “This is a victory for the rule of law and the communities that rely on USADF's vital work,” said Joel McElvain, senior legal advisor at Democracy Forward, the organisation representing the USDAF staffers and consulting firm in their lawsuit. “We will continue fighting against these power grabs to protect USADF's ability to fulfil the mission that Congress gave it to perform.” US Attorney Jeanine Pirro had written in court documents that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act doesn't apply to USADF, and that the president has the authority to designate acting members of the agency's board until the Senate confirms his nominees. Any claims about the cuts themselves, Pirro said, must be handled in the Court of Federal Claims, not the federal district court. The judge found in a separate case that Trump had the legal authority to fire the previous members of the USADF board. Pirro wrote in court documents in that case that the president also has the legal authority to appoint someone to run the USADF, consistent with Trump's policy goals, until the Senate could confirm his nominees.

Trump was touring the newly built Alligator Alcatraz migrant camp in the Everglades and was interacting with reporters. \"Biden wanted me in here, OK?\" the President told reporters while inside a large white tent lined with dog kennel-style chain-link-fence pens for prisoners. \"It didn’t work out that way, but he wanted me in here, that son of a bitch,\" Trump said, in presence of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump is already facing four criminal cases as he campaigned against Biden last year for a second non-consecutive term. He is the first former president to face criminal charges and consistently claimed the four cases were the result of \"weaponization\" of the Biden Justice Department. If convicted, Trump would have faced a de facto life sentence. He was charged with serious counts related to allegedly mishandling national security documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Democrat Biden dropped from the re-election bid last July after his own party leaders went against him over his apparent cognitive decline. Last Week, the President had left the White House on Tuesday for the NATO summit at The Hague.

The rare diplomatic designation has no immediate practical effect but reflected the broader anger of President Nicolás Maduro at the UN agency that monitors and defends human rights.

It comes just days after Turk said his office has documented increasing arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances and torture under Maduro's government. “Turk turns a blind eye to atrocious crimes,” said National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, who is also Maduro's chief negotiator with the US.

Turk recently urged the US to halt deportations of Venezuelans who may be at risk of arrest in their home country and raised concerns about the lack of due process in mass deportations from the US. The ire of Venezuela's National Assembly appeared to have been energised by Turk's speech to the Human Rights Council in Geneva last Friday. Turk raised alarm over an intensifying crackdown on civil liberties in the wake of Venezuela's parliamentary elections in June and the unrest that followed Maduro's disputed re-election last year -- echoing past statements of concern from his agency and other watchdogs. Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner of the July 2024 presidential election despite credible evidence to the contrary. “I am very concerned by detention conditions, including people being denied access to medical care, and lacking access to food and water,” he told the council last week. “Some prisoners were subjected to incommunicado detention.” Lawmakers called on Maduro to withdraw Venezuela's membership from the Human Rights Council while Turk remains in his post. Turk's office offered no immediate response to the National Assembly decision. The move Tuesday raised new questions over the status of the UN human rights office in Venezuela's capital of Caracas, which partially resumed operations last December -- months after Maduro's government forced it to close and expelled its staff, accusing the agency's employees of aiding “coup-plotters and terrorists” as tensions surged in the run-up to the presidential election.

Talking about the possibility that the signing of an India-US trade deal was imminent, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt firmly declared: “India remains a very strategic ally in the Asia-Pacific. And the President has a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi and he will continue to have that.”\n\nFrom India’s perspective, that is reassuring. Less than two weeks ago, Trump was sharing a hearty lunch with Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir. India’s top diplomats were aghast at this unprecedented get-together barely five weeks after the May India-Pakistan mini-war. Was it a rebuke to India? Or a reward for Pakistan proposing Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nWhat’s more, Munir has emerged as the most belligerent Pakistan army chief in decades — perhaps since Yahya Khan. On Saturday, during a Pakistan Navy passing out parade, telling new recruits that, “What India terms terrorism is, in fact, a legitimate struggle as per international conventions.” He kept up the fiery tirade, adding: “The world must realise that without a just and peaceful resolution to the Kashmir issue, regional peace will forever remain elusive.”\n\nStrong language indeed, and Munir’s fourth anti-Indian speech in the last two months. Many speculate Munir is positioning himself for higher office and also looking to cut off all support for former Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\nSo here you have a Pakistan army chief primed for confrontation — and an Oval Office occupant arguably as unpredictable as any in recent times. Meanwhile, Russia remains locked in fierce combat with Ukraine and is moving closer to China, which not only buys Russian oil but also invests heavily in the Russian Far East. Ideally, we must turn to the US, but India has slipped down Washington’s priority list for now.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is in Washington this week for the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting. But he isn’t expected to take part in the trade talks that have stretched out longer than expected. It was thought that a deal had been stitched up on Friday and that India’s negotiating team would soon return. That, it turns out, was wishful thinking. Leavitt insisted on Monday: “You’ll hear from the President and his trade team very soon when it comes to India.” But with nearly 12,000 items still under discussion, no deal will close until the last ‘t’ is crossed and the last ‘i’ is dotted.\n\nRegional bloc\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan and China are talking about creating a regional bloc that would replace SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) which has effectively become defunct. SAARC’s last meeting was in 2014 and another meeting scheduled to take place in Pakistan was scrapped after India refused to attend in the wake of the Uri attack.\n\nThe regional bloc would aim to include almost all the South Asian countries except India — a very glaring omission but one both China and Pakistan would be quite happy with. We will, of course, be invited to join but would we want to be a part of such an organisation where China will be holding the reins?\n\nWe got a taste of what could go wrong at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting where Rajnath Singh was presented with a draft statement that mentioned the Balochistan train hijacking but not the Pahalgam attack. Singh could be seen quietly putting down his pen and refusing to sign.\n\nIndia needs to strengthen ties with the US more than ever. But with Trump in the Oval Office, that path remains fraught. Trump is above all a dealmaker and even friends emerge bruised, sometimes more so than supposed enemies. He also faces broader challenges: the dollar sits at a four-year low, and his former ally Elon Musk has launched a full-scale war on Trump and the GOP. Musk labelled Trump’s latest spending bill “Insane,” renamed the party the “Porky Pig Party,” and added that it is: “Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.” He added more specifically: “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day.” On an even more ballistic note, he has threatened every member of Congress who campaigned for lower spending and has voted for this bill that, “they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”\n\nIndia will have to tread cautiously in this confused and tangled minefield, where every move could prove treacherous.\n\nPublished on July 2, 2025","summary":"Delhi’s strategy in peril amid Trump’s erratic tactics and looming trade tariff cliff","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/quite-a-churn-in-india-us-ties/article69761091.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/525iha/article69761096.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-02-07T140255Z_1681408576_RC2PPCA9RUBL_RTRMADP_3_USA-INDIA-MODI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:45:00","author":"Paran Balakrishna","authors":["Paran Balakrishna"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":337272916,"title":"World News | Jaishankar, Japanese Foreign Minister Discuss Upcoming India-Japan Summit on Quad Sidelines","text":"Washington DC [US], July 2 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, on the sidelines of the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting (QFMM) in Washington, focusing on preparations for the annual India-Japan Prime Ministerial Summit later this year.\nS Jaishankar, in his opening remark, exuded confidence on adding to the dynamism and the quality of the relationship between both nations during the upcoming summit.

Zeus’ law smashed to pieces. I’m without a king since my master died. He knew it was an unwinnable war. And then, somehow, he won it,' the narrator says.\n\n Tom Holland is seen filming The Odyssey for the first time with Christopher Nolan in Greece \nThe trailer shows brief shots of the sea - along with what appears to be a mammoth statue of a Trojan Horse.\nThen the trailer shows Jon Bernthal's unnamed character, who says, 'I know nothing of Odysseus, not since Troy, as Odysseus' son Telemachus (Tom Holland) says, 'I have to find out what happened to my father. When did you last see him?'\nBernthal's character shouts to the room, 'Who has a story about Odysseus? You? You have a story? Some say he’s rich. Some say he’s poor. Some said he perished. Some said he’s imprisoned,' along with random shots from the film.\nThe trailer ends with an old man laying on pieces of driftwood, presumably Damon's title character.\nWhile they were not shown in the trailer, the star-studded cast of The Odyssey also includes Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron and Mia Goth. \nThe film will be the most expensive of Nolan's career, and also the first film in history to shoot entirely on IMAX cameras.\n\nThe trailer begins with an unknown narrator speaking about the title character Odysseus (Matt Damon), who, in the original poem is trying to return home to his wife Penelope after his victory in The Trojan War.\n\nThe film will be the most expensive of Nolan's career, and also the first film in history to shoot entirely on IMAX cameras.\nFilming started back in February on location in Greece, Morocco, Italy, Iceland and Los Angeles, with filming also expected to happen in Britain, Scotland and Ireland.\nNolan is directing from his own screenplay - based on the epic poem by Homer that dates back to the 8th Century BC and was first published in English in 1614. \nHomer's The Iliad and The Odyssey are two of the oldest surviving works of literature to this date, both considered classics.\nThere have been numerous foreign language adaptations of The Odyssey throughout the years, plus a 1997 mini-series starring Armand Assante and the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou, which is loosely based on The Odyssey.\nThe Odyssey will be the sole new release in theater on July 17, 2026, as of now, with both Holland and Bernthal hitting screens as Spider-Man and Punisher, respectively, just two weeks later in Spider-Man: Brand New Day on July 31, 2026. \nMatt DamonChristopher Nolan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChristopher Nolan's The Odyssey trailer leaks online from early screenings of Jurassic World: Rebirth\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

UVA allegedly kept its programs, instead renaming them in an effort to conceal them, which led to an investigation by the Department of Justice. \n\nReactions to Ryan’s announcement have been mixed. \n\nMike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, told The Daily Signal, “This is an important victory in Trump’s crusade to recapture control of our universities. UVA is an important school, and Harvard is an important school, and I believe Trump is going to win with Harvard as well.” \n\nFrederick Hess, senior fellow and Director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, posted about the matter on X. \n\nHess wrote: “As one who was bullied out of the University of Virginia 23 years ago, I find this a very personal dispute. … While I have not been privy to the private exchanges between DOJ and UVA (and may revise my opinion if additional information surfaces), I find it deeply troubling that the DOJ appears to have conditioned access to federal funds on Ryan’s resignation.” \n\nRyan released a statement on June 27 announcing his decision. Though he wrote that he made the decision “with a very heavy heart,” the president stated that he would not let his personal concerns in the matter endanger hundreds of employees, researchers, and students at the university who, he wrote, would lose their jobs, funding, and visas were he to remain president at UVA. \n\nThe resignation has placed Trump’s battle with higher education in the spotlight once more. Though Ryan never mentioned DEI concerns or the investigation by the DOJ explicitly, his resignation letter, arriving in the wake of a DOJ investigation, referred to his decision not to “fight the federal government.” \n\nThe Trump administration’s dismantling of DEI at universities began when it pulled billions of dollars from Harvard’s funding. According to a New York Times report on Thursday, the administration had communicated privately with UVA in the last month with similar threats if Ryan refused to resign. \n\nThe U.S. Department of Education launched investigations in March of DEI practices at universities that allegedly violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin at any federally funded institution. The department named over 50 institutions, including other elite universities like Yale, Cornell, Duke, Notre Dame, Georgetown, and MIT. \n\nThe DOJ issued a letter to Ryan and board Rector Robert Hardie on April 28 demanding a report from the university on its “dissolution and dismantling of DEI” practices. The letter referenced two previous documents, sent April 11 and 18, that had requested the same thing and went unanswered by the school. \n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Ryan and UVA’s board of visitors for comment but did not receive one as of publication time.","summary":"Fallout continues in wake of the news that University of Virginia President James Ryan will be stepping down from his role as President Donald Trump’s...

The lawsuit seeks to halt further construction at the site.\n\n“The site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other iconic species. This scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect,” Samples said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump visited the controversial facility Tuesday along with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. It will have heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state of Florida said it will soon have 5,000 beds in operation there.\n\nOn potential environmental damage to the Everglades, Trump said, “We’ll be gone a million years, and this land will still be here … I think it was a brilliant choice, and I think almost anybody in his or her right mind would say this was a brilliant choice.”\n\nSamples said the campaigns rolled out by Florida politicians that announced the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz” ignored the environmental impacts.\n\nDHS responded to the lawsuit, calling it “lazy,” and added that the group is ignoring that the land in question has been developed for years.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n() An organizer with a Florida conservationist group is alleging a lack&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Environmental Advocate Criticizes Lack of Transparency in &#8216;Alligator Alcatraz&#8217; Plan first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/environmental-advocate-criticizes-lack-of-transparency-in-alligator-alcatraz-plan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-039Alligator-Alcatraz039-plan-lacks-transparency-Environmental-advocate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:32:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":337270498,"title":"Cheryl 'is in talks for TV return' five years after her last on-screen gig as she 'kickstarts career comeback' after ex Liam Payne's death","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jul 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiddy's mask finally slips: The courtroom picture that says EVERYTHING as jury reaches verdict on four charges and is ordered to keep deliberating on fifth\n\nHumiliation as Keir Starmer wins vote on welfare only after farcical climbdown on welfare reform plans\n\nProsecutors are looking at charging serial killer nurse Lucy Letby with MORE baby murders\n\nNewly widowed, my kind father fell for the town tramp.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:01:14 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:01:31 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nCheryl could reportedly be set for a return to TV as she's being eyed up for a mentoring role on the next series of The Voice. \nThe former Girls Aloud star's last appeared on TV as a dance captain on The Greatest Dancer back in 2019. \nBut according to The Sun, Cheryl may be making her talent show return alongside her longtime pal Will.i.am as a guest mentor mentor on The Voice. \nThe 14th series is reportedly set to see a return of the Battle Rounds and Cheryl is said to be in talks to mentor Will.i.am's team.\nA source said: 'Will.i.am and Cheryl first worked together 16 years ago and have remained good friends ever since.\n'She was the obvious choice to mentor his team when the Battle Rounds return four years after being axed.\n\nCheryl could reportedly be set for a return to TV as she's being eyed up for a mentoring role on the next series of The Voice (Seen in 2022)\n\nThe former Girls Aloud star's last appeared on TV as a dance captain on The Greatest Dancer back in 2019 (Pictured)\n'A lot has happened in Cheryl's personal life since she was last working on a talent show — BBC's The Greatest Dancer — so she's taking baby steps to put herself back out there. \n'Teaming up with will.i.am as a guest mentor seems the perfect way to kick-start her comeback.'\nThe series will reportedly air next year and the source said there are hopes Cheryl will agree to sign on permanently. \nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Cheryl for comment. \nCheryl's possible return to work comes after the tragic death of her former partner Liam Payne, who is the father of her son Bear. \nIn the six years between Liam's split from Cheryl and the singer's untimely death in Argentina, he became engaged to model Maya Henry and was reportedly talking marriage with his girlfriend of two years, Kate Cassidy, before he died. \nBut despite moving on romantically from the Girls Aloud singer, the One Direction star made his feelings very clear, hailing her as 'the most important person' in his life, and praising her for always being there for him, despite their split. \nThe former couple lived just minutes away from each other and before his death Liam revealed their relationship was stronger than ever, describing Cheryl as 'the best mum in the world' to co-parent with. \n\nThe 14th series is reportedly set to see a return of the Battle Rounds and Cheryl is said to be in talks to mentor Will.i.am's team (Seen in 2010)\n\nA source said: 'Will.i.am and Cheryl first worked together 16 years ago and have remained good friends ever since' (Seen in 2009)\n\nCheryl was later revealed to have the heartbreaking task of raising her son without his father, but a new dimension to that task emerged when it was revealed that Liam died without leaving a will. \nIt meant that his £24million fortune will go to Bear, and Cheryl has been named administrator, meaning she will be entrusted with protecting the money for her son. \nIt is unknown whether Liam, 31, had considered this outcome when thinking about his affairs, but regardless Cheryl, 41, has been entrusted with a huge responsibility on behalf of her ex-partner. \nMeanwhile, the lack of will means that Liam did not make any direct provision for his father Geoff and mother Karen, his two sisters and wider family, or other loved ones such as his partner Kate Cassidy. \nBut perhaps it seems appropriate that the responsibility of dealing with his estate has gone to Cheryl, along with music industry lawyer Richard Mark Bray, given the depth of their bond.\nLiam couldn't help gushing about his former partner in interviews saying that he 'couldn't ask for more' in the mother of his child. \nWhile Cheryl has always been more guarded, the remarks she did make about Liam publicly were telling. \nIn a 2018 interview, she claimed he was the only man who had never cheated on her, and she has never publicly dated anyone since they split up in 2018. \n\nCheryl's possible return to work comes after the tragic death of her former partner Liam Payne, who is the father of her son Bear (Seen in 2016)\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline in 2019, Cheryl insisted that things were going good with Liam and that they were navigating their way through parenthood well\nLiam and Cheryl first met when Liam auditioned for The X Factor back in 2008 as a fresh-faced 14-year-old.\nRumours of a romance emerged in 2016 when Liam shared a picture of a tattoo on his hand, thought to be a tribute to Cheryl's giant rose tattoo on her lower back and posterior. \nIn March 2016, they became 'Instagram official' and months later, made their first public appearance at Cannes Film Festival and after more rumours, it was confirmed that Cheryl was pregnant with their son Bear. \nHowever, in July 2018, Cheryl confirmed she and Liam had sadly split in a tweet, writing: 'We are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make.\n'We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.'\nBut despite ending things romantically, the pair continued to be bonded through their son, and stayed close over the years as they co-parented Bear, with Liam later declaring: 'Cheryl's always there for me.'\nKate CassidyThe VoiceGirls Aloud\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCheryl 'is in talks for TV return' five years after her last on-screen gig as she 'kickstarts career comeback' after ex Liam Payne's death\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Prediction market Kalshi told CNBC on Tuesday that its traders forecast deliveries of around 364,000.\n\nShares in the electric vehicle maker had been rising after Tesla started a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in late June and CEO Elon Musk boasted of its first \"driverless delivery\" of a car to a customer there.\n\nThe stock price took a turn after Musk on Saturday reignited a feud with President Donald Trump over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the massive spending bill that the commander-in-chief endorsed. The bill is now heading for a final vote in the House.\n\nThat legislation would benefit higher-income households in the U.S. while slashing spending on programs such as Medicaid and food assistance.\n\nMusk did not object to cuts to those specific programs. However, Musk on X said the bill would worsen the U.S. deficit and raise the debt ceiling. The bill includes tax cuts that would add around $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has also criticized aspects of the bill that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars in support for renewable energy development in the U.S. and phase out tax credits for electric vehicles.\n\nSuch changes could hurt Tesla as they are expected to lower EV sales by roughly 100,000 vehicles per year by 2035, according to think tank Energy Innovation.\n\nThe bill is also expected to reduce renewable energy development by more than 350 cumulative gigawatts in that same time period, according to Energy Innovation. That could pressure Tesla's Energy division, which sells solar and battery energy storage systems to utilities and other clean energy project developers.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that Musk was, \"upset that he's losing his EV mandate,\" but that the tech CEO could \"lose a lot more than that.\" Trump was alluding to the subsidies, incentives and contracts that Musk's many businesses have relied on.\n\nSpaceX has received over $22 billion from work with the federal government since 2008, according to FedScout, which does federal spending and government contract research. That includes contracts from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and Space Force, among others.\n\nTesla has reported $11.8 billion in sales of \"automotive regulatory credits,\" or environmental credits, since 2015, according to an evaluation of the EV maker's financial filings by Geoff Orazem, CEO of FedScout.\n\nThese incentives are largely derived from federal and state regulations in the U.S. that require automakers to sell some number of low-emission vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla, which often have an excess.\n\nRegulatory credit sales go straight to Tesla's bottom line. Credit revenue amounted to approximately 60% of Tesla's net income in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWATCH: Threats to SpaceX & Tesla as Musk, Trump feud heats up","summary":"Tesla shares dropped 7% from Friday's closing price of $323.63 to the $300.71 close on Tuesday ahead of the company's second-quarter deliveries report.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/01/tesla-shares-fall-7percent-ahead-deliveries-musk-trump-feud.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108155428-1749145124283-gettyimages-2215661757-TRUMP_RAMAPHOSA.jpeg?v=1749145163","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M07D01/7000381052/1751385595-40518918348-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:29:51","author":"Lora Kolodny","authors":["Lora Kolodny"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":337272344,"title":"ICE Agents in the Midwest Increasingly Detain Individuals Without Prior Criminal Records","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — President Donald Trump campaigned with a promise to deport large numbers of criminal offenders, and while U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained over 38,000 migrants with criminal records, updated data indicates a recent change in focus, with more arrests of individuals who have not been accused of any crimes.\n\nDuring the initial four months of Trump’s second term, the Deportation Data Project reveals that ICE detained 4,775 individuals in the Chicago Area of Responsibility, which encompasses Illinois and five surrounding states.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7.

The decision reportedly followed an internal review of American weapons reserves ordered by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, amid rising concerns about the rate at which munitions are being depleted.\n\nThe move reportedly affects dozens of Patriot missile interceptors, Stinger and AIM air-to-air missiles, hundreds of Hellfire and GMLRS systems, as well as thousands of 155mm artillery shells that Washington had previously pledged to Kiev. Some of the weapons were already positioned in Europe have now been withheld before handover to Ukrainian forces, NBC reported.\n\nThe weapons in question had been funded under the Biden administration through two mechanisms: direct drawdowns from existing US military stockpiles and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts new production from defense contractors. The Trump administration has not requested any additional Ukraine aid, and existing resources are expected to last only “several more months,” according to Politico.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly defended the move as a necessary step to prioritize American defense needs. “This decision was made to put America’s interests first following a DOD review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe. The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned – just ask Iran,” she said, without confirming any details.\n\nThe decision to freeze or slow-walk the remaining aid without formal notice to Congress may raise legal concerns similar to the 2019 withholding of some Ukraine assistance under Trump’s first administration –a move the Government Accountability Office ruled unlawful at the time, Politico noted.\n\nKiev has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it sees as dwindling support from Washington. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky met with President Donald Trump at the NATO summit in The Hague last week but received no firm promises. Trump said Patriots were “very hard to get” and that the US needed them for its own defense and for Israel.\n\nTrump has stated he intends to negotiate a ceasefire with Moscow and bring the conflict to an end. Hegseth said last month that the White House is reducing military funding for Kiev as part of its “America First” strategy and in hopes of achieving a diplomatic settlement.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration signed a deal giving the US priority access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth –a step the White House said would allow America to “get back” some of the hundreds of billions spent under Biden.\n\nThe Pentagon’s policy shift appears to reflect a broader realignment under Trump, who has publicly questioned the rationale behind endless aid to Ukraine. Russian presidential envoy and head of the Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, noted that the move “highlights the real limits of Western capacity and the shifting priorities of the US military.”","summary":"The US has reportedly paused deliveries of precision missiles, artillery shells, and air defense interceptors as its own arsenal runs low \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/620863-pentagon-ukraine-missile-shortage/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/68647b662030270dfa3aaa18.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:27:57","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":337272428,"title":"Kristi Noem Says Trump Is “Upholding Freedom” by Deporting Cannibals","text":"Speaking at a press conference in Florida with Donald Trump, Noem claimed that the president’s deportation push, which she is overseeing, is about “upholding freedom…the freedom to live safely in this country and to do things legally and to have justice.” The administration, she said, is “going after murderers and rapists and traffickers and drug dealers and getting them off the streets and getting them out of this country, because Joe Biden let the worst of the worst come in here.” You may have heard that, according to CBS News, the arrests of immigrants without criminal histories have spiked, and only about 8% of detainees have been convicted of violent crimes—but that’s not what Noem wanted to talk about.\n“The other day,” she told reporters, “I was talking to some marshals that had been partnering with ICE. They said that they had detained a cannibal and put him on a plane to take him home. And while they had him in his seat, he started to eat himself, and they had to get him off and get him medical attention. These are the kind of deranged individuals that are on our streets in America, that we’re trying to target and get out of our country because they are so deranged they don’t belong here.”\nSpeaking of cannibals, Trump brought up Hannibal Lecter again last week, reminding people that while campaigning for president, he talked a lot about the Silence of the Lambs character. As he was bragging about the “record number” of deportations his administration has carried out, he declared: “We’re bringing criminals out by the thousands—nobody can even imagine. They let people in that were murderers—11,888 murderers, gang members, people from mental institutions and insane asylums. You know what that is? Insane asylum? That’s a mental institution on steroids. During the campaign, I’d talk about the late, great Hannibal Lecter. Do you know who that is? Hannibal Lecter?

(EPA Images pic)PARIS: Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin spoke Tuesday by telephone for the first time in over two-and-a-half years, with the French president urging a ceasefire in Ukraine but Russia’s leader hitting back by blaming the West for the conflict.One week after a ceasefire ended Israel’s 12-day war with Iran, the two men also discussed Tehran’s nuclear programme, with Macron suggesting Moscow and Paris work together to de-escalate tensions.Fighting still raged on the ground in Ukraine more than three years after Russia’s full-scale February 2022 invasion of its neighbour sparked the war, with efforts to agree a truce at a standstill.Ukrainian drones hit the Russian city of Izhevsk on Tuesday, killing three people and wounding dozens in one of the deepest strikes inside Russia of the conflict, authorities said.The talks lasted for more than two hours and Macron and Putin agreed to hold more contacts on Ukraine and Iran in the future, the French presidency said.Macron “emphasised France’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” and “called for the establishment, as soon as possible, of a ceasefire and the launch of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia for a solid and lasting settlement of the conflict”, said the Elysee Palace.A Kremlin statement said Putin reminded Macron that “the Ukrainian conflict is a direct consequence of the policy of Western states”.Putin added that Western states had “for many years ignored Russia’s security interests” and “created an anti-Russian bridgehead in Ukraine”.The Kremlin said Putin told his French counterpart that any peace deal should be “comprehensive and long-term, provide for the elimination of the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis and be based on new territorial realities.”Macron had alerted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of his plans to speak with Putin, and talked to him afterwards, Macron’s office said without providing further details.‘Coordinate efforts’ on IranOn Iran, “the two presidents decided to coordinate their efforts and to speak soon in order to follow up together on this issue”, the French presidency added.Macron has previously urged Iran to ease tensions by moving to “zero enrichment” of uranium in its nuclear programme.Russia, which like France is a permanent member of the UN security council, has a cordial relationship with Iran’s clerical leadership and has long urged a diplomatic solution to the standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme.“He expressed his determination to seek a diplomatic solution that would allow for a lasting and demanding settlement of the nuclear issue, the question of Iran’s missiles and its role in the region,” the Elysee said.The Kremlin said Putin emphasised “the lawful right of Tehran in developing a civilian” nuclear programme.It said both presidents agreed that the conflict over Iran’s nuclear activities and other Middle Eastern conflicts should be solved “exclusively” by diplomatic means and that the two leaders would “continue contacts” on this.Macron tried in a series of calls in 2022 to warn Putin against invading Ukraine and travelled to Moscow

toughened his line against Russia, saying its expansionism is a threat to all of Europe.In April 2024, Russia’s then defence minister Sergei Shoigu and French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu, a close

more than 1,000km from the front line, has arms production facilities including factories that make attack drones and the Kalashnikov rifle.A Ukraine security services source said Kyiv had targeted an Izhevsk-based drone manufacturer and that the attack had disrupted Moscow’s “offensive potential”.Russian forces in turn struck the town of Guliaipole in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, causing “casualties and fatalities”, Ukraine’s southern defence forces said, without specifying numbers.Macron’s call with Putin comes as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stalled in recent

third consecutive month, according to another AFP analysis based on data from US-based Institute for the Study of War.","summary":"The French president urges a ceasefire during the phone call, but

Title IX agreement with Trump admin","text":"The University of Pennsylvania agreed to a resolution with President Donald Trump's administration to keep males out of women's sports and apologize to every woman swimmer who was affected by the presence of trans athlete Lia Thomas in the 2021-22 season. However, a lawsuit against the university by three former women's swimmers over their experience in sharing a team with Thomas is still active. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Former UPenn swimmers Grace Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist filed their lawsuit against the university, Harvard University, the NCAA and the Ivy League back on Feb. 5. The suit alleges university officials led them to feel their concerns over being teammates with Thomas were rooted in a \"psychological problem,\" and that by allowing Thomas to compete, the institutions \"injured them and violated federal law.\" The activist group funding the lawsuit, the Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS), released a statement on Tuesday addressing UPenn's resolution. \"In less than three weeks, lawyers for the University of Pennsylvania will appear in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts. They have informed the court that they will argue the university did not violate Title IX by allowing Lia Thomas to compete on the women’s swim team,\" the statement claimed. \"Will UPenn now admit to the federal judge—just as they did to the Trump Administration today—that they violated Title IX? Or will they continue fighting against accountability and against UPenn’s female swimmers in court?\" Meanwhile, Former UPenn swimmer Paula Scanlan, who is not part of the lawsuit but was one of the first of Thomas' teammates to speak out against the situation, shared the email she received from the university apologizing. ICONS added in its statement that Tuesday's announcement should serve as a warning to other institutions. \"We, along with the female athletes we represent, are grateful to the Trump Administration and the Department of Education for their commitment to restoring justice in women’s sports. Today’s announcement, concerning one of the most notorious violations of Title IX, sends a clear message to all educational institutions: denying women equal opportunities and the right to privacy is unequivocally wrong,\" the statement continued. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE \"ICONS remains dedicated to holding organizations like the NCAA, the Ivy League, and the University of Pennsylvania accountable, ensuring that legal precedents are set so such violations can never happen again.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to UPenn for a response to the ICONS statement. Thomas, a biological male, previously competed for the UPenn men's swimming team from 2017-20 under the name Will Thomas. According to the lawsuit, Thomas was introduced by women's swimming head coach Mike Schnur to the women's swimmers during a team meeting in Fall 2019 as their incoming teammate. Each of the three plaintiffs claims the experience left them \"repeatedly emotionally traumatized.\" The plaintiffs allege that the university administrators pushed pro-trans ideology onto them throughout the process of accepting Thomas on the team and in their locker room. The former swimmers say that they were led to feel their concerns over being teammates with Thomas were rooted in a \"psychological problem.\" \"The UPenn administrators told the women that if anyone was struggling with accepting Thomas’s participation on the UPenn Women’s team, they should seek counseling and support from CAPS and the LBGTQ center,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"The administrators also invited the women to a talk titled, ‘Trans 101.’ Thus, the women were led to understand that UPenn’s position was that if a woman on the team had any problem with a trans-identifying male being on her team that woman had a psychological problem and needed counseling.\" The plaintiffs also allege that the administrators warned them against speaking out against the situation publicly. \"The UPenn administrators went on to tell the women that if the women spoke publicly about their concerns about Thomas’ participation on the Women’s Team, the reputation of those complaining about Thomas being on the team would be tainted with transphobia for the rest of their lives and they would probably never be able to get a job,’\" the lawsuit alleges. The three female swimmers allege that they were made to believe they would be removed from the team if they tried to protest Thomas' participation ahead of the 2022 Ivy League championships. \"UPenn swim team members were told by Coach Schnur and UPenn administrators that UPenn administrators coordinated closely with the NCAA and the Ivy League to ensure that Thomas would be eligible for the 2021-2022 women’s swimming season,\" the suit alleged. \"These statements about close coordination between UPenn, the Ivy League and the NCAA regarding Thomas’ eligibility led the UPenn Women’s Team members to understand the resisting or protesting the participation of Thomas on the team or his presence in the locker room would be futile and could result in the women being removed from the team or from UPenn.\" The lawsuit alleges that coaches and UPenn administrators told the women's swimmers not to talk about Thomas' situation. Schnur allegedly told the women's swimmers that Thomas wouldn't be sharing a locker room with them when they asked after the initial introduction. But that allegedly changed later. Thomas officially began to practice and compete with the women's swimmers in Fall 2021. And that was when the female swimmers say they discovered that Schnur's alleged claim Thomas wouldn't share a locker room was not true. \"When UPenn’s women’s swimmers returned to school in the fall of 2021 they were shocked to discover that Thomas was being allowed to use the women’s locker room at UPenn and would be allowed to use the women’s locker room at swim meets,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"Margot [Kaczorowski] only learned that Thomas had been authorized by UPenn to use the women’s locker room when [Kaczorowski] walked in the women’s locker room to find Thomas in front of her changing his clothing.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Per the suit, Kaczorowski confronted Schnur in tears about her shock of discovering Thomas would now share a locker room with her. She alleges the coach responded by saying, \"I know it’s wrong, but there’s nothing I can do.\" \"Coach Schnur told the Plaintiffs he would be fired by UPenn if he did not allow Thomas to use the women’s locker room and compete on the women’s swim team,\" the lawsuit alleges. In December 2021, another team meeting was held to discuss Thomas' presence on the team and the media attention it garnered, per the court documents. The female swimmers allege they were told that Thomas would continue to be on their team and that \"Lia swimming is a non-negotiable.\" UPenn addressed the resolution with Trump's administration in a statement on Tuesday. \"The Department of Education OCR investigated the participation of one transgender athlete on the women’s swimming team three years ago, during the 2021 – 2022 swim season. At that time, Penn was in compliance with NCAA eligibility rules and Title IX as then interpreted,\" the statement read. \"Penn has always followed – and continues to follow – Title IX and the applicable policy of the NCAA regarding transgender athletes. NCAA eligibility rules changed in February 2025 with Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 and Penn will continue to adhere to these new rules. \"Penn has never maintained a policy of its own regarding the participation of transgender athletes in intercollegiate sports. Nor do we maintain our own policies related to other NCAA rules. We adhere to NCAA and Ivy League rules that are designed to ensure fair and transparent athletic competitions for all schools and participants.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"UPenn reaches agreement with Trump administration over Lia Thomas controversy while facing lawsuit from former female swimmers who are still suing.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/questions-over-upenns-lia-thomas-lawsuit-rise-after-title-ix-agreement-trump-admin","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/lia-thomas-and-teammates.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:16:34","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.097},{"id":337275886,"title":"Trump ridicules NYC's Democratic mayoral primary winner as 'a total nutjob'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report July 01, 2025 02:13 \n\n Trump ridicules NYC's Democratic mayoral primary winner as 'a total nutjob' \n Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on New York City's mayoral race and President Donald Trump's two cents on 'Special Report.'\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTV-VIDEONEW YORKNEW YORK CITYSTATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONSDONALD TRUMPDEMOCRAT ELECTIONSENFORCEMENT","summary":"Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on New York City&apos;s mayoral race and President Donald Trump&apos;s two cents on &apos;Special Report.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375126303112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0df0932f-5c7c-4a6a-b976-0da2ea8a66e7/e6aed280-8c83-447c-9ea4-1cb34d87a3fa/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:15:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.027},{"id":337272870,"title":"Trump Says Israel Agreed To 60-Day Ceasefire In Gaza, Then Warns Hamas: 'Take This Deal, Because...'","text":"US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Israel has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and warned Hamas that things will only \"get worse\" if they don't accept the same. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social to share the update as he prepares to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks at the White House next Monday. \"My Representatives had a long and productive meeting with the Israelis today on Gaza. Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War,\" Trump wrote. He said the Qataris and Egyptians have worked very hard to help bring Peace and would deliver the final proposal. \"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better -- IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE,\" he added. According to a report in AP, the President has been increasing pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to reach a ceasefire and hostage agreement and to end the war. Earlier Tuesday, Trump had said he would forge an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal next week. When asked if it was time to put pressure on Netanyahu, he said the Israeli PM was ready to come to an agreement. \"He wants to,\" Trump told reporters, stated AP. \"I think we'll have a deal next week,\" he added. The talks of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly failed over a major sticking point -- whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement. The development came as over 150 international charities and humanitarian groups on Tuesday called for disbanding a controversial Israeli and US-backed system to distribute aid in Gaza because of chaos and deadly violence against Palestinians seeking food at its sites. Hamas had launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, abducting hundreds of hostages and killing several others. Israel then retaliated with multiple blows to Hamas across Gaza, leading to a conflict which will complete two years this October.

ZELLER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:21:58 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:14 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nBlake Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds showcased a striking new look on Tuesday as he was honored in his home country of Canada.\nThe Deadpool star, 48, sported a dark new hair dye job, as he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada during Canada Day festivities in Ottawa.\nThe couple, who’ve been entangled in ongoing lawsuit drama with It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni, appeared unfazed by the controversy.\nPutting on a brave face, Gossip Girl alum Blake, 37, looked to be in high spirits as she snapped photos of Ryan while Canada's Governor General Mary Simon placed the medal around his neck.\nGrinning from ear to ear, the actress flashed her signature megawatt smile as Ryan waved to the cheering crowd and blew kisses. \nDespite the dark cloud of the It Ends With Us sexual harassment lawsuit, Ryan Reynolds appears to be on a roll, recently landing the cover of Time magazine in a feature titled 'How Ryan Reynolds Rewrote the Script for Celebrity Entrepreneurs.'\n\nBlake Lively stood proudly by Ryan Reynolds ’ side on Tuesday as he was honored in his home country of Canada — despite the legal storm still swirling around them\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum, 37, looked radiant as her Deadpool star husband, 48, was named an Officer of the Order of Canada during Canada Day festivities in Ottawa\nReynolds has made a pivot in recent years, expanding beyond Hollywood into the world of business. \n\n Tone deaf Ryan Reynolds drops cringeworthy reference to Blake Lively's legal battle \nHis ventures — including production and marketing firm Maximum Effort — even earned a spot on TIME’s list of the 100 most influential companies.\nBut not everyone was buying the hype.\nAfter Reynolds opened up about leveraging his fame to build brands and his strategy of “fastversing” (cross-promoting his own companies), some skeptical fans were quick to mock the TIME cover story, accusing the actor of buying his way in.\nCritics flooded social media with sarcastic takes, including one who joked, 'How Ryan Reynolds paid us to put him on the cover of this magazine! Lol.'\nAnother added, “'How Ryan Reynolds rewrote the script with maximum effort’ — very ironic of them to say this given everything he’s been exposed for.'\nThe medal honor comes after DailyMail.com exclusively learned that Baldoni's lawyers will be allowed to peruse a tranche of messages exchanged by Blake and Taylor, with all communications related to It Ends With Us now set for scrutiny.\n\nPutting on a brave face, Blake looked to be in high spirits as she snapped photos of Ryan while Canada's Governor General Mary Simon placed the medal around his neck\n\nDespite the dark cloud of the It Ends With Us sexual harassment lawsuit, Ryan Reynolds appears to be on a roll, recently landing the cover of Time magazine in a feature titled 'How Ryan Reynolds Rewrote the Script for Celebrity Entrepreneurs'\n\nThe couple, who’ve been entangled in ongoing lawsuit drama with It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni , appeared unfazed by the controversy\n\nSwift and Lively’s relationship has cratered in recent months, with the singer left furious at being dragged into the case. \nAnd she is not the only Swift to be dragged in: last week the Daily Mail revealed the subpoena against her had been withdrawn because Baldoni’s team had managed to acquire the information they were seeking – from none other than her dad Scott, 73.\n'Scott Swift did not want his daughter to be dragged into this any further and he voluntarily gave up this information as part of a deal that would include [Baldoni's team] withdrawing their subpoena for Taylor,' the source explained.\nThe pop star's doting dad - who has played a key role in building Swift's billion-dollar empire as her financial advisor - came to his daughter's rescue after she was allegedly blackmailed by Lively's lawyers.\nThat 'blackmail' revelation appeared in a legal letter filed last month by Baldoni's lawyers, who alleged that Lively's team had attempted to 'coerce' Swift to issue a public statement in support of her.\nThe filing claimed Lively's lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, had contacted Swift's team and demanded she 'release a statement of support for Ms. Lively, intimating that, if Ms. Swift refused to do so, private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively's possession would be released.'\nSwift's team allegedly responded to Gossip Girl star Lively's 'inappropriate and apparently extortionate threats in at least one written communication' sent to Gottlieb, according to the letter.\n'It is those communications that [Baldoni's team] seeks to obtain by way of subpoena, as they would evidence an attempt to intimidate and coerce a percipient witness in this litigation,' the letter stated.\n\nBaldoni’s team were forced to withdraw a subpoena targeting megastar Swift directly but they scored a victory today. Pictured: Lively and Baldoni in It Ends With Us\n\nBaldoni pictured in December 2024 in LA\nScott seemingly didn't take this alleged attempt to extort his 35-year-old daughter lightly, and decided to take matters into his own hands by cooperating with Baldoni and Bryan Freedman in order to protect Swift from any further legal involvement.\n'Plain and simple – they tried to extort Taylor by threatening to release private information about her so that she would support a narrative that she was not a part of,' our source added.\nIn a statement to People magazine, Gottlieb described the suggestion that Lively's lawyers had threatened Swift as 'categorically false.'\nLively's lawyers later filed a motion asking the court to strike the accusations from its docket as 'baseless, unnecessary, improper and abusive.' The motion to dismiss the letter was granted.\nHowever, the drama sheds further light on the collapse of the pair’s close friendship, which has gone cold amid the actress's high-stakes lawsuit.\nThe drama began last December when Lively, 37, accused Baldoni, her It Ends With Us co-star and director, of sexual harassment and coordinating a smear campaign against her.\nBaldoni, 41, hit back in January, with a $400 million countersuit accusing Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, of defamation.\nAll parties have denied the allegations. Last week, the defamation element of Baldoni’s lawsuit was scrapped by a judge, although he is still suing for civil extortion and invasion of privacy among other claims.\nBut contained in Baldoni's filing were screenshots of alleged text messages, in which Lively regularly mentioned Swift by name.\n\nAnd she is not the only Swift to be dragged in: last week the Daily Mail revealed the subpoena against her had been withdrawn because Baldoni’s team had managed to acquire the information they were seeking – from none other than her dad Scott, 73; The pair pictured May 18 in NYC\nIn one now infamous and toe-curling exchange, Lively appeared to refer to herself as the character Khaleesi – from Game of Thrones – and to Swift as one of her 'dragons.'\nElsewhere in Baldoni's filing is the claim that Swift was present at a meeting convened by Lively at her New York penthouse to discuss It Ends With Us script changes.\nSources close to Swift insisted the singer had no knowledge of the meeting and simply turned up to find it underway.\nNonetheless, the whole furor reportedly left Swift - who is godmother to Lively's three daughters – feeling ‘exploited’ by her pal of ten years.\nScott, a former stockbroker and financial advisor for Merrill Lynch, has long been credited as smoothing his daughter’s path to financial success.\nA disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission lists him as linked to 10 companies affiliated with his daughter, according to Bloomberg.\nLast year, he was accused of assaulting a photographer who was 'waiting' for Swift's arrival off a luxury yacht in Sydney following the Australian leg of her Eras Tour.\nIn a statement to Daily Mail Australia at the time, a rep for Swift described the photographers as 'aggressive' and her father later avoided charges.\n\nSwift and Lively’s relationship has cratered in recent months, with the singer left furious at being dragged into the case; (Swift in February) \n\nScott isn't the only member of Swift’s inner circle to defend the pop star amid the legal drama.\nHer boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, recently unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on Instagram while supermodel Gigi Hadid, another of Swift's closest friends, has reportedly 'iced out' Lively in solidarity. \nIn a statement released to the Daily Mail, a spokesman for Lively accused Baldoni’s lawyers of repeatedly attempting to drag Swift into the case and attempting to ‘exploit’ her popularity.\nIt continued: ‘The Court outright denied the Wayfarer Parties’ motion to compel documents from Ms. Lively, who has produced far more documents in this case than the Wayfarer Parties combined.\n‘Further, the Court’s protective order ruling rests on the Wayfarer Parties’ admission that they received nothing from Taylor Swift, which is exactly the opposite of what their ‘insider’ claimed two weeks ago.\nAs for the rest, Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties demanded access to Taylor Swift’s private communications—despite having already subpoenaed and then withdrawn that subpoena.\nBaldoni’s desire to drag Taylor Swift into this has been constant dating back to August 2024, when the crisis PR firm led by Melissa Nathan included her in their ‘Scenario Planning’ document (Lively Amended Complaint, Exhibit D), referred to her as a bully, and called for a strategy to influence the ‘TS fan base’.\nWe will continue to call out Baldoni’s relentless efforts to exploit Ms Swift’s popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing.\nRyan ReynoldsJustin BaldoniCanada\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively beams with pride as Ryan Reynolds is given Canadian honor amid their Justin Baldoni legal woes\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 34\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he said.\n\nTrump told reporters earlier in the day that he is hopeful that a ceasefire-for-hostages agreement can be achieved next week between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. He is set to meet Netanyahu at the White House on Monday.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to free remaining hostages in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel says it can only end if Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.\n\nThe war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe two sides have shown little sign of a readiness to budge from their entrenched positions.\n\nThe U.S. has proposed a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the remains of other Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said earlier this week Israel has agreed to a U.S.-proposed 60-day ceasefire and hostage deal, and put the onus on Hamas.\n\nTrump and his aides appear to be seeking to use any momentum from U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran nuclear sites, as well as a ceasefire that took hold last week in that conflict, to secure a lasting truce in the war in Gaza.\n\nTrump told reporters during a visit to Florida that he would be \"very firm\" with Netanyahu on the need for a speedy Gaza ceasefire while noting that the Israeli leader wants one as well.\n\n\"We hope it's going to happen. And we're looking forward to it happening sometime next week,\" he told reporters. \"We want to get the hostages out.\"\n\nGaza's health ministry says Israel's post-Oct. 7 military assault has killed over 56,000 Palestinians. The assault has also caused a hunger crisis, internally displaced Gaza's entire population and prompted accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice and of war crimes at the International Criminal Court.

But many are reluctant to give up their high-tech systems, particularly countries in Eastern Europe that also feel threatened by Russia.\n\nThe halt of some weapons comes after Russia launched its biggest combined aerial attack against Ukraine over the weekend, Ukrainian officials said, in an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in peace efforts championed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nUkraine has been pleading with the West for more air defense systems as Russia steps up its missile and drone attacks, including on civilian infrastructure, leading to the deaths of dozens of noncombatants.\n\nTrump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the NATO summit last week. He said after the meeting that the United States would try to get Ukraine more air defense systems to protect against deadly Russian attacks but would not commit to approving more aid for Ukraine.\n\n“We're going to see if we can make some [Patriots] available,” Trump said in The Hague on June 24 when asked by a reporter if he would sell air defense systems to Ukraine. “They're very hard to get. We need them too. We were supplying them to Israel.”\n\nTrump, who criticized the amount of US military aid sent to Ukraine during the 2024 presidential campaign, gave a vague answer when he was asked about continued defense assistance for Ukraine.\n\n“We'll see what happens,” said Trump, whose Republican party is deeply divided on the issue with its isolationist wing strongly against aid for Ukraine.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ukraine wants Patriots “more than any other thing.” saying his administration would “see if we can make some available.” He noted that the United States had been supplying them to Israel to help it defend itself against missiles fired by Iran and the proxy groups it supports.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a Senate subcommittee hearing earlier this month that some US security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline but provided no details. Hegseth also acknowledged that funding for Ukraine military assistance would be reduced.\n\nHe said the budget bill under consideration in Congress includes hard choices and “reflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.”\n\nHegseth stressed that the Trump administration takes a different view of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“We believe that a negotiated peaceful settlement is in the best interest of both parties and our nation’s interests,” he said.\n\nWith reporting by AP and Politico","summary":"The United States is halting some shipments of weapons previously promised to Ukraine after a Pentagon review determined that US stockpiles have declined too much.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-weapons-supply-war-pentagon-trump/33461518.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/69d2bb68-b658-4697-86c6-08dd5c876703_cx0_cy8_cw0_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:07:05","author":"Rfe/rl","authors":["Rfe/rl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":337272934,"title":"World News | ISKCON Temple in US Targeted in Suspected Hate Crime; India Urges Swift Action and Stands in Solidarity","text":"Spanish Fork [US], July 2 (ANI): The ISKCON Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah, renowned globally for hosting the annual Holi Festival, has come under attack in a suspected hate crime, with over two dozen bullets fired at the premises over several days, causing significant structural damage.\nAccording to ISKCON, 20 to 30 bullets were fired at the temple building and surrounding property during nighttime hours while devotees and guests were inside. The incident resulted in thousands of dollars in damage, including to the temple's intricately hand-carved arches.\nAlso Read | Rajnath Singh Speaks to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Appreciates 'Unwavering Support' in Fight Against Terrorism.\nCondemning the attack, the Consulate General of India in San Francisco expressed solidarity with the community and urged swift action. In a post on X, it stated, \"We strongly condemn the recent firing incident at the ISKCON Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple in Spanish Fork, Utah. The Consulate extends full support to all the devotees and the community and urges the local authorities to take prompt action to bring the perpetrators to justice.\"\nA similar incident had occurred earlier this year when, on March 9, a Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) Hindu temple in Chino Hills, California, was found desecrated just days ahead of a so-called 'Khalistani referendum' in Los Angeles, according to temple authorities.\nAlso Read | 'Elon Musk May Have To Close Up Shop, Head Back Home to South Africa Without EV Subsidies': Donald Trump Issues Deportation Warning for Tesla and SpaceX CEO.\nThe official page of BAPS for the United States shared the details of the March 9 desecration on the social media platform X and emphasised the community's resilience. \"In the face of another Mandir desecration, this time in Chino Hills, CA, the Hindu community stands steadfast against hate... Our common humanity and faith will ensure that peace and compassion prevail,\" BAPS Public Affairs wrote.\nThe Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) also pointed to the incident on X, linking it to rising anti-Hindu sentiment and noting that the vandalism came shortly before the planned 'Khalistan referendum' in Los Angeles.\n\"Another Hindu Temple vandalised, this time the iconic BAPS temple in Chino Hills, CA... Not surprisingly, this happens as the day for a so-called 'Khalistan referendum' in LA draws close,\" CoHNA posted, while listing other recent temple attacks since 2022 and calling for an investigation.\nLast year, acts of vandalism also targeted the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Sacramento, California, on the night of September 25. That incident followed closely after a similar attack on a BAPS temple in New York.\nMessages such as \"Hindus go back\" were found scrawled during those attacks, deeply alarming the local Hindu community. Despite repeated provocations, community leaders continue to affirm their unity and commitment to confronting hate.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., who claimed that she supported OBBB because it was a \"bailout for Alaska at the expense of the rest of the country.\" \"Oh my God,\" Murkowski mumbled angrily before looking at Nobles. \"That’s what Sen. Paul said,\" Nobles responded. REPUBLICAN SENATOR CALLS CAUCUSING WITH DEMOCRATS AN 'INTERESTING HYPOTHETICAL' She then stared at Nobles without making a response for more than ten seconds. \"I didn’t say it, ma’am,\" Nobles reiterated. \"I’m just asking for your response.\" \"My response is I have an obligation to the people of the state of Alaska, and I live up to that every single day,\" Murkowski answered. She added that it was \"offensive\" to claim that federal dollars being sent to a state is considered a \"bailout.\" \"Do I like this bill? No. Because I tried to take care of Alaska's interests, but I know that in many parts of the country there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill. I don't like that. I don't like the fact that we moved through an artificial deadline, an artificial timeline, to produce something—to meet a deadline rather than to actually try to produce the best bill for the country,\" Murkowski answered. \"But when I saw the direction that this is going—you know, you can either say, 'I don't like it,' and not try to help my state, or you can roll up your sleeves. Fox News Digital reached out to Paul’s office for a comment. MAGA COUNTRY VOTERS SOUND ALARM OVER ‘RIDICULOUS’ NATIONAL DEBT AMID DEBATE OVER TRUMP-BACKED BILL Senate Republicans successfully passed the bill on a 51-50 vote with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. Paul, along with Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only Republicans who voted against the bill. All Democrats voted no. Ahead of the Senate vote, several last-minute deals were made, including the doubling of the rural hospital fund to $50 billion, which was pushed by Collins, and a rollback of the start date of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) work requirements for states with higher payment error rates, like Alaska. The bill now heads to the House, where Republican leaders are determined to have a final bill ready to be signed by Trump by Friday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Sen.

Trump said workers who have spent years in the U.S. labor force, particularly in the agriculture and hospitality industries, may be eligible for a new type of work permit that would allow them to remain in the country legally, pay taxes and continue working but without receiving citizenship. The proposed plan, which has not yet been formally announced, would create a system by which farmers and other employers take legal responsibility for longtime undocumented workers. TRUMP URGES 'TEMPORARY PASS' FROM IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN FOR KEY INDUSTRIES: 'I CHERISH OUR FARMERS' \"We’re going to take care of our farmers and hotel workers, but we're working on it right now. And Ron [DeSantis is] going to be involved,\" Trump said during a tour of a new immigration detention camp in Florida’s Everglades that is surrounded by alligators, \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" \"We have a lot of cases where ICE would go into the farm, and these are guys that are working there for 10 to 15 years, no problem. \"The farmers know them. It’s called ‘farmer responsibility’ or ‘owner responsibility,’ but they're going to be largely responsible for these people, and they know these people. They've worked on the farms for 15 years. … We have a great feeling for the farmer and for others in the same position. TRUMP DIRECTS ICE TO EXPAND DEPORTATION EFFORTS IN AMERICA'S LARGEST CITIES \"They can be here legally. They can pay taxes and everything. They're not getting citizenship, but they get other things. And the farmers need them to do the work,\" Trump said. \"Without those people, you're not going to be able to run your farm.\" The future status of illegal migrants working in these sectors has been raised over the last number of weeks with Trump saying that farmers and hospital operators have raised concerns they may lose valuable members of their workforce should those illegal migrants be caught up in his mass deportation operations. Trump’s plan may not sit well with his hardline immigration supporters as the president seeks to find middle ground between them and protecting businesses reliant on long-term immigrant labor. \"I won the farmers by 92%, and I’m not going to be abandoning my farmers,\" Trump said at a roundtable discussion after the tour. \"We were strong with the voters, but we’re also strong for the farmers and for others in the hotel industry. \"They’re not going to have citizenship, but they’ll be working. They’ll be paying taxes,\" Trump reiterated. \"We need to get our farmers the people they need, otherwise the farmers aren’t going to be able to work their land.\" Trump said that during a previous mass deportation effort, California farmers were left without enough workers to harvest their crops. \"You know, we tried this once before, many, many years ago, when there was a very strong guy, and he got everybody out. And every farmer — almost all the farmers in the country — went bankrupt, and they had nobody to work. And we don’t want to have that situation,\" Trump said without citing who he was referring to. He was likely referring to President Dwight Eisenhower's 1954 mass deportation campaign that saw the deportation of more than 1 million migrants. The president made similar comments about hotels and farms potentially running into issues as a result of federal immigration enforcement June 12.

This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\" On June 19, border czar Tom Homan signaled that those operations would continue, but they are not a major focus.","summary":"President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is considering deportation exemptions for illegal migrants who work on farms or in the hospitality industry who could be swept up in ICE raids.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-working-on-deportation-exemptions-for-illegal-farm-and-hospitality-workers","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/trump-farmers-permit.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:00:34","author":"Michael Dorgan","authors":["Michael Dorgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":337272922,"title":"World News | Nepal's Iconic Juju Dhau--King Curd--adapts with Time, but Tradition at Risk","text":"Bhaktapur [Nepal], July 2 (ANI): Inside a modest factory nestled in the heart of Nepal's Bhaktapur, Rina Suwal moves swiftly between steaming vats of milk and rows of pitchers waiting to be filled.\nFrom early morning until late evening, she is immersed in a daily ritual that has become her life's work for the past 25 years -- preparing Juju Dhau, the famed \"King Curd\" of Nepal.\nAlso Read | Rajnath Singh Speaks to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Appreciates 'Unwavering Support' in Fight Against Terrorism.\nThis delicacy holds a cherished place in the Newa community, particularly during festive seasons, where no celebration feels complete without it. But as time has passed, the very vessel that defines Juju Dhau -- the traditional mud pitcher -- is slowly being replaced, threatening to erode a piece of cultural identity.\n\"When I started working (making Juju Dhau), only the mud pitcher was used; there was no such existence as plastic containers. About five years after I started the business, plastic containers came into use, giving comfort and easing mobility. People found it troublesome to carry the pitcher on a motorcycle from one place to another, where plastic containers became handier. In those days, people were reluctant to buy the Juju Dhau made in a mud pitcher rather than a plastic container, but now the tables have turned upside down,\" Suwal told ANI.\nAlso Read | 'Elon Musk May Have To Close Up Shop, Head Back Home to South Africa Without EV Subsidies': Donald Trump Issues Deportation Warning for Tesla and SpaceX CEO.\nFor centuries, Juju Dhau has been inseparable from the kataaro, a clay pot that not only holds the curd but also helps create its signature texture and flavour. Even as it lines supermarket shelves across Kathmandu Valley today, its roots trace back to 13th-century Bhaktapur, where tradition still pulses through its alleys.\nThe shift to plastic containers, however, is a reflection of modern convenience. They're lighter, more durable, and easier to transport, especially by motorbike. Yet, this change has sparked concern among long-time curd makers and cultural purists alike, who fear the essence of Juju Dhau is being diluted.\nWhat hasn't changed is the painstaking attention to quality that defines the preparation of the curd. Each morning, Rina and her team receive fresh milk from cows and buffaloes from nearby towns. It undergoes fat content checks -- the ideal being five per cent -- before moving to a commercial milk boiler that replaces the manual stirring of the past.\n\"After receiving the milk, the fat percentage should be checked, and the standard measurement is 5 per cent. After being approved, the milk is then boiled in a vat (pasteuriser) machine, before the milk needs to be stirred manually, which has now been replaced. After the milk hits up to 85 degrees Celsius, it is then transferred to a Dekchi (a big and deep utensil to boil things), where it is boiled for another hour. Thus, the boiled milk is transferred into the mud/plastic pitcher three times. The milk cannot be taken off the stove; rather, milk can be added onto it,\" Suwal explained.\nThe milk is poured in stages over an hour or more, forming layers of froth and cream. It's then cooled and inoculated with a starter culture -- a spoonful of existing Juju Dhau -- to begin fermentation. What follows is a slow and careful process of setting the curd, now aided by refrigeration.\nWhere once clay pots were insulated with blankets and rice husks to retain warmth and nurture the fermentation, refrigerators now quicken the process, allowing greater volumes to be made in a shorter time.\nDespite this evolution, Juju Dhau's distinct taste remains a draw for locals and visitors alike. Himanshu Thakur, a tourist visiting Bhaktapur, shared his experience.\n\"First of all, the taste was slightly tangy but pleasantly sweet, and it is very different from normal curd because it's not very sour, not at all sour. It also has a much thicker texture than a normal Dahi (curd),\" Thakur told ANI.\nBuffalo milk -- with nearly double the fat of cow's milk -- is often credited with delivering this luxurious texture. Even today, traditional curd makers insist that real Juju Dhau must begin with buffalo milk to stay true to its origins.\nThe demand for the King Curd continues to surge, especially during festivals.\n\"During summer, we use 15 cans of milk, where each can contains forty litres of milk. During the festive seasons, we have to make Juju Dhau from 30 to 40 cans of milk,\" Suwal concluded.\nAs Bhaktapur changes with the times, so too does its beloved curd. But for makers like Rina Suwal, each batch remains a balancing act between heritage and modernity, between clay and plastic, ensuring that while the methods may evolve, the soul of Juju Dhau is never lost.

Compounding this, as Pyongyang has forged closer strategic bonds with Russia, it now seemingly perceives any dialogue with the United States less as an overture for peace and more as a thinly veiled pretext for military action.\n“Having seen US bombers target Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, North Korea may see premature talks as a trap – just another excuse for Washington to accuse it of insincerity and justify a strike,” Hong Min, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU), told This Week in Asia.\n“Denuclearisation appears to be off the table for good. What the North might consider is arms control negotiations, under the condition that it is accepted as a nuclear state.”\nNorth Korea is likely to lean more on its nuclear deterrent while drawing closer to Moscow, said Lim Eul-chul, a professor specialising in North Korean studies at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies.\n“North Korea will likely focus on easing sanctions pressure by bolstering its strategic partnership with Russia, all while enhancing its nuclear and missile capabilities,” Lim said. “At the same time, it will continue to carefully monitor US intentions.”\nVictor Cha, president of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) geopolitics and foreign policy department, said the attacks on Iran might have reinforced North Korea’s belief that nuclear armament was the correct path.\n\n“One of the costs of our bombing of Iran is that we may have ended CVID with North Korea,” Cha said, referring to the once-core US policy goal of Pyongyang’s “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation”.\nIn recent months, US President Donald Trump has referred to North Korea as “a nuclear power”, fuelling speculation that Washington might pivot from denuclearisation towards arms control negotiations.\n“The lesson North Korea has taken away from this [is that] ‘we need to keep our weapons to avoid massive ordnance penetrators being dropped on North Korea’, like they were dropped on Iran,” Cha said in a CSIS-hosted online panel discussion.\nAccording to Cha, the show of military force by the US might cause North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to think, “I need some insurance that [bombing] doesn’t happen to me”.\nHe said US military action against Iran could lead Washington and Pyongyang to resume the nuclear dialogue that had stalled since the last talks in Hanoi in early 2019, which collapsed without a deal.\nWhile North Korea would doubtless aim to avoid Iran’s fate, the US would likely want to halt the growing military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang and prevent any potential nuclear programme reconstitution efforts involving Tehran and Pyongyang, Cha said.\n“President Trump famously likes his friend in North Korea, and he’s scheduled to go to Apec in South Korea at the end of October. Who knows what could happen there? He could go up to Panmunjom to meet the North Korean leader again,” Cha said.\n\nPanmunjom, the truce village in the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas, was the site of Trump and Kim’s impromptu third meeting in June 2019, following the failure of their Hanoi summit.\nWith South Korea set to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit this fall, speculation is swirling about another meeting between the two leaders.\nBut many doubt Kim would want another high-profile photo opportunity with Trump.\n“North Korea has no interest in another one-off Trump spectacle, which it believes serves no national interest,” Hong Min said.\n“Instead, it will focus on strengthening ties with Russia and China. Kim is likely to visit Russia later this year to elevate the ‘comprehensive strategic partnership’ with Moscow.”\nSigns of the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang are growing. Russian media recently reported that North Korea planned to send 5,000 military construction workers and 1,000 engineers to Russia’s Kursk region amid the war in Ukraine.\nSouth Korea’s intelligence agency has said Pyongyang dispatched 11,000 troops to Russia in October and another 4,000 in February, and supplied more than 10 million artillery shells, missiles and long-range weapons in exchange for technical help and economic aid from Moscow.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korean state media emphasised the “militant comradeship” with Russia during Kim’s meeting with Russian Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova in Pyongyang. Lyubimova said her visit came at a time of the “solidity and invincibility” of the bilateral friendship.\n“Given this growing military alliance, there is almost no chance of North Korea coming to the negotiating table with Washington,” Hong Min said.\nDespite this, Trump continues to keep the door open for another meeting with Kim.\nWhen asked last week whether he had recently sent a letter to Kim, Trump avoided answering directly and said: “I’ve had a good relationship with Kim Jong-un and get along with him, really great. So we’ll see what happens. Somebody’s saying there’s a potential conflict. I think we’ll work it out.”\nBut North Korea was unlikely to respond to vague overtures from the US, said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies.\n“They won’t engage unless Washington backs up its words with action, like halting joint military drills with South Korea or stopping the deployment of strategic assets to the peninsula,” he said.\n“Until the Russia-Ukraine war ends, Pyongyang will stay away from talks with the US.”\n\nYang said South Korea must deliver a consistent message that its goal was not war, but tension reduction and peace, warning that US involvement in the Middle East crisis might send “the wrong message” to the North.\nOthers believed that the North might escalate provocations against the US to distinguish itself from Iran.\n“North Korea may try to show that it’s different – that its nuclear force is already complete,” said Yang Wook, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n“They could provoke militarily to make the point that, unlike in the Middle East, countries like South Korea and Japan won’t dare launch strikes against them.”\nCho Han-beom, another senior researcher at KINU, said the bombing of Iran could prompt Pyongyang to accelerate the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and other nuclear delivery systems.\n\nNotably, North Korea has avoided making harsh criticism of Trump, perhaps signalling that Kim wants to keep communication channels open, according to Cho.\nPyongyang’s reaction to the US bombing has been relatively muted, limited to a foreign ministry statement condemning Washington’s violation of international law.\nDespite receiving aid from Russia, North Korea was still in economic dire straits and might yet have to turn to Washington for help, Cho said.\n“For North Korea, cooperation with Russia has limits when it comes to actual economic improvement. Without improving ties with Washington, North Korea’s future remains bleak,” Cho said.","summary":"When the US bombed Iran’s nuclear sites last month, Washington may have inadvertently sent Pyongyang the clearest signal yet that relinquishing its nuclear arsenal could expose North Korea to the very attacks it aims to avoid.\nPolitical analysts say Washington’s hardline approach to Iran’s uranium enrichment has only cemented the North Korean leadership’s deep-seated conviction that nuclear weapons are the ultimate deterrent.

So you have these women who are suffering from heat exhaustion and they’re passing out, but yet, you know, there are service dogs (at the same facility) that have air conditioning … none of it makes sense to me. It is so beyond inhumane.”\n\nTodd has also been vocal about the poor conditions he endured while an inmate at the Federal Prison Camp Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida. \n\nThe reality show patriarch said prison food was “disgusting filthy” and alleged a dead cat once fell from the ceiling and into the food.Todd alleged he faced retaliation for speaking out about issues lurking behind the prison’s wall in his first jailhouse interview. \n\nHe told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo: “The food is dated and it’s out of date by, at minimum, a year. It’s a year past expiration. And they’re literally starving these men to death here. These men are getting – I don’t know – they are getting 1,000 calories a day. \n\n“I've been told this by a staff member – one of the ways she’s trying to break me is by cutting down what you can buy in commissary. \n\n“So, before she came here, you could buy 12 packs of tuna a week. She cut it down to six, and from six it went to three. She has not given a reason. When I asked her about it, she said, 'commissary is a privilege, not a right.'”\n\nAfter Savannah highlighted her parents’ experiences and their respective prisons’ poor conditions, Todd and Julie said they were “very proud” of their daughter for advocating for them and other inmates.","summary":"The reality star claimed she witnessed her physical health break down over her 28-month prison stint.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/julie-chrisley-health-issues-prison-conditions/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/N0X1H7Exs/0x0/todd-julie-chrisley-grayson-car-crash-lawsuit-2022-court-seal-records-appeal-profit-off-terrible-situation-3-1715273138667.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 00:00:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":337271632,"title":"Bay Area Democratic leaders assail Trump tax and policy bill after Senate passes it","text":"Bay Area Democratic leaders on Tuesday blasted the just-passed tax and policy bill of President Donald Trump as a gift to rich people at the cost of everyday Americans that would add trillions of dollars to America’s national debt.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said the bill, if approved by the Republican-majority House of Representatives, would bring lower taxes, bigger paychecks, tighter borders and stronger national security.\n\n“Americans will face harmful cuts to their health care and food assistance,” South Bay Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said Tuesday. “In California, over 2 million people alone would lose access to their health care. Hospitals and clinics will be hit, and some will be forced to close if House Republicans agree to this travesty.”\n\nEast Bay Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier said in a social media post Tuesday morning that he was on his way to Washington “to do whatever I can to stand in the way of this bill.”\n\nReferring to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, DeSaulnier said the bill’s cuts to Medicaid — which provides health care for some 70 million low-income, elderly and disabled Americans — and funding for the Affordable Care Act would strip health care from 17 million Americans in coming years, “to give tax breaks to the ultrawealthy.”\n\nThe bill would make permanent many of the tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term.\n\nMany business groups quickly expressed approval of the Senate vote.\n\n“The tax provisions included in this bill will not only drive economic growth and sharpen America’s competitive edge but also put more money in workers’ pockets, increasing prosperity in communities across the country,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief policy officer Neil Bradley said.\n\nNon-partisan research group The Tax Foundation estimated Monday that the bill would slash federal tax revenue by $5 trillion by 2034. Projected economic growth of 1.2% would pay for about a fifth of the tax cuts, shrinking the tax loss to $4 trillion, the group reported.\n\nFormer House speaker and San Francisco Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, in a social media post Tuesday morning, condemned the “Republicans’ One Big, Ugly Bill.”\n\n“It strips millions of health care, takes food away from children, and plunges our nation $4 trillion deeper in debt to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Pelosi said. “House Democrats will fight to stop it.”\n\nThe Budget Lab at Yale University estimated Monday that effects from the bill on taxes, Medicaid and spending on the federal SNAP food stamps program would cost the lowest-earning 20% of Americans about $700 a year, and boost incomes for people making $185,000 by about $9,000, and for people making $3.3 million by about $104,000.\n\nSouth Bay Democratic Rep. Sam Liccardo, former mayor of San Jose, said in a social media post Monday that the bill, by eliminating federal clean-energy programs, would inflate utility bills and make the transition to solar power — seen as vital for combating climate change — more expensive.\n\nHowever, American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers applauded the Senate, saying the bill would “help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development.”\n\nFrancis Creighton, CEO of Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America, said the bill would help “family-owned wholesalers to reinvest, compete, and thrive.”\n\nLiccardo in an interview Tuesday described the proposed legislation as “the one big bloated borrowing bill that leaves our children and grandchildren nearly $4 trillion more indebted … and gives us the added pain of gutting lifelines for health, nutrition and education.”\n\nThe bill’s provision to shift more costs from the federal SNAP food stamp program to states had been opposed by Democrat-led states, including California. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined two dozen other governors in signing a June 24 letter to House and Senate leaders saying states would need to spend millions or billions of dollars, or quit the SNAP program, which benefits more than 40 million people, including about 14% of Californians.\n\n“Hunger and poverty will increase, children and adults will get sicker, grocery stores in rural areas will struggle to stay open, people in agriculture and the food industry will lose jobs, and state and local economies will suffer,” the letter said.\n\nRemoved from the bill was a controversial provision to ban states from regulating artificial intelligence for 10 years. Billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks, who is Trump’s technology adviser, had argued that unrestricted AI development would increase productivity and lower the debt. But the proposed regulatory moratorium, though seen as a boon to Silicon Valley, faced substantial opposition, including from Trump loyalist and Georgia Republican Rep.

(AP pic)WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that Elon Musk’s companies receive from the federal government, in an escalation of the war of words between the president and the world’s richest man, one-time allies who have since fallen out.The feud reignited on Monday when Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump’s re-election, renewed his criticism of Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla, the leading US EV maker. That bill passed the senate by a narrow margin midday Tuesday.“He’s upset that he’s losing his EV mandate and … he’s very upset about things but he can lose a lot more than that,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.Though Musk has often said government subsidies should be eliminated, Tesla has historically benefited from billions of dollars in tax credits and other policy benefits because of its business in clean transportation and renewable energy.The Trump administration has control over many of those programmes, some of which are targeted in the tax bill, including a US$7,500 consumer tax credit that has made buying or leasing EVs more attractive for consumers.Tesla shares dropped more than 5% Tuesday.The Tesla CEO renewed threats to start a new political party and spend money to unseat lawmakers who support the tax bill, despite campaigning on limiting government spending. Republicans have expressed concern that Musk’s on-again, off-again feud with Trump could hurt their chances to protect their majority in the 2026 midterm congressional elections.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent pushed back on Musk’s criticism that the bill would balloon the deficit, saying, “I’ll take care of” the country’s finances.Musk spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting government spending, before he pulled back his involvement in late May. Trump on Truth Social on Tuesday suggested Musk might receive more subsidies “than any human being in history, by far,” adding: “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.”Trump later doubled down, telling reporters with a smile, “DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon.”In response to Trump’s threats, Musk said on his own social media platform X, “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.” He later added that he could escalate the exchange with Trump but said, “I will refrain for now.”Challenges to Tesla The feud could create new challenges for Musk’s business empire, particularly as the electric automaker – his primary source of wealth – bets heavily on the success of its robotaxi programme currently being tested in Austin, Texas. The speed of Tesla’s robotaxi expansion depends heavily on state and federal regulation of self-driving vehicles.“The substance of Tesla’s valuation right now is based on progress towards autonomy. I don’t think anything is going to happen on that front, but that is the risk,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management.Analysts expect another rough quarter when the EV maker reports second-quarter delivery figures on Wednesday. Sales in major European markets were mixed, data showed Tuesday, as Musk’s embrace of hard-right politics has alienated potential buyers in several markets worldwide.The elimination of the EV credit could hit Tesla’s earnings by as much as US$1.2 billion, about 17% of its 2024 operating income, JP Morgan analysts estimated earlier this year.The Electrification Coalition, an EV advocacy group, on Tuesday urged the US house to revise the senate bill. Shares of smaller EV players Rivian and Lucid Group lost 2% and 3.8%, respectively, on Tuesday.Gary Black, a longtime Tesla investor who manages money for the Future Fund LLC, sold his shares recently as car sales declined. He told Reuters he is considering when to reinvest and that eliminating electric vehicle credits would harm Tesla. In a separate post on X, Black said: “Not sure why @elonmusk didn’t see this coming as a result of him speaking out against passage of President Trump’s big beautiful bill.”The US transportation department regulates vehicle design and will play a key role in deciding if Tesla can mass-produce robotaxis without pedals and steering wheels, while Musk’s rocket firm SpaceX has about US$22 billion in federal contracts.Tesla also gets regulatory credits for selling electric vehicles, and has reaped nearly US$11 billion by selling those credits to other automakers who are unable to comply with increasingly strict vehicle emissions rules. Without those sales, the company would have posted a first-quarter loss in April.Trump had in early June threatened to cut Musk’s government contracts when their relationship erupted into an all-out social media brawl over the tax-cut bill, which non-partisan analysts estimate would add about US$3 trillion to the U.S. debt.Asked if he was going to deport Musk, a naturalised US citizen, Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday: “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look.”","summary":"The rift risks fresh challenges to the tech tycoon’s empire as ambitious robotaxi trials hinge on federal approval.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/07/02/trump-escalates-feud-with-musk-threatens-tesla-spacex-support/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/925fc41e-elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 23:59:06","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":337269984,"title":"Donald Trump reveals his family member he'd like to see replace Thom Thills","text":"Donald Trump has revealed his 'first choice' would be daughter-in-law Lara run to replace turncoat Republican Senator Thom Tillis in 2026. \n\nThe president has celebrated Tillis - who voted against the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' - announcing he would not run for re-election Sunday. \n\nOn Tuesday, the president was asked who he'd like to see take his spot and a familiar name came to mind. \n\n'Somebody that would really be great is Lara, she grew up there,' Trump said.\n\nHe noted that while Lara, 42, is from North Carolina, she and husband Eric 'live in Florida, they have a very good life.'\n\nLara, the wife of the president's son, would have the family's backing if she chose to run, a source told DailyMail.com Monday. \n\n'She's a great person, Lara Trump. I mean, that would always be my first choice but she doesn't live there now, but she's there all the time, her parents are there, she really knows North Carolina well and I won there three times.'\n\nTrump cited Lara's success at running the Republican National Committee in 2024 and her new Fox News talk show. \n\nAssuming a Republican wins in 2026 in the purple state, Trump will be happy to see the back of Tillis regardless of who it is.\n\n'I didn't get along with Tillis and he resigned, that's a good thing. I had it out with this guy two nights ago and he resigned, he did us all a favor. I was happy about it,' Trump told the press gaggle. \n\nThe seat may not be hers for the taking even if she has the support of her famous family.\n\nSeveral other Republicans are considering a bid, including former party chairman Michael Whatley, who is seen as a strong contender; Congressman Pat Harrigan; and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, sources tell DailyMail.\n\nLara, however, would have the Trump family support if she runs, a source familiar told DailyMail. \n\nLara is married to Eric Trump, the president's third child and is also host of a weekend show on Fox News. Eric sparked talk of a Trump political dynasty earlier this month when he told the Financial Times that a political career would be 'would be an easy one' for family members, if they took that option.\n\nStill, one Trump adviser told Axios they'd be 'surprised if she wants to leave the amazing gig she has at Fox.'\n\nNorth Carolina is a longtime battleground state where Democrats tend to win the governorships and Republicans the Senate seats. \n\nDemocrats, however, see the retirement of Tillis, a well-liked Republican senator, as a chance to change their luck. The party is pushing former Gov. Roy Cooper, a popular politician, to run for the seat.\n\nAsked if he would back a successor for his seat, Tillis didn't answer.\n\n'Dependent upon whether or not President Trump endorses somebody it could be an open primary,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill on Sunday night.. 'He could close it out and the party could get behind it, I suspect that's what they do. I just really hope he has some discernment because obviously Mark Robinson was a bad pick.'\n\nRobinson, the scandal-ridden lieutenant governor, lost last year's gubernatorial race to Democrat Josh Stein even as Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the presidential race. \n\nLara Trump, a North Carolina native who graduated from N.C. State University, currently anchors a weekend show on Fox News.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, she served as co-chair of Republican National Committee. In that contest, President Trump backed Whatley to be chairman with Lara Trump as his deputy. The duo served together through the election.\n\nShe was previously floated as a potential Senate candidate when former Republican Sen. Richard Burr retired. She opted not to launch a campaign for the seat. \n\nEric and Lara currently live in Florida. Lara was touted as a candidate to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate when he was confirmed as secretary of state but, again, she opted to stay out of politics.\n\nShe said she worries about moving her family to Washington D.C., pointing to advice she received from her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who both worked in the first Trump Administration.\n\n'It was tough on them personally, but it was really tough on their family,' she told Time magazine in February.\n\n'Even if I decided to move my whole family, dogs and all, up to Washington, D.C., I still think that it probably would have been a big challenge for my kids and for us as a whole.'\n\nEric Trump, speaking to the Financial Times a few weeks ago, expressed the same concerns about his children and a political life.\n\n'The real question is: 'Do you want to drag other members of your family into it?'' Eric Trump said when asked about running for public office. Their son Luke is seven and daughter Caroline is five.\n\n'Would I want my kids to live the same experience over the last decade that I've lived?\n\n'If the answer was yes, I think the political path would be an easy one, meaning, I think I could do it,' he said. 'And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.'\n\nTillis announced his retirement on Sunday after Trump whacked him over his opposition to the president's 'big, beautiful' budget bill currently making its way through the Senate. \n\nTillis was one of two Republican senators who voted against the 'motion to proceed' on Trump's budget bill Saturday evening, along with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. \n\nIn a post made to his social media site Truth Social Sunday morning, President Trump came after Tillis, claiming that he 'hurt the great people of North Carolina' and calling him a 'talker and complainer.'\n\n'Thom Tillis has hurt the great people of North Carolina. Even on the catastrophic flooding, nothing was done to help until I took office. Then a Miracle took place! Tillis is a talker and complainer, Not A Doer! He's even worse than Rand 'Fauci' Paul,' Trump wrote on Sunday morning.","summary":"The president celebrated Tillis announcing he would not run for re-election Sunday.
