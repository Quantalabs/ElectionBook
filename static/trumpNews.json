You want me to bodyslam Kamala Harris? I said do you want me to bodyslam Kamala Harris? You want me to drop the leg on Kamala?\"Hogan then asked if Harris was a chameleon or Indian before making a stereotypical gesture associated with indigenous Americans. He seemed to realize he made a mistake.\"I'm gonna get heat for that one, brother,\" Hogan said. \"That was not me, that was the beers talking.\"Hogan publicly endorsed Trump when he appeared as a speaker during the Republican National Convention.\"You better get ready,\" Hogan said. \"When Donald J. Trump becomes the president of the United States, all the real Americans are going to be nicknamed 'Trumpites' because all the Trumpites are going to be running wild for four years.\"This was not the first time Hogan had drawn criticism for racist remarks. In 2015, National Enquirer and Radar Online released a leaked video of Hogan saying racial slurs.In response, Hogan was suspended from the WWE Hall of Fame. He was reinstated in 2018.\"This is not who I am,\" Hogan told PEOPLE. \"I believe very strongly that every person in the world is important and should not be treated differently based on race, gender, orientation, religious beliefs or otherwise. I am disappointed with myself that I used language that is offensive and inconsistent with my own beliefs.\"Hogan has yet to publicly comment on the video.More WWE: Dwayne Johnson Pays Emotional Tribute to Late WWE Hall of Famer","summary":"Wrestler Hulk Hogan made a controversial remark about presidential candidate Kamala Harris while promoting his beer brand.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/hulk-hogan-incites-crowd-controversial-remark-about-kamala-harris-1942156","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2454388/hulk-hogan-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:31:27","author":"Jeremy Hanna","authors":["Jeremy Hanna"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":254553896,"title":"Working for people, not power: Ardern’s hopes for future US president","text":"Ardern’s comments came as Democrats gathered for the second day of their national convention, to rally around Harris and her running mate Tim Walz as their chosen candidates for the presidential election.

Podcaster and self-described MAGA supporter Scott Adams also criticized the moment, writing on X, \"I'm going to go with 'weird' to describe Doug Emhoff and his daughter.\"Newsweek sent an email to Harris' campaign seeking comment Tuesday evening.Some conservatives also critiqued a moment between President Joe Biden and his youngest daughter, Ashely, who spoke at the DNC Monday night prior to Biden delivering the keynote speech. Johnson posted a video of Biden hugging his daughter on the DNC stage to his Instagram account, describing it as \"the most CRINGE moment\" of the convention's opening night.Democrats started labeling Republicans and their policies as \"creepy\" and \"weird\" last month, an attack first coined by Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz that quickly picked up attention online. Trump's campaign has repeatedly dismissed the label, and the former president has responded to the attacks by calling Harris \"a weird person.\"Some users on X shot back at conservatives labeling Emhoff as \"weird\" by pointing to past photos of Trump with his oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump. The former president has faced backlash for making reported inappropriate comments about his daughter, who served as a White House advisor during her father's first term.During a 2006 appearance on ABC's The View, Trump said while sitting next to Ivanka that if she \"weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.\" In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Trump reportedly said that Ivanka is \"really something, and what a beauty, that one.

Republican defectors who have publicly disavowed former President Donald Trump are also taking the stage in Chicago. On Tuesday, former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham — the third spokesperson tasked with heading the press operations of Trump’s White House during his term — addressed the floor of the United Center. Grisham spoke of her disaffection with the former president, noting that she “was one of his closest advisers.” “The Trump family became my family. I spent Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s all at Mar-a-Lago,” Grisham recalled. “I saw him when the cameras were off behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters, he calls them basement dwellers.” “He used to tell me: ‘It doesn’t matter what you say Stephanie. Say it enough, and people will believe you.’ But it does matter. What you say matters and what you don’t say matters,” Grisham added. The former press secretary recalled her resignation from the White House in the aftermath of Jan. 6. “I asked Melania [Trump] if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there’s no place for lawlessness or violence. She replied with one word: no. I became the first senior staffer to resign that day.” Grisham is not the only prominent Republican figure addressing the convention. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) is expected to take the stage on Thursday, and Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan is scheduled to speak on Wednesday. Former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser, who in his words voted for Trump “not once, not twice, but three times,” also spoke on Tuesday, telling the convention floor that he’s “not left-wing” but that he believes “our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst.” “I’m voting for Kamala Harris because she’ll make us proud to be Americans,” Sweetser added. Earlier this week, retired Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Michael Luttig announced that he would be endorsing Vice President Harris over Trump. The prominent conservative legal scholar, who was appointed under George H.W. Bush, told CNN that “regrettably, in the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law.” “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris,” he added. Democrats want to make clear at the convention that there are plenty of other Republicans who feel similarly.","summary":"Stephanie Grisham is one of multiple anti-Trump Republicans to speak at the Democratic National Convention","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/stephanie-grisham-republicans-dnc-1235084114/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/stephanie-grisham-dnc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:26:30","author":"Nikki McCann Ramirez,Ryan Bort","authors":["Nikki McCann Ramirez","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":254553868,"title":"Matt Gaetz cruises to victory in Florida GOP primary amid McCarthy revenge tour","text":"Firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz cruised to victory in his Republican primary for reelection Tuesday — swatting down a challenge from Navy veteran Aaron Dimmock, who was backed by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The 42-year-old incumbent had been heavily favored to win the contest, which was the last stop in McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) so-called “revenge tour.” Gaetz hadn’t faced a serious primary challenge since first getting elected to Congress in 2016. His ruby-red 1st Congressional District of Florida is widely seen as a safe seat in the general election. This election cycle, allies of McCarthy sought to recruit challengers to take down the eight Republicans who banded together with a solid bloc of Democrats to oust him from the speakership. Gaetz was the last of those eight to face reelection. The Sunshine State Republican led a mutiny against McCarthy last October in protest over his decision to put through a temporary spending patch. That move came as Congress was staring down the barrel of a government shutdown because it had not been able to wrangle through the necessary appropriations bills in time. McCarthy was the first speaker in US history to have been successfully ousted. Efforts by him and his allies to exact revenge had largely been unsuccessful. Just one of them, Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good (R-Va.), has lost his primary. Two others — Reps. Ken Buck (R-Col.) and Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) — opted against running for reelection. One key distinction between Gaetz and Good is that the Floridian has close relations with former President Donald Trump. The former president had endorsed Good’s opponent. During the Florida GOP primary cycle this year, The Freedom Patriots PAC — a group that is widely seen as aligned with McCarthy — spent some $3 million to take down Gaetz. They appeared to ramp down spending on the primary weeks before Tuesday. Some of the attacks against Gaetz included ads predicated on allegations that the congressman engaged in sexual misconduct. Other ads highlighted his past ties with ex-Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg, who was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for sex trafficking, among other crimes. Gaetz has long denied the allegations against him and cited the Justice Department’s decision against bringing charges as vindication. In June, the House Ethics Committee confirmed it reopened an inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct and drug abuse against Gaetz. Throughout his primary challenge, the incumbent congressman has run ads touting his ties to Trump and ripped Dimmock over his past in diversity training.","summary":"Firebrand Rep.

Kennedy Jr. to a cabinet position if he were to drop out and endorse the Republican—a move his vice presidential candidate said the ticket was considering the same day. “He’s a brilliant guy. He’s a very smart guy. I’ve known him for a very long time,” Trump told CNN, adding that he would be “honored” by the endorsement. “I didn’t know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I’d be open to it,” Trump said. The former president said he “probably would” consider Kennedy for a cabinet position—something the independent campaign seems to be angling for in recent weeks. Earlier the same day, Kennedy’s vice presidential nominee Nicole Shanahan sat down for an interview with the podcast Impact Theory, where she said the campaign was considering endorsing the Republican. In the interview, Shanahan denied a report in The Washington Post last week that Kennedy was trying to meet with the Democratic nominee to discus an endorsement or a possible cabinet position. Kennedy, the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, was a registered Democrat until 2023. “Definitely not in talks with Harris,” Shanahan said during the podcast, calling the reports “fake news.” Kennedy also met with Trump to discuss a possible cabinet position shortly before the Republican National Convention in July, the Post confirmed. A video clip of the meeting was briefly shared by Kennedy’s son on social media. In the podcast interview on Monday, Shanahan was vocally more supportive of the Republican ticket, as well as controversial backer Peter Thiel, and said they were considering a “unity party” ticket with the former president. “If we’re splitting hairs, I would say I trust the future of this country more under the leadership of the Trumps and the Thiels and the J.D. Vances than I do under the leadership of the Harris’s and the Reid Hoffmans,” Shanahan said. The independent vice presidential candidate said that Kennedy was weighing the option of staying in and forming a new political party—but said they were concerned about drawing votes away from Trump in the general election. “Or we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump,” Shanahan told the host. “Trump has taken genuine, sincere interest in our policies around chronic disease,” Shanahan said. “He takes it seriously. For that reason, I think it behooves us to sit and see if we can actually make some real change.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Erin O'Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesFormer President Donald Trump said he would consider appointing independent presidential candidate Robert F.

He said that while his event focused on tackling crime, the theme he saw at the DNC on Monday night was “lies” – predicting that former President Barack Obama would repeat that again when he takes the stage Tuesday night as the keynote speaker. “I think it was about lies. It was lies about me, all night long they were saying things that weren’t true,” Trump said. “Charlottesville has been disproven. Everything that they’ve said has been disproven. The French soldier thing that they do all the time has been disproven, in the French cemetery,” he added, denying making controversial remarks Democrats attribute to him, such as calling veterans “suckers and losers.” He then asserted that Democrats “are good at lying.” “Every single thing that they talked about. The immigration. How about inflation? We had no inflation and they had a lot and they said the reverse,” Trump said. “It was disinformation, misinformation, which is what they talk about all the time.” “It’s probably the same thing [that will happen tonight.] It’s just incredible. They get before the cameras and they make up stories. Like they’re storytellers,” he added. Trump said he agreed with the repeated line Monday night painting Vice President Kamala Harris’ as the “underdog” in the 2024 election – but that doesn’t mean she deserves sympathy. “She should be the underdog because she did such a bad job,” Trump told The Post in an exclusive interview, referring to Harris’ time as vice president handling the border. “The job that she did was a disgrace, and to think that she’s now running for president.” Harris has described her campaign with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as an “underdog” movement in her fight against Trump because she has limited time to speak to voters after President Biden dropped out of the race. Her closest allies at the Democratic National Convention stressed her humble beginnings throughout the first night of the four-day event.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted the Democratic National Convention's programming as \"lies\" ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/us-news/trump-blasts-dnc-programming-in-interview-with-the-post-as-lies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-jj1rzujxv-1724199492972.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724185112&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CmlAvyC6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:23:28","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":254553690,"title":"Trump is willing to consider appointing RFK Jr. to a position in his administration.","text":"Former President Trump opened the door to the possibility of giving Robert F.

The potential partnership between Trump and Kennedy has been a subject of discussion for weeks as these two controversial individuals vie for the support of overlapping groups of voters. Kennedy’s vice presidential pick, Nicole Shanahan, hinted at the possibility of a collaboration in a podcast that aired the same day as Trump’s comments. In it, she told host Tom Bilyeu that one avenue she and Kennedy are considering is to end their campaign and back Trump with a joint endorsement. Shanahan said they have a choice to “walk away right now and join forces … with Donald Trump.” She did not indicate whether that decision was currently in the works. She instead expressed concerns that staying in the race could potentially help Democratic nominee Vice President Harris and her running mate Tim Walz win the election. Trump suggested that a Kennedy endorsement would be a positive enhancement to his campaign, which is currently running essentially tied with Harris’s. “I’m leading in the polls, but not by as much,” Trump said in his interview with CNN.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Trump opened the door to the possibility of giving Robert&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump is willing to consider appointing RFK Jr. to a position in his administration. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-is-willing-to-consider-appointing-rfk-jr-to-a-position-in-his-administration/","image":"https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/AP24229002800772-e1723856069305.jpg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:21:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":254553696,"title":"Embarrassing moment DNC roll call descends into chaos as Alabama fails to cast vote and Lil Jon takes over for Georgia","text":"KAMALA Harris has solidified her status as the Democratic presidential nominee, setting the stage for a Donald Trump match-up in the 2024 election. Harris' arrival on the blue ticket has instilled an exuberant jolt of electricity and hope into the Democratic Party a month after the party's future was in shambles following the resurgence of Trump and Republicans, but the Democratic National Convention's roll call wasn't without its blunders. Republicans left their convention in Milwaukee on July 18, renovated and united, convinced a landslide victory was on the horizon in November. Just days before the convention, Trump survived an assassination attempt on July 13 but nonetheless stood unshaken in front of delegates with a large bandage on his ear, delivering a unified speech to delegates. Meanwhile, on the heels of the GOP convention, the Democrat's goal to remain in the White House seemed bleak when President Joe Biden shockingly bowed out of the race on July 21. But since Biden ended his reelection campaign, the tide has turned in favor of Democrats, who have swiftly allied with Harris and Tim Walz's ticket. Within a few weeks of her campaign, Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers and an influx of support from Dem leaders who hesitated to support Biden's reelection efforts. Harris and Walz's campaign has also upended Trump's lead in some national polls, shifting the election into a narrow, neck-and-neck race, and in some cases, outright took the lead over the Republican nominee, according to polling by Cook Political Report. The rejuvenated blue ticket has caused turmoil within the Trump campaign as his allies have advised the former president, 78, to adjust his strategy or risk losing the election, according to Vanity Fair. Now, delegates from across the country have descended into Chicago for the start of the Democratic National Convention to honor Harris as the party's nominee. Harris and her vice president-nominee Walz were previously made the party's official nominees in a virtual roll call, which concluded on August 6. Harris received 99 percent of the votes from participating delegates. Tuesday's formal roll call was more of a celebratory event for the Democratic presidential candidate to solidify her candidacy in November's general election. The roll call was not without its gaffs, however. There was an awkward pause when cameras focused on Alabama's delegation, though the state decided to forgo its turn in favor of allowing Biden's home state, Delaware, to go first. When the roll call got to Georgia, the DNC erupted, as rapper and entertainer Lil Jon jumped out of the crowd, singing verses from his 2013 hit single, Turn Down for What. 'THANK YOU, JOE' President Biden, who was supposed to be the center of the DNC's festivities, delivered a forceful, hour-long speech that diverted well beyond the scheduled primetime slot during night one. A spirited crowd waving preprinted \"We ❤️ Joe\" signs heaped Biden with admiration as a final testament to his 50 years in public service. In his nearly hour-long speech, an emotional Biden highlighted his administration's achievements and made the case for his successor, 59, to represent the nation. \"It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president,\" said a teary-eyed Biden. \"I love the job, but I love my country more. I love my country more. And all this talk about how I'm angry at all the people who said I should step down - it's not true. \"I love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. \"America, America, I gave my best to you. I made a lot of mistakes in my career. \"Well, I gave my best to you for 50 years. Like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation, and I've been blessed a million times in return with the support of the American people.\" Biden passed the torch to Harris' hands, whom he referred to as \"vice president soon-to-be president Kamala Harris. The president called nominating Harris as his vice president the \"best decision I made my whole career.\" \"She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity,\" Biden said of his vice president. \"Her story represents the best American story. She'll be president our children can look up to. \"She'll be a president we can all be proud of. She will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\" Biden became the first president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to decide not to seek reelection. More to follow...

Within a few weeks of her campaign, Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers and an influx of support from Dem leaders who hesitated to support Biden's reelection efforts. Harris and Walz's campaign has also upended Trump's lead in some national polls, shifting the election into a narrow, neck-and-neck race, and in some cases, outright took the lead over the Republican nominee, according to polling by Cook Political Report. The rejuvenated blue ticket has caused turmoil within the Trump campaign as his allies have advised the former president, 78, to adjust his strategy or risk losing the election, according to Vanity Fair. Now, delegates from across the country have descended into Chicago for the start of the Democratic National Convention to honor Harris as the party's nominee. Harris and her vice president-nominee Walz were previously made the party's official nominees in a virtual roll call, which concluded on August 6. Harris received 99 percent of the votes from participating delegates. Tuesday's formal roll call was more of a celebratory event for the Democratic presidential candidate to solidify her candidacy in November's general election. The roll call was not without its gaffs, however. There was an awkward pause when cameras focused on Alabama's delegation, though the state decided to forgo its turn in favor of allowing Biden's home state, Delaware, to go first. When the roll call got to Georgia, the DNC erupted, as rapper and entertainer Lil Jon jumped out of the crowd, singing verses from his 2013 hit single, Turn Down for What. 'THANK YOU, JOE' President Biden, who was supposed to be the center of the DNC's festivities, delivered a forceful, hour-long speech that diverted well beyond the scheduled primetime slot during night one. A spirited crowd waving preprinted \"We ❤️ Joe\" signs heaped Biden with admiration as a final testament to his 50 years in public service. In his nearly hour-long speech, an emotional Biden highlighted his administration's achievements and made the case for his successor, 59, to represent the nation. \"It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president,\" said a teary-eyed Biden. \"I love the job, but I love my country more. I love my country more. And all this talk about how I'm angry at all the people who said I should step down - it's not true. \"I love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. \"America, America, I gave my best to you. I made a lot of mistakes in my career. \"Well, I gave my best to you for 50 years. Like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation, and I've been blessed a million times in return with the support of the American people.\" Biden passed the torch to Harris' hands, whom he referred to as \"vice president soon-to-be president Kamala Harris. The president called nominating Harris as his vice president the \"best decision I made my whole career.\" \"She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity,\" Biden said of his vice president. \"Her story represents the best American story. She'll be president our children can look up to. \"She'll be a president we can all be proud of. She will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\" Biden became the first president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to decide not to seek reelection. More to follow...

And in what appears to be an attempt — and let’s be real, somewhat pathetic attempt — to troll the Kamala Harris campaign, the clip was edited to include Beyoncé’s song “Freedom.” Cool, bro. Harris was granted use of the song by the pop superstar less than a day after she entered the race, and the song is now indelibly linked to her historic campaign. TheWrap has reached out to Beyoncé’s reps for comment. Trump’s camp has a history of using songs without the artist’s permission, including, most recently, the Isaac Hayes-penned hit “Hold on I’m Coming.” The estate for the late R&B star has sued Trump for $3 million for the unlicensed use of the song, which they estimate has been used 100 times by the GOP campaign. The suit, which was filed in Georgia federal court, also names the Republican National Committee and conservative group Turning Point USA. In addition to the $150,000 fee per each use of the song, Hayes’ family also wants a disclaimer that they have not “authorized, endorsed, or permitted use of the Isaac Hayes Enterprises’ property at any point, now or in perpetuity throughout the universe” for the candidate. Previous musicians who have objected to Trump’s use of their songs include Bruce Springsteen, Adele, Celine Dion, Elton John, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, the estate of George Harrison, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Earth Wind & Fire. X users were quick to point out the folly of trying to co-opt Beyonce and her song: Anna Maltese wrote, Oh, look, you’re trying to copy Kamala Harris, that’s cute! Of course, Beyonce might feel differently. Portland, Oregon-based Badd Company responded with, “And now you will be sued, again, for Copyright Infringement. You, folks, are destroying yourselves, good job!” @ZephyrRN1701G said, “Holy s–t…OH NO HE DIDN’T.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., won his primary Tuesday, NBC News projects, handing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a final defeat on his revenge tour. Gaetz defeated Navy veteran Aaron Dimmock, who was backed by McCarthy, R-Calif., in the deeply Republican 1st District on the Florida Panhandle. McCarthy and his allies had targeted Gaetz, along with other Republicans who voted to oust him from the speakership late last year. McCarthy was able to claim only one win, helping to defeat House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., this summer. Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Eli Crane of Arizona also fended off primary challenges after they voted to oust McCarthy. A McCarthy-aligned super PAC called Florida Patriots PAC spent $3.5 million on ads against Gaetz, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact. The group ran ads referring to an ongoing Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz over allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct. Gaetz has dismissed the investigation as “frivolous.” But in a sign that Gaetz was in a strong position heading into the primary, Florida Patriots PAC stopped spending in the race three weeks ago. Gaetz also got a boost from former President Donald Trump, who endorsed him. Gaetz touted the endorsement on the airwaves, with one TV ad featuring audio of Trump saying Gaetz is “a very good person, and he’s a very capable man. You ever watch this guy on television? Like a machine. He’s great. He loves Florida, and he loves the country.” McCarthy is betting his effort was not completely in vain, suggesting that it could have dinged Gaetz if he decides to run for statewide office someday. “I don’t think he’ll ever be able to run for governor like he wants to,” McCarthy said at last month’s Republican convention, according to The Independent.","summary":"Rep.

Rick Scott wins Florida GOP primary as he seeks a second term","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Rick Scott has won the Republican primary in Florida, advancing to a Nov. 5 showdown against the winner of the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat. Scott — who won his 2018 race by a razor-thin margin of about 10,000 votes — has even larger ambitions as he looks to seek the Senate Republican leader seat if he wins the general election. An ally of former President Donald Trump, Scott sought the Senate leadership position in 2022 and lost by a 37-10 vote to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. This year, with McConnell stepping down, Scott could seek the position again Florida has shifted politically in the six years since Scott narrowly won office in 2018. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans, but now Republicans have more than a 1 million-voter advantage over Democrats. Scott will face former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in a race that could largely hinge on the success of their parties’ presidential candidates. The former Miami congresswoman had the backing of party leaders as she defeated three other Democrats on the ballot. She now has to overcome Scott’s power of incumbency and his ability to self-fund his campaign. Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign has focused largely on abortion rights, gun safety and Latin American issues. This year, Florida also has amendments to protect abortion rights and legalize marijuana on the ballot, which have historically benefitted Democrats in elections. She will also be pinned on Vice President Kamala Harris inspiring Democrats to the polls as she faces former President Donald Trump. Mucarsel-Powell was the first Ecuadorian American and South American-born congressional member elected when she won in 2018, but she lost her reelection bid in 2020 to U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez. The Senate seat was not the only one in Florida to watch, since some of the state’s congressional races include the most well-known far-right lawmakers. One such example is U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who must defeat his primary challenger Aaron Dimmock. That race has been fueled by a barrage of campaign advertisements, with Gaetz accusing Dimmock of being a carpetbagger who moved from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle to promote diversity and inclusion. Meanwhile Dimmock has highlighted allegations of sexual misconduct against Gaetz. U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds and Mike Waltz are also widely known conservative legislators. Donalds didn’t have any primary challengers, and Waltz defeated John Grow, a software engineer. Waltz had spoken at former President Donald Trump’s campaign events, made Fox News appearances and appeared at the Republican National Convention last month. U.S. Rep. Cory Mills, who is also closely aligned with Trump and has staunchly defended Gaetz in the past, defended his seat against former Florida Senate candidate and veteran Mike Johnson. Each of these congressional members are far-right conservatives in Congress, known mostly for their alignment with Trump. They’ve led charges to defend the former president, stalled appropriations bills and budget deals, upended former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and fought for stricter regulations on abortion access and immigration. Florida voters are deciding contested primaries in most of Florida’s 28 House districts. Among the higher-profile House races was in District 13, in Pinellas County along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Whitney Fox, a former marketing and communications director at the county transit authority, easily bested four Democratic opponents to take on GOP freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a member of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, who faced no primary opposition. The district leans Republican, but Fox expressed optimism she could prevail in November. “Our shared hopes for affordable housing, reproductive freedom, and an economy that works for everyone unite us far more than any differences divide us,” Fox said in an email. “This campaign is about putting power back in the hands of working families. It’s about ensuring that whether you’re a teacher, a small business owner, or a retiree, your voice matters.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mark Kelly responds to question on serving in potential Harris Cabinet","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., responded to a question about his level of interest in a Cabinet-level role in a potential Kamala Harris administration. After speaking at the Veterans and Military Families Council meeting during the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, Kelly joined Fox News Digital for an interview about the presidential race. The Arizona senator was asked by Fox News Digital if he would be interested in serving in Vice President Kamala Harris' cabinet if she won the presidential election in November, specifically in secretary positions in the Departments of Defense (DOD) or Homeland Security (DHS). GOP SENATORS KICK OFF TRUMP CAMPAIGN DNC COUNTER-PROGRAMMING: HARRIS 'DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE' \"I'm focused on doing everything I possibly can over the next 77 days to make sure that Tim Walz and Kamala Harris are successful on November 5th. That's my goal,\" he said, not indicating whether he'd want to join their administration. Kelly's answer was similar to his responses earlier this month when he was being considered and vetted as a potential running mate for Harris. He repeatedly told reporters that it wasn't about him, and he was focused on making sure Democrats win in November. STRATEGISTS PIN GOP SENATE HOPES ON TRUMP BASE COMING 'HOME' AHEAD OF ELECTION The Democratic senator's background as a 25-year Navy combat veteran puts him at a unique vantage point and makes him a very likely contender for a potential stint as the secretary of defense if he were interested. Similarly, Kelly's role as senator of a border state, who has made clear his concerns regarding illegal immigration, could leverage his standing on a list of possible DHS secretaries. One sticking point for the Arizona Democrat in the 2024 election is respect for veterans and their families. \"Do you expect somebody, Donald Trump to really care about military families when he doesn't even care about the service members that have put their lives on the line and regard them as suckers and losers?\" he asked on Tuesday. \"Of course you wouldn't.\" DEM SOCIALIST SENATOR RALLIES BEHIND HARRIS' PRICE-FIXING PLAN: 'IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD' However, former President Trump has denied the anonymously sourced report that said he called deceased soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied doing so, writing on Truth Social, \"Only a sicko with an axe to grind would suggest that anyone would make such a statement.\" But his denial hasn't stopped opponents, Kelly and President Biden included, from holding it against him. \"You need somebody who cares about our veterans and cares about our service members,\" Kelly told Fox News Digital. DEM-ALIGNED GROUP HAMMERS HARRIS' FORMER VP SHORTLISTER FOR TURNING 'HIS BACK' ON BLACK STUDENTS According to the senator, \"a President Harris will make sure that we continue to modernize our military, to make sure our service members can win in conflicts, whether it's in the Western Pacific, in Europe, in the Middle East, anywhere.\" He further described the \"tremendous amount of energy\" at the DNC, where Harris is being celebrated as the new Democratic nominee for president after Biden suspended his campaign. But Kelly said the enthusiasm isn't confined to Chicago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Arizona is often thought of as sort of a red state,\" he explained.

The biggest reason protesters have turned out: the war in Gaza. While the Democratic Party formally embraces a two-state solution, according to the party platform released this week, progressive elements within the party have long expressed frustration with President Joe Biden over the issue, claiming he hasn’t sufficiently pressured Israel to cease the attacks it has leveled on Gaza in the 10 months since the Oct. 7 attack. Trump, meanwhile, has issued many notable criticisms of Hamas. He said last week that if he is elected he would “deport pro-Hamas radicals,” and he has encouraged Israel to “finish the problem” in eliminating Hamas. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed support for a cease-fire, while Trump hasn’t. Still, Republicans didn’t face the same ire at their convention, and the reason protesters in Chicago said they showed up here, instead, is to hold the party currently in power accountable. Protesters said they were more enthusiastic about showing up at the Democratic convention, which kicked off Monday, for a variety of reasons. Most prominently, they include the progressive protesters’ belief that they may have a far more viable path to persuading a Harris-led ticket to enact meaningful policy change over the war in Gaza. But many also said they’re angry with Democrats because they believe that as the incumbent party, they hold more responsibility for the war than Republicans right now. “I want to push the Democratic Party on a lot of issues,” said Jacob Smith, 32, a software engineer who traveled from Detroit and attended Monday afternoon’s protest, at which several thousand people marched. He listed “stopping the genocide in Gaza” and achieving a “permanent cease-fire” as chief among them. He said he felt both parties were “equally beholden to special and corporate interests.” “They’re both basically right-wing parties at this point,” he said, adding, “But in general Democrats are a little better than Republicans.” Smith said he hasn’t decided whom he wants to vote for yet, and he wouldn’t offer whom he’s considering, other than that it “won’t be Trump.” Smith said he felt it was more important to protest the Biden-Harris administration because “it’s the administration that has aided and abetted an ongoing, visible genocide.” “The country is run by Democrats right now. This is happening on their watch,” he said. Smith said he was hopeful that Democratic Party leaders would be more likely to listen to such protest efforts “because progressive voters are part of their base — maybe they’ll be more likely to listen to us” than Republicans. Smith didn’t attend any of the far smaller protests at the RNC. “Obviously, protesting Republican policies is a good thing,” he said, “but how much of a policy change is it really realistic to expect would happen that way.” “It’s about efficacy in a lot of ways,” Smith added. “Where are your actions going to be most effective?” Lauren Pineiro, 24, a restaurant worker from Florida, also joined the smaller protests at the Republican convention. “I was happy to protest against Trump and the racist reactionary agenda of that party. But I think the reason why it was smaller is just because the Democrats are in power right now, and they’re the ones that have been overseeing this genocide,” she said. “I think that’s why people feel more strongly to come here, even though a lot of people do care about fighting back against Trump’s agenda.” Fred Schein, 76, a lifelong Chicago resident, said, “Trump is a fascist, and I would never vote for him, but the Democrats are the ones in power during this war.” He said that while this year’s protests are centered on the war in Gaza, “they also are really wrapping in quite a lot of issues,” he said, listing reproductive rights, climate change and immigrant rights as a few examples. Annie Weiler, 28, a marketing manager from Knoxville, Tennessee, said she hoped the protest effort would help guide the Harris campaign to pivot not just on tone but also on policy when it comes to the war in Gaza. “Right now, Kamala Harris still has the option to help stop funding this war,” she said. “I am a Democrat, but it is hard to support Kamala Harris when she is openly supporting Israel in this conflict,” Weiler added. Sean Parmelee, 36, marched Monday with a sign that read, “We’re trying to help you, Kamala.” He means it earnestly. “I’m voting for her — but many people here are not,” said Parmelee, a Chicago resident. “Honestly, she is making it very hard for them.” “Look at all this energy. She can have it all if she chooses,” he said. Parmelee said he’s protesting because pushing for a cease-fire and an arms embargo on Israel “is the right thing to do.” “And it’s the right strategy for Kamala Harris,” he said. As Parmelee spoke, a protest organizer wielding a megaphone led the crowd in a loud chant of “Harris, Harris, what do you say, how many kids have you killed today?” Sydney Loving, 29, a teacher from Dallas, said she was protesting now at the Democrats’ convention instead of at the Republicans’ last month because she sees the Biden administration as “the architects of the genocide in Gaza.” “It’s just that simple fact — they’re the ones who are in office, writing the checks, who are sending the missiles and all this stuff,” Loving said. Mariana Espana, 17, a student in Chicago who will be old enough to vote by Election Day, said she was here to help push Harris specifically to “act on a cease-fire for Palestine” because “it’s such a tragedy to see these kids dying.” “I personally support Kamala. A Trump presidency would be a disaster. But I feel it’s important to push Kamala to push for a cease-fire,” she said. “I think it would help her campaign, because it would help rally this wing of the party,” she said.","summary":"CHICAGO — The protests outside the Democratic National Convention, entering its second day, have already far outnumbered the demonstrations in Milwaukee a month ago, when former President Donald Trump accepted his party’s presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/protesters-dnc-far-outnumbered-republicans-convention-rcna167232","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240819-DNC-2024-protest-wm-351p-b79da3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:48:03","author":"Adam Edelman,Alex Tabet,Daniella Silva","authors":["Adam Edelman","Alex Tabet","Daniella Silva"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":254552454,"title":"DNC 2024: Who Is Angela Alsobrooks?

The time slot Alsobrooks was given speaks to the importance DNC organizers give her remarks and the parallels between the historic nature of her race and Harris'.In May, the 53-year-old won the Democratic primary over Representative David Trone. Trone spent $60 million on the primary, making it the most expensive primary election in the state's history.While history is on the Democrats' side in the election since Republicans haven't won a Senate seat in Maryland in over 40 years, Hogan is a formidable opponent. Hogan left office in 2023 with a 77 percent approval rating, making him one of the most popular governors in the country. His popularity was bipartisan, with an 81 percent approval rating with Democrats, according to a Gonzales Research and Media Services poll in January 2023.A June poll, however, shows the race between Hogan and Alsobrooks is much tighter than many people expected. A poll of 635 Maryland voters from Public Policy Polling found Alsobrooks is leading the Maryland Senate race 45 percent to 34 percent.\"The fight ahead will not be easy,\" Alsobrooks said after winning the primary. \"Maryland has been a blue state, but it will only stay a blue state if we put in the work.

She began her professional career in 1997 as Prince George's County Assistant State's Attorney and became the first full-time prosecutor assigned to handle domestic violence cases.In 2010, she became the youngest person and first woman elected to serve as the County's State Attorney.Alsobrooks graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor's Degree in Public Policy and received her law degree from the University of Maryland. She's also a Delta Sigma Theta Sorority member and has one daughter named Alex.When Harris learned that Alsobrooks won her election in 2010 after running a campaign on policies Harris deployed in San Francisco, the future vice president called to congratulate her, according to The Washington Post. Over the years, Harris and Alsobrooks have helped each other with their campaigns.

[+] cultivate it in their own arena. getty In my speaker training workshops, I frequently get questions about executive presence. What is it, how to improve it, why it’s important in the first place. A lack of executive presence is frequently cited as the reason a worker is being held back from a promotion or overlooked for important projects. And feedback about executive presence is surprisingly lacking in actionable detail. Perhaps not for much longer. Communicating executive presence involves a distinct set of skills, but the measurable characteristics of executive presence are still evolving. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Merit and Success has been around for a decade and focused on gravitas, communication and appearance. Enter Scott Hutcheson, a senior lecturer at Purdue University and owner of a training and consulting business centered on leadership. He has worked with 4,000 leaders in 147 countries. Hutcheson cultivated an interest in executive presence over the course of his 40-year career in leadership training – “before it had a name,” he said. He set out to look at whether executive presence matters in the highest of high-stakes contests: the United States presidential election. This work will be featured in an upcoming book about executive presence. “After several conversations about who is ‘presidential’ and who isn’t, I decided to conduct research,” said Hutcheson. “I found the results fascinating and others seemed to find them quite interesting as well.” MORE FOR YOU Netflix’s Best New Movie Arrives With A Perfect 100% Critic Score ‘Emily In Paris’ Dethroned In Netflix’s Top 10 List By A New Show How Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Accidentally Bought Into An Alleged $100 Million Mississippi Cancer Cluster Hutcheson created a model based on three traits, each with six behaviors. The 18-behavior framework was statistically validated by Dutch partner company Human Insight. They include: Warmth: Active listening and connecting with others on a personal level, which helps leaders build trust and foster a positive, engaging environment. Competence: Setting the right priorities and being well prepared, which helps leaders demonstrate expertise and reliability. Gravitas: Maintaining composure under pressure and delivering messages effectively, which are crucial for commanding respect and inspiring confidence. Hutcheson and his team of Ph.D. students used GenAI tools to analyze information about presidential candidates. Each candidate was given a score based on the model, then examined the election results. Bottom Line: Executive Presence Wins Elections Since 1960, the first election with televised debates, in every U.S. presidential election except one (Bush/Kerry), the candidate with a higher executive presence score won the popular vote. In two elections (Bush/Gore and Hilary Clinton/Trump), the candidate with the higher executive presence score won the popular vote but did not win the electoral college. Here are the top executive presence scores among candidates based on the Hutcheson model and GenAI analysis: Barack Obama (95) John F. Kennedy (92.5) Ronald Reagan (92.5) Kamala Harris (92.5) Bill Clinton (90) In an exchange about the current presidential candidates, Hutcheson points out that Harris’s background as a prosecutor has likely contributed to her ability to project confidence and maintain composure, key parts of gravitas, and her ability to connect with people supports warmth, while her lengthy government experience indicates competence. Although Donald Trump did not score high on executive presence (at a score of 62.5), he demonstrates “a unique ability to connect with a large and loyal base through his unfiltered communication style, which many perceive as authentic and relatable,” said Hutcheson. The Lesson for Leaders Business leaders who dismiss the importance of executive presence do so at their peril, because leaders must constantly win the “votes” of employees, shareholders and other stakeholders. Hutcheson stresses that executive presence isn’t something that’s achieved overnight. “It’s a continuous process of growth and refinement. With deliberate effort, any leader can elevate their presence and influence,” he said. Hutcheson has actionable recommendations that leaders should prioritize to build a stronger executive presence. Warmth: Develop an ability to connect with others by improving listening skills and showing genuine interest in people. Competence: Sharpen your expertise and be prepared. This will build your credibility and ensure that others see you as a reliable authority. Gravitas: Work on maintaining composure, especially under pressure, and communicate your ideas with clarity and conviction. I’ll add that an organization’s culture will determine which characteristics are most valued, and therefore most rewarded. My own recommendation is to take stock of the behaviors you observe in successful leaders and determine how to showcase your own best traits without feeling like you need to mimic a leader you admire.

President Joe Biden’s son is expected to go on trial next month on nine tax-related counts, including three felony counts and six misdemeanor counts of failure to pay taxes. Hunter Biden, 54, of Malibu, “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,” the indictment alleges. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Donald Trump appointee who is overseeing the trial, this week rejected the defendant’s bid to toss the case after the president’s son sought to argue the special counsel prosecuting the case was improperly appointed. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals previously rejected the younger Biden’s request to revive a bid to have the charges against him tossed. Hunter Biden’s lawyers wrote in legal filings that they believe the case was brought “in direct response to political pressure.” His attorneys wrote that the defendant has since paid his tax bill, plus fines, to the government. Hunter Biden is not expected to attend Wednesday’s hearing. Regarding the tax charges, the 56-page indictment filed in L.A. federal court alleges that between 2016 and Oct. 15, 2020, “the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.” In June, the president’s son was convicted of three felony charges in a separate federal case brought in Delaware stemming from the purchase of a gun in 2018. Hunter Biden was found guilty of having lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs — when, in fact, he later admitted to having been addicted to illegal narcotics at the time. Court papers show Hunter Biden is scheduled to be sentenced in the Delaware gun case on Nov. 13, in the week after the presidential election. Described in the indictment as a Georgetown- and Yale-educated lawyer, lobbyist, consultant and businessperson, Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate and a Chinese private equity fund during the time of the tax allegations. “He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements for business and legal services that paid millions of dollars of compensation to him and/or his domestic corporations, Owasco PC and Owasco LLC,” according to the indictment for tax evasion. In addition to his business interests, the defendant was an employee of a multinational law firm, the document states. Hunter Biden has said he had forgotten to pay his taxes during a period when he was in the grip of drug addiction.","summary":"The president's son is accused of failing to pay more than $1.4 million in taxes.

Attorneys for two Democratic activists challenging Kennedy’s spot on the ballot said in a Harrisburg courtroom on Tuesday that Kennedy’s candidacy paperwork has a fake home address. Similar allegations are being heard in other state courts. They also argued that the third-party candidate hasn’t gathered the required number of signatures. Citing a canceled flight from Boston to Philadelphia the evening before, Kennedy showed up an hour and 40 minutes late. Commonwealth Court Judge Lori Dumas had earlier decided to continue without his testimony. Just after his arrival, the hearing was adjourned without the judge indicating when she would rule on the matter. Kennedy could snag votes from Vice President Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump if he were to appear on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground with 19 electoral votes. Trump won the state in 2016 but President Joe Biden won it back in 2020. The attorney for Kennedy slammed the judge’s move to continue without the candidate’s testimony. Kennedy claimed that the Democrats are trying to block the rights of tens of millions of voters. “To me, it’s a sad devolution of this party that the only way that they can win elections is to keep its opponents off the debating stage, off the ballots, and use lawfare to try to win elections rather than campaigning,” he said outside the courthouse. “I’ll be on the ballot in every state,” he added. The Kennedy campaign has called the challenge “frivolous” and Kennedy lawyer Paul Rossi said that a state shouldn’t be in the business of banning a candidate from its ballot because of a residency argument. He said that it would lead to a “patchwork” of state court rulings removing some candidates from ballots, citing the March Supreme Court ruling to reinstate Trump on primary ballots following state attempts to use the 14th Amendment to have him removed. Rossi added that a federal court ruling from 2016 which ordered a lowering of the signature requirements for candidates from smaller parties should also be used in Kennedy’s case. One of the attorneys for the activists challenging Kennedy’s presence on the ballot, Tim Ford, said that Kennedy had filed petitions that violated state law and that his late appearance “shows a total disregard for our process here in Pennsylvania and a disrespect for the voters who have to make the decision of who they’re going to vote for for president.” Ford argued that Kennedy hasn’t shown that the signature ruling should apply in this case and that the “patchwork” argument references a federal constitutional case and cannot be used in a case where the state of Pennsylvania is setting the rules governing who can appear on its ballots. Kennedy is battling challenges in other states as well, including Georgia and New York. Last week, a New York judge rejected his nominating petitions because the listed address was a “sham.” Kennedy is appealing the decision. Kennedy has listed his address as being in the Empire State, but those challenging his presence on the ballot say that he really lives in Los Angeles, California. Rossi argued that Kennedy partly pointed to the New York address to adhere to the 12th Amendment which states that a president and vice president shouldn’t be from the same state – Kennedy’s running mate Nicole Shanahan is a Californian.

Stephanie Grisham, who held the role from July 2019 to April 2020, is one of several Republican figures invited to the convention in Chicago to denounce the “extremism” of the former president and his campaign. During her remarks, she told attendees that the former president mocks his supporters behind closed doors, calling them “basement dwellers.” “I wasn't just a Trump supporter. I was a true believer,” Grisham said, before adding that during a hospital visit “when people were dying in the ICU, he was mad that the cameras were not watching him. He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth.” “He used to tell me, ‘it doesn't matter what you say, Stephanie, say it enough and people will believe you,’” the former press secretary said. She added that she resigned on January 6, 2021, because she “couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.” “Kamala Harris tells the truth, she repsects the American people and she has my vote,” she said. In a statement to NBC News, Grisham said she never thought she would be speaking at a Democratic convention. “But, after seeing firsthand who Donald Trump really is, and the threat he poses to our country, I feel very strongly about speaking out.” She added: “While I don’t agree with Vice President Harris on everything, I am proud to be supporting her because I know she will defend our freedoms and represent our nation with honesty and integrity.” Other Republicans are expected to share a similar message throughout the convention, including former Representative Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, who is scheduled to speak Thursday. On Monday – the first night of the convention – a video compilation of former Trump voters was played to attendees, including a longer interview with a former Trumper, Rich Logis. “While Donald Trump continues to attack moderates and independents, the Harris-Walz campaign has made clear that there is a place in our coalition for voters who reject the extremism of Donald Trump and want to protect our democracy,” a Harris campaign official said. Grisham was Trump’s third White House press secretary, succeeding Sarah Huckabee Sanders and was the first White House Press Secretary to hold no press conferences. She later assumed the role of chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump on April 7 2020. On the evening of January 6 2021, Grisham resigned from the position following the storming of the United States Capitol. In the aftermath of the insurrection and her resignation Grisham has become a fervent critic of her former boss, warning that he would “seek revenge” if not reelected. She told CNN earlier this year: “He used to tell me when I was press secretary, ‘Go out there and say this.’ And if it was false, he would say, ‘It doesn’t matter, Stephanie. Just say it over and over and over again, people will believe it.’ “He knows his base believes in him. He knows he can basically say anything and his base will believe what he’s saying.” Her inclusion on the second night of the convention, which also includes remarks from Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, continues the Harris campaign’s drive to recruit Republicans to their cause. “We will be putting patriotic Republicans front and center in our convention programming to explain, in their own words, why they are putting country first and supporting Vice President Harris,” Austin Weatherford, the campaign’s national Republican engagement director, said in a statement to NBC News. The campaign launched its “Republicans for Harris” program this month to reach more moderate and independent voters who may have supported Trump in the past, specifically highlighting the controversial Project 2025 document.","summary":"Stephanie Grisham is one of several Republican figures invited to the convention in Chicago","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephanie-grisham-trump-speech-dnc-b2599220.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/21/00/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/07DjtZNh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:31:37","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":254551966,"title":"Night 2 of the DNC Live Updates: Obama’s Comeback and a Promising Candidate for Democrats Beyond Kamala Harris","text":"Night two of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) probably cannot go any worse for the wayward Democrat Party than night one did … but it just might. On the second night at the “mostly peaceful” gathering of leftists in Chicago, Illinois, former President Barack Obama will return to the main stage and spotlight to give the keynote address at the end of the evening. His wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, will speak earlier in the evening. Interestingly, several Democrats are quite openly referring to Michelle Obama as their “dream candidate,” which means despite the hullabaloo from across the media that Vice President Kamala Harris is not in fact the “dream candidate” for the party. The Democrats are just kind of stuck with Harris, as they had no other options when they staged a coup against the guy who happens to be the sitting president of the United States who’s from their party President Joe Biden. It’s worth noting that they, perhaps conveniently perhaps not, shoved Biden in the trunk of the car at the end of the night well after primetime on Monday night to hasten his march to being yesterday’s news. Speaking of the media, cracks are beginning to emerge across the establishment media when it comes to their close relationship with Democrats and particularly the Harris campaign. Several establishment reporters were critical of the DNC’s unfocused and unusually long and disjointed programming on Monday evening. If the party does not sort out these issues by Tuesday, things could begin to get much worse for Harris and Democrats–and it is definitely something to watch as the evening shakes out. But now that Biden is firmly squashed in history’s dustbin, Democrats will look forward to the next less than 80 days to election day on Nov. 5 and their efforts to try to make the presidential race competitive again. David Plouffe, one of Obama’s closest advisers who seems to be running things at what was the Biden campaign but is now the Harris campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, did an interview early on Tuesday with Axios where he said the battleground states have returned to the traditional fight like the nation saw in 2016 or 2020. But right after he said that, a new poll emerged out of Virginia showing Republican candidate Donald Trump has again pulled into a statistical tie with Harris in the Old Dominion, flashing more warning signs for Democrats that Trump may be again expanding the map now that Harris’s sugar high has faded. So again, the big picture this evening is a flash back to history in the good ‘ole days for modern Democrats when Obama was president–which comes after they crushed the inconvenient lump of a current president into history already–and a look at what might be the future when the other Obama might emerge in a future race for president, but not this year. Of course, while this all happens, the Democrats will continue to try to convince themselves that everything they know about Harris’s extremism and incompetence was actually a fantasy and that they do in fact have a shot at winning in November despite giant flashing warning signs emerging everywhere already less than a month into Harris’s nascent campaign. And they will try to do it while staying on schedule and not pissing everyone watching off by having pointless speeches drag on too long. Can they execute? Follow along here, because – News will watch so you don’t have to. Below, find live updates with news and analysis from the second night of DNC primetime programming.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNight two of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) probably cannot go any&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Night 2 of the DNC Live Updates: Obama&#8217;s Comeback and a Promising Candidate for Democrats Beyond Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/night-2-of-the-dnc-live-updates-obamas-comeback-and-a-promising-candidate-for-democrats-beyond-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-DNC-Livewire-Night-2-Fantasy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:29:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":254551742,"title":"Trump lawyer revealed as Iran hacking target after feds warn of phishing","text":"An attorney for former President Donald Trump was targeted by Iran’s government in its recent hacking attempts against the Republican presidential nominee, according to a new report — after the US intelligence community warned Monday of foreign phishing operations targeting political candidates. Trump’s lawyer Lindsey Halligan, who has worked for the ex-president for several years, was identified to CNN by three sources as one of Tehran’s targets — though the outlet said it was unclear to what degree the hackers were able to access information in her accounts. The Trump campaign did not dispute the report’s identification of Halligan as a target. “These reports of the attempted hacking of President Trump’s team by the Terrorist Regime in Iran come after recent disclosures of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, Pa., tragedy,” said campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. “The Iranians are petrified that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House. Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.” The US intelligence community and the FBI said in a joint statement Monday that Iran is determined “to try to shape the outcome” of the Nov. 5 election by using “cyber operations.” Hackers allegedly linked to the Russian government used similar tactics during the 2016 election — including by hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. Those hacks helped divide Democrats by revealing that party bosses colluded to stomp out the candidacy of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, including by providing Clinton with advance knowledge of at least one debate question. Podesta clicked on a phishing link in March 2016 after a phony Gmail security alert urged him to update his password. The method by which Iran targeted Halligan is unclear. CNN also reported that informal Trump adviser Roger Stone’s email account was hacked by suspected Iranian operatives, who then leveraged the access to break into the account of a Trump campaign official. Trump regularly boasts that his aggressive enforcement of sanctions caused economic hardship in Iran resulting in a lack of funds to arms proxy militants in Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria and Yemen — and frequently blasts the Biden-Harris administration as too soft in its approach. The Republican nominee and his relatives also have engaged in business with Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia, with Trump’s golf courses partnering with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner managing a $2 billion investment from Riyadh’s sovereign wealth fund. The federal government statement Monday urged caution in online activities. “Using strong passwords and only official email accounts for official business, updating software, avoiding clicking on links or opening attachments from suspicious emails before confirming their authenticity with the sender, and turning on multi-factor authentication will drastically improve online security and safety,” the statement said. Halligan and Stone did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.","summary":"An attorney for former President Donald Trump was targeted by Iran&#8217;s government in its recent hacking attempts against the Republican presidential nominee, according to a new report — after the US intelligence community warned Monday of foreign phishing operations targeting political candidates.

Harris, smiling and clapping as she walked, joined the President on stage after he concluded his speech, embracing him and offering a heartfelt message of support. ‘You made me cry,’ Harris told Biden, according to a lip reader who decoded their exchange. The presidential hopeful, 59, added: ‘I love you so much, you’re amazing.’ Harris also promised the 81-year-old that ‘I’ll stay here with you’, suggesting she will continue to offer guidance to Biden – who had just past the torch to her. Biden delivered his valedictory address to delegates and supporters Monday night, saying, ‘I gave my best to you’ and basking in a long ovation that reflected the energy released by his decision to cede the stage to Harris. He insisted he did not harbor any ill will about the impending end of his tenure – despite reports to the contrary – and called on the party to unite around Harris. Visibly emotional when he took the stage, Biden was greeted by a more than four-minute-long ovation and chants of ‘Thank you Joe.’ He replied: ‘America, I love you.’ The president began by wiping away a tear as his daughter Ashley introduced him. His eyes were also visibly watery during parts of his farewell speech. ‘I made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you,’ Biden said. ‘For 50 years, like many of you, I give my heart and soul to the nation.’ He called his selection of Harris as his running mate four years ago ‘the very first decision I made when I became our nominee, and it was the best decision I made my whole career’. ‘She’s tough, she’s experienced and she has enormous integrity, enormous integrity,’ he said. ‘Her story represents the best American story.’ ‘And like many of our best presidents,’ he added in a nod to his own career, ‘she was also vice president.’ He also insisted he wasn’t angry about stepping aside, despite a slew of Democrats having demanded he drop out, and said he was acting for the good of the country. ‘All this talk about how I’m angry about all the people who said I should step down, that’s not true,’ he said. He noted how he had five months left in office and said: ‘I’ve got a lot to do – I intend to get it done.’ ‘It’s been an honor of my lifetime. I love the job. But I love my country more,’ the president continued. Biden, in his remarks, repeated his 2020 theme that ‘we’re in a battle for the very soul of America,’ and pressed the case for why Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were best prepared to wage it. ‘Because of you, we’ve had the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period,’ Biden declared. And then he interjected, ‘I say “we,” I mean “me and Kamala”,’ sharing the credit for his most popular successes with the vice president. Biden also vowed: ‘I promise I will be the best volunteer Harris and Walz’s campaign has ever seen.’ Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff came out after his address to embrace him and his family. ‘Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you’ll continue to do,’ she said earlier in the evening. ‘We are forever grateful to you.’ Harris’s appearance at the convention on Monday night to thank Biden for his leadership was brief and unannounced. She will travel today to Milwaukee for a rally in the swing state of Wisconsin before returning to Chicago late in the evening. Emhoff and former President Barack Obama will speak today on the second day of the convention, turning the party’s attention toward Harris and her faceoff against Republican Donald Trump. The Harris campaign said today that it will spotlight ‘trusted messengers’ from key battleground states over the convention’s three remaining days. They include Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. From Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly will speak along with John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina will be the last speaker before Harris accepts the Democratic nomination on Thursday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told Joe Biden he was &#8216;amazing&#8217; and made her &#8216;cry&#8217;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala&#8217;s Response to Biden&#8217;s Tearful Speech: &#8220;I Gave it Everything&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamalas-response-to-bidens-tearful-speech-i-gave-it-everything/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/20/11/88719471-0-image-m-23_1724151338037.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:22:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":254551772,"title":"Donald Trump's Odds of Winning Election Rise After DNC Start","text":"Donald Trump's chances of defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in November have increased among bookmakers following this week's start of the Democratic National Convention (DNC).As of Tuesday evening, predictive betting website Polymarket listed Trump as a slight favorite to win the election, giving the former president a 50 percent chance to Harris' 48 percent. The odds were reversed when the DNC got underway in Chicago just 24 hours earlier, when Harris was listed as the slight favorite.Harris' odds of beating Trump peaked on August 15, when Polymarket gave her a 54 percent chance of winning to Trump's 44 percent. While the vice president's odds worsened by a small amount on Tuesday, they have generally been on an upward trajectory over the past few weeks.In a Tuesday post to X (formerly Twitter), Polymarket shared a short video showing the changing odds in the presidential race since June 25, when President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee. Trump had a relatively comfortable lead over the Democratic ticket until earlier this month, when Harris drew level with the former president.Meanwhile, rival bookmaker BetOnline.ag listed both Trump and Harris with -110 odds to win as of Tuesday evening. The company told Newsweek that Harris had been leading last week, \"but steady betting on Trump over the past two days has pulled the numbers back to even.\"Most recent polls continue to indicate that Harris has a small but significant lead over Trump nationally. An average of surveys compiled by polling website FiveThirtyEight shows Harris leading Trump by 2.8 points as of Tuesday night.In addition, the polling picture now slightly favors Harris in several key battleground states. The latest FiveThirtyEight averages show that the vice president is ahead by 0.7 points in Arizona, 1.3 points in Pennsylvania, 2.8 points in Michigan and 3.2 points in Wisconsin.Trump has a 1.2 percent lead in Georgia and a tiny 0.2 percent lead in North Carolina, according to Tuesday's FiveThirtyEight averages. The race is dead even in Nevada, where the average shows that each candidate is favored by 44.6 percent of voters.With all signs pointing to a very close race in November, both campaigns will be hoping to capitalize on whatever momentum they can achieve ahead of November 5.The Harris campaign could see some benefits from the DNC after it concludes on Thursday, as major political party conventions typically result in a slight polling bump.The first day of the DNC included speeches from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, first lady Jill Biden and a surprise short speech by Harris. Biden delivered the night's closing keynote address.Day two of the DNC was expected to include appearances by several pro-Harris Republicans, including former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, along with speeches from independent Senator Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.","summary":"Trump's betting odds have improved as the Democratic National Convention's second day got underway.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-odds-winning-election-rise-after-dnc-start-1942077","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2454301/donald-trump-betting-odds-improve-dnc-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:22:14","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":254551740,"title":"Judge strikes down Biden admin ban on noncompete agreements: ‘Arbitrary and capricious’","text":"A federal judge in Texas on Tuesday barred a Federal Trade Commission rule from taking effect that would ban agreements commonly signed by workers not to join their employers’ rivals or launch competing businesses. US District Judge Ada Brown in Dallas said the FTC, which enforces federal antitrust laws, does not have the authority to ban practices it deems unfair methods of competition by adopting broad rules. Brown had temporarily blocked the rule in July while she considered a bid by the US Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobby, and tax service firm Ryan to strike it down entirely. The rule was set to take effect Sept. 4. Brown in her ruling said that even if the FTC had the power to adopt the rule, the agency had not justified banning virtually all noncompete agreements. “The Commission’s lack of evidence as to why they chose to impose such a sweeping prohibition … instead of targeting specific, harmful non-competes, renders the Rule arbitrary and capricious,” wrote Brown, an appointee of Republican former President Donald Trump. FTC spokesperson Victoria Graham said the agency was disappointed with the ruling and is “seriously considering a potential appeal.” “Today’s decision does not prevent the FTC from addressing noncompetes through case-by-base enforcement actions,” Graham said in a statement. The Chamber of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Democratic-controlled FTC approved the ban on noncompete agreements in a 3-2 vote in May. The commission and supporters of the rule say the agreements are an unfair restraint on competition that violate US antitrust law and suppress workers’ wages and mobility. About 30 million people, or 20% of US workers, have signed noncompetes, according to the FTC. The commission often adopts rules that target specific industries, such as requiring telemarketers to make certain disclosures or mandating that gas stations display fuel ratings, but it is unusual for the agency to enact bans on more widespread business practices. Business groups have argued that Congress never intended to give the FTC those broad powers, and that banning noncompetes will make it difficult to safeguard trade secrets and other confidential information. Last week, a federal judge in Florida ruled that the ban was likely invalid and blocked it from being applied to a real estate developer. But a judge in Philadelphia went the other way in July, finding that the FTC reasonably concluded that noncompetes are virtually never justified.","summary":"The judge, a Trump appointee, said that even if the FTC had the power to adopt the rule, the agency had not justified banning virtually all noncompete agreements.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/business/judge-strikes-down-biden-admin-ban-on-worker-noncompete-agreements/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/ftc-noncompete-ban.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724179482&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:20:23","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":254551822,"title":"Trump is losing his audience","text":"We all know how important crowd size is to Donald Trump. That’s why liberals and Democrats enjoy sharing video clips on social media of his campaign rallies in which there appear to be lots of empty seats. But I think liberals and Democrats are missing the forest for the trees. Crowd size is not as important as crowd interest. The question isn’t whether they’re coming. It’s whether they’re staying. They aren’t. About 7,000-8,000 people attended Trump’s rally on Friday in eastern Pennsylvania, according to Mary Wheeler. Another reporter at the venue (for the New York Post) said it can hold around 10,000. About an hour into Trump’s speechifying, however, attendees started heading for the exits, according toUSA Today reporter Zac Anderson. “Looks like people are starting to trickle out of the Wilkes-Barre Trump rally as he goes past the hour mark. There appears to be more empty seats.” Why aren’t they staying? Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House spokeswoman who’s now co-host of “The View,” suggested a reason. “One I keep hearing from voters is simply exhaustion,” she wrote Monday (my italics). “The ‘Trump Show’ appealed to many who were frustrated with the Washington status quo and were willing to try something totally different. Trump is running for a third time – and a fourth time if you count his soft-run in 2012. Many voters who liked his policies on the economy, border, etc., are fatigued over the drama that comes with Trump.” Griffin wasn’t talking about crowd sizes and she wasn’t talking about Trump voters. She was speaking more generally about the kind of voters Trump needs to win the election, but isn’t currently attracting. US Senator Lindsey Graham echoed that same sentiment over the weekend. To appeal to these so-called independent voters, especially suburban white women, Graham urged the former president to stop with the name-calling, the outbursts and otherwise incendiary rhetoric. Trump the policymaker can win the election, he told “Meet the Press.” But “Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not.” However, Trump voters and indie voters have a lot in common when you consider the other meaning of the word exhaustion. Not only are people exhausted in the sense that they are tired. They are exhausted in the sense that they are bored. Their interest appears depleted. They came for “The Trump Show” Friday. They left after it got boring. I don’t want to make too much of this, and I don’t have hard data at hand, but this suggests double trouble. Not only is Trump failing to attract the attention of people who might support him, he’s failing to keep the attention of people who do. Some voters aren’t listening, and perhaps never will. However, those who are listening aren’t listening for long. Lindsey Graham is right to warn against alienating indie voters. But he may be wrong to assume Trump voters are in the bag. But “The Trump Show” isn’t boring because it’s familiar and tedious, as Alyssa Farah Griffin suggested. I think it’s boring because it doesn’t make any sense. It’s like he fired the show’s original creators, but forgot to hire new writers. The result is that he’s nearly always improvising, and the result of that is that he’s nearly always incoherent. Most people aren’t going to try making sense of his incoherence, though. When they get bored, they simply drift away. This is important to say. The conventional wisdom among Republicans, former Republicans and the reporters who reflect their views is that Trump must stop playing the role of showman to win over indie voters, especially white women. He must stop saying things like he’s much better looking than Kamala Harris. (Yes, he said that.) They say he needs to stick to policy. “Trump doesn’t seem to be making a serious effort,” Charlie Dent, a former GOP congressman, toldThe Financial Times. “The focus is still all about maga [Make America Great Again]. But I’m sceptical that the maga base will be large enough to win.” But the conventional wisdom among Republicans seems misguided. He’s already stopped playing that role of showman. Indeed, he may no longer be capable of playing it again. Something is very wrong with him. He’s habitually incoherent. His press conferences usually devolve into a word salad so impenetrable it’s like a foreign language. Bloomberg’s Tim O’Brien has said he’s not well. Point is: A showman never loses his audience. But Donald Trump appears to be losing his. Crowd interest, more than crowd size, is worth our attention, because it tells us rally goers are seeing something that the rest of us are not. I suspect what they are seeing, though perhaps without knowing it, is that Trump can’t communicate anymore. He talks and he talks, to be sure, but it’s not talking that makes any kind of sense. It’s gibberish, and gibberish never persuaded anyone to do anything. It can’t even persuade Trump voters to stay in their seats. Too many people are spending too much time parsing the meaning of this or that remark. Rally goers aren’t bothering, though. They are telling us the truth. The story of “The Trump Show” is no longer spectacular. It’s gibberish now. And gibberish is boring.","summary":"We all know how important crowd size is to Donald Trump.

Kennedy Jr's running mate Nicole Shanahan said this week that the pair are considering ending their independent campaign to endorse former President Donald Trump. \"So you know, there's two options that we're looking at, and one is staying in, forming that new party,\" Shanahan told the \"Impact Theory\" podcast. \"But we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and Walz presidency because we draw votes from Trump, or we walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump, and you know, we walk away from that, and we explain to our base why we're making this decision.\" In a statement to ABC News, Shanahan said such a move would \"require a significant commitment by Trump to give Bobby true authority to execute,\" though she did not explain what that would entail. Shanahan's comments were a shocking moment of candor about the independent campaign's thinking in the final months of the presidential race. As ABC News reported, Kennedy met with Trump last month during the Republican National Convention, where the men discussed potential roles Kennedy could play in a Trump White House, including Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has run on a commitment to make America healthier, talking extensively about chronic disease and issues with the pharmaceutical industry, though he has espoused some debunked claims -- for example, that vaccines and autism are linked -- and is deeply skeptical of vaccines. Trump, speaking to CNN Tuesday in Michigan, said he would \"love\" an endorsement from Kennedy. Kennedy has also sought a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Washington Post reported last week Kennedy sought a cabinet position in exchange for an endorsement. Kennedy has played coy about his future in the race, saying recently he \"would talk about my status in the race\" if he felt another candidate was committed to focusing on the issues he cared about. Until Shanahan's remarks this week the campaign hadn't been so transparent about the possibility Kennedy, who despite tanking poll numbers maintains a fervent base of supporters, would abandon his bid. At one point in the interview with \"Impact Theory,\" Shanahan spoke about the campaign as though it was near its deathbed, using the past tense to describe its prospects. \"We wanted to win. We wanted a fair shot,\" she said, lamenting the flood of money and lawsuits the Democratic Party has dedicated to removing Kennedy from the ballot in multiple states. An Albany judge ordered this month that Kennedy be kept from the New York ballot over residency issues, though the candidate has appealed the ruling, and separate court cases are in session this week in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Her comments are unlikely to help an already struggling fundraising operation. Jeff Hays, who has helped raise money for the campaign and a pro-Kennedy super PAC, told ABC News on Tuesday, \"That just absolutely killed fundraising.\" Hays was going to host a fundraiser next month for the PAC, American Values, in Utah, but he's calling it off, he said. Tony Lyons, American Values' co-founder, told ABC News Hays was \"overreacting,\" claiming without explanation that Shanahan's interview would actually help the group's fundraising numbers. \"I'm sure there will be many more twists and turns,\" he said. \"There's a lot more baseball to be played.\" On Twitter, Kennedy wrote, \"As always, I am willing to talk with leaders of any political party to further the goals I have served for 40 years in my career and in this campaign. These are: reversing the chronic disease epidemic, ending the war machine, cleaning corporate influence out of government and toxic pollution out of the environment, protecting freedom of speech, and ending politicization of enforcement agencies.\"","summary":"RFK Jr. considering ending campaign and endorsing Trump, running mate says.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rfk-jr-ending-campaign-endorsing-trump-running-mate/story?id=112996246","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/935a084b-33c8-49ff-8630-3256a0aed506/robert-kennedy-ap-jt-240820_1724191010111_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:09:32","author":"Will McDuffie","authors":["Will McDuffie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.011},{"id":254553116,"title":"Obama, Harris highlight demographic shift at root of Trump-MAGA panic","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

The Nate Silver-backed prediction market and betting platform is now giving Trump a two-point edge over the Vice President, 50% to Harris’ 48%. Trump led Harris in the forecast by as much as 10% when she clinched the party’s nomination for president Aug. 5. Harris quickly narrowed the gap, after her campaign got a boost of momentum, taking the lead in the forecast for the first time on Aug. 8, when the odds favored her over Trump by a margin of 50% to 48%. The California Democrat’s lead steadily widened, peaking at 54% to 44% a week later on Aug. 15 before quickly sliding back to a near even split, where the rivals have remained until her unannounced appearance at the DNC paying tribute to President Biden Monday night. The forecast’s odds are evenly split between the candidates among six key swing states. Trump leads in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, all of which Biden carried in 2020. The Republican’s lead in Georgia is the highest of the three, where he tops Harris 59% to 41%. Harris is the odds-on favorite in the Rust Belt battlegrounds, notching a lead in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Harris leads in the Great Lake State by nearly 30 points, 64% to 36%.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump has reclaimed a narrow lead over Kamala Harris in Polymarket's 2024 presidential election forecast.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/us-news/trump-pulls-ahead-in-key-2024-forecast-after-kamala-harris-surprise-dnc-appearance/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-8j6j3tsr9-1724194273713.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724179910&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:06:44","author":"Chris Nesi","authors":["Chris Nesi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":254551326,"title":"Trump campaigns to ‘make America safe again’ as Democratic convention zeroes in on his felony record","text":"By ISABELLA VOLMERT and BILL BARROW HOWELL, Mich. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to “Make America Safe Again” while campaigning in Michigan as the Democrats who gathered in Chicago to nominate Kamala Harris branded him a career criminal. As part of a battleground campaign swing designed to counter the Democratic National Convention, Trump stood alongside sheriff’s deputies in the city of Howell and tarred Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, as the “ringleader” of a “Marxist attack on law enforcement” across the country. “Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,” Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris. “You’ll see levels of crime that you’ve never seen before. … I will deliver law, order, safety and peace.” Trump has sought in recent weeks to blunt the enthusiasm that Harris has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed her. That has involved both dark predictions about what electing Harris would mean for the country and efforts by Trump’s advisers to set up events where he can try to draw specific policy contrasts. On Tuesday in Michigan, the subject was crime and public safety. “Our policemen and women have the backs of law-abiding citizens every day,” Trump said. “When we go back to the White House, you’re going to see support the likes of which you haven’t seen, certainly in four years.” In excerpts released before his speech, Trump’s campaign also said he would call for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers; he did not mention that during his remarks. The event was the latest billed as focused on a specific issue. But on these occasions, Trump has spent considerable time attacking Harris personally and taking shots at Biden, and the same was true after their appearances Monday at the Democratic convention. “I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend everything was great,” Trump said, singling out inflation and the U.S.-Mexico border as topics Democrats glossed over. “We have a fool as president,” he said of Biden. Trump presented a bleak portrait of life in the U.S. and the threat of a Harris presidency, though he was short on specifics and heavy on hyperbole. “It’s just insane,” Trump said. “You can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be. And you’ve seen it, and I’ve seen it, and it’s time for a change.” Trump making such claims, surrounded by supportive law enforcement officers, stood in stark contrast to the Democrats’ convention. Speaker after speaker found ways Monday night in Chicago to remind Americans that Trump is the first former president ever convicted of felony crimes, has been found civilly liable for sexual assault, and still faces multiple indictments, including for his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat to Biden. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas skewered Trump on Monday night as “a career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star,” a reference to his payments to an adult film actress at issue in his New York conviction for business fraud. As the crowd roared, Crockett kept going, hailing Harris as a former prosecutor who “has a resume” while Trump “has a rap sheet.” The derision reached its peak as Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, stood back from the podium and smiled as delegates chanted: “Lock him up! Lock him up!” — a turnabout from Trump supporters’ chants about Clinton eight years ago despite the former secretary of state never having been charged with any crime.","summary":"Trump has sought in recent weeks to blunt the enthusiasm that Harris has attracted.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/20/trump-campaigns-to-make-america-safe-again/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24233728777525.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:05:16","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":254551582,"title":"Trump campaigns to ‘make America safe again’ as Democratic convention zeroes in on his felony record","text":"By ISABELLA VOLMERT and BILL BARROW HOWELL, Mich.

In an exclusive interview with the New York Post, the former president revealed that Barron would be attending a university in New York this fall. \"He’s all set in a certain school that’s very good. He’s always been a very good student. He’s smart,\" Trump told the Post. Trump did not say which school specifically his son had selected, but added that an announcement would be coming soon. BARRON TRUMP DEBUTS AT FATHER'S FLORIDA CAMPAIGN RALLY TO SUSTAINED APPLAUSE When asked if Barron was going to attend NYU, Trump smiled and again reiterated that he would not share which school his son selected until the announcement was live. The former president has previously floated the possibility of his son attending his own alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany Trump also graduated. Eric Trump attended Georgetown University. Barron Trump, 18, graduated from Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in May.

REUTERS This year’s Democratic National Convention (DNC) is happening at Chicago’s United Center this week. The opening night festivities included speeches from Golden State Warriors and Team USA men’s basketball head coach Steve Kerr, Hillary Clinton, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and President Biden. I saw bits and pieces of every speech last night; as a disabled American voter, I’m keenly interested in finding out how the Harris-Walz ticket plans to support the disability community should they win the White House over Donald Trump come early November. One aspect of the DNC you likely won’t hear anything about in most, if not all, mainstream news coverage is the accessibility of it. My friend and colleague Sara Luterman at The 19th News wrote an extensive piece on this very topic earlier this month, noting the DNC does feature “new wide-ranging considerations” for greater accessibility for the 850 attendees with disabilities, which include 560 delegates who identify as disabled. Robin Jones, accessibility advisor to the Democratic National Convention Committee, told Luterman in part the DNC Committee is “trying to be inclusive of everyone’s needs” while adding there are a “variety of different people with different disabilities attending.” Captioning company VITAC, who’s been covered in this column before, put out a press release earlier this week ahead of the DNC kicking off where it announced it was enhancing accessibility at the event by way of live, multi-language captions, dubbing, and audio descriptions. The company touts its contribution in the lede, writing it is playing an “important role” in shaping this year’s DNC “the most accessible in the DNC’s history.” VITAC notes it is the “largest provider of captioning products and services in North America” and added it has a “long, successful history” of making governmental and other political events accessible to the disability constituency. VITAC, it boasted, was one of the first companies to being live captioning to such conventions as the DNC; it captioned the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. In a brief interview with me conducted earlier this week, VITAC general manager Doug Karlovits explained the DNC made a commitment to “put on the most accessible convention in history” and said it was imperative that Kamala Harris’ message be spread to “as many Americans as possible.” In order to realize its grand vision, the DNC sought a partner who possessed both the experiential and technical chops to help make it happen. That perfect partner, of course, was found in the VITAC team. “It’s a pretty big undertaking,” Karlovits said of the work to make the DNC accessible to all. “It’s all being done remotely, and we have a direct feed to the United Center’s audio. We’re providing live English captions and live audio description for DNC viewers across all their different streaming channels and broadcast outlets. Our translators and voiceover artists are providing live English-to-Spanish dubbing on the fly during the convention while our multilingual captioners, listening and working directly from that dubbed audio, are providing live Spanish captions.” MORE FOR YOU Netflix’s Best New Movie Arrives With A Perfect 100% Critic Score ‘Emily In Paris’ Dethroned In Netflix’s Top 10 List By A New Show How Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Accidentally Bought Into An Alleged $100 Million Mississippi Cancer Cluster In a nod to equality, Karlovits told me Deaf and hard-of-hearing people “increasingly want and expect access to” things like the DNC—or live sporting events or even a Taylor Swift concert. Ensuring such events are accessible to all, he said, guarantees everyone, regardless of ability, will be able to enjoy them. Specific to the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community, Karlovits noted accommodations such as ASL interpretation and captions are “essential to understanding spoken content.” Likewise, things like audio descriptions as equally essential to Blind and low vision people in terms of understanding information that’s presented visually. Karlovits said the cries for accessibility is part of a “broader movement” towards equality and inclusivity regarding access to information. Slowly but surely, the disability community is getting its due—deservedly so. “By providing accessible services, organizers not only comply with legal requirements but also recognize the importance of including all community members in important societal and political conversations,” he said. “This helps foster a more equitable society where everyone can engage with and contribute to key discussions and decisions.” When asked what VITAC’s goals are for this week, Karlovits said the company is “thrilled” accessibility has been thrust onto such a big stage. This means a lot to Karlovits and crew from a business standpoint, but especially as an advocate for and ally of the disability community. VITAC’s overarching goal, he said, has always been to “provide the highest quality access services for the communities that rely on them.” “We love the fact that in all walks of life and across multiple industries—whether it be education, corporate, government, or legal—we’re seeing people recognize the benefits of accessibility and take proactive steps for inclusion,” Karlovits said of the moral of the DNC’s inclusion story.

Day 2 of the convention on Tuesday will be hosted by a longtime Republican critic of Donald Trump, and anti-Trump Republican groups have flocked to Chicago to show their support for Harris and warn of the dangers of electing Trump. “We’re here (at the convention) to make common cause with the (Democratic) party faithful for the purpose of this election,” said Craig Snyder, director of Haley Voters for Harris, a group of like-minded Republicans who cast votes for former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley in this year’s Republican primaries. Snyder told Global News the group is developing messaging to reach right-leaning independents and moderate Republicans “to show them that there is a community of people who agree with them, who are like-minded with them, but who’ve reached the conclusion that voting for the vice-president is the best thing to do for the country.” Resistance to Trump from within his own party has steadily increased since Trump first launched his 2016 campaign, and some GOP officials and former supporters were featured speakers at the last Democratic convention in 2020. But that event was an entirely virtual affair due to the pandemic, and most of those Republicans were limited to the opening night. This year, Republicans are being featured every night of the convention in front of huge crowds at the United Center, where they will underscore the growing opposition to Trump among traditional and moderate conservatives and help paint Harris as a consensus candidate. Tuesday’s speaking schedule will be hosted by Republican strategist Ana Navarro, a friend of Harris’s who has been a prominent anti-Trump voice in her roles as a CNN political commentator and co-host of ABC’s The View. “We need to love our country more (than our party),” Navarro said on CNN Tuesday in explaining her decision to accept the hosting gig, despite noting she’s still a registered Republican. “I’ve had this clear from the get-go. I’ve had this clear from 2016. My purpose is to make sure that Donald Trump does not get anywhere near the White House. We failed in 2016, but we’re not going to fail in 2024.” Other speakers on Tuesday include John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, Ariz., and Stephanie Grisham, who served in Trump’s administration as communications director and, briefly, the White House press secretary. Later in the week, the convention will hear from former Georgia lieutenant-governor Geoff Duncan and former U.S. representative Adam Kinzinger, the latter of whom sat on the special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. During the convention’s first night on Monday, a video was played of Florida resident Rich Logis, who said he was a diehard Trump supporter before the pandemic forced him to step outside the “MAGA echo chamber.” “I made a grave mistake, but it’s never too late to change your mind,” said Logis, who now co-chairs the Florida chapter of the Republicans Against Trump group and has endorsed Harris. Since she became the nominee, Harris has steadily racked up endorsements from Republicans opposed to Trump, including those speaking at this week’s convention and groups like Snyder’s and Logis’s who had pledged to support U.S. President Joe Biden before he dropped his re-election bid last month. Other notable Republicans — including Trump’s former vice-president Mike Pence, Sen. Mitt Romney and former House speaker Paul Ryan — have declined to endorse Trump but have yet to say if they will support Harris. While Trump handily won the Republican primaries early this year, he faced a sizable resistance movement from Haley supporters, particularly after she became his sole opponent. Even after she dropped out of the race in March, between 10 and 20 per cent of voters in multiple states still cast their votes for Haley. Haley has since endorsed Trump and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Haley Voters for Trump group to try and stop them from using her name, which the group says has no legal merit. “I am a Haley voter in the state of Pennsylvania, a registered Republican, and I’m for Harris,” Snyder said with a laugh. “It’s really is as simple as that. “(Haley’s endorsement of Trump) is not a decisive factor in the minds of these voters. They’re going to make up their own mind based on what they think is best for themselves, their families, their communities, their country.” Trump has angrily dismissed Republicans who oppose him as “RINOs,” or “Republicans in Name Only.” Past conventions have featured speakers from the opposite party on occasion, as well as figures who switched parties. But the number of anti-Trump Republicans at the Democratic convention this year is notable and emblematic of a new political era, analysts say. “With Donald Trump, there’s really a new dimension of politics — or a very old dimension of politics — which is pro-democracy or anti-democracy,” said Matthew Lebo, a political science professor at Western University. For some Republicans, he said, “perhaps all the other issues that are usually so important are just secondary to that this year.” Unlike Biden, Harris and her campaign have opted to focus less on painting Trump as a threat to democracy and more on the economy, health care and other “kitchen-table” issues. While other Republicans are picking up the democracy messaging, Snyder said he and his group are more focused on portraying Harris truthfully, and countering the radical left caricature she’s become in conservative media. “Haley voters sent a very clear signal, that they don’t want Donald Trump,” he said. “And so the question for them is, can they go that last mile and vote for the Democratic nominee? “Our job is to help them reach that decision.”","summary":"The Democratic convention is featuring Republican speakers every night as anti-Trump conservatives flock to Chicago to build support for Kamala Harris.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10706976/dnc-democrats-republican-speakers-convention-harris/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CP215365337.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:02:54","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":254551188,"title":"Gwen Walz, wife of VP contender Tim Walz, shares details of their fertility journey","text":"In a new comments, Gwen Walz, the wife of Democratic vice presidential contender Tim Walz, for the first time discussed what she called the \"incredibly personal and difficult experience\" of using fertility treatments to have children, how she says the couple barely felt comfortable telling anyone at the time, and the specifics of her treatment, which was intrauterine insemination, or IUI -- not IVF, as had been broadly assumed. Her husband has often talked on the campaign trail about their struggle in general terms, connecting their experience to the bans on in vitro fertilization (IVF) put in place this past spring in Alabama and attacking Republicans over reproductive rights restrictions. \"Like millions of families across the country, for years, Tim and I tried to start a family through fertility treatments. We followed the journey that is infertility -- the anxiety, the agony, and the desperation that can eat away at your soul,\" Gwen Walz said in comments to Glamour and later confirmed to ABC News. \"Knowing that pain, I cannot fathom the cruelty of politicians who want to take away the freedom for couples to access the care they need. After seeing the extreme attacks on reproductive health care across the country -- particularly, the efforts in Alabama that jeopardized access to fertility treatments -- Tim and I agreed that it was time to formally speak out about our experience,\" she said. Her husband has frequently talked about their fertility journey generally, referring to IVF and treatments \"like it,\" but not using the term IUI -- likely known only to a narrower audience. While recently speaking at a rally in Detroit, Tim Walz said that it would be \"dangerous\" to ban \"things like IVF as well as IVF,\" saying \"this is very personal for my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we went through two years of fertility treatment.\" And in an interview earlier this month, grouping GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance in with Republicans who support restrictions on IVF, Walz said that if it were \"up to him, I wouldn't have a family because of IVF and the things that we need to do.\" \"My kids were born through that direct, you know, that way,\" Walz said. But IUI is different from IVF, and has not come under the same levels of attack because it does not involve freezing, transferring or discarding embryos. It's a minor distinction in some respects -- fertility advocates say the Walz family's experience certainly gives them credibility to talk about how important access to fertility treatment is, regardless of using IVF or the lesser-known IUI -- but it would've mattered in Alabama, for example, because the Walz family would not have lost access to their care after the state's recent Supreme Court decision. The decision, which put IVF into the spotlight on a national scale, determined frozen embryos qualify legally as children. It forced half of the state's fertility clinics to put IVF treatments on hold for weeks because they didn't want to be held liable for discarding unused embryos, a normal part of the process. The detail that Gwen Walz did not use IVF, but rather a different treatment, quickly led to an attack from Vance, who said Tim Walz \"lied\" and should know the difference, having been involved in the process. \"Like, you know the difference, right? Anybody who's had a friend or themselves gone through fertility treatments, you know the difference. So, why lie about it? I just don't understand it,\" Vance said. In response, the Harris campaign called Vance's attack \"just another example of how cruel and out of touch Donald Trump and JD Vance are when it comes to women's healthcare.\" \"Infertility is a deeply personal journey, but the Governor and Mrs. Walz came forward to share their story because they know that MAGA attacks on reproductive rights are putting all fertility treatments at risk,\" said campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg in a statement. Ehrenberg said Tim Walz \"talks how normal people talk\" and \"was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.\" Gwen Walz, speaking at a Rural Council event at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, did not seem to mind her husband's general descriptions of their treatment journey. She remarked that \"they're fact-checking us on every single little tiny thing,\" and joked that she wouldn't attempt to give the exact number of students she graduated with in her small high school class in rural southwestern Minnesota. In the interview about her fertility treatment, she said she hadn't wanted to be outspoken about the details of her journey until recently, because of how painful it was. Back in the early 2000s, during the process, she said she only told a neighbor who was a nurse and could help her with her regularly-needed shots. \"I'd rush home from school and she would give me the shots to ensure we stayed on track. Many of our closest family and friends were surprised when we shared these experiences so many years later,\" she said. The details of Walz' fertility journey led some organizations to clarify their past descriptions, including the IVF advocacy group RESOLVE. In a statement, the group said it \"regrets\" if the organization contributed to any confusion about the type of fertility treatments used by Walz and his wife but said they continue to welcome Walz's advocacy and support. \"We support all paths to parenthood and have welcomed Gov. Walz's support of our community and our advocacy issues, since our federal Advocacy Day in 2017 during his tenure in Congress,\" Barbara Collura, President and CEO of RESOLVE, said in a statement. \"The ongoing conversation around the importance of IVF access and other fertility treatments has made millions of would-be parents across the country feel seen. We need our elected representatives at the state and federal level, and government officials to do everything in their power to make it easier, not harder, for people to build their families,\" Collura said.","summary":"She says the couple used a treatment different from the IVF he suggested.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gwen-walz-wife-vp-contender-tim-walz-shares/story?id=112993783","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/75723687-5dd9-47bb-8834-353b6a22efc6/tim-gwen-walz-gty-lv-240820_1724186286534_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:01:48","author":"Cheyenne Haslett,Elizabeth Schulze,Gabriella Abdul-Hakim","authors":["Cheyenne Haslett","Elizabeth Schulze","Gabriella Abdul-Hakim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":254551522,"title":"Dem governor under fire for abortion attack on JD Vance doubles down: 'He's trying to make himself a victim'","text":"Kentucky Democratic Gov.

Trying to make himself and Donald Trump the victims.\" Beshear came under fire after he suggested to \"Morning Joe\" that Vance should have to \"go through\" a pregnancy resulting from rape to understand some women's experience. \"JD Vance calls pregnancy resulting from rape ‘inconvenient.’ Inconvenience is traffic.

What a disgusting person,\" Vance wrote. Beshear told Mitchell later in the day that he meant no harm against the GOP nominee and claimed Vance was trying to \"deflect\" from scrutiny over his abortion comments. \"Of course not. It's ridiculous, but it's also a deflection. JD Vance knows that he and Donald Trump are so wrong on this issue, so he's trying to make himself a victim,\" he said.

It's just – again, deflection. Trying to make himself and Donald Trump the victims,\" he said. Abortion rights was a central theme Monday night at the convention. In his address, President Biden claimed that former President Trump would \"do everything to ban abortion nationwide\" if re-elected. Trump has called for returning the issue to the states, in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Beshear's attack on Vance derived from a 2021 interview where Vance explained his personal dilemma with abortion exceptions in instances of rape. During his run for U.S. Senate in 2022, Vance was accused by Democrats of calling rape \"inconvenient.\" His remarks on that subject were taken out-of-context, according to fact-checkers; he never referred to rape as \"inconvenient\" but rather said that society shouldn't view pregnancies resulting from such circumstances that way. William Martin, communications director for Vance, reacted to Beshear's attack in a statement. \"After speaking on the DNC main stage last night, Harris campaign surrogate Governor Andy Beshear went on national television this morning and explicitly called for a member of Senator Vance’s family to be raped. His comments are disgusting, vile, and should not be tolerated in American politics.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We call on Kamala Harris to immediately repudiate Governor Beshear’s comments and demonstrate that regardless of partisan disagreements, this kind of violent rhetoric has no place in our public discourse,\" Martin said.

Not all Chinese factories in Southeast Asia will shut down, as products from there can be shipped to India, Europe and elsewhere, according to Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. Some older facilities might be closed, but newer plants should be able to survive if they can find alternative markets, he said. The stricter line from the US comes as both major political parties there take a tougher stance against Beijing in the run-up to the election in November. As well as imperiling Southeast Asian production, it could jeopardize Washington’s decarbonization efforts, given more than three-quarters of its solar product import came from the region last year. While the tariffs will most likely be imposed early next year, it could be sooner if there was an electoral advantage for the Democrats to do so, said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, an Asian-based nonprofit organization that works to advance sustainable global trade. However, US solar manufacturing isn’t ramping up as quickly as hoped, meaning there could be less scrutiny, she said. Efforts to limit the perceived circumvention of US restrictions on Chinese imports are likely to continue, and this is especially true if Donald Trump gets elected, Elms said. He is “extremely focused” on countries that the US has trade deficits with, and this includes many Southeast Asian nations, she said.","summary":"The future of Southeast Asia’s booming solar industry, which produces the most panels in the world after China, is being thrown into doubt as the US looks set to impose hefty tariffs on the region.","url":"https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/southeast-asias-solar-boom-threatened-by-us-china-trade-tension","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/us-solar-product-imports-in-2023-country-spent-the-most-on-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:00:17","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":254551298,"title":"Will the \"blue wall\" stand in 2024?","text":"Will the \"blue wall\" stand in 2024?
