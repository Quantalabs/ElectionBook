The total includes physical books, audio books and e-books. “We are printing hundreds of thousands of copies to fill the demand at our retail partners,” the publisher announced Thursday. Vance’s book already was a million seller before Trump chose him for the Republican ticket. “Hillbilly Elegy,” which Ron Howard adapted into a feature film released in 2020, tells of Vance’s childhood in Ohio and his family’s roots in rural Kentucky.

O’Connor answered The Post’s questions just four days after Biden abruptly ended his campaign for a second term as fellow Democrats called on him to step aside over his apparent mental decline — after Biden repeatedly appearing confused in public, which medical pundits said could be due to Parkinson’s. “Are you Dr. O’Connor?” a Post reporter asked the presidential physician on the White House driveway as he walked past the press briefing room. “I don’t know. I don’t know,” he sheepishly replied — before making clear he was indeed the elusive doctor and proceeding to answer questions about the commander-in-chief, whose quest for a second term collapsed following his dismal June 27 debate performance against former President Donald Trump. “How’s the president’s health?” The Post asked. “It’s excellent,” O’Connor insisted with a smile. “Are you going to come to the briefing room to address us?” The Post inquired. “Probably not,” answered O’Connor, who has never been allowed to brief the press during Biden’s more than three years in office — in a break from historical norms. “Could that change before the end of his term?” the journalist followed up. “I hope not,” O’Connor said, as he seemed to recognize that he would be unable to cross the driveway just north of the West Wing due a cordon established following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House moments earlier. “And how is his mental cognition?” The Post asked. “It’s excellent,” the doctor insisted with a smile. “Is there a reason you didn’t perform a cognitive test on him?” the reporter pressed. “We don’t need to. He’s here every day,” O’Connor claimed. As O’Connor turned to walk away, The Post followed and asked, “Dr. O’Connor, is there anything to that speculation that there might be something related to Parkinson’s that he has?” “No,” O’Connor said. “No, he’s good.” “And the [Parkinson’s] specialist’s visits to the White House, did that have anything to do with that concern?” The Post added. “No,” O’Connor said. “He’s seen him three times, my letter was clear.” Biden did not address swirling questions about his health in a Wednesday night address to the nation on his decision to step aside and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket — saying only that it was time to “pass the torch.” Biden insisted last week that he would forge ahead with plans to stand in the Nov. 5 election — saying in a BET interview taped last Tuesday that he’d only drop out “if I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem.” Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), have called on Biden to resign as president rather than serve out his term, which ends Jan. 20. “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” Johnson said Sunday. Many medical experts said in the past month that they believe Biden likely has Parkinson’s or a related condition. “I could’ve diagnosed him from across the Mall,” neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts told NBC this month — calling Parkinson’s “one of the easier movement disorders to diagnose” and pointing specifically to Biden’s “rigidity” and “shuffling gait,” and “slow movement.” He also said “hypophonia” or using a “small, monotone voice … over time is a hallmark of Parkinson’s.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — President Biden&#8217;s physician Dr. Kevin O&#8217;Connor defended his boss&#8217; &#8220;excellent&#8221; cognitive fitness Thursday as Republicans urge him to resign — insisting the president does not have Parkinson&#8217;s or a related disease in what may be his first interview since Biden took office.

Vice President Harris is the current choice (as shown by all the polls and spark in fundraising). What can be more democratic than that? Also, even in the primaries, Democrats did vote for Harris to be the vice-presidential nominee. And what is the job of the vice president? To backstop the president when necessary.

Thousands of Democrats will converge on the United Center and McCormick Place, beginning Aug. 19. ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch “We are proud to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention and truly showcase the reason we call Chicago the best city in the world,” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement. “While Chicagoans and visitors will experience the very best our city has to offer in vibrancy, diversity, and culture, our top priority remains ensuring a safe convention for both attendees and residents. We have worked closely with our partners at the Federal, state, and local levels to develop a comprehensive security plan that caters to the needs of the convention and simultaneously supports the lives of Chicagoans who rely on our services each day.” The Secret Service is under intense scrutiny after former President Donald Trump was shot at a campaign rally. The Secret Service, in connection with the Chicago police and other law-enforcement agencies, have been preparing for the convention for about a year and a half. The Democratic National Convention is designated as a National Special Security Event. Thursday morning, the Secret Service unveiled the final details of their security plan. There will be two perimeters for the DNC venues, and they will be similar to the protections that were put in place for the Republican National Convention last week in Milwaukee. RELATED: Chicago DNC 2024: What to know about Democratic convention There will be an outer perimeter where vehicles will be allowed and an inner perimeter where only credentialed delegates and media will be allowed on foot. Two venues that will be covered by the plan with their own separate perimeters are the United Center, which will host the main convention itself, and McCormick Place, where delegates will hold meetings during the day. Local and federal officials said Thursday that pedestrian closures and vehicle screening perimeter enforcement will begin at 7 p.m. Aug. 17 around United Center. They said the same will begin around McCormick Place at 10 p.m. Aug. 16. “I am deeply grateful to the United States Secret Service and all of our law enforcement partners across Federal, state, and local government for their work to ensure the safety and security of the Democratic National Convention,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “Their tireless efforts and coordination will ensure convention-goers and residents alike will experience this historic moment without fear for their safety and with minimal disruption to their day-to-day activities.” The Secret Service back in March described the kinds of potential threats the security plan seeks to address. “For more than a year, the U.S. Secret Service team here in Chicago has been working with the Chicago Police Department and our other Federal, state and local partners to devise a security plan that will provide a safe and secure environment for those attending the convention, as well as minimizing impacts on the public,” said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jeff Burnside, the U.S. Secret Service’s 2024 DNC coordinator. “Security surrounding the DNC is of paramount importance and this plan, which is a result of our combined efforts, will ensure that.” Chicago police have also been training and preparing for their roll, which is protecting the area outside the convention. “We have been training and working with our Federal partners for more than a year to prepare for a safe and successful DNC,” Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said. “We are constantly assessing and reassessing our resources based on intelligence and best practices. We’re doing this as we look ahead to the convention, and we will be doing this in real-time during the convention. Flexibility plays a vital role in our safety planning.” FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Field Division Lucas Rothaar said Thursday there is no known credible threat to the DNC. “We are living in an elevated threat environment,” Rothaar said. “We do acknowledge the vast threats that we face as a nation running from violent crime to international terrorism, domestic air terrorism, and hate crimes along with a host of other threats.” Last week, the department sent the chief of counter-terrorism to Milwaukee to review the security plan in place there. He described how CPD is preparing for the DNC. “What you do is you keep going over and over protocol over security, double checking everything,” CPD Counterterrorism Chief Duane Devries said. “You have to keep your social media teams on top of it. All your intel out there.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; The Secret Service shared new details Thursday about the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chicago DNC 2024 Safety Plan Revealed by Secret Service and Chicago Police: No Credible Threats Identified first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chicago-dnc-2024-safety-plan-revealed-by-secret-service-and-chicago-police-no-credible-threats-identified/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15094832_072524-wls-united-center-dnc-security-map-img.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:37:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.367},{"id":252631662,"title":"Angsty Personal Blog Reveals ‘Lonely’ Past Life of 20-Year-Old J.D.

Josh Hawley, citing a new whistleblower. \"According to one whistleblower, the night before the rally, U.S. Secret Service repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally,\" Hawley, a Missouri Republican and member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. \"This means that the technology was both available to USSS and able to be deployed to secure the site. Secret Service said no.\" WHISTLEBLOWER REVEALS WHY TRUMP RALLY OFFICER ASSIGNED TO SHOOTER'S PERCH MOVED FBI Director Christopher Wray, whose agency has taken a lead role in the investigation, confirmed during a congressional hearing this week that the would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, flew a drone of his own overhead before Trump took the stage. \"This raises an obvious question: why was the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) not using its own drones?\" Hawley wrote. The USSS did not ask for local partners to fly their drones until after the shooting was over and a counter-sniper took down the gunman, according to the whistleblower. OFFICER REPORTED MAN AT TRUMP RALLY WITH RANGE-FINDER 30 MINS BEFORE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: SOURCE \"The whistleblower further alleges that after the shooting took place, USSS changed course and asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site in the aftermath of the attack,\" Hawley wrote. The senator asked Mayorkas to hand over all DHS communications regarding drone coverage for the rally as part of a congressional investigation into the security failure that allowed an armed man within 150 yards of the former president. TRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT \"It is hard to understand why USSS would decline to use drones when they were offered, particularly given the fact USSS permitted the shooter to overfly the rally area with his own drone mere hours before event,\" he wrote. \"The failure to deploy drone technology is all the more concerning since, according to the whistleblower, the drones USSS was offered had the capability not only to identify active shooters but also to help neutralize them.\" EXCLUSIVE TRUMP RALLY VIDEO SHOWS CHAOS AFTER GUNMAN OPENED FIRE Crooks struck at least four people with AR-15 fire from the rooftop, killing a 50-year-old father of two named Corey Comperatore and seriously wounding David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74. Trump later said he had been shot in the right ear, and photos from the scene showed him getting back to his feet after ducking for cover with blood on the right side of his head. Crooks is believed to have cased out the rally venue in advance of the attack and arrived with multiple explosive devices that authorities recovered from his vehicle. It's not surprising that local authorities were turned down regarding their drone, said Bill Gage, a retired Secret Service agent and a consultant at Safehaven Security Group. \"That whistleblower is gonna be local law enforcement, and USSS would never allow a non-USSS drone,\" the expert on active shooter response told Fox News Digital. There are \"too many issues,\" he said, including drone specifications, federal flight rules and training for both the operator and the spotter. \"There needs to be a serious rethinking of the protective model that the USSS uses,\" he said. \"The model is sound and proven, but how local assets fit in needs to be reassessed.\" Previous whistleblowers have also approached Hawley's office with details about the event – including an explanation for why the rooftop Crooks accessed before opening fire had been unmanned.

Trump will speak at the conference on Saturday. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Characterized as the world’s largest bitcoin conference, the three-day event hosted at the Music City Center convention complex features a wide range of speakers such as independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., political commentator and comedian Russell Brand and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The conference features educational panels, networking opportunities and entertainment experiences such as a Karate Combat/Influencer Fight Club viewing and a screening of a bitcoin movie, “God Bless Bitcoin,” which features interviews with people such as billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Trump will give a 30-minute keynote address Saturday during the conference’s final day, in a speech that will likely attempt to court voters and capitalize on support he has already received from key cryptocurrency figures like the Winklevoss twins. Kennedy, who owns between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of bitcoin, will speak Friday afternoon, as the presidential candidate has championed cryptocurrency as a way for the middle class to insulate itself from inflation. Tickets to the conference are pricey, starting at $699 and reaching as high as $21,000 for a single ticket—though prospective attendees can get tickets at a 21% discount if they purchase them with bitcoin.

Surprising Fact Edward Snowden, the whistleblower behind one of the largest classified documents leaks in the history of the National Security Agency, is expected to speak Friday from Russia, and has called the cryptocurrency “the most significant monetary advance since the creation of coinage.” Tangent Bitcoin traded down more than 2% at just under $65,000 Thursday afternoon, having mostly plateaued in the last three months, posting gains of a fraction of a percent. It has surged more than 53% since the start of the year. Big Number $1.8 million. That is how many dollars worth of bitcoin Trump supporters donated to the Republican nominee through the end of June, according to The Wall Street Journal. Key Background The bitcoin conference has historically been used by public figures and companies as an event to announce partnerships and initiatives. In 2021, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced at the event that the country would be making bitcoin a legal tender. Attendance has been inconsistent in recent years, as 25,000 people appeared at the convention in 2022 (when the crypto market experienced one of its worst crashes ever) and 12,000 attended in 2023, according to Bloomberg. Bitcoin 2024 has yet to share attendance numbers, though big-name speakers like Trump could generate more tickets than prior years. What Has Donald Trump Said About Bitcoin? Trump has increasingly warmed up to cryptocurrency as Election Day draws closer, ditching the skepticism he had for it years ago. While president in 2019 he said he was not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, calling their values “highly volatile and based on thin air” in a tweet. He also told Fox News in 2021 bitcoin “just seems like a scam,\" saying he did not like it “because it's another currency competing against the dollar.\" Since then, Trump has embraced cryptocurrency, allowing supporters to donate to his campaign with bitcoin and selecting a running mate in JD Vance, R-Ohio, who supports and owns at least $100,000 worth of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market may benefit from Trump winning in November, with bitcoin remaining “sensitive” to the election as its price is “positively correlated with the probability” of a Trump victory, according to Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani. Trump’s Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, is likely to adopt the regulation-centric crypto policies of her former running mate, President Joe Biden.

The circumstances were such that he was damned if he did, and damned if he didn’t. He backed out because he was showing signs of senile dementia. At 82, it was perhaps not possible to prevent signs of normal brain aging to show themselves. Orientation as to time, place and person can go, while there may be difficulties with language. Biden showed the sort of hesitations characteristic of language difficulty during his debate with Republican contender Donald Trump, himself 78. During a recent NATO Summit he mixed up names, showing an almost classic disorientation as to person. It is not known if a diagnosis of senile dementia has been made, but it can be assumed that the medical staff of the White House would have administered the necessary tests. It is strongly possible, especially in view of his age, that even if a diagnosis has not been made, no one can rule it out in the future. If a diagnosis has been made, the prognosis does not rule out death during the second term, because while dementia is a sign that the brain is degenerating, it also means that other bodily functions will be affected, and as the degeneration progresses, death will also occur, between three to 12 years after onset. That is what happened to President Ronald Reagan, who experienced symptoms in 1992 or 1993, and died in 2004, by that time confined to his bed, and after having retired from public life years before. However, he had left office in January 1989, and at that time he was just short of his 78th birthday, and was at the time the oldest person ever to have held office. It is something of an irony that Reagan’s term covered the Soviet ‘gerontocrats’, the old men who succeeded to the Secretary Generalship of the USSR. Brezhnev was 76 when he died in office in November 1982, having taken office in 1964 at 58. He was succeeded by KGB chief Yuri Andropov, who was 68, and who died in February 1984, essentially the next winter. He was then succeeded by Yuri Chernenko, who was 73. He died in March 1985. At that point, the Politburo apparently panicked, and elected as Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev, who was 54. He was destined to preside over the dissolution of the USSR. Similarly, Biden has seemingly anointed Vice-President Kamala Harris as his replacement. After his tweet of endorsement, she should be a shoo-in, because at the nominating convention, scheduled next month to be held in Chicago. Biden had won a majority of delegates in the primaries. While those delegates will not be bound to him any longer, they will probably mostly vote as he wishes. It would almost appear as if she is being presented as a sacrificial lamb to Trump, because it was perhaps decisive that donors were now baulking. Getting those donors back is a task in itself. She would therefore have to campaign initially against those who would probably not have supported her nomination in more ordinary circumstances. She has very little time left to campaign, It may be that unlike other Democratic possibilities, she will not have to fight to establish name recognition, but the odds seem tilted against her. However, her heading the ticket means that one of the main fears, which was leading Democrats facing contests in November, of Biden damaging other Democrats running for re-election, is removed. Whether or not Harris brings any add-on is not relevant at this stage. What matters is that she is not Biden. She is 60, which might mean a generational change, but still makes it doubtful whether she can appeal to young people. She is not that far from the age at which senile dementia strikes, after all. She was picked to be Vice-President because she united so many minorities. Her father was black, her mother was Indian and she was a woman. True, she left Asian Americans and Native Americans, as well as the LGBTQ+ groups unrepresented, but then nobody’s perfect. How white male Republicans like Trump will react is another matter. Trump has already reacted, stating that she will be easier to beat than Biden. She complicates issues. Obama was elected because the USA was ready for a black President. Hillary Clinton was not elected, probably because the USA was not ready for a woman President. Harris has thus got two obstacles to overcome when approaching white male voters. The USA gets its Presidents later than ever, because of the progress made in medicine. However, it also increases the chances of someone losing it while President. There is a mechanism for the Vice-President to take over, but as the past weeks have shown, it is hard enough persuading someone not to run, let alone displace the President. The USA faces the danger of becoming a gerontocracy. Actually, after the presidential debate, Trump looked increasingly like a winner. While his own performance was miserable, it was typical. At least he showed no signs of senile dementia, though he is 78, and would be Biden’s age at the end of his term, in January 2029. The effects of dementia on his already ebullient character are truly unpredictable. Harris seems to be the sacrifice made for other Democratic candidates. This was clearly implied by Biden saying that what he is doing, he is doing for the good of the party and the country. Even if Trump can’t be stopped, Biden by removing himself might avoid a total train wreck. Biden has become the first US President since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 not to contest for re-election. Johnson was trying for a third term, for which he was eligible, but decided that the anti-war movement was going to lead to his defeat. He announced that he was not going to run after his won the New Hampshire primary by only 49 percent to 42 percent, in March 1968. His vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, then campaigned, but was not the frontrunner, that being Robert F. Kennedy, but he won the nomination after RFK was assassinated. Humphrey then lost the election to Richard N. Nixon. Coincidentally, the nominating convention is to be held in Chicago, as in 1968. Again, the omens are not good for Harris. The 1968 Convention was marred by anti-Vietnam War protests. Instead of the coverage boost, there were unfortunate images on TV juxtaposed of protester-police battles, and the convention failed to be positive for Humphrey or any other Democratic candidate. A factor against the Democrats then, but absent then, was the third-party candidacy of George Wallace, the Alabama Governor, who drew off Democrat votes in the South, throwing many states into the Republican tally. Though Biden’s policy on Gaza causes much anguish and concern, riots like those of 1968 are not expected. However, it will be a concern for voters, though not for uncommitted voters. It is thought that voters who are already Democratic ill consider the issue, but there is no real choice, just as there was not in 1972. Both Democrat and Republican nominees were pro-war, though it was the Democratic party which produced the only genuinely anti-war candidate, Harris does have the advantage of being able to run on Biden’s record, just as he ran on the record of his President, Barack Obama. However, the circumstances under which she is being plunged in the fire is something the USA needs to think about, because one medical opinion is that Biden entered the White House while already suffering some symptoms of dementia. It is the age at which Trump is set to return for another term. The USA gets its Presidents later than ever, because of the progress made in medicine. However, it also increases the chances of someone losing it while President. There is a mechanism for the Vice-President to take over, but as the past weeks have shown, it is hard enough persuading someone not to run, let alone displace the President. The USA faces the danger of becoming a gerontocracy. Are congressional ages going up along with presidential? That study has not yet been done, vital as it might have now become.","summary":"AT PENPOINT US President Joe Biden used the opportunity for introspection at his home in Delaware to take what was probably the most painful decision of his life: not to run for re-election.

Initial steps include denying her role as ‘Border Czar’ and downplaying her reputation as the ‘most liberal’ Senator.","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and her team plan to refute that she was ever in charge of the migration crisis at the southern border. It comes as Republicans are set to make Harris’ role as Joe Biden’s ‘border czar’ one of their main points of attack in her battle for the White House with Donald Trump. As Democratic strategists try to reinvent Harris’ record for the campaign a government transparency organization also deleted a webpage which had declared her the most liberal Democrat in the Senate . Immigration and the border was Harris’ first big task as vice president and House Republicans on Thursday passed a resolution condemning her leadership on the issue. In March 2021, President Joe Biden and his administration were already struggling with an escalating immigration crisis. Migrants were pouring across the southern border, detention centers filled up with unaccompanied minors, and stories about ‘kids in cages’ began filtering into the public consciousness. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary at the time, repeatedly insisted that it was ‘not a crisis’. Republicans hammered Biden’s lack of enforcement, demanding that the president take the issue seriously and visit the border. The White House felt it necessary to do something, some kind of sign to the public and the media that the president was tackling the problem. To stave off criticism Team Biden offered up Vice President Kamala Harris as the solution. The president and vice president stood together in the State Dining Room of the White House as Biden announced his intention to put Harris in charge of the migrant crisis. Her chief goal, Biden stated, was to lead the diplomatic effort with Mexico and Central American countries to address the ‘root causes’ of migration. ‘I can think of nobody who — who is better qualified to do this,’ Biden said, citing Harris’ record as a California Attorney General. It was not an unfamiliar task, Biden noted, recalling that as vice president, he had stepped up for President Barack Obama to work with leaders to stem migration on the southern border. But Biden knew he was throwing Harris into a leadership vacuum, when he had no interest in getting involved personally in a politically fraught situation. ‘I gave you a tough job,’ Biden said, looking at Harris who smiled wryly at him. ‘And you’re smiling, but there’s no one better capable of trying to organize this for us.’ Republicans could not believe that Biden had given the task of securing the border to Harris, and the vice president and her team were deeply resentful of what Biden’s staff had done to her politically. Although Harris tried to narrowly define her role in the crisis, media outlets correctly recognized what Biden was doing. ‘Biden makes Harris the point person on immigration issues amid border surge’ read a headline in Politico. ‘Biden taps VP Harris to lead response to border challenges,’ the Associated Press wrote. ‘Biden puts Harris in charge of border crisis,’ read the headline of an article by Axios. To many, Harris’ first event on the issue demonstrated she was unprepared to handle the crisis, as she cited the show “Cheers” to make her point on migration. ‘You know, to use a phrase from an old television show, “Cheers”, you know, “where everybody knows your name,”’ she said, reciting words from the show’s theme song. She explained, “Most people don’t want to leave home.” Republicans saw Harris’ weakness and began driving home her failures. House Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. put Harris’ face on a carton of milk and described her as ‘missing at the border.’ Biden did not help. After saddling Harris with the politically explosive issue, he used an event with congressional Democrats to say that Harris would do a ‘hell of a job’. But the Vice President was not having it. She interrupted Biden to remind him that she was only handling the ‘root causes’ of migration. Facing ongoing pressure, Harris was sent to Guatemala to host an event on addressing the crisis and telling migrants not to come to the United States. ‘Do not come. Do not come,’ she said repeatedly. ‘The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back,’ she said. However, millions of migrants did not listen. Harris was also beset with criticism after she dismissed the idea of visiting the border in bizarre fashion during an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. Asked about not having been to the border she said: ‘…And I haven’t been to Europe. I don’t understand the point you’re making.’ She laughed at the question. In September 2022, Harris was sent by the administration to talk about the issue on Meet the Press. When anchor Chuck Todd asked Harris whether she believed the border was secure, she replied, ‘We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.’ Republicans said that was not true and repeatedly challenged her claim. As Republicans ramped up criticism of Harris, and Biden, for refusing to visit the border, the president’s team finally decided to send Harris to release some of the pressure. In June 2021 she visited the border – days after former President Donald Trump scheduled a visit to highlight the administration’s failures. Harris said: ‘I’m glad to be here. It was always the plan to come here.’ Trump declared victory. He said: ‘After months of ignoring the crisis at the Southern Border, it is great that we got Kamala Harris to finally go and see the tremendous destruction and death that they’ve created.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her team plan to refute that she&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Uncovering the scheme to manipulate Americans about Kamala and distort her narrative.

Alec Lace appeared on the network on July 5 to discuss the future of the Democratic party after President Joe Biden’s debate stumble — commentary that devolved into racist and sexist remarks about the presumptive Democratic nominee. Lace suggested that Harris ascended to power by sleeping her way to the top. “Kamala Harris — she’s the original ‘Hawk Tuah’ girl — that’s the way she got where she is. And the party’s going downhill if it’s in her hands,” Lace said. His comment refers to a viral TikTok clip in which a woman is asked the question, “What’s one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?” “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang,” the woman replies, alluding to oral sex. Social media users took to X to fume about Lace’s offensive remarks. “Beyond disrespectful. Is he not a dad? Imagine someone spoke this way about his daughter/son in the future smh,” one user wrote. Lace’s Instagram bio says he is a father of four and the host of the podcast “First Class Fatherhood.” Another remarked: “Alec lace should never be allowed on tv again. That was absolutely disgusting.” The Independent has emailed a representative for Lace for comment. On Wednesday, he addressed his controversial Fox Business appearance — but fell far short of an apology. Lace responded to the online hate he has received in a post on X, clarifying that he appeared on the show before Biden exited the 2024 race. “Comparing Donald Trump to Hitler is dangerous and 100x worse than comparing Kamala Harris to the Hawk Tuah girl,” he continued, adding: “So save me your fake outrage.” Separately, Lace admitted he “may have been wrong,” before doubling down on his initial claim: “Monica Lewinsky might hold the title but I believe Harris was with Willie Brown prior. Need a fact check on that.” Harris briefly dated Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, at the beginning of her political career in the 1990s, prompting some critics to attribute her success to her ties to Brown. The former mayor addressed the claims in a 2020 op-ed in theSan Francisco Chronicle titled: “Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” He wrote: “I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov Gavin Newsom, Sen Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians.” In the same July 5 clip, Lace disparaged White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Harris in one breath: “There’s the DEI press secretary telling you that the DEI vice president is the future of the party here. And so the future looks kind of dim for the Democrats.” Lace isn’t the first to suggest Harris was a “diversity, equity and inclusion” hire. Earlier this week, Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett said on CNN: “When you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that’s what they have now as a vice president…100 per cent. She was a DEI hire.” Former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka also referred to the vice president as “colored.” On Wednesday, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade took heat after he appeared to describe a Black sorority as “colored” hours before Harris was supposed to deliver remarks to the group. The network has denied that Kilmeade used the term, and instead claimed Kilmeade said “college.” Harris — who has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for president for less than a week — has also been the subject of misogynistic comments, namely about her intelligence. Numerous Republicans have claimed she has a “low IQ,” while former president Trump called her “dumb as a rock.”","summary":"Alec Lace also called Harris and the White House press secretary ‘DEI’ hires","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-hawk-tuah-girl-b2585899.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/16/SEI214048480.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kcUdu91l-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:19:14","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":252631684,"title":"As Harris considers a running mate, what are states’ succession rules for VP candidates?","text":"The 2024 White House campaign has thrust a handful of governors and senators into the mix for vice president, and that has drawn attention to rules of succession in the contenders’ home states should they win. Each state has its own rules for naming replacements when elected officials leave office. Those rules carry significant political stakes in a year when former President Donald Trump has already selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris considers her own choice for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Here are the rules in some states that have VP contenders: Pennsylvania If Harris picks Gov. Josh Shapiro, he can remain in office as governor while he campaigns for vice president. If he ultimately were elected, Shapiro would have to resign as governor before the Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration. Shapiro, 51, is in his second year as governor. Constitutionally, Democratic Lt. Gov. Austin Davis would be tapped to serve the remainder of Shapiro’s four-year term, which ends in January 2027. Davis ran on the 2022 general election ticket with Shapiro after Shapiro endorsed him in a separate primary for the lieutenant governor’s office. Davis, 34, would become the youngest governor in the country and the first Black governor of Pennsylvania, as well as its second-youngest ever. He is already the youngest lieutenant governor in the nation and the first Black lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania. A new governor would be elected in the November 2026 election. Ohio If Vance is elected, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine would have the job of appointing his replacement. His appointee would serve from Inauguration Day until Dec. 15, 2026, under state law. A special election for the last two years of Vance’s six-year term would be held in November 2026. DeWine has said he would pick someone who would work hard for Ohio and also be capable of running — and winning — in 2026. The race for the next full six-year term would take place in 2028. A Senate vacancy would present DeWine with the opportunity to alleviate a bottleneck at the top of the political pecking order of aspiring Ohio Republicans. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Attorney General Dave Yost are already positioning to face off in a 2026 gubernatorial primary, and three other sitting statewide officeholders who are Republicans face 2026 term limits and are weighing their futures. Also, Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno is running this fall for Ohio’s other Senate seat against incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper already must leave his current job in January because the state constitution limits him to two consecutive four-year terms. He is one of the many governors on Harris’ short list. Another constitutional provision offers the potential for Cooper’s out-of-state campaign travels as a Harris running mate to complicate matters back home. The constitution says that “during the absence of the Governor from the State … the Lieutenant Governor shall be Acting Governor.” The current lieutenant governor, who is elected separately from the governor, is Republican Mark Robinson. Robinson is running for governor against Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein, and the provision could help Robinson carry out favored policy choices during the final weeks of his campaign. But could Robinson replace significant Cooper policies permanently? That’s highly unlikely, one political expert said, based on the governor’s previous travel history and modern transportation and communications. The idea is “almost like a fun parlor game,” said Chris Cooper, a Western Carolina University political science professor unrelated to the governor. “It’s a quirky part of our state constitution, but in terms of public policy it’s just not going to be meaningful.” If Robinson issued an executive order that Roy Cooper didn’t like, the governor could just undo it when he returned, Chris Cooper said. And while the GOP-controlled General Assembly could convene in Cooper’s absence and pass a bill that Robinson could quickly sign, Republicans already have veto-proof majorities to enact bills largely whenever they choose. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has raised his national profile by winning a second term last year in heavily Republican Kentucky. Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would take Beshear’s place in Kentucky should the governor resign to become vice president. She would serve out the remainder of his term, which ends in late 2027, and could run for a full term in that year’s election. Beshear and Coleman ran as a ticket in their successful campaigns in 2019 and 2023. There is debate within Kentucky political circles about Coleman’s ability to appoint a successor as lieutenant governor. It’s an “open question” because Kentucky’s constitution “doesn’t address the issue specifically,” says University of Kentucky law professor Joshua A. Douglas. This isn’t the first time that Kentucky’s succession rules have come under scrutiny. Republican lawmakers this spring passed a measure to have a vacant U.S. Senate seat filled by a special election, overriding Beshear’s veto. The bill removed the governor from a role in filling a vacancy. It came amid heightened scrutiny about the health of Kentucky’s senior senator, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, though bill supporters said it was unrelated. Arizona As he is looked at as a possible Democratic VP contender, Sen. Mark Kelly is no stranger to Arizona’s process for replacing candidates. He won a special election in 2020 for John McCain’s old seat. If the former astronaut is chosen as vice president, Democratic Arizona Gov. Kate Hobbs would have to appoint a replacement from the same party as Kelly. That person would serve until a special election in 2026 to fill the last two years of Kelly’s term. In December 2018, Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican then-Rep. Martha McSally to the McCain seat, which had been filled for a few months after McCain’s death by GOP Sen. Jon Kyl. In an example of how a Senate seat can eventually change party control, Kelly beat McSally during a 2020 special election that was considered among the most competitive Senate races in the country that year. Kelly went on to be reelected in November 2022. ___ Associated Press Writers Bruce Schreiner, Gary D. Robertson, Marc Levy, Julie Carr Smyth and Jonathan J. Cooper contributed to this report.

Newsweek obtained a copy.In the memoir, Fred, who describes himself as being fairly close to his uncle, detailed a 2012 flight that he took with his wife, Donald and Melania to Mar-a-Lago \"before reporters started calling the plane Trump Force One.\" He described the plane as a \"stunning\" custom Boeing 575 with \"Italian leather seats embroidered with the Trump Family crest,\" among other luxuries.\"Clearly, Donald loved his plane, and he knew every shiny inch of it,\" Fred writes.He goes on to explain that before taking off, he had been drinking a bottle of Coke which he left \"empty in a cup holder next to my seat.\" Fred said he went up to the cockpit to ride up front, but heard Donald scream \"Fred! F***!\" as they were taking off.\"I didn't realize that as we were accelerating, the coke went sliding out of the cup holder and tumbling onto one of the leather seats, spilling the last few drops. I swear, it was just a few drops,\" he said. \"'That's a hundred thousand dollars worth of damage,' Donald roared.'\"\"Melania didn't say anything,\" Fred recalled. \"She was just taking it all in. But Donald was seething mad.\"Fred said he apologized and helped clean things up and a couple of minutes later, his uncle patted him on the shoulder, \"realizing, I guess, that maybe he'd overreacted a bit.\"\"I'd heard him dress down people, including his brother Robert, but I'd never been on the receiving end of his outrage, unless you count the day he and Rob had threatened to send me to military school,\" Fred wrote. \"I can't say I enjoyed it too much.\"Fred's new book comes just four years after he blasted his sister Mary Trump for publishing a book critical of their uncle before the 2020 election. Fred and Mary are the children of Donald's older brother, Fred Trump Jr., who struggled with alcoholism and died of a heart attack at 42 years of age in 1981.In the new book, Donald's nephew recalled his use of the n-word when he \"disgustedly\" blamed Black people for the slash into the soft top of his beloved Cadillac Eldorado convertible, although noting, \"This was Queens in the early 1970s,\" when \"people said all kinds of crude, thoughtless, prejudiced things.\"\"In one way or another, maybe everyone in Queens was a racist then,\" he mused.Fred also recounted that the former president wondered aloud whether people with disabilities would be better off dead. He recalled Donald saying in a private meeting, \"The shape they're in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.\" A few years later, Fred said his uncle suggested that he should also let his son, who was born with a rare medical condition that led to developmental and intellectual disabilities, die.Fred said when he called Donald about his son's medical fund running out of money, the former president responded, \"I don't know. He doesn't recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.\"\"Did he really just say that? That I should let my son die... so I could move down to Florida? Really?\" he wrote. \"I'm usually pretty good at getting my head around things that other people say, even when I don't agree with them. But this was a tough one. This was my son.\"Fred described himself as being close to his uncle, having attended his inauguration in 2017 and visiting the White House during Donald's presidency. But he revealed that he did not vote for his uncle in either the 2016 nor 2020 election, saying that \"it wasn't personal.\"\"I still loved my uncle,\" Fred wrote. \"It wasn't even political. It was about achieving effective policy, about making the world a better place.\"","summary":"\"Donald was seething mad,\" the former president's nephew Fred Trump III recalls in his upcoming tell-all book.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/melania-trump-reaction-donald-angry-outburst-details-new-book-1930389","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2436832/fred-trump-donald-melania.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:15:04","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":252630820,"title":"This week on \"Sunday Morning\" (July 28)","text":"The Emmy Award-winning \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET. \"Sunday Morning\" also streams on the CBS News app beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET.

Vance","text":"Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), waxed poetic about the Zach Braff movie Garden State, shared his musings about the meaning of home, and posted emotional updates from the months before he was deployed to the Middle East on a personal blog verified by the Daily Beast. The site, titled “The Ruminations of J.D. Hamel”—Vance’s name before he officially had it changed after his wedding in 2014—was hosted on the popular early-internet site Blogger and is connected via a profile to a previously reported political blog penned by Vance called “The Hillbilly Elite.” The blog was launched in 2005, just before Vance was shipped off to Iraq to serve as a public relations specialist in the Marine Corps. In it, the future veep candidate said he spent his final days before his deployment reading a biography on Winston Churchill and his Bible. He also cried a lot, according to one post, the first time he had done so since his grandmother recently died. “Yesterday was incredibly emotional for me. I honestly can say that I felt more like a female than I think I ever have or will,” Vance wrote in a July 2005 post. “I cried twice, and along with the time my grandma died those are the only times I've cried since I was 13 years old. So yesterday was weird, and I read a lot yesterday, from a biography on Winston Churchill, one of my heroes, and the Bible.” The lengthy ramble is one of four posts on the blog that offer a new look into the inner thoughts and political development of a man who may soon be a heartbeat from the presidency, and offer some themes familiar to most millennials, including anxiety over the future of social security and the possibility of homeownership. He also shared—overshared, even—his personal feelings in a way that most millennials may find relatable. “So bored and lonely here that I need something to get my mind back on the right track,” he wrote in the July post. “I feel really weird right now, like I don't want to hang out with anyone except for my closest friends or my family, and I have few really good friends here and no family.” For Sean Morrow, the writer at labor site More Perfect Union who first posted screenshots of the blog Tuesday on social media, the blog showcases “how often [Vance] reinvents himself to fit the moment.” “In between ‘sensitive college boy making casually misogynist comments to explain his emotions’ and ‘wannabe far-right strongman’ Vance made multiple other transformations. It’s a path worth paying attention to.” Vance’s office declined to comment on the now nearly 20-year-old blog. The blog features some more lighthearted posts too, including several mid-2000s pop culture references. “Any thought about my family-a memory of Meghan singing \"B-A-N-A-N-A-S\" in the back of the car, the card that my little cousins made for me, or whatever-made me tear up,” Vance wrote, seemingly referencing Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl,” which was released in March that year and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks. Vance also shared his thoughts on the 2004 film, Garden State, which starred Scrubs actor Zach Braff alongside Natalie Portman. “I couldn't watch Garden State because New Jersey’s landscape is so much like Ohio’s, the music is so relevant to my life right now, and the story of a guy returning home, realizing that home isn’t what it used to be, etc. made me want to tear up,” Vance wrote. “The comment he makes about about [sic] realizing that the place he grew up isn’t really home anymore, and his theory that people settle down because when you lose your home you want to make a new one really resonates with me right now, and I’m sure it does with some of you too.” About one month later, Vance updated his friends and family when his boots finally hit the ground in Iraq after weeks of traveling through Ireland, Hungary, and Kuwait. “The temperature in Kuwait hit me like a ton of bricks, it was 125 when we got off the plane,” Vance wrote. The young marine said it took some time to get used to his new home—a former Iraqi Air Force base seized from Saddam Hussein’s forces in the months prior. “Today I saw a concrete bunker with a crashed MiG in it, and I have to admit it was pretty cool,” Vance added. For entertainment, Vance said he was going to find what he called “Hajji DVDs.” “Basically, these Iraqi dudes pirate movies and sell them here the same day they come out in theaters in the U.S., at a cost of $2.50 apiece.” He described himself as “a little homesick, but mostly happy to be here and finally contribute, even if only a small part, to our country’s mission.” The 2005 blog shows a very different side of Vance as a Marine—an excitable, thoughtful young man eager to serve his country. The Ohio senator has since changed his tone on the war in Iraq, condemning it on the floor of the Republican National Convention as he accepted the nomination for vice president. If any of Vance’s family or friends were looking for more personal insights or updates from former President Donald Trump’s running mate, however, they were out of luck—he stopped writing for his blog just five months after his first post.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Erin O’Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty Images and BlogspotDonald Trump’s running mate, Sen.

The meeting came a day after the Israeli prime minister gave a fiery speech to Congress as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. The Israeli leader faces pressure both at home and abroad to bring an end to the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month. Mr Netanyahu said he had known Mr Biden for 40 years - and that the president had known every Israeli PM over the last half a century. \"From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,\" he said. Mr Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Mr Biden \"on the great issues before us\" over the next several months. The US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli PM he had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant. The meeting between the two men follows months of tension over the war in Gaza, with Mr Biden in May reportedly telling Israel that \"enough is enough\". Mr Netanyahu in June said it was \"inconceivable\" that the Biden administration \"has been withholding weapons and ammunition\" to Israel. At a news briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said that Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach \"compromises\" in peace talks. While Mr Kirby added that \"gaps remain\" in the US-Israel relationship, the countries have a \"healthy relationship\". \"By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,\" Mr Kirby said. \"He [Mr Biden] is very comfortable with the relationship he has with the Prime Minister.\" Mr Netanyahu also plans to meet Vice-President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee after Mr Biden announced he was stepping down from his re-election campaign. Speaking in the House chamber on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's war in Gaza, while attempting to rally support from US politicians. \"Our enemies are your enemies,\" he said, and condemned protesters as \"Iran's useful idiots\". The White House pushed back on Mr Netanyahu's characterisation of the protesters, with Mr Kirby saying that \"it's not a phrase we would use\" and \"not a reflection of what we think\" of the \"mostly peaceful\" protests. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Washington to accuse Mr Netanyahu of being a \"war criminal\". Their loudspeakers and chanting could be clearly heard from the White House as Mr Netanyahu arrived on Thursday. Police arrested 23 people, including five inside the Capitol building. Mr Netanyahu's speech was occasionally met with rapturous applause, mostly led by Republicans. The Gaza war has deepened political divides in Washington, and led to infighting among Democrats whose progressive wing has been critical of US support of Israel. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was spotted sitting in the audience holding a sign that read \"guilty of genocide\". Ms Harris did not attend Mr Netanyahu's speech due to scheduling conflicts, the White House said. Instead, she spent part of the day speaking to a crowd from the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. Ms Harris has expressed steadfast support for Israel. However, such a stance has been politically costly for the Democrats. Hundreds of thousands of protest votes were cast against Mr Biden during the presidential primaries by those wanting him to stop sending military aid to Israel. Some of those angered by his war stance see Ms Harris as a chance to mend the fracture in the party, and win back the votes. Mr Netanyahu is expected to visit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Friday.","summary":"Gaza war was a priority at a meeting held after the Israeli PM gave a fiery speech to Congress.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3eppp0n57o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5a32/live/ffed63c0-4aad-11ef-9d7d-8f2c8d9c3d2a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:10:58","author":"Brandon Drenon & Bernd Debusmann Jr At The White House","authors":["Brandon Drenon & Bernd Debusmann Jr At The White House"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":252631224,"title":"How Trump could replace JD Vance if the Ohioan's terrible polling continues","text":"Sen. JD Vance of Ohio has had a rough week and a half since he was announced as former President Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate. While Trump insists he's sticking with Vance, the senator's poor polling combined with Vice President Kamala Harris' momentum has led some to ask: Could Trump replace Vance? And if so, how would it work? For those wondering, the answers lie in recent history and the fine print of Republican Party rules.It's still technically possible that Trump could choose a new number two. But such a decision would have to happen very soon.The Democratic and Republican National Committees have separate rules governing how they fill vacancies of presidential or vice presidential nominees. Under Rule 9, the Republican National Committee explains how it fills a vice presidential vacancy \"which may occur as the result of death, declination, or otherwise.\"The rule allows the party to reconvene its national convention if it chooses or to move ahead with a vote of the smaller group of Republican National Committee members who would determine Vance's replacement.Time arguably poses more complications than the specific rules, said Amy Dacey, former Chief Executive Officer at the Democratic National Committee and current Executive Director of the Sine Institute of Policy & Politics at American University.\"I think sometimes what people forget is that people start voting in September,\" Dacey told Business Insider. \"There's an early vote in some states in September. So this is not just a November election. And the worst case scenario would be for your nominees not to appear on a ballot in a state.\"Crucially, the rule explicitly applies to a scenario in which Vance voluntarily steps aside, according to Kenneth Mayer, a recently retired political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He told Business Insider that there's no precedent for forcibly ripping the nomination away from a vice presidential candidate after the convention.Mayer also told Business Insider that impending state deadlines pose a significant issue, and that the complications only snowball once ballots are printed. It would be, he said, \"extraordinarily disruptive\" both logistically and politically to replace Vance as the vice presidential nominee.Among Vance's biggest problems are his numbers — he is the least-liked vice presidential candidate on the heels of their convention since 1980, a CNN polling analysis found.Almost 80% of staffers and leaders disapproved of the Vance pick, according to a survey that Punchbowl News conducted at the Republican National Convention. Most of those asked thought that Trump should have gone with Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, instead.Though Trump has consistently stated his support for Vance, some in his orbit are reportedly questioning whether the Ohioan was a wise pick now that Harris will almost certainly be the Democratic presidential nominee. Trump has faced similar situation before. In 2020, there were rumors he would replace former Vice President Mike Pence on his ticket. Trump denied those reports. \"If I did, that would be a great act of disloyalty because he's been great,\" he said.A representative for Vance declined to comment on the record, and Trump's team did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.Trump reaffirmed his support for Vance on Thursday, telling Fox News that Vance was \"doing a great job.\"\"He is fantastic. No, it wouldn't have mattered,\" Trump said when asked if knowing about Vice President Harris' candidacy would have changed his strategy.Left unsaid is that if a president or presidential hopeful were to replace their running mate, it would become an immediate scandal, one that risks overshadowing an entire election. Democrats did as much in 1972, when George McGovern dropped his vice presidential nominee, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, after only 18 days together on the ticket.Eagleton resigned under pressure after the public found out he had been treated for depression.

In a televised address Wednesday night, the president framed his choice in almost existential terms. The defense of democracy, Mr. Biden said, “is more important than any title.” He did not utter former President Donald Trump’s name, but the implied warning was clear: that, in Mr. Biden’s view, electing his predecessor to another term could imperil American democracy. The Oval Office – where this reporter had the privilege of witnessing history as the only print journalist present – was packed. Much of the space was consumed by the equipment and crew broadcasting Mr. Biden’s speech and running the teleprompter. Biden aides squeezed in. Seated along the wall were his wife, children, grandchildren, and spouses. The only non-family member accorded that honor was decadeslong adviser Mike Donilon. The “restricted press pool” included a print reporter, a still photographer, and a network TV camera-person. It was like being on a TV set. But the import could not have been more real. The last time an American president opted not to run for a second term was in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced his decision from the same room, as the nation was embroiled in war abroad. Mr. Biden spoke faintly, haltingly, solemnly. The speech was laced with pride and a sense of what might have been, had he felt able to continue his campaign. He highlighted what he sees as the main accomplishments of his presidency, a reprise of his campaign pitch. In a preview of many more “farewell” moments to come, Mr. Biden cited the nation’s post-pandemic economic recovery, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., reducing illegal border crossings (after they surged in his term), battling climate change, and appointing diverse leadership in his administration. Winning the 2020 election was itself a major triumph, in Mr. Biden’s eyes. And preventing his predecessor from retaking the White House remains his overarching goal. “I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake,” the president said. “America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.” Now Mr. Biden is making the case to elect his vice president, Kamala Harris, who almost certainly will carry the Democratic torch to November, amid a remarkably fast transformation of the Biden campaign into the Harris campaign. “I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris,” the president said toward the end of his remarks. “She’s experienced, she’s tough, she’s capable.” Mr. Biden didn’t say “vote for Vice President Harris,” reflecting his apparent desire to maintain a bit of separation between official duties and politics. On Sunday, when he released the letter announcing his decision to step aside from his reelection campaign, he did not endorse Ms. Harris as his replacement for the Democratic nomination. That came a half hour later in a social media post. But Wednesday’s speech was not devoid of politics. Mr. Biden has spent more than 50 years in the highest levels of elective office, and it infuses his being. He clearly relishes the game. And now, as much as he wanted to defeat Mr. Trump again, he decided to put “personal ambition” aside, as he put it. His badly faltering debate performance last month against Mr. Trump eventually left little choice but to leave the race, under pressure from his own party. Speaking at her regular briefing Wednesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Mr. Biden’s exit “has nothing to do with his health.” But, his recent bout with COVID-19 aside, the president’s increasing frailty in recent months has become impossible for even his most loyal allies to avoid. His childhood stutter, which he noted in his address, has been evident more frequently. Mr. Biden faces calls from some Republicans to resign the presidency itself, but his aides scoff at the idea, asserting that he has the acuity and stamina necessary to finish his term. Mr. Biden finished his remarks with a call for national unity – and a final implied warning of what a second Trump term might bring. “Let’s act together, preserve our democracy,” he said. The broadcast over, aides and family burst into applause. First lady Jill Biden walked over to the Resolute Desk, and stood beside her husband. Moments before, daughter Ashley seemed close to tears as she reached for her mother’s hand. Mr. Biden addressed the room. ”This has been the honor of a lifetime,” he said, followed by other words of gratitude. As this reporter was exiting the Oval Office, per the staff’s instruction, more applause could be heard – both from inside the presidential suite and outside in the Rose Garden. Staff had been attending a watch party there and eating ice cream, the boss’s favorite treat.","summary":"President Biden’s address to the nation sealed his historic exit from the presidential race, while framing the coming election in almost existential terms.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0725/A-reporter-s-view-Inside-the-Oval-Office-at-a-pass-the-torch-moment?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2024/07/0725%20NBIDEN%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 19:06:39","author":"Linda Feldmann","authors":["Linda Feldmann"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.362},{"id":252632056,"title":"House Republicans vote to rebuke Kamala Harris over administration’s handling of border policy","text":"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are moving quickly to emphasize Vice President Kamala Harris’s role in the Biden administration’s handling of the U.S. border with Mexico, passing a resolution Thursday that condemns her performance in the job. The resolution, which is purely symbolic, echoes an attack line that Republican Donald Trump has taken against Harris since she rose to become the likely Democratic presidential nominee. All House Republicans and six Democrats in tough reelection races voted for the resolution. President Joe Biden tasked Harris early in his administration with addressing the root causes of migration. Border crossings eventually became a major political liability for Biden when they reached historic levels. Since June, when Biden announced significant restrictions on asylum applications at the border, arrests for illegal crossings have fallen. It remains to be seen whether the border will become a political liability for Harris as it was for Biden. But Republicans say Harris did not do enough to clamp down on illegal immigration in a role they characterized as “border czar.” “The result of her inaction has been record high illegal crossings, overwhelmed communities, and an evisceration of the rule of law,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Trump, if elected president, has pledged deport millions of people and has made anti-immigration rhetoric a central focus of his campaign. The House vote showed some early signs of cracks in the confidence that Democrats have so far bestowed on Harris. The six Democrats who voted for the resolution — Reps. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Mary Peltola of Alaska and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state — were mostly members from battleground districts and had previously been critical of Biden. The measure called for “elected officials who understand the gravity of the crisis at the border and who will execute the policies to fix the border crisis.” Golden said in a statement that he would “continue to be critical of this administration” when it comes to the border. Caraveo, who endorsed Harris this week, said in a statement that Harris would “stand up to party leaders when they’re wrong.” As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their own borders. The Biden administration wanted to develop and put in place a long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries. Most House Democrats tried to defend how Harris has handled the job. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the resolution was “fake and fraudulent” and that Harris was never appointed “border czar,” as the measure stated. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who is the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Harris “was narrowly tasked with developing agreements that could help bring government and private sector investments to those countries that are sending migrants to the United States.” Jayapal said Harris successfully recruited “billions” of dollars in investments for Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Democrats also repeatedly pointed out that Republicans rejected a border and immigration deal that the White House negotiated with Senate GOP leadership earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who won a special election this year on a campaign that focused on border security, said Harris has some potential strengths on the issue. He said Harris’ relationship with Mexico’s president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, and Harris’ past as a prosecutor could prove to be assets when it comes to the border. “I think now she has to emphasize the fact that she recognizes that the southern border is a problem,” Suozzi said. « Previous","summary":"Six Democrats also voted for the resolution, including Rep.

From the moment former President Donald Trump was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania, there have been people, usually his political opponents, who have suggested that Trump was not actually shot. Of course, there were the usual conspiracy nuts who claimed it was all made up. But there were also more mainstream figures who suggested that Trump was not hit by a bullet from the would-be assassin’s gun but rather a bit of shrapnel that came from…somewhere. The first theory held that a bullet had actually shattered a glass teleprompter panel, and a shard of glass then hit Trump’s ear. That theory suffered from the fact that the teleprompter panels were not hit by bullets and appeared to be intact after the shooting. But that did not stop the theorists from starting with the glass and going on from there. “We still don’t know for sure whether Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, whether he was hit by glass fragments, whether he was hit by shrapnel — we don’t have those details,” MSNBC host Joy Reid said a few days after the assassination attempt. “We actually have no details from his physician, even though this man is still a Secret Service-protected, you know, presidential candidate. We know almost nothing.” Reid was also upset that, in her view of things, Trump’s Secret Service agents “allowed” the former president to stand up after being hit so that he could pose for photos. “We don’t know why, for nine full seconds, Donald Trump was allowed to stand back up during an active shooting, an active shooter situation, even though they at that point had said the shooter was down. How would they have known if there were more shooters or not?” Reid said. “Yet they allowed him to stand up in the middle of that crisis and pose for a photo and fist-pump the air so he could get the iconic photo.” Clearly Reid has an active imagination. Finally, she questioned the wound that Trump suffered in the shooting. “What is the actual injury to Donald Trump’s ear that is under that bandage?” she said. “Shouldn’t we know that by now? It’s weird.” If you think this sounds a little weird itself, you should know that such speculation is fairly common on the Left and becoming more so every day. No need to list a lot of examples. It’s out there. Now the speculation has received the imprimatur of the director of the FBI. Christopher Wray appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and on two occasions suggested that Trump might have been hit by “shrapnel.” On one occasion, Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) asked Wray, “How close did the assassin’s bullet come to killing President Trump?” Wray responded, “My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear. So I don’t know that I have the actual distance.” On another occasion, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the committee, asked Wray if the FBI had accounted for all eight bullets thought to have been fired by the shooter and whether some victims might have been hit multiple times. “I think with respect to former President Trump, there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear, so it’s conceivable,” Wray answered. “Although, as I sit here right now, I don’t know whether that bullet, in addition to, you know, causing the grazing could have also landed somewhere else. But I believe we’ve accounted for all of the shots and the cartridges.” What to make of it? Wray did not offer any information on what, if Trump was not hit by a bullet, the shrapnel might have been or how it might have happened. Had he talked to FBI experts who have examined the evidence? He did not say. So what could it mean? I called Dr. Ronny Jackson, now a Republican congressman from Texas, to find out more. He is a former Obama and Trump White House physician who served more than 20 years in the U.S. Navy, including a stint with a shock trauma unit in Iraq during the worst days of the war there. Gunshots, shrapnel, explosives, whatever — in Iraq, Jackson treated the terrible wounds they can cause. As a congressman, Jackson does not practice medicine. He has let his various licenses lapse, although he is still certified in emergency medicine. His critics have pointed out that he was accused of inappropriate actions while White House physician, which he denies. In our conversation, Jackson stressed he is not Trump’s doctor. He was not present at the July 13 shooting but joined Trump the day after. He dressed Trump’s wound and applied the bandage, which he said anyone could do. But the fact is, he is an experienced doctor, and he saw Trump’s wound the day after the shooting. He is certainly qualified to describe it. Jackson told me that the bullet took off a little of the top of Trump’s ear and left a wound entirely consistent with a high-velocity gunshot. Jackson also said he read the medical report from the Pennsylvania hospital where Trump was taken after the shooting. Doctors there treated Trump’s wound and also gave him a full examination to see if he had suffered any other injury. The hospital medical report, Jackson said, referred to Trump’s wound as a gunshot wound. He said not only the appearance of the wound but also the presence of swelling and other symptoms were entirely consistent with a gunshot wound. “The reality is, it was a bullet,” Jackson said. “It looks like the path of a bullet coming right over the top of his ear.” When I asked about Jackson’s experience with such matters, Jackson cited his time in Iraq and said, “I believe I know what a gunshot wound looks like.” Jackson was unhappy with Wray’s speculation. “He shouldn’t be making statements like that,” Jackson said. “From him, it’s an irresponsible statement unless he has some obvious forensic evidence.” But Wray said what he said, and now the speculation from the Joy Reids of the world will only grow. What can be done? The best thing would be for Trump to authorize the doctors who treated him in Pennsylvania to discuss the wound and treatment involved. And there will certainly be more evidence in the future about the events of those few seconds, including the paths of the eight shots investigators believe the would-be assassin fired. That information is needed if only for the public’s right to know. In the big picture, though, it’s not clear what difference confirming the shrapnel theory would make. An assassin intending to kill Trump fired a high-powered rifle at Trump, and Trump was hit by shrapnel from the high-velocity bullet. Does that change anything significant about the story? For Reid and her allies, the answer is yes. They are looking for a way to devalorize Trump’s actions after the assassination attempt. People were amazed that Trump could be shot and then stand up and gesture defiantly as Secret Service agents hustled him offstage. Remember that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called Trump’s actions “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” That impression is precisely what the Trump theorists are hoping to diminish — and in the process diminish any political benefit Trump might have reaped from the assassination attempt. For them, it’s all politics. Still, more information is better, and the public needs to know more about the events of July 13.","summary":"TRUMP-WASN&#8217;T-SHOT THEORIES PROLIFERATE. From the moment former President Donald Trump was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania, there have been people, usually his political opponents, who have suggested that Trump was not actually shot.

Vance told delegates: “Tonight is a night of hope. A celebration of what America once was and, with God’s grace, what it soon will be again.” He lambasted globalization and pledged to restore the ability of the American economy to create more jobs and be an energy-producing economy.When choosing Vance, the Republicans’ presidential nominee Donald Trump opted to escalate the stature of a rising star of the right wing of politics in the US and to intensify the appeal of the populist movement. It is Trump who has boosted that conservative-populist trend in American life since he first ran for president against Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Trump needs a successor, someone who can carry the torch of his Republican campaign in the years to come. He sees in Vance a political figure for whom he can serve as a political uncle as they campaign ahead of the Nov. 5 election against the Democratic successor to President Joe Biden, likely to be Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump selected Mike Pence as his running mate eight years ago. But Pence was a former governor of Indiana and part of the Republican establishment. Trump now wants to move further away from the establishment Republicans who were previously the dominant faction of the party. The establishment wing promotes the traditional Republican Party views of fiscal conservatism and support for a bigger US military. Nevertheless, its foundations have been shaken as it has compromised more on issues of government spending, abortion, taxes and frequent American military interventions abroad.Trump wants to undermine the set of beliefs espoused by the Republican establishment with the help of the man he hopes will be his future vice president. The essential attitude of the conservative-populist pursuit in American politics, as manifested by both Trump and Vance, is that these policies are depriving the American people of their liberties and freedoms. High taxes mean that people cannot do what they want with their money and America’s wars overseas mean that the US government is more interested in what is happening in other countries than on what is good for America and the American people. Repeatedly, Trump and Vance affirm their desire to “Make America Great Again.” And to follow “America First” policies.Vance is a disciple of MAGA. There are reports that he is a good friend of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Trump. According to NBC News, President Trump was leaning toward North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his pick for running mate. That’s when Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump chimed in. “Don Jr. and Eric went crazy: ‘Why would you do something so stupid? He offers us nothing’,” a long-time Republican operative familiar with the discussion told NBC News. “They were basically all like ‘J.D., J.D., J.D.’,” the operative said.There have also been reports that Vance may approach his old acquaintances in Silicon Valley, California, who are known for their very liberal views and pro-Democratic Party stances. He will seek to neutralize them and convince them that the Trump agenda for the Republican Party and for the whole of the US would also fit with their own interests.The selection of Vance also reveals that Trump thought about other candidates and later dismissed them. He could not nominate Nikki Haley because she was his rival in the Republican primaries and always campaigned against him. He dismissed other choices like Burgum because he signed a law in his home state that banned almost all abortions. Vance is pro-life too. However, he never had the chance to sign a law determining what the rules on abortion should be.Vance’s age may also have been a positive factor that appealed to Trump. He will turn 40 in August. This could help Trump reach young voters, who are usually more liberal in their outlook. If Trump can siphon off a segment of them to vote for him, this will make it easier for him to return to the White House.Vance started out as a critic of Trump. Now, he is his running mate. This could also be a demonstration of the success of Trump. He convinced a former political enemy to support his views. Trump now aims to turn more of his critics into political allies. Since Vance was in the Marines, he will help Trump reach out to military men and women and their families. Trump can even do well with intellectuals thanks to the nomination of Vance, who is the author of a best-selling book titled “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.” He wrote it in 2016. It is a personal memoir of what he called “Appalachian values.” It is about growing up poor in Kentucky and what his family faced when living in Ohio, confronting many social and economic problems. While this book appeals to intellectuals, it will also resonate well with the American middle class. This could make Vance a real asset to Trump’s 2024 campaign.","summary":"Maria Maalouf At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week, J.D.

Desmond mistakes the newsreel cameras that will record her arrest for those of a studio that will capture her starring role in a new movie. Her delusion comes to mind while contemplating how California will fare if, as now seems almost certain, Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic nominee for president this year. It’s no secret that California, by far the most populous state, is not held in high esteem by those who live elsewhere. In fact, a 2023 study found that California is the fifth most disliked state, behind Illinois, New Jersey, New York and West Virginia. “A staggering nine of California’s western neighbors hate their guts,” the semi-serious study said. “Is it the water stealing thing? Whatever is, California doesn’t have a lot of friends around. Maybe a fruit basket would help.” Non-Californians, especially those who live in socially and politically conservative states, tend to see California as a dystopia of crime and deviant behavior, unaffordable living costs and ruinous taxation. The negative image is a relatively recent phenomenon. For decades, even before World War II, California was seen as a place of new beginnings and boundless opportunity. In 1980, its movie star former governor, Ronald Reagan, was elected president and four years later easily won a second term. However, as the nation’s politics polarized, California became one of those places that people on the other side of the political teeter-totter loved to hate. President Joe Biden’s historic announcement that he would drop his bid for a second term and throw his endorsement to Harris changes the dynamics of what would have been, and probably still is, an unpredictable contest. Former President Donald Trump was preparing to depict Biden as a doddering old man, incapable of governing, but now he will likely face Harris, who is two decades younger. He must devise a new strategy to prevail in the half dozen or so swing states whose voters will ultimately decide which contender secures the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House. One element of that strategy will be to demonize California, where Harris was born and where she climbed the political ladder from San Francisco district attorney to state attorney general, U.S. senator and finally vice president. There’s no shortage of fodder for a “California is a cesspool” campaign in those swing states, most of which have little in common with California. Video images of California’s squalid encampments of homeless people and smash-and-grab store robberies, its embrace of undocumented immigrants, its tight gun control laws and its high gasoline prices could be potent political ammunition. Trump will almost certainly claim that electing Harris would visit those California conditions on the nation as a whole, with illegal immigration perhaps being the most powerful potential issue in those decisive states. Harris will, of course, pound on Trump’s many problems, including his conviction on felony charges and other pending criminal cases. She has been the Biden administration’s point person on using abortion rights to attract swing voters in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of its Roe v. Wade decision. This is not going to be a positive campaign. This is going to be a mudslinging duel to the finish, and California’s image will be a major weapon. Is California ready for its close-up?

Netanyahu’s first White House visit since 2020, when former President Donald Trump was in office, comes at a time of growing pressure in Israel and the U.S. to find an endgame to the nine-month war that’s left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza and some 1,200 dead in Israel. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was using the meeting to reiterate his calls for Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a cease-fire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved. “The gaps are closable,” Kirby said. He added, “But it’s going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.” Harris is scheduled to meet separately on Thursday with Netanyahu and is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages, who were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war. The Israeli leader is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee Trump. Biden greeted Netanyahu in the Oval Office, where the Israeli leader thanked the president for his service. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups and downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they’ve known each other. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting. Biden thanked Netanyahu and joked that his first meeting with an Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, in 1973 soon after he was elected to the Senate came when he was only 12. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for the 81-year-old Democrat, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu will meet the families of American hostages. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander-in-chief. She’s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn’t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is “no daylight between the president and vice president” on Israel. Harris’ last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she’s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. Netanyahu, in a fiery address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, offered a robust defense of Israel’s conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping “Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.” The Israeli leader spent scant time discussing the ongoing negotiations. “Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,” Netanyahu told American lawmakers. “Our fight, it’s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. ” Netanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration’s support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But Netanyahu also went out of his way to note actions that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran’s aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Netanyahu is set to travel to Florida on Friday to meet with Trump. Netanyahu also slammed protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran’s “useful idiots.” The Secret Service beefed up security at the White House ahead of Netanyahu’s visit, erecting additional fencing and barriers near the White House campus. Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” Harris said in a statement. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday and chanted, “Arrest Netanyahu,” and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders. Trump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu’s address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015. White House officials said that her absence wasn’t a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She’s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president’s residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she’s been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel. She used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.

Jared Golden ‘absolutely not’ committed to supporting Kamala Harris","text":"Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, said Thursday he has not decided whether to support Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in her race against former President Donald Trump. Golden told a reporter for Axios Thursday that he is “absolutely not” committed to backing Harris and has to first hear more about her vision for the country. Golden released a written statement after the Axios story was published, saying that “our choice in leaders should never be a knee-jerk decision driven solely by party.” “I expect to have to work to earn Mainers’ votes and our candidates for president should expect the same,” Golden said. “Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just a few days and I look forward to learning more about what kind of leader she would be.” Golden also described what he would like to hear from Harris as she hits the campaign trail. “My hope is that she leans into her record as an attorney general and prosecutor and affirms her commitment to public safety and the rule of law – from going after the white-collar criminals who rip off the working class to securing our border and stopping the flow of deadly fentanyl into our communities,” he said. “I am curious to know her plans to lower costs for Mainers, protect Social Security and Medicare, safeguard our children’s future and prosperity and maintain America’s leadership on the world stage.” Golden has been distancing himself from his party as he runs for reelection. He published an Op-Ed saying he’s “OK” with another Trump presidency and released a TV ad highlighting his past efforts to work with Trump and Republicans. Trump has won the rural and more conservative 2nd Congressional District in the last two presidential elections. And Golden is facing a Trump-endorsed opponent this year, state Rep. Austin Theriault, a Fort Kent Republican and former NASCAR driver. “Jared Golden has gone full Washington as he changes his positions in desperation to win in November,” Theriault said in a written statement. Theriault said the Golden “took the position of every other slippery Washington politician who refuses to disclose who they’re supporting for president. As I grew up in Fort Kent, I learned to put people over politics – and Jared Golden’s not doing that right now. I’m running to bring more balance and less extremism to Congress.” Golden was part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to salvage key provisions of a bipartisan border security bill, which had been described as one of the strictest proposals in decades after Trump urged Republicans to walk away over concerns it would boost President Biden’s reelection chances. Golden had expressed concerns about Biden’s ability to serve another term and wondered whether the president’s lapses during a widely panned debate with Trump was an off-night or a sign of a bigger problem. But he stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw from the race, which Biden did in dramatic fashion on Sunday. Golden told Axios during an interview on Capitol Hill that he is confident that Harris would be able to serve a full term and “that’s a positive step in the right direction, I think, from the perspective of the American people. They at least have a clear choice.” Golden’s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the most competitive in the country. And Republicans believe they have the wind at their backs after Golden changed his position and announced his support for an assault weapons ban following the mass shooting in Lewiston, which could weaken his support among gun owners, an important voting bloc. Golden, a former Marine from Lewiston, has been highlighting his independence from Democrats. He has opposed Biden’s policies more than any other House Democrat. His first TV ad of the cycle seems like it could have been written by a Republican. It highlights Golden’s breaks with Biden over spending and electronic vehicle mandates, and declares Biden to be “unfit to serve a second term.” The ad highlights Golden working with Trump and Republicans to secure the border while supporting police and increased domestic gas and oil production. Golden hasn’t regularly attended House Democratic caucuses in nearly three years, including one earlier this month about how Biden’s flagging campaign would impact down-ballot races. Golden gave a pre-recorded address to the state Democratic convention in May, citing an out-of-state family obligation. He was not present at Monday’s meeting when state delegates going to the national convention threw their support behind Harris.

Ryan Giggs' pregnant girlfriend Zara Charles offered a glimpse of her growing bump as she departed a hair salon in Cheshire on Thursday The mother-to-be opted for a tight white T-shirt and black cycling shorts as she departed the salon following a two-hour appointment This will be Ryan's third child, as the football ace already has son, Zach, 17, and daughter, Libby, 19, from his 10 year marriage to Stacey Cooke, while Zara has a daughter from a previous marriage. The baby is supposedly due later in 2024, with a source telling The Sun: 'Ryan and Zara are thrilled at the prospect of becoming parents again. 'They have a very solid, loving relationship and are building a long-term future together.' Insiders claim Ryan's ex wife Stacey - who divorced Ryan back in 2017 - has also given her blessing as well as their children. A source told The Sun: 'Ryan was nervous about what his kids would think but they've got to know Zara over the last few years and really like her. They're happy because they know he's happy... 'But they've joked that he might struggle with the early mornings and lack of sleep. Ryan and Zara are thrilled at the prospect of becoming parents again, they have a very solid, loving relationship and are building a long-term future together.' Another source told the publication: 'Stacey approves of Zara. Her and Ryan have been through a lot but they have moved on and she's only interested in him being happy, because that makes him a good dad to their kids. There is no animosity.' Stacey and Ryan divorced in 2017 after it was revealed he had been having an eight-year affair with his brother's wife, Natasha.

Meet the ex-Manchester United star's partner Members of his family cut ties with him when the news broke, his dad saying he was 'ashamed' of his son while his brother, Rhodri, made headlines appearing on a Paddy Power advert mocking the former Manchester United man. The marriage survived the affair - as well as Ryan, 50, cheating with Big Brother star Imogen Thomas - but they separated in 2016. According to Leiper Gupta Family Lawyers, the divorce could have cost Ryan £20million, but the pair's lawyers said they remained 'firm friends'. Ryan and Zara's exciting news comes after the former footballer returned to work as Director of Football at Salford City, the club he co-owns, after being cleared of assaulting former girlfriend Kate Greville in 2023.

But for world leaders, Joe Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign signaled something even more profound. It is the passing of an era. Mr. Biden is the last in a long line of U.S. presidents viscerally wedded to America’s post-World War II vision of itself and its place in the world: as architect, leader, and linchpin in a web of alliances dedicated to promoting and protecting democratic friends over autocratic rivals. Key U.S. allies – above all, Ukraine – know that the real-world impact of Mr. Biden’s departure from office will still depend on who wins in November. Donald Trump has shown disdain for the vision of American leadership – rooted not just in power and self-interest but also in values – put in place after the world war, and for the overseas alliances forged along the way. Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s vice president and now Democratic candidate for the presidency, has stood shoulder to shoulder with her boss on Ukraine. She is likely to stay broadly on the path he has charted over the past four years. Yet the continued commitment to Ukraine that Ms. Harris feels, along with many fellow Democrats and some Republicans, comes from a different place than Mr. Biden’s. It has been shaped by a very different world, one in which politicians from both major parties have increasingly come to recognize the practical limits of America’s ability to deploy its resources, reach, and power overseas. And it comes from a different age. Mr. Biden, born in 1942, grew up in an America whose idea of itself was shaped by Washington’s extraordinary vision of U.S. leadership after the world war. Despite the postwar impulse of many Americans to retreat from the world – as one top U.S. diplomat put it at the time, to “go to the movies and drink Coke” – the United States extended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to the battered economies of Western Europe, formed the transatlantic NATO defense pact, and championed its support for free nations, free-market economies, and free trade worldwide as the best way to “contain” Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union. In the decades since, U.S. foreign policy has not always matched that lofty vision. America has allied itself not just with democrats but with dictators, too. It has fought wars – Vietnam in the 1960s and ’70s, Afghanistan after 9/11, and Iraq in the early 2000s – that caused huge casualties and ended in chaotic retreats. But the ideal – the assumption that America had a special role in the world and a responsibility toward its allies and the world – was the North Star for American politicians who came of age politically in the postwar years. Even the younger ones. John F. Kennedy is remembered for a 1961 inaugural address urging citizens to rededicate themselves to moving America forward. But at its core, his speech was about America’s special postwar place in the world. “The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans,” he declared, “born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.” They would be “unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed” – whether at home or “around the world.” This expansive view of American leadership, and the sense that it was key to defining what America is, has been an article of faith for Mr. Biden. It was critical in his response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Other presidents might well have opposed Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked assault on a neighboring state. They might well have responded with U.S. sanctions and urged allies to follow suit. That was pretty much the approach taken by then-President Barack Obama, a child of the 1960s, to Mr. Putin’s first attack on Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Mr. Biden’s response has been of a completely different order. He brought to bear the full weight of his office in assembling and leading key allies, in Europe and beyond, in providing sustained financial and military support for Ukraine’s fighting forces. The closest recent parallel also came under a U.S. leader whose view of America was forged by the world war: Republican President George H.W. Bush’s response to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s attempted annexation of Kuwait in 1990. Mr. Bush, who fought in the world war, took a similarly personal lead in assembling a coalition of some 30 countries, including Middle East rivals, behind a U.S.-led invasion to dislodge the Iraqis six months later. It’s not yet clear how long and how assertively America will hold to Mr. Biden’s pledge to back Ukraine for “as long as it takes” once he has left office. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one of dozens of leaders to pay tribute to Mr. Biden after his decision, made clear his understanding of the president’s indispensable personal role in helping Kyiv fight back. “We sincerely hope that America’s continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or allowing its aggression to pay off,” he said.","summary":"Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race marks the end of an era of U.S. leaders who saw America’s global role as key to its sense of self.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2024/0725/biden-speech-trump-us-america-world-war-2?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2024/07/0725%20NBIDEN%20BIDENMEANING%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:54:37","author":"Ned Temko","authors":["Ned Temko"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.412},{"id":252631744,"title":"Six Democrats in tight races join GOP in criticizing Harris record as ‘border czar’","text":"House Republicans, joined by six Democrats, passed a resolution strongly condemning “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris on her “failure to secure the southern border.” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), GOP Conference chairwoman, introduced the resolution that garnered a 220-196 vote. While border patrol officials recorded over the past few weeks the lowest numbers of illegal migrant crossings, Harris’s role in addressing the root problem of migration from Central American countries was brought back to light following President Joe Biden’s endorsement of her as the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris’s campaign team is mobilizing, having raised more than $100 million since she entered the race as a presidential candidate. In response, Republicans are looking to remind the public about the three-year period when more than 8 million illegal migrants crossed the border following Harris’s speech in which she told migrants “do not come.” Harris was never appointed to be a “border czar,” but she was tasked with “finding the root cause of migration,” which led to her being “known colloquially as the Biden administration’s ‘border czar.’” “No matter what congressional district you go to, the number one issue facing Americans is Kamala Harris’s open border crisis,” Stefanik said on the floor. “The American people deserve elected officials who understand the gravity of the crisis at the border.” Here are the six Democrats who have sided with Republicans on pinning the border crisis on Harris. Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) Serving in Congress since 2019, Golden has a record of voting against his party on border security bills. Back in 2022, he introduced legislation that aimed to strengthen Customs and Border Protection recruitment in rural areas. Although Golden has a strong record of supporting border security, he also faces a tight reelection, as the Cook Political Report labeled his race a “political toss-up.” In 2020, former President Donald Trump won Golden’s district. Golden was already on the record saying he wouldn’t commit to supporting Biden due to his health and age concerns and said at least Harris was “capable of finishing the next four-year term.” He then contradicted himself Thursday when he said, at this time, he is “absolutely not” committing to voting for Harris and is “going to wait and see what she puts forward and what her vision for the future of the country is.” Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-CO) In her first term as a representative, similar to Golden, Caraveo’s race has been deemed a tight one. However, despite condemning Harris for failing to secure the border, Caraveo has supported Harris’s run for the presidency. “I’m eager to elect her as the 47th President of the United States come November,” Caraveo said. Rep. Don Davis (D-NC) Davis is another freshman representative who has been a major critic of the Biden administration’s approach to securing the southern border. Davis was one of 14 House Democrats in March to denounce Biden for his handling of the border crisis. In April, Davis visited the border himself. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) Perez, another freshman representative, joined Golden and Davis in May, saying Biden’s executive order on asylum was not good enough. ​​“Border security must be the top national security priority for President Biden,” the statement read. “These proposed changes do not give the Border Patrol the authority it needs to bring order to our southern border, and the proposed changes will not be enough to stop the drug cartels from trafficking fentanyl over the border and into communities across America.” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) Currently facing criminal charges for bribery, Cuellar is another House Democrat who has joined in on blaming Harris for her lack of action at the southern border. Cuellar’s district includes cities and towns along the U.S.-Mexico border. In March, he launched a Democratic border security group. “It’s important for Democrats to talk about strong border security and still be respectful of immigrants’ rights,” Cuellar told reporters in March. “For so long, the Republicans have had a narrative about the border being a dangerous place and out of control. And I think it’s important that Democrats also have a narrative about border security.” Rep. Mary Peltola (D-AK) Elected in 2022, Peltola has made stopping the spread of fentanyl central to her time in office. She has crossed the aisle multiple times to vote with Republicans in favor of securing the border. “No one can deny we face an ongoing crisis at our southern border. Currently, fentanyl flows across it and all the way up to Alaska, where it continues to tear families and communities apart,” Peltola said in a statement. “We must take real action to address our ongoing border crisis — that’s why I voted to pass this measure and stop cartels in their tracks.”","summary":"House Republicans, joined by six Democrats, passed a resolution strongly condemning “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris on her “failure to secure the southern border.” Rep.

Donald Trump posted a video soundtracked by Don Toliver’s “Attitude” featuring Charlie Wilson and Cash Cobain to his TikTok account on Wednesday (July 24). The clip finds the former president blasting Vice President Kamala Harris by utilizing some of his previous soundbites attacking the probable Democratic presidential nominee while “Attitude” vocals thump in the background. “KAMALA, YOU’RE FIRED,” Trump captioned the video. Toliver has yet to publicly react to Trump’s TikTok. Billboard has reached out to reps for Don Toliver and Charlie Wilson for comment. With just over 100 days until the election, the twice-impeached former president takes several shots at Harris in the TikTok clip. “You’ve been terrible at everything you’ve done. You’re ultra-liberal and we don’t want you here. We don’t want you anywhere,” 45 spews. Fans were stunned to hear the worlds of the Cactus Jack artist and Trump colliding. “He saw Kamala use brat for promo and had to lock the f–k in,” one person wrote on X. Another chimed in, “We’re living in a simulation!” “Attitude” appeared on Don Toliver’s Hardstone Psycho album in June, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 — his highest since 2021’s Life of a Don. The Cash Cobain-produced single reached No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 16 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Kamala Harris has also had her share of music moments since Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21. Charli XCX endorsed the Democratic front-runner, claiming that “Kamala IS brat” after her acclaimed LP, and Harris HQ returned the favor by changing her X banner to the signature Brat lime-green tint with black text. Harris appears to have found a fitting anthem of her own.

Daniel Miller, who fronts the Texas Nationalist Movement, says a Harris victory would ‘fuel’ his group’s goal — the withdrawal of Texas from the US, or ‘Texit.’ According to Miller, the Democrat’s track record on immigration and climate change would leave millions more Texans wanting to opt out. Secessionist feelings are already high in Texas — nearly a third of residents want to leave the US, polls show — even though the US Constitution does not allow it. ‘If Harris wins, expect Texit support to surge,’ Miller told DailyMail.com. It would deepen ‘polarization,’ expand the federal government’s reach in Texas and ‘fuel the desire for independence,’ he said. ‘People here see this political charade for what it is,’ Miller added. ‘Her favorability hovers somewhere between leprosy and a colonoscopy, and yet she’s hailed by the mainstream media as the second coming of JFK.’ Vice President Harris looks set to become the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Republican Donald Trump in November. President Joe Biden, under pressure over his poor debate performance, on Wednesday confirmed he would not seek reelection, saying he would ‘pass the torch to a new generation.’ This has focussed attention on the record of Harris, a former California Senator and attorney general who, if elected, would become the first woman and person of black and South Asian heritage to become commander-in-chief. She’s fought hard to cut America’s emissions of planet-heating gases, sponsored the hard-line Green New Deal resolution, and was instrumental in passing Biden’s historic climate bill. Those are popular in Harris’ native California and Washington DC — but less so in Texas, which yields 42 percent of America’s crude oil and 27 percent of its natural gas, says Miller. The same goes for the Democrat’s record on immigration, he adds. She was nicknamed the ‘border czar’ of the Biden administration, and for years failed to stop the growing influx of asylum seekers across into Texas and other frontier states. ‘Harris bears much responsibility for the border crisis and immigration, which combined are the number one concern for Texans,’ says Miller. The Lone Star state’s 30-million-and-growing population wants ‘self-governance’ and to keep a distance from Washington, he says. ‘Any federal policies that undermine our values will push more Texans towards Texit,’ he adds. His comments come in a divisive election year, and amid the runaway success of Civil War, a dark thriller about the US spiraling into conflict between the capital and breakaway states. Texas was an independent country 200 years ago, and growing numbers of its residents want that status back. The separation, dubbed Texit, takes its name from Britain’s ‘Brexit’ from the European Union. Miller says his movement, created in 2005, has never been so close to achieving its goal. He wants the state legislature to pass a law allowing a referendum on breaking away. The US Constitution, however, has no clause allowing states to do this — indeed, the secession of Southern states including Texas in 1861 led to the Civil War, the bloodiest war in US history. It’s getting more popular thanks to the influx of asylum seekers at the border with Mexico, he says. Texans feel they’d do a better job of managing the frontier without the federal government tying their hands, he says. ‘A Harris presidency not only continues but extends that Biden legacy,’ says Miller. ‘If you thought Biden was bad for Texas, her administration is going to be orders of magnitude worse.’ Across the US, about 23 percent of people want their state to bust out of the union. Those sentiments are felt strongest in Alaska, Texas, California, New York, and Oklahoma, recent YouGov polling showed. The survey showed that 31 percent of Texans want out — though Miller says it’s an undercount. Alaska is the most pro-independence state, with 36 percent of residents wanting the Last Frontier to call it a day and leave the union. Democrat-run California and New York are next in line to abandon ship, with 29 percent and 28 percent of residents favoring secession, respectively. Oklahomans (28 percent), Nebraskans (25 percent), Georgians (25 percent), Floridians (24 percent) and Washingtonians (24 percent) are also eyeing the door. At the other end of the spectrum is Connecticut, with just 9 percent of its relatively content residents seeking an out. The interest in secession has been showcased by the success of the movie Civil War, which grossed $69 million in the US, according to Box Office Mojo. The tense thriller sees a nation that’s collapsed into full-blown armed conflict. The military powers of Texas and California have united as Western Forces, which are descending on Washington, DC. They seek to overthrow an authoritarian US president, played by Nick Offerman. Meanwhile, fictional Reuters photographer Lee (Kirsten Dunst) and reporter Joel (Wagner Moura) take to the road with the aim of reaching the capital before it falls to rebels. Miller calls the movie a ‘100 percent plausible’ account of America tearing itself apart.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Kamala Harris win in November would push America one step closer&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Impact of Kamala&#8217;s Victory on Red State&#8217;s Attempt to Secede from the US first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-impact-of-kamalas-victory-on-red-states-attempt-to-secede-from-the-us/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-How-a-Kamala-win-would-fuel-this.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:47:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.1},{"id":252630816,"title":"US police no longer trust FBI – report","text":"Many US state and local law enforcement agencies are refusing to share vital information with the Federal Bureau of Investigation due to concerns that it has become partisan and politicized, according to a whistleblower report submitted to Congress. The 230-page report was compiled by an alliance of retired and active-duty agents and analysts, who spoke to more than 30 “independent, highly credible” sources across the US. “They are not only reluctant to work with the FBI but reportedly have decided to no longer share actionable, substantive information on criminal and other intelligence-related activity” with the Bureau, because they believe it “has been operating as a partisan federal agency motivated by a political agenda” in recent years, the report’s authors said. The report’s existence was first reported on Wednesday in the New York Post. The document itself was sent to the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees and posted online. The group described a “crisis of confidence” in FBI-led task forces and a “disturbing loss of trust” in the Bureau as a whole, even as Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress about a “complex threat environment” that is unprecedented in his career. Most sources pointed to the FBI’s response to the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol and the August 2022 raid on former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. One of the sources described the FBI’s behavior as “that of a Third World country” and argued it “should be dismantled and its personnel prosecuted and given long prison sentences.” Pressure to assist with “J6” cases has led to a belief that the Bureau is driven by a “partisan, political agenda.” One source said they could not understand why the FBI was not going after any other groups with the same fervor. Another said that local officers feared they could be targeted “because of their love for the US” and perceived as “domestic terrorists” based on how they vote. Newer FBI agents “do not bother to conceal their distaste” for traditional political or religious views and openly identify themselves as “woke or liberal,” the head of a multi-agency task force said. Hired on the basis of “diversity, equity and inclusion” (DEI) guidelines, they are “completely worthless” and “the worst batch of people,” the whistleblowers said. The FBI academy at Quantico, Virginia at which new agents are trained “promotes a cult of narcissism” and arrogant superiority, while being intolerably politicized, the report claimed. Meanwhile, the Bureau’s Security Division has been abusing the security clearance process to purge conservative-leaning agents from its ranks. The whistleblowers urged Congress to force the resignation of Wray as “an extreme measure of last resort” and the only way to restore the Bureau’s reputation.","summary":"Law enforcement across America has lost faith in the FBI after the January 6 crackdown and the Mar-a-Lago raid on ex-president Donald Trump \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601662-usa-police-fbi-mistrust/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66a28b9085f54019da772af5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:47:25","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.525},{"id":252629740,"title":"So … What’s With This Rumor That J.D. Vance Had Sex With a Couch?","text":"Vice presidential hopeful JD Vance would like to be having a brat summer, but he is instead facing accusations of pushin’ the cushions of an unfortunate sofa. Social media has been inundated with jokes and memes suggesting Vance once pleasured himself between two couch cushions. What goes on between a man and his couch is between him, God, and whatever sexy sectional he chooses to victimize. While we can’t definitively state that Donald Trump’s running mate has never engaged in some furniture fornication, the viral allegation that Vance wrote about having sex with a couch in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy is false. On July 15, the day the Ohio senator was confirmed as Trump’s 2024 running mate, X (formerly Twitter) user @rickrudescalves wrote that they “can’t say for sure but [Vance] might be the first vp pick to have admitted in a ny times bestseller to f***ing an inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (vance, hillbilly elegy, pp. 179-181).” While Vance’s memoir contained plenty of gross generalizations about blue-collar, working-class Appalachians, he did not actually describe a sexual tryst with a hapless piece of upholstery. Regardless, the claim took off with a vengeance. Things escalated on Thursday when the Associated Press posted, then deleted, an article fact-checking the allegation. The piece was headlined: “No, JD Vance Did Not Have Sex With a Couch.” A spokesperson for the AP told Semafor that the story had been retracted because it hadn’t gone through the standard editing process at the wire service, and that the Associated Press was investigating how it made it to publication. While the couch-sex debacle is silly, it’s not helping Vance recover from a series of early campaign stumbles. Earlier this week, the senator was widely mocked for awkwardly joking that Democrats will accuse anything of being racist. “I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today and I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too,” he said at a rally on Monday. The cringey attempt at humor has also found its way into couch-related content: Vance was also widely criticized after a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson in which he attacked Kamala Harris as a “miserable cat lady” whose lack of biological children made her unfit to serve in elected office. Vance’s past comments about abortion and Trump have also been widely circulated. The comments about Harris, in particular, were met with widespread backlash by voters, commentators, and social media users who not only pointed out that Harris has two stepchildren but that attacking childless Americans — whatever their reasons for not reproducing — as inferior was a perilous message for a party already struggling to with the issue of reproductive rights and freedoms.

Netanyahu arrived in the U.S. on Monday after being invited by members of Congress to address lawmakers during a joint session. Harris, who became the likely Democratic nominee for president after Biden withdrew from the race, was not present to greet Netanyahu on the tarmac when he arrived. The Israeli prime minister delivered his address to Congress Wednesday, where he detailed the horrors of the country's war against Hamas. Harris declined to preside over the address and instead attended a sorority event in Indiana. Anti-Israel protests broke out across Washington D.C. ahead of Netanyahu's big speech, where agitators burned the American Flag, called the Israeli prime minister a \"war criminal,\" and vandalized a Liberty Bell replica with pro-Hamas writing. ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS BURN AMERICAN FLAGS, ACCUSE NETANYAHU OF BEING ‘WAR CRIMINAL’ AS HE ADDRESSES CONGRESS A leader from the Republican Jewish Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that works to lobby for conservative interests, has said that if Harris is elected, he expects her to follow in President Biden's footsteps regarding Israel moving forward. \"If you thought Joe Biden was bad on issues of top concern for pro-Israel voters, Kamala Harris is far worse,\" Sam Markstein, RJC national political director, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"It took her a full day to issue a weak condemnation of the pro-Hamas mobs that burned American flags and chanted vile antisemitic slogans at Jews in Washington, D.C. – with zero mention of any concrete action she would take to hold them accountable. It should be easy to condemn antisemitism – the real question is what she will do to confront it, and her statement speaks for itself,\" Markstein added. \"Clearly, her priorities are not our priorities – and if elected, we can expect more of the same.\" Harris condemned the protests in a statement Thursday: \"Yesterday, at Union Station in Washington, D.C., we saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric. I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.\" Netanyahu's U.S. visit comes at a critical moment in Harris' campaign, as she works to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket and make her case to voters just four months before Election Day. GOP LOOKS TO REVOKE VISAS FROM PARTICIPANTS IN VIOLENT PROTESTS AHEAD OF NETANYAHU ADDRESS Harris has said that she supports Israel's right to defend itself since the October 7 attack, but also highlighted calls for a ceasefire in the region. The vice president met with Benny Gantz, a rival of Netanyahu and member of Israel’s wartime cabinet, in March. That same month, Harris became the first administration official to call for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in the conflict. But anti-Israel protests erupted on college campuses across the country in the spring, and in June, Harris expressed sympathy for the agitators. \"They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,\" Harris said in an interview with The Nation. \"There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Kamala Harris and the Democrats will reap what they’ve sowed in this election – from undermining the US-Israel relationship to unprecedented lows and overseeing a spike in antisemitism to record high,\" Markstein said. \"The Jewish community is more energized than ever to help elect Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States to restore law and order to our cities and colleges so that American Jews can walk the streets and campuses without fear. November 5, 2024 cannot come soon enough.\" Fox News' Michael Lee and Emma Colton contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with Israeli PM Netanyahu on Thursday after months previewing how she would handle Israel relations if elected in 2024.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-jewish-group-fears-harris-presidency-would-far-worse-amid-rising-antisemitism","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/931/523/Netanyahu-Harris-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:44:51","author":"Aubrie Spady","authors":["Aubrie Spady"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":252629600,"title":"Secret Service refused police offer of drone before assassination attempt: Whistleblower","text":"The Secret Service declined an offer from local law enforcement to use drone technology at the rally where a gunman took shots at former President Donald Trump, an anonymous whistleblower told Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO). Hawley revealed in a letter published Thursday to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that the whistleblower said the Secret Service “repeatedly” objected to using a drone that was capable of identifying and neutralizing an active shooter. The whistleblower said a local law enforcement partner made the drone offers to the Secret Service the night before the rally, according to Hawley. The whistleblower said that after the shooting occurred, the Secret Service “changed course” and asked local police to use drone technology to surveil the scene, Hawley wrote. The revelation comes after FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed on Wednesday that Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, flew a drone over the rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, about two hours before he carried out the shooting. Crooks was able to fire multiple shots into the rally crowd from a nearby rooftop, killing one, critically injuring two, and causing a minor injury to Trump. Wray said the FBI reverse-engineered the drone’s flight path and found that Crooks flew it around roughly 200 yards from the stage where Trump later spoke and livestreamed the site for about 11 minutes. “This raises an obvious question: why was the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) not using its own drones?” Hawley wrote. The Missouri lawmaker said it was “hard to understand” why the Secret Service did not stop Crooks from using a drone so close to the rally start time while also refusing an offer from local police to employ a drone to help secure the event. Hawley’s revelation comes as the Secret Service faces intense scrutiny for the security failures that led to the first assassination attempt on a current or former president since 1981. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle announced her resignation this week after she struggled to provide answers to House lawmakers’ questions at a hearing about the security missteps on Monday. Cheatle admitted at the hearing that it was “the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades,” and she faced bipartisan calls to step down from her post.

But the data suggest a strategic running-mate choice could help the Democrat in some of them. That’s the takeaway from five fresh Emerson College surveys taken July 22 and July 23, the two days immediately after President Biden withdrew from the race. “In Arizona, 49% support Trump and 44% support Harris. In Georgia, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Michigan, 46% support Trump and 45% Harris. In Pennsylvania, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Wisconsin, 47% support Harris and Trump respectively,” says the polling memo released Thursday. In Arizona, Harris isn’t helped by 57% of respondents disapproving of Biden’s job performance. An expanded field also hurts Harris. When Robert Kennedy Jr., Libertarian Chase Oliver, Green Party hopeful Jill Stein and Cornel West are factored in, Trump’s lead stretches: 48% to Harris’ 40%. Harris could be boosted in the state by selecting Sen. Mark Kelly, a favorite of Barack Obama, as her VP, however, as 36% of respondents said the former astronaut would be her best selection. Whether he could deliver the state is a more open question. Turning to the Peach State, Biden’s 51% unfavorability is also a drag on the likely Democratic nominee, whose deficit increases to 3 points in the expanded field. And it’s unclear any vice-presidential hopeful will help her: Sen. Bernie Sanders, an unlikely choice, tops the hypothetical field with 17%. Michigan presents some contrasts. Harris and Trump are tied at 44% in the expanded field, with the veep outperforming her two-way numbers. And the polling suggests she should make Gretch happen in the veep slot, with 27% of respondents picking Gov. Whitmer as their favorite running mate. Pennsylvania is another battleground Harris may be helped in by picking the state’s governor, as 40% of respondents want the popular Josh Shapiro to be her running mate. Shapiro is +18 when it comes to job-performance approval in the state, suggesting he could be a major boon. Without Shapiro, Harris is down by 2 points to Trump whether in a two-way matchup or an expanded field, so a strategic pick may make the difference there. Turning to Wisconsin, it’s notable the race is tied regardless of whether the matchup is polled as Harris-Trump or the expanded field. Though there are differences among the candidates in the polling, there are also prevalent trends, including a gender gap. In all five states, Harris leads with women and Trump with men. And in most cases, the candidate who is behind isn’t close. The Republican is up by double digits in all five battlegrounds with his own gender, and Harris leads by 9 or more points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the blue-wall states. This polling also suggests the “double hater” phenomenon is in effect with Harris and Trump, regarded unfavorably along with President Biden by more than 50% of respondents in all five states. These polls track with previous battleground-state surveys showing that swing states could go either way in November. A North Star Opinion survey conducted between July 20 and 23 shows Trump up by 2 points in the Keystone State in a head-to-head battle with Harris. A Landmark Communications poll conducted Monday in Georgia shows Trump with 45.8% support, just 1.5% above Harris in a six-way race.","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is holding an edge against Vice President Kamala Harris in most of the states actually up for grabs in November.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/slew-of-swing-state-polls-show-donald-trump-with-battleground-edge-over-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-vhb4ook3i-1721930295326.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721915932&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wPb0Y7rU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:42:16","author":"A.g.

When the US Treasury Department first started to use economic sanctions against Washington’s adversaries in the 1990s, its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) worked from a single conference room, and according to a Washington Post feature published on Thursday, was primarily responsible for tasks like “blocking American sales of Cuban cigars.” The use of sanctions exploded after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, however, and the US now imposes three times more sanctions than any other country or international organization. These penalties target “a third of all nations with some kind of financial penalty on people, properties or organizations,” the newspaper noted, including 60% of the world’s low-income countries. In the US, this sanctions explosion has created chaos at OFAC’s offices, two anonymous sources told the newspaper. According to the sources, OFAC struggles to process “tens of thousands of requests from the private sector,” as companies seek to avoid criminal charges for sanctions violations, while the White House has reportedly outsourced decisions on what individuals and entities to sanction to nonprofits and think-tanks. Meanwhile, demands by OFAC staffers to rein in the use of sanctions have been shot down by higher-ups at both the Treasury and State departments, the Post’s sources claimed. “The abuse of this system is ridiculous, but it’s not Treasury or OFAC’s fault,” Caleb McCarry, a former State Department official, told the newspaper. “They want relief from this relentless, never-ending, you-must-sanction-everybody-and-their-sister, sometimes literally, system,” he continued, adding that “it is way, way overused, and it’s become out of control.” US Sanctions often fail to achieve their intended goal. George W. Bush’s sanctions on North Korea failed to stop Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons; Barack Obama’s sanctions on Syria failed to remove Bashar Assad from power; Donald Trump’s sanctions on Venezuela failed to incite the overthrow of Nicolas Maduro; and Joe Biden’s sanctions on Russia – numbering more than 6,000 in two years – have failed to bring an end to Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. While a major power like Russia has weathered these sanctions and continued to grow its economy, other nations have not been so fortunate. Starvation has been an ever-present threat in North Korea since the late 1990s, while Trump’s sanctions on Venezuela caused a major economic contraction and have been blamed for the deaths of up to 40,000 people between 2017 and 2019. “The mentality, almost a weird reflex, in Washington has just become: If something bad happens, anywhere in the world, the US is going to sanction some people. And that doesn’t make sense,” Ben Rhodes, a former adviser to Barack Obama, told the Washington Post. “We don’t think about the collateral damage of sanctions the same way we think about the collateral damage of war, but we should.”","summary":"60% of the planet’s low-income countries have been punished by “ridiculous” US economic sanctions, the Washington Post has reported \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601663-us-sanctions-policy-failed/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66a28e3585f540194e2fefba.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:41:23","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":252628868,"title":"Harris Narrows Gap Against Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with former President Donald J.

Just days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process. Her swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump’s significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans. Overall, Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in a head-to-head match.

(AP) — New federal court rulings are narrowing the Biden administration’s enforcement of a rule for protecting LGBTQ+ students from discrimination and allowing critics to limit it even further school by school. A federal judge in Missouri blocked enforcement of the rule in six additional states, bringing the total to 21. The decision Wednesday from Senior U.S. District Judge Rodney Sipple, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, applies in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. It comes just a week before the rule is to take effect. Sipple’s ruling followed one last week by U.S. District Judge John Broomes in Kansas, who blocked enforcement in that state, Alaska, Utah and Wyoming but also in individual schools and colleges across the U.S. with students or parents who are members of three groups opposing the rule. Broomes, an appointee of President Donald Trump, gave one group, Moms for Liberty, an extra week — until Friday — to submit its list of affected schools and said it could include ones for members who joined the group after his initial July 2 order. Republican officials seeking to roll back transgender rights hailed Sipple’s ruling as a victory for cisgendered girls and women, having framed the issue as protecting their privacy and safety in bathrooms and locker rooms. They’ve also argued the rule is a ruse to allow transgender females to play on girls’ and women’s sports teams, but Sipple said it would not apply to athletics. “Yet again a federal court has stopped the Biden-Harris administration from going around Congress to implement a ridiculous, nonsensical, and illegal election-year move,” Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffith said in a statement. “And it comes just in time before the start of the new school year.” Moms for Liberty had told Broomes in a court filing earlier this month that its members have students in tens of thousands of schools across the U.S., many in Democratic-led states supporting the rule. Also, judges in Alabama and Oklahoma have yet to rule in lawsuits filed by those states and Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The three groups involved in the Kansas lawsuit already have submitted lists of about 1,100 schools and colleges in the U.S. affected by Broomes’ order. An AP analysis shows that 69% are outside the 21 states where enforcement already is blocked. The Department of Education did not immediately respond Thursday to an email seeking comment about the latest rulings, but it has stood by the rule, which takes effect Aug. 1. LGBTQ+ youth, their parents, health care providers and others say restrictions on transgender youth harm their mental health and make often-marginalized students even more vulnerable. The Biden administration has asked federal appeals courts in Cincinnati, Denver and New Orleans to overturn judges’ orders. On Monday, it asked the U.S. Supreme Court to narrow orders applying in 10 states. It wants to enforce a provision declaring that bias against transgender students violates the 1972 Title IX civil rights law barring sex discrimination in education, without affecting bathroom access or use of students’ preferred pronouns. The various federal judges’ rulings block the rule at least through the trials of the states’ lawsuits, but they have concluded the states are likely to show that the Department of Education exceeded the authority granted by Title IX. Sipple and Broomes also said the rule likely violates the free speech rights of staff, student and staff who don’t recognize transgender students’ gender identities. “The Court also considers the fact that the regulations currently in effect have essentially ‘been unchanged for approximately 50 years. Therefore, it would be of relatively little harm to others to maintain the status quo,’” Sipple wrote in his decision, quoting Broomes’ July 2 decision. In the Kansas case, Moms for Liberty had asked Broomes to apply his July 2 order to any county where a group member lived — greatly expanding its reach, including across most major U.S. cities. Broomes declined, but he also rejected the Department of Education’s argument that Moms for Liberty couldn’t add to the list of affected schools through people who joined after July 2. Moms for Liberty said it was encouraging people to join online — and modified its website — so the schools of new members’ children can fall under Broomes’ order.

The GOP nominee is apparently thinking along the same lines. Politico reported: It might seem like a simple, albeit cheap, line at a campaign rally, but the closer one looks at the rhetoric, the more important it becomes. Right off the bat, Trump’s interest in “unity” has obviously been thrown out the window. Earlier this week, the former president said he was shot because “the Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me,” and as of last night, he tried to draw a direct connect between a Democratic talking point and the attempt on his life. It’s wildly irresponsible to talk this way — investigators still don’t know what motivated the shooter — but Trump clearly doesn’t care. What’s more, it’s tough to take the former president’s complaints about the rhetoric seriously given his own record. In fact, the week before the shooting in Pennsylvania, Trump described the Biden administration as a “fascist government,” as his campaign operation issued a fundraising appeal asserting as fact that President Joe Biden is “a threat to democracy.” Two weeks earlier, the former president wrote on his social media platform, “JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND A THREAT TO THE SURVIVAL AND EXISTENCE OF OUR COUNTRY ITSELF!!!” The hysterical missive dovetailed with months of rhetoric in which Trump has told voters the United States would likely cease to exist if he loses. If he thinks it’s dangerous for Democrats to push such criticism, perhaps Trump can explain why he’s pushed the same criticism. Complicating matters, the Republican candidate might not like the Democratic line, but it’s rooted in fact. As we’ve discussed, this is a White House hopeful who has repeatedly raised the prospect of creating a temporary American “dictatorship,” and who has talked about “terminating” parts of the Constitution that stand in the way of his ambitions. He’s running on a platform of rejecting election results he doesn’t like, militarized camps, pardons for politically aligned criminals, friendships with foreign authoritarians he holds in high regard, and mass firings of federal bureaucrats who are deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump’s ideological ambitions. If Trump doesn’t want to be accused of threatening democracy, then he might want to try curtailing his threats to democracy. Finally, it’s hard not to wonder what Republicans’ internal polling has to say on this. The scope of the pushback against this specific talking point suggests it might be potent.","summary":"Democrats accuse Donald Trump of being a threat to democracy.

At a rally in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he derogatorily called \"lying Kamala Harris.\" Harris has succeeded her boss, President Biden, as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after Biden - in a blockbuster announcement on Sunday - dropped his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president. TRUMP HOLDS FIRST RALLY AFTER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE TRANSFORMED The embattled president's immediate backing of Harris ignited a surge of endorsements of Harris by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders. By Monday night, the vice president announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention. She also hauled in a staggering $129 million since Biden's announcement, her campaign touted on Thursday morning. IT'S A MARGIN OF ERROR RACE BETWEEN TRUMP AND HARRIS Trump, speaking to a packed arena in Charlotte, aimed to paint Harris as the \"most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.\" He charged that she \"has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office.\" And pointing to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the far-left champion and two-time runner up for the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump argued that Harris is \"more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it?\" Throughout his more than hour and a half stream of comments, Trump repeatedly slammed the vice president over border security and crime, two top issues in the 2024 election. The strategy by Trump, his campaign, and allied groups, is simple: Define Harris, who is not nearly as well known to Americans as Trump and Biden, before Harris has the chance to define herself. Trump campaign spokesman and senior adviser Steven Cheung said that the former president's team was ready to go on offense the moment Harris succeeded Biden as the Democrat's standard-bearer. \"There wasn’t any surprise. We were prepared for it. We had all our assets ready. We had all our content ready. It didn’t surprise anyone,\" Cheung told reporters ahead of the Trump rally. Longtime Republican consultant David Kochel emphasized that both the Trump and Harris campaigns are \"in a race to define\" the vice president and that most Americans \"know so little about her record … It’s go time for both sides.\" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns who remained neutral in the 2024 Republican primary, noted to Fox News that \"Trump’s got a big megaphone.\" He offered that Trump's slights are \"not without merit,\" as he noted that Harris \"did run to the left of Biden\" in the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race and that \"she had one of the most liberal records in the Senate when she was there.\" Harris is pointing to her hefty law enforcement resume as she spotlights Trump's numerous legal controversies, including his 34 felony convictions two months ago in the first criminal trial of a former or current president. \"As many of you know, before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" Harris said Monday at an event at her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. \"Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,\" she emphasized as she pointed to Trump's multiple lawsuits and criminal cases, many of which are ongoing. Harris repeated the line of attack the next day at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump responded at Wednesday's rally, saying \"I don’t think people are going to buy it.\" And he argued that the vice president \"was one of the worst prosecutors in history\" and that \"she destroyed San Francisco.\" The former president touted his support for law enforcement and landed the backing of the National Association of Police Organizations, as the group's president, Michael McHale, joined Trump on the podium to formally endorse the GOP nominee. The Harris campaign panned Trump's performance, with spokesman Ammar Moussa calling it \"an unhinged, weird and rambling speech\" and arguing that \"the American people won’t be fooled or distracted\" by Trump's salvos. The jabs by Trump come as Harris is in the process of taking full control of the Biden campaign, cementing her nomination, which will formally come as early as next week during a virtual roll call ahead of the Democratic convention, and choosing a running mate by early next month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Harris is enjoying plenty of earned media during this seemingly honeymoon phase of her fledgling campaign, when it comes to paid media, the Trump campaign and its aligned groups currently have a massive advantage. Trump's air superiority will likely be short-lived, as the Harris campaign appears to be working to produce and air spots as soon as possible. \"She needs to be on the air with some pretty compelling bio stuff,\" Kochel emphasized. Ahead of the rally, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said that even though Trump is now facing a new opponent at the top of the Democrats' ticket, the GOP's strategy \"does not change … at all.\" \"We have been running our race, and we are going to continue to run our race,\" Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chair whom Trump installed as RNC chair in March after clinching the Republican nomination, emphasized in a Fox News interview. Whatley, speaking at the rally site at Charlotte's Bojangles Coliseum, noted that Trump and the RNC will relentlessly tie Harris to Biden's policies on border security, fighting inflation, crime and other top issues in the 2024 election. \"The Democrats not only have a messenger problem, they have a message problem. And Kamala Harris is doubling down on every single one of Joe Biden's failed policies. It's the Biden-Harris administration, the Biden-Harris campaign. And she is picking up that mantle,\" Whatley argued. Fox News Mark Meredith and Jennifer Johnson contributed to this story.

Medics at the event responded to 44 heat-related calls, including people suffering from heat illness and bouts of fainting. At least one person sent to the hospital was reported in critical condition. Another person onsite suffered from cardiac arrest. Although the rally took place indoors, rally goers appeared at the arena and waited outside for several hours. Temperatures reached 89 degrees, with humidity and direct sun beating down on attendees. This isn’t the first event where Trump supporters have suffered from extreme heat. In June, a campaign event in Arizona saw 11 people hospitalized due to high temperatures leading to similar medical problems. Heat was also problematic during Trump’s 2020 run — 17 individuals required medical attention (including 12 who were hospitalized) at an event in Florida that year when attendees were subjected to high-80-degree temperatures and humid conditions for several hours. The latest episode of excessive heat conditions at a Trump rally comes on the heels of the two hottest days ever recorded on Earth. Sunday broke the previous record, only for Monday to hit even hotter temperatures on average across the globe. Despite repeated instances of his own supporters suffering the effects of excessive heat, likely due to the climate crisis, Trump continues to be a denier of climate change, repeatedly describing it as a “hoax” over the past several years, including this year as a candidate for the White House. As president, Trump undermined dozens of environmental regulations, including many that were previously established to address the warming of the planet. Trump also avoided a question on the climate crisis during his debate with President Joe Biden in June, refusing to say if his future administration would “take any action” to address it and instead ranting about unrelated topics. Environmentalists expect another Trump presidency to be a disaster for the climate. “Trump already has a record on pretty much denying the climate crisis and repealing environmental regulations and essentially just clearing the path for fossil fuel expansion. … We know what he did last time, and we have an even better understanding of how backwards it could get,” said John Noël, senior climate campaigner with Greenpeace USA. But it’s becoming increasingly hard for Trump and other Republicans to deny the crisis is real. There’s even some evidence to suggest that the attempt on Trump’s life could be blamed, in part, on the observed rise in temperatures. According to at least one whistleblower, a law enforcement officer was supposed to be stationed on the roof where a shooter had targeted Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this month. That officer, however, allegedly abandoned their post because it was too hot to stay up there.Temperatures were indeed much higher than usual in that part of the state that day. In nearby Pittsburgh, temperatures exceeded 90 degrees, well above the projected high of around 83 degrees for the date the rally took place. Indeed, due to the shooting, heat-related medical situations at the Butler rally that day were largely ignored.","summary":"Trump is a noted denier of the climate crisis, frequently decrying climate change as a &ldquo;hoax.&rdquo;","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/dozens-of-trump-backers-required-medical-attention-due-to-heat-at-nc-rally/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/07/2024_0725-trump-rally-heat-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:37:13","author":"Chris Walker","authors":["Chris Walker"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":252628596,"title":"FBI director says there is 'some question' whether Trump was hit with a bullet or shrapnel","text":"In the aftermath of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump earlier this month, the former president said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\"Now FBI Director Christopher Wray cast some doubt on this Wednesday when he said before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee that it was not clear whether Trump was struck by a bullet or shrapnel at Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\"I think, with respect to former President Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear,\" Wray said.His comment was in response to a question from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who asked where the eight shots fired by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks went.Wray added, \"So it's conceivable, although as I sit here right now I don't know whether that bullet, in addition to, you know, causing the grazing, could have also landed somewhere else. But I believe we've accounted for all of the shots in the cartridges.\"Jordan followed up, \"It's my understanding that the very first one was the one that hit the president. The very first shot. Or is that not accurate?\"\"As I sit here right now, I don't know the answer to that. I believe we know the answer to that. I just don't have it in front of me,\" Wray responded.The gunman — who was shot dead by the Secret Service —opened fire from a rooftop just minutes into Trump's July 13 rally, leaving the former president's ear bloodied, one attendee dead, and two others injured.When asked for comment Thursday regarding Wray's testimony about there being a question of whether Trump was hit by a bullet or shrapnel, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Business Insider: \"Anyone who believes this conspiracy bullshit is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.\"Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, appointed Wray as FBI director in 2017.Meanwhile, firearms expert Peter Diaczuk told BI that whether a bullet or shrapnel struck Trump, both would have done a similar amount of damage to his ear and that the former president would not have known the difference.\"They're both going to rip the ear apart. They're both passing by at a relatively high rate of speed,\" said Diaczuk, a professor of forensic science at New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Additionally, Diaczuk told BI that it's most likely that it was, in fact, a bullet that hit Trump's ear instead of shrapnel.In order for a bullet to break up and cause a fragment, \"it's got to hit something substantial to disrupt its integrity,\" Diaczuk explained.\"And from what I saw — clearly, I don't have as much information as people who have been to the scene looking at things — but from what I saw the day of and the day after, was that it was a clear line of sight between the sniper's nest and the podium,\" said Diaczuk. \"And if that's the case, then there's nothing to cause the breakup of a bullet.\"\"I don't see any indication of an intervening object to cause the bullet to fragment,\" he said.Republican Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump's White House doctor, said in a previously released note that the former president \"sustained a gunshot wound\" that caused \"significant bleeding\" and \"marked swelling\" of his entire upper ear.\"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear,\" the memo read. \"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down from the cartilaginous surface of the ear.\"","summary":"A spokesman for Donald Trump clapped back, describing the FBI Director Christopher Wray's comments as \"conspiracy bullshit.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-fbi-christopher-wray-bullet-assassantion-attempt-shrapnel-2024-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/6693c8129caa6ed01e01768c?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:35:42","author":"Natalie Musumeci","authors":["Natalie Musumeci"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":252629138,"title":"Republicans Divided on Removal of Biden via the 25th Amendment Following Trump’s Opposition Due to Kamala’s Alleged Unfitness","text":"Republicans are at odds about whether President Joe Biden should remain in office through the election as doubts about his mental and physical health increase. Since Biden announced he won’t be seeking reelection on Sunday, scores of GOP lawmakers have come out saying he needs to be removed from office immediately because he’s not fit to serve. They are calling on Biden’s Cabinet to trigger his removal through the 25th Amendment, which has never been used in history. Former President Donald Trump, however, made it clear Thursday that he is against the maneuver, saying, ‘I don’t think they should use the 25th Amendment.’ ‘I will say this, the world is in a very dangerous place. I think if [Biden] goes, [Kamala] then takes over and she’s worse than he is,’ Trump said on Fox & Friends, calling her a ‘San Francisco radical.’ Despite Trump’s warning, some Republicans are still insisting that the never-before-used amendment must be invoked immediately to boot out Biden. The 25th Amendment, which outlines presidential succession, gives the vice president and Cabinet power to remove the commander in chief from office in the event it’s determined he or she is no longer fit for office. Under Section 4, a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate is necessary to find the president is ‘unable to discharge’ their ‘powers and duties.’ Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, first filed a resolution just after the debate to call on Harris ‘to convene the Cabinet and declare President Joe Biden as unable to carry out his duties as Commander-in-Chief.’ Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Monday he was still considering whether to put the resolution on the House floor. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has called for Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment and on Tuesday introduced articles of impeachment for the vice president failing to uphold border laws. Additionally, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., wrote a letter to every one of Biden’s Cabinet members urging them to invoke the 25th Amendment. ‘I wrote a letter and sent it to Kamala Harris asking her to invoke the 25th Amendment,’ Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., told DailyMail.com. ‘I have a little book on my desk. It’s called the Constitution. And she is the Vice President of the United States and the President of the United States is compromised mentally and physically.’ ‘So it’s her duty to invoke the 25th Amendment, get the cabinet together, write a letter, submit to Joe Biden and that millisecond she becomes the the the acting president United States.’ He said Biden is ‘pretending’ to be president and he would ‘rather have an acting president than him pretending.’ Van Orden says he is still supportive of Trump, but adds ‘I’m looking at this from a national security perspective.’ Other Republicans, meanwhile, said they are fully on board with the president’s resistance to the 25th Amendment. ‘I think the [former] president’s position is my position,’ Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., told DailyMail.com. ‘That’s a Kamala Harris question. It’s not for us. You know, we can all see that Joe Biden has some limitations. But since the White House and frankly a lot of elements in our media, not all of you guys but definitely elements in our media, have hidden Joe Biden from the public, that falls on their shoulders. That’s their responsibility.’ Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., agreed with Donalds and Trump. ‘It won’t pass the Senate. So I don’t know that is needed.’ ‘I don’t think the President has any capacity to govern. And he hasn’t been quite some time and it’s been covered up completely by the media.’ ‘Everybody in Washington talks about it, Democrats and Republicans.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublicans are at odds about whether President Joe Biden should remain in office through&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republicans Divided on Removal of Biden via the 25th Amendment Following Trump&#8217;s Opposition Due to Kamala&#8217;s Alleged Unfitness first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/republicans-divided-on-removal-of-biden-via-the-25th-amendment-following-trumps-opposition-due-to-kamalas-alleged-unfitness/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1721931103_rewrite-this-title-Republicans-split-on-whether-Biden-should-be.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 18:32:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.546}]}
