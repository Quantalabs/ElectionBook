We look forward to our journey through life together. \n\n'At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.' \n\nThe couple have the blessing of the President, with Trump himself saying he was happy when he learned that they had become an item.\n\n'He told me about it, and I said, 'Tiger, that's good, that's good. I'm very, happy for both.' But they just let them both be happy. Let them both be happy. They're both great,' Trump said.\n\nWoods and Trump went public with their relationship in March and asked for privacy \n\nThe relationship has the blessing of the president - Trump paid tribute to the pair of them \n\n'I love Tiger and I love Vanessa. He and I have a very special, very good relationship with Tiger. I played golf with him a couple of times over the last month, and he's a fantastic guy and a fantastic athlete.' \n\nAdditionally, Tiger's mother, Kultida, passed away in February - a devastating blow as the matriarch of the Woods family died at the age of 80.\n\n'At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.'\n\nTiger himself has been absent from the course after suffering an injury to his Achilles as he prepared for the Masters back in April. However, he was recently seen without a brace on his knee riding a golf cart while watching Charlie.\n\nWith The Open Championship coming up next month, it's unclear if Tiger will have rehabbed his injury in time.\n\nTiger WoodsJupiter\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nKai Trump and Charlie Woods endure very different days at South Florida golf tournament\n\nAdd comment","summary":"With two of their parents dating each other, all eyes were on the children of Tiger Woods and Vanessa Trump at a junior golf tournament in Florida.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-14844285/Kai-Trump-Charlie-Woods-endure-different-days-South-Florida-golf-tournament.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/25/02/99692667-0-image-m-11_1750813475656.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/31/2450396494918956612/1024x576_MP4_2450396494918956612.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-25 01:13:51","author":"Editor,Jake Fenner","authors":["Editor","Jake Fenner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.394},{"id":334874666,"title":"Trump’s F-bomb stresses ‘gravity’ in Mid-East","text":"Israel’s military said it shot down two Iranian missiles launched shortly after the ceasefire came into effect on Tuesday (AEST) and returned fire.\n\nIran has denied firing a missile and analysts have suggested it could have been a timing accident or a rogue unit.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the US President blasted Israel for its response, saying the Middle East ally needs “to calm down now”.\n\n“Israel violated it too, Israel, as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I’d never seen before, the biggest load that we’ve seen, I’m not happy with Israel,” Mr Trump said. \n\n“You don’t go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them, so I’m not happy with them, I’m not happy with Iran either, but I’m really unhappy with Israel going out this morning because of one rocket that didn’t land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn’t land – I’m not happy about that.”\n\nHe added that Israel and Iran “have been fighting so long, so hard that they don’t know what the f**k they’re doing”.\n\nAsked about Mr Trump’s use of words on Wednesday, the Treasurer said he was “not going to quibble with the language that President Trump used”.\n\n“I think it does reflect the gravity of the situation in the Middle East, and the importance of both sides adhering to this cease fire, which has been negotiated,” Mr Chalmer told Sky News. \n\n“And so I think the stakes are very high in the Middle East, the implications for the world, and particularly the global economy, are very significant. \n\n“And so I think President Trump’s language reflected that – far be it from for Australians to quibble with that kind of language, we are blunt speaking people.”\n\nIran defends ‘peaceful’ nuclear program\n\nSpeaking to Sunrise on Wednesday morning, Iranian ambassador to Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, defended Iran’s right to a “peaceful nuclear program”. \n\n“We have the right to use (a) peaceful nuclear program, including the enrichment for peaceful uses,” he said.\n\n“Iran, although it has been for a long time in cooperation with IAEA and in negotiation with the different international bodies like Five Plus One and just recently had five rounds of negotiations with US Government, is still ready to go for the negotiation table again. \n\n“We are ready to negotiate with them, but we keep our right for peaceful use of energy.”\n\nCentral to Israel and the US’ strikes on Iran were claims Iran was close to developing nuclear weapons, a claim Iran has repeatedly denied.\n\n“We didn’t breach our commitments,” Mr Sadeghi said. “I don’t know what reference you are (making) to that. But with regard to the bombardment of our nuclear facilities, it was an illegal action raised by the US that we also defended ourselves and reciprocated based on our right.”\n\nReports on Wednesday morning leaked to the media from US Intelligence stated the US strikes President Donald Trump has said “completely obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities in fact only delayed Iran’s nuclear program by months. \n\nThese reports were strenuously denied by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt who labelled the leaking “a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear program”.\n\nMr Sadeghi said he did not have “any exact technical assessment and estimate” on the damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities. \n\n“That is something that the technical teams, with regard to Iran and IAEA, maybe Tehran, have to find out about it, the dimension of the damage. The thing is, that Iran does have the right to peaceful nuclear usage.”\n\nMore to come.","summary":"A senior Albanese government minister has reacted to Donald Trump dropping an F-bomb on the Middle East.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/trumps-middle-east-fbomb-reflects-the-gravity-of-the-situation-chalmers-says/news-story/3d0bb28492c7928592bac0a8b7a3ca1a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b0e2b5f74a977b629fba1f19bd525767","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 01:10:19","author":"Joseph Olbrycht","authors":["Joseph Olbrycht"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":334872350,"title":"Cuomo is trying a comeback in New York's mayoral primary, but Zohran Mamdani stands in his way","text":"New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Andrew Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal upstart Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a crowded field of lesser-known but maybe less-polarizing candidates in the party's mayoral primary.Their choice could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.The vote takes place about four years after Cuomo, 67, resigned as governor following a sexual harassment scandal. Yet he has been the favorite throughout the race, with his deep experience, nearly universal name recognition, strong political connections and juggernaut fundraising apparatus.The party's progressive wing, meanwhile, has coalesced behind Mamdani, 33, a self-described democratic socialist. A relatively unknown state legislator when the contest began, Mamdani gained momentum by running a sharp campaign laser-focused on the city's high cost of living and secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.The candidates were making a final push out in the city Tuesday, sweating it out with voters on a sizzling summer day in which temperatures reached the triple digits. While preliminary returns will be released after the polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday, a winner might not emerge for a week because of the city's ranked choice voting system, which allows voters to list up to five candidates in order of preference. If a candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters, they win outright. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the tabulation of the rankings wouldn’t begin until July 1.The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election. There is also a possibility that Cuomo runs on the November ballot as an independent candidate if he loses the primary.The mayoral primary’s two leading candidates — one a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate — could be stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party’s ideological divide, though Cuomo’s scandal-scarred past adds a unique tinge to the narrative.The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's Republican agenda.Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. It was unclear if that episode was enough to jump-start a campaign that had been failing to pick up speed behind Lander’s wonkish vibe.Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.RELATED STORY | New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary. Here's how it worksMamdani's energetic run has been hard not to notice.His army of young hipster canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people. He would be the city's first Indian American and first Muslim mayor.Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.In one heated debate exchange, Cuomo rattled off a long list of what he saw as Mamdani's managerial shortcomings, arguing that his opponent, who has been in the state Assembly since 2021, has never dealt with Congress or unions and never overseen an infrastructure project. He added that Mamdani couldn't be relied upon to go toe-to-toe with Trump.Mamdani had a counter ready.“To Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,” he said.Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.During the campaign, he has become more aggressive in defending himself, framing the situation as a political hit job orchestrated by his enemies.The fresh scandal at City Hall involving Mayor Eric Adams, though, gave Cuomo a path to end his exile.","summary":"New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Andrew Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a crowded field of lesser-known candidates for New York mayor.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/elections/cuomo-is-trying-a-comeback-in-new-yorks-mayoral-primary-but-zohran-mamdani-stands-in-his-way","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/404ffa8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5839x3065+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2F30%2F9e5ee64c4c4cb8140f36d067ab07%2Fap25175587019038.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:44:42","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":334874058,"title":"Russian missile attack kills 17 as Zelenskiy presses NATO support","text":"DNIPRO (Ukraine): A Russian missile attack in southeastern Ukraine on Tuesday killed at least 17 people and caused sweeping damage, officials said, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Kyiv’s allies at a NATO summit to bolster Ukraine’s defence industry.\n\nThe two-part strike killed 15 and wounded more than 200 in the regional capital Dnipro, said governor Serhiy Lysak, where a blast wave showered scores of train passengers with broken glass.\n\nAmong the wounded were at least 18 children, he added.\n\nThe rare daytime strike also damaged dozens of apartment buildings and educational facilities among other sites, according to Mayor Borys Filatov, who said the attack caused an “unprecedented amount of destruction” in the city.\n\nTwo people were also killed in the town of Samar, around 10 km (six miles) from Dnipro, Lysak said, adding that an infrastructure facility was damaged.\n\nThe attack came as Zelenskiy pressed NATO member states in the Netherlands to boost their investment in Ukraine’s growing defence sector and crack down on the supply of foreign components that he said Russia uses to build its weapons.\n\n“This is not a fight where it’s hard to choose a side,” he wrote on X in response to the strike. “Standing with Ukraine means defending life.”\n\nZelenskiy was also expected to meet US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nRussia has stepped up air strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks, particularly its capital Kyiv, where 28 people were killed on June 17 in the deadliest such attack this year.\n\nAnother 10 people were killed in air attacks on Kyiv and the surrounding region on Monday.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s attack on Dnipro, stunned residents surveyed a badly damaged apartment building and battered cars.

In a post shared on Truth Social, Trump said Israel and Iran would likely exchange final blows over the next six hours before the deal would come into place on Tuesday.\n\"Iran will start the ceasefire and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the ceasefire and, upon the 24th Hour, an official end to the 12-Day War,\" he stated.\nThe conflict between Israel and Iran started on June 13 when the former launched a massive airstrike on Iranian military and nuclear sites, codenamed \"Operation Rising Lion\". In retaliation, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) initiated a large-scale drone and missile campaign called 'Operation True Promise 3', targeting Israeli fighter jet fuel production facilities and energy supply centres.\nTensions escalated further after the US conducted precision airstrikes early Sunday morning on three key Iranian nuclear facilities under \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\" Iran retaliated by launching multiple missiles at US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar--the largest US military base in the region.

Know Truth As Rumours Go Viral.\nIn the initial report, the Chinese state-owned firm had indicated the presence of methane gas at the Jaljale site, with findings suggesting it could supply Nepal's gas demand for the next 50 years.\n\"The trial production (of methane gas) will start within Mangsir (November), and its commercial production will possibly start within the next fiscal year. It will be utilised fully,\" the Nepalese Prime Minister announced during Tuesday's parliamentary meeting.\nThe Chinese company, which previously drilled to a depth of 4,013 meters and extracted a one-meter core sample for laboratory testing, will proceed with further steps only after intergovernmental agreements are in place, officials said on condition of anonymity.\nThe Chinese team had collected rock samples and transported them to China for further testing to determine the quantity and quality of the methane gas. Based on current estimates, the discovered methane reserves could meet Nepal's energy needs for the next 50 years, marking a potential breakthrough in reducing the country's dependence on petroleum products.\nThe exploration was initiated under a bilateral agreement signed between the governments of Nepal and China in 2016, aimed at developing petroleum resources.\nIn 2019, Nepal's Department of Mines and Geology entered into a formal agreement worth NPR 2.4 billion with the China Geological Survey for exploration and drilling work. However, progress was delayed due to several challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation issues, road access limitations, and land acquisition disputes.\nThe three-year agreement, signed in February 2019, was later extended in 2022. Drilling was carried out on 45 ropani (approximately 2.29 hectares) of acquired land in Jaljale by a team of around 70 technicians, while the project also provided employment to about 100 local workers.\nMethane (CH4), composed of hydrogen and carbon, is a cleaner-burning fuel compared to petrol or diesel. It is a potent greenhouse gas, formed primarily through the decomposition of organic matter over long periods.\nGlobally, methane is used as an energy source for heating, electricity generation, and industrial applications. Unlike liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), it cannot be easily compressed into small household cylinders and is typically stored in larger containers.

He was also added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, with a $3m reward offered for information leading to his arrest or conviction.\n\nIn the statement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Tren de Aragua, under Mosquera Serrano’s leadership, of “terrorizing our communities and facilitating the flow of illicit narcotics into our country”.\n\nIt was the latest effort in the Trump administration’s campaign to crack down on criminal activity that it claims is tied to the proliferation of foreign gangs and criminal networks in the US.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and other Latin American gangs as “foreign terrorist organisations”, a category more commonly used to describe international groups with violent political aims.\n\nBut Trump has used the threat of criminal networks based abroad to justify the use of emergency powers during his second term.\n\nFor instance, the Trump administration has claimed that Tren de Aragua is coordinating its US activities with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. That allegation was then used to justify the use of a rare wartime law: the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nClaiming that the presence of groups like Tren de Aragua constituted a foreign “invasion” on US soil, Trump leveraged the Alien Enemies Act as the legal basis for pursuing the expedited deportations of alleged gang members.\n\nMore than 200 people were sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where many of them remain to this day.\n\nThose deportations have drawn widespread criticism, along with a slew of legal challenges. Critics have said that the expedited deportations violated the immigrants’ rights to due process. They also pointed out that many of the deported men did not have criminal records.\n\nLawyers for some of the men have argued that they appear to have been imprisoned based on their tattoos and wardrobe choices. The Department of Homeland Security, however, has disputed that allegation.\n\nAt least one top US official has acknowledged that Maduro’s government may not direct Tren de Aragua.\n\nAn April memo from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, obtained by news outlets like NPR and The New York Times, likewise cast doubt on the idea that Venezuela was controlling the gang’s movements in the US.\n\nRather, the memo said that the Maduro government likely sees Tren de Aragua as a threat.\n\n“While Venezuela’s permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” the memo reads.\n\nLast July, the US and Colombia offered joint multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to the arrest of Mosquera Serrano and two other men believed to lead Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe group was also sanctioned in the same month as a transnational criminal organisation for “engaging in diverse criminal activities, such as human smuggling and trafficking, gender-based violence, money laundering, and illicit drug trafficking”, according to a Treasury Department statement.\n\nNumerous countries in Latin America have struggled with the gang’s rapid growth, which has been linked to political assassinations and widespread human trafficking, though experts say there is little to suggest the gang has infiltrated the US.","summary":"The State Department has offered up to $3m for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/25/us-sanctions-alleged-leader-of-venezuelan-gang-tren-de-aragua?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AFP__20250123__36VN8RV__v2__MidRes__ChileCrimeTrenDeAragua-1750796439.jpg?resize=1799%2C1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:25:01","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.152},{"id":334869034,"title":"Joe Rogan Shares Strong Opinion on MAGA’s Internal Conflict Regarding Iran Bombing","text":"Joe Rogan backed Republican Thomas Massie after the renegade congressman came out against President Trump’s involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. \n\nKnown for his endorsement of Trump prior to the election, Rogan was in conversation with Bernie Sanders when he seemed to express his views on the conflict within the MAGA community. He mentioned that numerous supporters of the president were not in favor of going to war.\n\nRogan stated, “People understand this individual should have the freedom to express his opinions and make valid arguments, leading others to reject the notion,” regarding Massie’s role in potentially swaying public opinion against Middle Eastern military efforts.\n\nLibertarian Congressman Massie had put forward a resolution in the House aimed at limiting Trump’s authority on military actions after the president dispatched B-2 bombers targeting Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHe pulled the resolution, however, following Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire. \n\nRogan still feels that Massie can have a large sway over the MAGA movement, who the comic says is against war. \n\n‘I think the whole MAGA thing right now is very divided, particularly because one of the things they voted for was no war,’ Rogan said. \n\n‘Well now it seems like we’re in a war. And it’s quick. We’re six months in and that’s already popped off.’\n\nHe added that he was concerned about American troops overseas and the idea of Iranian sleeper cells created due to Joe Biden’s disastrous policy on the border. \n\nSanders, a Democratic socialist, praised Massie’s efforts and said it ‘bothers’ him that Trump and many supporters suggesting the Kentucky Congressman face a primary for his views.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican told reporters Monday night that he had agreed to pull his resolution, even after it sparked support from Congressional Democrats looking to score political points against the president. \n\n‘I talked to the Speaker on the floor just now and told him we wouldn’t push it if the cease-fire holds, so it’s really in their court,’ Massie said, adding that he would ‘wait and see’ before making a final call. \n\nMassie’s decision to withdraw drew praise from Trump’s deputy chief of staff James Blair. \n\n‘Thank you for your attention to this matter,’ Blair wrote, adding the siren emoji to highlight Massie’s stunning U-turn. \n\nMassie was vocal about his opposition to U.S. military strikes of Iranian nuclear facilities in Iran, challenging the president for what he described as an ‘unconstitutional’ act to go to war without the authority of Congress. \n\nHe previously boasted that his War Powers Resolution, that he launched with the support of Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California had 57 cosponsors.\n\n‘Whether you like it or not Congress will be voting on U.S. hostilities in Iran,’ he wrote Monday afternoon on social media. \n\nTrump expressed his frustration with Massie, after the Kentucky Congressman went on television for several interviews where he criticized the president. \n\n‘GET THIS ‘BUM’ OUT OF OFFICE, ASAP!!!’ Trump posted on social media. \n\n‘Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is. Actually, MAGA doesn’t want him, doesn’t know him, and doesn’t respect him,’ Trump also wrote. \n\nMassie repeatedly criticized the president, especially after Trump floated the prospect of regime change in Iran. \n\n‘This is not America First folks,’ he wrote. I will not vote for the United States to get dragged into another regime change war. In fact, I will actively oppose it.’ \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also took on Massie during a Fox News segment on Monday. \n\n‘He should be a Democrat because he is more aligned with them than with the Republican Party,’ she said. \n\nShe also pushed back on Massie’s claim that Trump’s action was unconstitutional. \n\n‘The White House was not obligated to call anyone because the president was acting within his legal authority under Article 2 of the Constitution, as commander-in-chief of the president of the United States,’ Leavitt concluded. \n\nOn Sunday, Trump additionally criticized Massie for grandstanding on television after the successful military strikes on Iran. \n\n‘He’s a simple minded ‘grandstander’ who thinks it’s good politics for Iran to have the highest level Nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’ at every chance they get,’ Trump wrote on social media, describing him as ‘weak’ and ‘ineffective’ and ‘disrespectful to our great military.’\n\n ‘MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague!’ Trump concluded. \n\nMassie responded to Trump on his own social media account. \n\n‘Donald Trump declared so much War on me today it should require an Act of Congress,’ the congressman wrote with the hashtag #sassywithmassie. \n\nHowever, Trump himself appeared to be showing frustration with both Israel and Iran on Monday.\n\nThe president went on a foul-mouthed tirade saying that both Israel and Iran violated the ceasefire deal that he announced Monday evening.\n\n‘We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing,’ Trump said before boarding Marine One en route to the NATO Summit early Tuesday morning.\n\nThe president said Monday evening that he had brokered a ceasefire between Iran and Israel after ordering his own strike on three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. \n\nEarlier Monday, Iran had retaliated by sending missiles toward the U.S.’s largest military base in the Middle East, located just outside of Doha in Qatar, which didn’t prompt a response from Trump. \n\nInstead he announced the ceasefire. \n\nOn Tuesday morning Trump was fired up after Israel decided to launch another massive assault on Iran just as the deal was to take hold. \n\n‘Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I’ve never seen before, the biggest load that we’ve seen,’ an incredulous said.\n\n‘I’m not happy with Israel,’ he added. ‘I’m not happy with Iran either. But I’m really unhappy if Israel’s going out this morning because of one rocket that didn’t land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn’t land. I’m not happy about that.’\n\nLater Tuesday, a leaked intelligence assessment claiming Donald Trump’s strikes on Iran did not destroy Tehran’s nuclear program was deemed ‘flat-out wrong’ by the White House.\n\nThe report, conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency and leaked by CNN, claims Saturday’s airstrike on three Iranian nuclear sites only set the country’s program back by months instead of completely destroying it.\n\nTrump claimed the strikes ‘completely and totally obliterated’, a statement echoed by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt who dismissed the assessment as a ‘clear attempt to demean President Trump’.\n\n‘Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration,’ Leavitt said. \n\nTrump faced calls for his impeachment on a sole charge of abuse of power over his launch of military strikes on Iran without first seeking authorization from Congress – but the House today overwhelmingly voted to block the resolution.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Rogan backed Republican Thomas Massie after the renegade congressman came out against President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Rogan Shares Strong Opinion on MAGA&#8217;s Internal Conflict Regarding Iran Bombing first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-rogan-shares-strong-opinion-on-magas-internal-conflict-regarding-iran-bombing/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joe-Rogan-gives-decisive-take-on-MAGA-civil-war-over.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:20:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":334874914,"title":"Fed's Schmid says there is time to study tariff effects before rate cuts - TradingView","text":"The U.S. Federal Reserve has time to study the effect of rising import tariffs on prices and economic growth before deciding on further interest rate cuts, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said on Tuesday.\n\n\"The current posture of monetary policy, which has been characterized as 'wait-and-see,' is appropriate,\" Schmid said in remarks prepared for delivery to an agricultural summit in Nebraska. \n\n\"The resilience of the economy gives us the time to observe how prices and the economy develop,\" before changing the benchmark policy rate, said Schmid, a voter this year on the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which next meets on July 29-30. \n\nThe Fed has held its benchmark rate steady in a range from 4.25% to 4.5% since December, despite calls from President Donald Trump for rate cuts. \n\nFed officials in recent projections anticipate two rate cuts by the end of the year, but have highlighted uncertainty around trade policy and in general expect to see slower growth, higher unemployment and higher inflation in coming months. \n\nInflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, and \"contacts almost uniformly expect increased tariffs to push up prices and to weigh on activity,\" Schmid said, adding it seemed \"likely\" the Fed's inflation and job goals \"will come into conflict.\"\n\nBut \"there is far less clarity on when and by how much,\" said Schmid, an argument for leaving interest rates unchanged until the economy's direction is clearer.","summary":"Fed's Schmid says there is time to study tariff effects before rate cuts  TradingView","url":"https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3SR13T:0-fed-s-schmid-says-there-is-time-to-study-tariff-effects-before-rate-cuts/","image":"https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:15:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.071},{"id":334874944,"title":"Los Angeles Area Politician Calls For Local Street Gangs To Fight ICE Agents","text":"It's no secret that politicians in California are the worst in the country. Pending the outcome of the New York City mayoral race, that is, and excepting the mayor of Chicago, of course. Since ICE started enforcing immigration laws in the Los Angeles area, those California politicians have been an abject disaster. To put it mildly. When protesting to stop the arrest and deportation of criminal illegal aliens in the LA area quickly turned to rioting, violence, looting and life-threatening attacks on law enforcement, they universally rushed to blame everyone else for their failures. Gavin Newsom, the state's Governor, has desperately attempted to distract from his tenure as one of the worst politicians in modern American history by using President Donald Trump as a boogeyman. Mayor Karen Bass, who presided over the destruction of two entire communities in the LA area just a few months ago, did the same, while also egging on rioters. And now there's another entry in the never-ending contest of \"which California politician wants to be the worst in the state,\" as there has essentially been a call for violence against federal law-enforcement. LA Area Vice Mayor Wants Dangerous Criminal Gangs To Attack ICE Bill Melugin from Fox News reported exclusively on Tuesday afternoon that the vice mayor of Cudahy, a small city just south of downtown Los Angeles, is now under an FBI investigation. Why? Because, per Melugin's reporting, she allegedly posted a video calling for members of the 18th Street and Florencia 13 gang members to fight ICE agents and defend street territory. After repeatedly criticizing the gangs for not joining in on protests and organizing against the \"biggest gang\" there is, Cynthia Gonzalez told leadership of those gangs to \"get your f***** members in order\" and \"help out.\" She also explained that once the raids are over, she doesn't want those same gangs to claim the neighborhood streets or block as their own, if they weren't willing to step up now. Pretty clear call to action! Gonzalez, after deleting the video, posted on Facebook asking for help getting a lawyer to defend her after the FBI went to her house. Matthew Seedorff, a reporter for Fox LA, reached out to the city of Cudahy for comment, and their response was, well, unsatisfactory. \"The City of Cudahy is aware of recent comments made by Vice Mayor Cynthia Gonzalez on social media,\" the statement said, per Seedorff. The comments made by the Vice Mayor reflect her personal views and do not represent the views or official position of the City of Cudahy. The City will not be providing further comment.\" That's simply unacceptable. Openly calling for gangs to attack federal agents doing their jobs and enforcing the law is not a \"personal view.\" That's a call to violence from a sitting politician, because she disagrees with United States law. Calls to violence are not protected First Amendment speech. It's not acceptable. In a stunning turn of events, Gonzalez has been handsomely rewarded and promoted around LA. Per Melugin, she was hired by UCLA as their \"Director of the Principal Leadership Institute.\" When doing so, they called her a leader in \"educational equity and social justice\". The LA Times promoted her as the \"best pick\" for school board of LA Unified School District. And they wonder why quality of life and standards in California continue to fall.","summary":"The vice mayor of the city of Cudahy in Los Angeles County called for members of two notorious gangs in the LA area to fight back against ICE raids.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/los-angeles-area-politician-wants-local-street-gangs-attack-ice-agents","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/06/sipa_62099548-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:14:36","author":"Ian Miller","authors":["Ian Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":334869032,"title":"January 6 Defendants Seek Recognition on Capitol Plaque","text":"Multiple Jan. 6 defendants are asking that the Jan. 6 honorary plaque — which was authorized by Congress to be created and installed in 2022 — also “recognize the experiences” of the over 1,500 defendants in the insurrection.\n\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges filed a lawsuit against Architect of the Capitol Thomas Austin earlier this month demanding the memorial plaque be installed — given that it has sat in storage since its creation in 2023.

The president’s action was celebrated by many who saw the investigations and prosecutions into the events of the day as political. To most of those who were horrified by what they witnessed and welcomed the investigations, the pardons were condemned.\n\nHouse Democrats have sought to pressure Speaker Mike Johnson and other leaders to install the plaque that celebrates the police officers who defended the Capitol and the lawmakers inside it that day. The motions to include a recognition of the defendants on the plaque are sure to add a new point of controversy to the debate.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nProtestors attempting to breach the main entrance of the Capitol in Washington,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: January 6 Defendants Seek Recognition on Capitol Plaque first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/january-6-defendants-seek-recognition-on-capitol-plaque/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jan-6-defendants-want-Capitol-plaque-to-recognize-them-too.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:12:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":334876040,"title":"Child Vaccine Coverage Faltering, Threatening Millions: Study","text":"Efforts to vaccinate children against deadly diseases are faltering across the world due to economic inequality, Covid-era disruptions and misinformation, putting millions of lives at risk, research warned Wednesday.These trends all increase the threat of future outbreaks of preventable diseases, the researchers said, while sweeping foreign aid cuts threaten previous progress in vaccinating the world's children.A new study published in The Lancet journal looked at childhood vaccination rates across 204 countries and territories.It was not all bad news. An immunisation programme by the World Health Organization was estimated to have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the last 50 years.And vaccination coverage against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio and tuberculosis doubled between 1980 and 2023, the international team of researchers found.However the gains slowed in the 2010s, when measles vaccinations decreased in around half of the countries, with the largest drop in Latin America. Meanwhile in more than half of all high-income countries there were declines in coverage for at least one vaccine dose.Then the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Routine vaccination services were hugely disrupted during lockdowns and other measures, resulting in nearly 13 million extra children who never received any vaccine dose between 2020 to 2023, the study said.This disparity endured, particularly in poorer countries. In 2023, more than half of the world's 15.7 million completely unvaccinated children lived in just eight countries, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the study.In the European Union, 10 times more measles cases were recorded last year compared to 2023.In the United States, a measles outbreak surged past 1,000 cases across 30 states last month, which is already more than were recorded in all of 2024.Cases of polio, long eradicated in many areas thanks to vaccination, have been rising in Pakistan and Afghanistan, while Papua New Guinea is currently enduring a polio outbreak.\"Routine childhood vaccinations are among the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions available,\" said senior study author Jonathan Mosser of the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).\"But persistent global inequalities, challenges from the Covid pandemic, and the growth of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy have all contributed to faltering immunisation progress,\" he said in a statement. In addition, there are \"rising numbers of displaced people and growing disparities due to armed conflict, political volatility, economic uncertainty, climate crises,\" added lead study author Emily Haeuser, also from the IHME.The researchers warned the setbacks could threaten the WHO's goal of having 90 percent of the world's children and adolescents receive essential vaccines by 2030.The WHO also aims to halve the number of children who have received no vaccine doses by 2030 compared to 2019 levels.Just 18 countries have achieved this so far, according to the study, which was funded by the Gates Foundation and the Gavi vaccine alliance.The global health community has also been reeling since President Donald Trump's administration drastically slashed US international aid earlier this year.\"For the first time in decades, the number of kids dying around the world will likely go up this year instead of down because of massive cuts to foreign aid,\" Bill Gates said in a separate statement on Tuesday.\"That is a tragedy,\" the Microsoft co-founder said, committing $1.6 billion to Gavi, which is holding a fund-raising summit in Brussels on Wednesday.","summary":"Efforts to vaccinate children against deadly diseases are faltering across the world due to economic inequality, Covid-era disruptions and misinformation, putting millions of lives at risk, research warned Wednesday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/child-vaccine-coverage-faltering-threatening-millions-study-3776747","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4607105/more-half-worlds-completely-unvaccinated-children-live-just-eight-countries-research-finds.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:12:17","author":"Daniel Lawler","authors":["Daniel Lawler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.152},{"id":334866798,"title":"Could Trump Get A Nobel Peace Prize?

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the most vocal hawks pushing for American intervention in Iran, told CNN on Tuesday: “if we can get Iran to change their behavior, then President Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize on steroids.”\n\nTrump clearly wants the prize—he’s mentioned it publicly dozens of times over the years, The New York Times noted, and he’s complained, as recently as last week, that he doesn’t think he will get it.\n\n“I should have gotten it four or five times . . . they won’t give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals,” he told reporters Friday (three of the four presidents to win the Nobel Peace Prize are Democrats).\n\nTrump, in arguing he should be awarded the prize, has cited several agreements between other countries he’s claimed to broker, including a deal to end the India-Pakistan crisis, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied Trump was involved in, and the Abraham Accords of 2020, a diplomatic agreement between Israel and several Arab states the U.S. helped negotiate during Trump’s first term.\n\nHe also noted in a Friday Truth Social post that his administration helped broker a peace treaty between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, writing “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do.”\n\nCarter is running for a Senate seat in Georgia, where an endorsement from Trump could improve his chances of beating his competitors.\n\nWho Else Has Nominated Trump For The Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nUkrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko nominated Trump last year, telling The Telegraph he believed it would compel Trump to broker a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, but Merezhko withdrew the nomination this week, accusing him of losing focus on the Russia-Ukraine war as his attention appears to shift to the Middle East.

Overnight on Monday, Trump announced a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran as fighting stretched into a 13th day, but it was unclear whether the two sides would stick to the agreement.

In FY 2023-24, bilateral trade reached USD 83.64 billion, marking a nearly 15 per cent year-on-year increase since the CEPA came into effect. India's non-oil exports to the UAE surged by over 20 per cent, while UAE foreign direct investment (FDI) into India tripled, rising from USD 1.03 billion in FY 2021-22 to USD 3.35 billion in FY 2022-23, making the UAE India's fourth-largest investor. These gains further reinforce the UAE's enduring commitment to championing India's dynamic start-up ecosystem.\nSince 2000, UAE-based investors have channelled an estimated USD 20 billion into the Indian economy, fueling innovation, accelerating growth, and cementing the UAE's position as a key strategic partner.\nBuilding on its efforts to deepen collaboration with India's innovation ecosystem, the launch event featured the signing of several Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between the UICC and prominent academic and entrepreneurial institutions, including PRIME Meghalaya under the Meghalaya Basin Management Agency (M.B.M.A.), IDEATE Lab @ O.P. Jindal Global University, and Jamia Hamdard.\nThe event concluded with a presentation by Ahmed Aljneibi, Director of the UICC, who unveiled the bold vision and strategic framework of the Start-up Series. He outlined how the initiative will culminate in a high-profile pitch event in New Delhi, where five exceptional start-ups will be selected to receive an exclusive UAE soft-landing package--including incubation support, business licensing, tailored mentorship, and direct access to leading investors, innovation hubs, and free zone networks across the Emirates.\nThe event drew over 100 participants from across the start-up, investment, policy, and media landscape.\nAttendees witnessed the unveiling of the official Start-up Series microsite and the premiere of a promotional trailer calling for applications from high-potential Indian ventures.

pregnancy in a joyous social media post on Tuesday, sharing her sonogram and announcing, “Baby Gaetz coming 2025.”\n\nGaetz, who was originally President Donald Trump‘s selection for attorney general before withdrawing from consideration ahead of the January inauguration, retweeted his wife’s post on X, where she also displayed her baby bump.\n\nThe ex-politician-turned-TV anchor, 43, and his spouse, 31, first met at a fundraising event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, in March 2020.\n\nGinger’s older brother is billionaire Palmer Luckey, the founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR.\n\nGaetz proposed to Ginger in December 2020, and the two tied the knot in a small ceremony on California’s Catalina Island in August 2021.\n\nGinger previously told the Daily Mail that her engagement to Gaetz “did not come as a surprise,” adding that she saw it coming.\n\nHOUSE COMMITTEE PROBE\n\nGaetz had to remove his name from consideration for attorney general last November because he was embroiled in a federal sex-trafficking investigation by the House Ethics Committee on Capitol Hill.\n\nGaetz, who at the time resigned his seat in the House of Representatives after being nominated by Trump, said his confirmation had “become a distraction” to the incoming administration.\n\nThe House investigation stemmed from Gaetz’s alleged involvement in drug-fueled sex parties with women between 2017 and 2020.\n\nGaetz was accused of engaging in sexual misconduct, drug use, misuse of state identification records, and misspending campaign funds for personal use, among other accusations.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee had been investigating the allegations made against Gaetz since 2021, but paused its probe as the Department of Justice opened its investigation.\n\nHowever, in February 2024, the Department of Justice declined to bring charges against Gaetz following a years-long investigation, citing an inability to make a strong enough case in court.\n\nOnce the Justice Department closed its case against Gaetz, the House Ethics Committee resumed its investigation.\n\nThe House panel interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and a lawyer for two women who testified before the committee.\n\n‘WEB OF PAYMENTS’\n\nAttorney Joel Leppard testified that Gaetz paid two of his clients in exchange for sex.\n\nOne of the women claimed she witnessed Gaetz and another of his associates having sex with a 17-year-old girl.\n\nBut the woman said she did not believe Gaetz thought the girl was under 18.\n\nThe woman, who was underage at the time, testified to the House Ethics Committee that she had two sexual encounters with Gaetz at a party in 2017.\n\nShe also testified about a second sexual encounter with Gaetz and another woman, which was not previously reported, according to CNN.\n\nThe other adult woman, who was allegedly involved in the sexual encounter, denied participation in the supposed act with Gaetz and the minor, the outlet reported.\n\nDuring its investigation into the former congressman, the Department of Justice constructed a payments chart that showed one of Leppard’s clients received over $4,000, and the other received $3,500 from Gaetz via Venmo.\n\nThe woman also received money from Gaetz on PayPal, Leppard testified at the time.\n\nJoel Greenberg, a former friend of Gaetz, cooperated with the Department of Justice during its investigation and told authorities about how he and the former politician had sex with the 17-year-old girl.\n\nHe also told federal investigators that he and Gaetz believed the woman was over 18.\n\nGreenberg pleaded guilty to sex-trafficking charges in 2021 and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\n\nGaetz has denied all the accusations against him, including that he had sex with a minor.\n\nHe has never been formally charged with any crime related to the House Ethics Investigation or Department of Justice probe.","summary":"Internewscast

cautious diplomacy in Iran's war with Israel","text":"When Israel attacked Iran nearly two weeks ago, the Chinese government, a longtime friend of Iran, jumped into action — at least, when it came to words. It condemned the attacks. Its leader, Xi Jinping, got on the phone with the Russian leader and urged a ceasefire. Its foreign minister spoke with his counterpart in Iran.\n\nBut that's where China stopped. The usual rhetoric was delivered. De-escalation and dialogue were trumpeted. Yet China offered no material support.\n\nDespite Beijing's clout as a near-peer rival to the United States and its ambition to play a bigger role on the world stage, Beijing refrained from offering military support to Iran, let alone getting directly involved in the conflict. The decision underscored the limitations it faces in the Middle East.\n\n“Beijing lacks both the diplomatic capabilities and the risk appetite to quickly intervene in, and to think it can successfully navigate, this fast-moving and volatile situation,\" said Jude Blanchette, director of the China Research Center at RAND. \n\nGiven the tangled politics of the Middle East, where China holds substantial economic and energy stakes yet wields minimal military influence, Beijing “isn’t inclined to stick its neck out,” Blanchette added. Instead, the Chinese government opts to remain “a measured, risk‑averse actor.”\n\n China weighs commercial interests \n\nZhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University in eastern China, said volatility in the Middle East is not in China's interests.\n\n“From China’s point of view, the Israel-Iran conflicts challenge and impact China’s business interests and economic security,” Zhu said. “This is something China absolutely does not want to see.\"\n\nAfter the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the strategically located Strait of Hormuz over the weekend, China spoke against it. “China calls on the international community to step up efforts to de-escalate conflicts and prevent regional turmoil from having a greater impact on global economic development,” said Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\nOn Tuesday, following the ceasefire announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post: “China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran,” suggesting the ceasefire would prevent the disruption of Iranian oil production.\n\nA 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration contained estimates suggesting that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy could struggle to preserve its industrial production without the roughly 1.2 million barrels of oil and other fossil fuels provided by Iran.\n\nCraig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, summed up Beijing's responses as “steady oil buys and ritual calls for ‘dialogue'.” \n\n“That’s about it,\" Singleton said. “No drones or missile parts, no emergency credit line. Just words calibrated to placate Tehran without rattling Riyadh or inviting U.S. sanctions.”\n\nBeijing's muted responses also expose the gap between China's great-power rhetoric and its real reach in the region. Said Singleton: “China’s Gulf footprint is commercial, not combat-ready. When missiles fly, its much-touted strategic partnership with Iran shrinks to statements. Beijing wants discounted Iranian oil and a ‘peace-broker’ headline, while letting Washington shoulder the hard-power risks.”\n\n In statements, China sides with Iran and pledges to mediate \n\nSince the onset of the war, Beijing — which brokered a diplomatic rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023 — stood by Iran's side and urged talks.\n\nAt the United Nations, China, a permanent member of the Security Council, teamed up with Russia and Pakistan in putting forward a draft resolution condemning “in the strongest terms” the attacks against peaceful nuclear sites and facilities in Iran. They called for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" even though the United States, another permanent member on the council, is almost certain to veto the proposal.\n\nShortly after Israel attacked Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, and told him that “China explicitly condemned Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.” Wang, using common diplomatic language, said China was “ready to maintain communication with Iran and other relevant parties to continue playing a constructive role in de-escalating the situation.\"\n\nWang later spoke with foreign ministers of Oman and Egypt; both nations are key mediators in the region. And late last week, before the U.S. got involved militarily, Xi spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin; the two agreed to stay in closer contact over Iran and work toward de-escalation. But China stayed away from any direct involvement, and Russia also had muted responses to the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nIran is an important link in Xi's ambitious global project Belt and Road Initiative, and in 2023 joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a security group by Russia and China to counter the U.S.-led NATO. It has conducted joint exercises with China, including this year's “Maritime Security Belt 2025” in the Gulf of Oman, in which Russia also took part. On Wednesday, Beijing will convene a meeting of defense ministers of SCO member nations.\n\nAs important as Iran is to China, it is only part of Beijing's calculus, according to an analysis by the Soufan Center, a New York-based organization that focuses on global security challenges.\n\nIn an intel brief, the center said the conflict has revealed that Beijing's support for its partners, especially those in confrontation with the United States, “is limited by a complex matrix of interests, including its desire to avoid alienating major economic partners and escalating tensions with the West.\"\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and writers Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"A longtime friend of Tehran, Beijing jumped into verbal action when Israel attacked Iran nearly two weeks ago","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/iran-beijing-united-states-chinese-middle-east-b2776358.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/07/China_Military_Parade_00526.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:02:04","author":"Didi Tang","authors":["Didi Tang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":334876246,"title":"‘Low-Level Loser’ Leaks That US Strikes on Iran Did Not Destroy Their Targets","text":"Two US intelligence officials briefed on the result of strikes on Iran’s Fordow uranium-enrichment facility and the Natanz Enrichment Complex did not eliminate Iran’s threat of building a nuclear weapon, but rather set the project back “by months”.\n\n“The analysis of the damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear ambitions is ongoing, and could change as more intelligence becomes available. But the early findings are at odds with President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that the strikes ‘completely and totally obliterated’ Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also said on Sunday that Iran’s nuclear ambitions ‘have been obliterated,’ CNN wrote in its exclusive report.\n\nOn Monday, following the strikes by B2 stealth aircraft dropping bunker-busing bombs on he facility, Trump signaled a ceasefire between Israel and Iran beginning at midnight Tuesday morning, even as both sides continued to shell each other’s territories with missiles.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday bristled at CNN’s report, insulting the officials who leaked the assessment by the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, and called it “flat-out wrong.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement: “This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as ‘top secret’ but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community. The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear program. Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.”\n\nThose strikes “set them back maybe a few months, tops,” one of the sources told CNN.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies told CNN he agreed with the assessment that the attacks do not appear to have ended Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“The ceasefire came without either Israel or the United States being able to destroy several key underground nuclear facilities, including near Natanz, Isfahan and Parchin,” Lewis said, referring to separate nuclear complexes near Tehran.\n\n“These facilities could serve as the basis for the rapid reconstitution of Iran’s nuclear program,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a classified briefing for the House of Representatives on the outcome of the strikes slated for Tuesday suspiciously had been canceled, while a similar Senate briefing was rescheduled for Thursday.","summary":"Two intelligence officials briefed on assessment of strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities said the stockpiles of enriched uranium were not destroyed.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/55121","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/06/22/9a345fc35b952d2d46f3590f92acb244.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-25 00:00:48","author":"John Moretti","authors":["John Moretti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":334870260,"title":"Walmart seeks fair play in global game, says CEO","text":"TOI.inWalmart CEO Doug McMillon\n\nWalmart Inc president and chief executive officer Doug McMillon said the US-based retail giant would like to have a level playing field and consistency in policy wherever it has a presence, adding that the current tariff turmoil is something that it can navigate better than any other company.“We operate in a lot of countries and that is what we ask for everywhere (a level playing field), and that’s consistent,” McMillon said, when asked about India.“We engage with lots of different governments and, in those conversations, we share with them what we think should be changed to enable us to better serve customers. But we don’t set the rules, and we will be compliant with the rules, whatever those are.”We like to buy locally, create jobsThe Donald Trump administration intends to press India to give online retailers such as Amazon and Walmart full access to its $125 billion ecommerce market, the Financial Times reported in April.Live EventsBoth countries are in negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) that they are trying to finalise by next month.McMillon, 58, said Walmart is not involved in trade talks as those are held between governments.India doesn’t allow ecommerce firms such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to hold stocks or sell directly to consumers. Locally owned companies such as the units of Reliance Retail and the Tata Group don’t face such curbs.“The more things can be clear and transparent, the better it is from a business point of view,” McMillon said. “Businesses like consistency and predictability, whether it’s in this country or around the world.”Asked how soon it would like to have a model that allows Flipkart to hold inventory in India, McMillon said the company wants to be able to serve customers as well as possible.“We carry inventory in our businesses around the world. It’s a challenge to do that well—we like doing it,” he said.“It’s one area that we have expertise in. And if the rules allowed it, we would be happy about that, but we will leave the choice of what the rules are to someone else.”Walmart will be able to manage the tariff situation, thanks to its sourcing capabilities, he added.“There was a group of tariffs that were put in place back in 2018—we have been dealing with those,” McMillon said, referring to levies imposed by the previous Trump administration.“Walmart can manage that situation better than anyone. We have a lot of creative and experienced merchants who can make different choices. Over the years, we have worked on where merchandise comes from.We like to buy locally. We like the benefits of creating jobs for customers by buying locally. We like the benefits of a shorter lead time. That’s easier with food and consumables than it is with general merchandise.”Keeping a lid on the cost of living is a priority.“We want to see low prices,” McMillon said.“The purpose of our company is to help people save money and live better—low prices are in our DNA. We want to do everything we can, whether it’s our own actions or the actions of others to try and create the best possible value for customers.We are bothered by that (tariff situation), I am just saying that we will manage it as well as anyone, and we’ll make sure that we have a price gap relative to our competitors so that customers find value with us in every country where we operate.”Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027.“It’s encouraging to see what’s happening here,” McMillon said.“We are seeing the breadth of categories expand. When we initially set that goal, we had a smaller number of categories involved, but that's expanded.”The company will continue to source from India and China.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onUS retail giantecommerce marketlocal sourcingDoug McMillonbilateral trade agreementWalmart IncFlipkartIndia market\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Since the Dobbs decision, 13 states have outlawed abortions in virtually all circumstances, creating a patchwork of abortion access across the country, and balkanized legal constraints for patients and providers, who are shielded in some states and criminalized in others.\n\nThe total number of abortions each year has also steadily increased in the wake of that decision.\n\nIn 2024, 1.14 million abortions occurred in the United States, according to the Society for Family Planning.\n\nRoughly one in four abortions were performed through telehealth last year, with an average of 12,330 abortions per month performed through medication abortion, which typically requires a two-drug protocol that a patient can take at home.\n\nThat’s up from one in five in 2023 and one in every 20 in 2022.\n\nMedication abortion has accounted for the vast majority of abortions in recent years. Roughly 63 percent of all abortions are now medication abortions, according to Guttmacher.\n\nMifepristone, one of two prescription drugs used in medication abortions, is approved for use by the FDA up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. From 2019 through 2020, nearly 93 percent of all abortions were performed before the 13th week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut the drug is at the center of legal challenges fueled by right-wing anti-abortion activist groups who have sought to strip the government's approval and implement sweeping federal bans on abortion care.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has also pledged to revisit the drug’s approval, using spurious reporting and junk science, in an apparent attempt to undermine the basis for the government’s approval.\n\nNearly half of patients who traveled for an abortion last year came from states where abortion is outlawed — including more than 28,000 Texas residents, more than any other state, Guttmacher found.\n\n“While these findings show us where and how far patients are traveling, they are not able to capture the numerous financial, logistical, social and emotional obstacles people face,” according to Guttmacher Institute data scientist and study lead Isaac Maddow-Zimet.\n\nIn the months after the Dobbs decision, sweeping anti-abortion restrictions across the deep South and neighboring states have effectively forced abortion patients to travel hundreds of miles to reach the nearest state where abortion access was legal.\n\nFlorida, surrounded by anti-abortion states, was initially a key point of abortion access in the South within the first two years after the Dobbs decision. In 2023, more than 9,000 people traveled from other states to get an abortion there, according to Guttmacher. Roughly one in every two abortions nationwide and one in three abortions in the South were performed in Florida at that time.\n\nLast year, Florida banned abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are even pregnant, and the number of patients traveling to the state for abortion care was virtually cut in half.\n\nAnother 8,000 people left the state to get an abortion elsewhere, often crossing as many as three states to get there, Guttmacher found.\n\n“It was not just Floridians who were impacted, but also the thousands of out-of-state patients who would have traveled there for care,” according to Candace Gibson, Guttmacher Institute Director of State Policy.\n\n“The most extreme abortion bans are concentrated in the South, which makes it disproportionately difficult for people living in that region to exercise their fundamental right to bodily autonomy,” she added.","summary":"More than 325,000 abortion patients were forced to leave their home state for legal care in the years after the decision","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/abortion-legal-travel-dobbs-anniversary-b2776346.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/22/53/GettyImages-2208139114.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UOtEfJja-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:59:09","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":334869752,"title":"Trump wants GOP to cancel holiday recess until passing the budget bill","text":"June 24 (UPI) -- Complications with the so-called \"one big, beautiful\" fiscal year 2026 budget bill might keep lawmakers at the Capitol until passing it instead of recessing for Independence Day.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had announced a July 4th deadline for the budget bill, but Congress is slated for a week-long recess next week, which caused Trump to call on senators to stay at the capital until passing the budget bill.\n\n\"To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, [but] don't go home,\" Trump said Tuesday morning in a Truth Social post, as reported by Roll Call.\n\n\"Get the deal done this week,\" Trump said. \"Work with the House so they can pass it immediately.

And Republicans in Congress are staying put to get it done.\n\nThe Senate is gearing up for weekend work, while House Speaker Mike Johnson told lawmakers Tuesday to keep their schedules “flexible” as they prepare for more votes.\n\n“We are making good headway,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. He expects the Senate will get this “past the finish line” by the end of the week, sending it back to the House for swift action.\n\nBut Republicans who have majority control of the House and Senate are finding that their push to move fast and change things — namely cuts to federal government programs including Medicaid and SNAP food stamps used by millions of Americans — is easier said than done.\n\nNot all GOP lawmakers are on board, and the Senate parliamentarian has advised that several key proposals violate procedural rules. With Democrats flatly opposed, it’s all leaving GOP leaders scrambling days before final votes.\n\nHere’s the latest on what’s in, out and still up for debate as lawmakers work to finish the massive 1,000-page plus package.\n\nWhat’s the goal of the big bill? Tax cuts.\n\nThe top priority for Republicans is preventing what they warn would be a massive tax hike, some $3.8 trillion, after December when the tax breaks they put in place during Trump’s first term, in 2017, expire.\n\nThe big bill seeks to make existing tax rates and brackets permanent, while also temporarily adding new ones Trump campaigned on — no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for seniors who earn no more than $75,000 a year.\n\nThe wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase, while the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nMiddle income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, CBO said.\n\nOne provision for families would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal or $2,500 in the House. But families at lower income levels won’t see the full amount, if any.\n\nAnd one unresolved issue is the House’s proposed $40,000 cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, that GOP senators say is too high and want limited.\n\nThe bill also funds deportations, a border wall and Trump’s heroes garden\n\nThere’s also some $350 billion of new funding in the package for Trump’s border and national security agenda.\n\nTrump promises the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, and the package proposes money to hire 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses, and for 100,000 immigration detention beds with a goal of deporting some 1 million people a year.\n\nAdditionally, the House bill proposes $12 billion for the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The Senate package also provides the attorney general with $3.5 billion to create a similar state fund — called Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or Biden, referring to the former president.\n\nImmigrants entering the U.S. would face stiff new fees, including $1,000 for those seeking asylum protections.\n\nThere’s also money for the development of Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense system over the U.S., and quality of life measures for servicemen and women.\n\nAnd there are extras: One provision from the Senate would provide $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”\n\nHow to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and green energy programs\n\nTo help partly offset the lost tax revenue, Republicans are seeking to cut back some long-running government programs — Medicaid, food stamps and green energy incentives — basically unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents: Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nRepublicans argue they are trying to right-size the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve — mainly pregnant women and children — and root out waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nThe package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children older than 10 would have to work to qualify for food aid, and those with teens would have to comply with the work requirement for Medicaid.\n\n“It’s wildly popular,” Johnson said Tuesday, noting people can work, volunteer or go to school or job training programs. “For heaven’s sake, do something constructive.”\n\nSome 80 million Americans rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, and most already work, according to analysts.\n\nAll told, the CBO estimates at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage, and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.\n\nDeeper SNAP cuts that would shift cost-sharing to the states were called into question by the Senate parliamentarian and undergoing revisions. And more Medicaid changes are up for debate — including a Senate plan to reduce the so-called provider tax that most states impose on hospitals and other entities.\n\nKey GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warn that lower Medicaid provider tax cuts will hurt rural hospitals. “We cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage,” said 16 House GOP lawmakers in a letter to leadership.\n\nSenators are considering the creation of a new rural hospital fund, but the plan remains a work in progress. They’ve also had objections to the House’s proposed new $35 co-pay on Medicaid services.\n\nBoth the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles and also the production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.\n\nAll told, the cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs are expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.\n\nWhat’s the final cost?\n\nAltogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. The Senate draft is slightly higher.\n\nThe spending cuts tally at least $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe CBO estimates the package from the House would add $2.4 trillion to the nation’s deficits over the decade.\n\nOr not, depending on how one does the math.\n\nSenate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost, because they’re already “current policy.” They argue the Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for its preferred approach.\n\nUnder the Senate GOP view, the cost of tax provisions would be $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nDemocrats and others argue this is “magic math” that obscures the costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.\n\n“Current policy baseline’ is a budget gimmick,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. “This bill will add trillions upon trillions of dollars to the national debt to fund tax breaks for billionaires.”\n\nTrump, en route to Europe for a NATO meeting, told senators to lock themselves in a room if needed, and “GET THE BILL DONE.”\n\nAssociated Press writesr Darlene Superville and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.","summary":"House Speaker Mike Johnson told lawmakers to keep their schedules “flexible.”","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/24/congress-tax-cuts-4th-july-deadline/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_45191-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:58:02","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":334872320,"title":"How Trump’s citizenship policy affects Nigeria (1)","text":"INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the shimmering glow of the American Dream, the notion of birthright citizenship was like a golden key, unlocking doors to freedom, opportunity and a future brimming with possibilities. For Africans who crossed the oceans hoping to carve out a better life, that key was often the very reason they believed their children’s futures could be shaped in the Land of Liberty. But then came President Donald Trump’s executive order—a chilling gust of wind that threatened to snap that golden key in half. The dream, once untainted by doubt, suddenly became a mirage, casting shadows on the hopes of those who had put everything on the line to come to the United States. Children born on American soil could find themselves caught in the crossfire of an immigration war they had no part in.\n\nAn overview of the executive order\n\nTrump’s Executive Order, titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” is aimed at ending birthright citizenship for certain children born in the United States. This order obviously seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children born on U.S. soil whose parents are neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents, including those who are undocumented or in the country on temporary visas. This order contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States of America, which was ratified in 1869. It provides that:\n\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”\n\nThe constitutionality of President Trump’s order has since become the subject of many suits across America. Several Federal District Courts issued orders blocking enforcement of Trump’s Executive Order. They held that citizenship by birth is an unequivocal constitutional right and “one of the principles that makes the United States the great nation it is. The president cannot change, limit or qualify this constitutional right via Executive Orders.” The Supreme Court will on May 15, 2025, hear arguments on Trump’s claim that there is no automatic guarantee to birth-right citizenship. Is Trump’s policy constitutional? Can he use an Executive Order to override the Constitution birthed since 1878? \n\nThe adverse effects of American citizenship on Nigerians and other Africans\n\nLegal and constitutional challenges\n\nUnited States nationality law outlines the criteria under which an individual acquires U.S. nationality. In the U.S., nationality is generally obtained through provisions in the Constitution, various laws, and international treaties. Citizenship, however, is established as a right by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, not as a privilege, for individuals born within U.S. territory or its jurisdiction, as well as those who have been “naturalized.” Although the terms “citizen” and “national” are sometimes used interchangeably, “national” is a broader legal term, meaning a person can be a national without being a citizen. Citizenship, on the other hand, refers specifically to nationals who hold the status of being a citizen (Wikipedia ‘United States Nationality Law’ accessed on the 31st Jan 2025).\n\nThe move to end birthright citizenship has sparked significant legal debates. Many Nigerians in the diaspora argue that such executive orders conflict with the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born on American soil. The contention is that an executive order alone is insufficient to amend this constitutional provision, leading to prolonged legal battles and uncertainty for affected families. \n\nThere is no denying that the executive order indeed is blatantly unconstitutional as stated by a Federal District Court judge in Seattle, John C. Coughenour, who issued a temporary restraining order halting the U.S. president’s plan. This policy, if upheld, could also increase undocumented populations, as children of noncitizens would have no legal status. Even Nigerian parents residing legally in the U.S. A few weeks ago, three U.S. citizens, one with cancer, were deported to Honduras alongside their mothers for being in the U.S. illegally, but not yet citizens. Others could face uncertainties regarding their U.S.-born children’s citizenship status. \n\nThis policy could deter Africans from migrating to the U.S., fearing instability in their children’s citizenship status. If upheld, the order could set a precedent affecting birthright citizenship interpretations in other countries, potentially influencing global migration patterns. \n\nThe president’s order, one of several issued in the opening hours of his presidency to curtail immigration, legal and illegal, declared that children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants after February 19, 2025, would no longer be treated as citizens. The order would also extend to babies born to mothers who are in the country legally but temporarily, such as tourists, university students or temporary workers, if the father is a noncitizen.\n\nIn response, 22 states, along with activist groups and expectant mothers, filed six lawsuits to block the executive order, arguing that it violates the 14th Amendment. Legal precedent has long interpreted the amendment — which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States” — as applying to every baby born in the U.S., with a few narrow exceptions: children of accredited foreign diplomats, children born to noncitizens in U.S. territories occupied by an invading army, and, at one point, children born to Native Americans on reservations. \n\nJudge Coughenour’s ruling marks the start of what is likely to be a prolonged legal battle between the new administration and the courts over President Trump’s ambitious second-term agenda, which aims to overhaul American institutions in ways that could be seen as violating legal precedents. Other executive orders, including efforts to remove job protections for career federal employees and speed up deportations, are also facing legal challenges.\n\nJudge Coughenour’s decision was pointed: “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades,” he said. “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order. Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?” After the hearing in Seattle, Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown called the executive order “un-American,” though he cautioned that the battle is far from over.\n\nIn a status conference about the Maryland case, Joseph W. Mead, an attorney from Georgetown Law School’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, who represents four pregnant mothers and two nonprofit groups, argued that the courts should act quickly so the mothers can know the legal status of their future children. “Mothers today now have to fear that their children will not be granted the U.S. citizenship they’re entitled to,” he said (Mike Baker, Mattathias Schwartz ‘Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump’s Plan to End Birthright Citizenship’ accessed on the 31 Jan 2025.).\n\nAnother concern is the economic reality that many African immigrants face, even after obtaining American citizenship. While the U.S. is often seen as a land of opportunities, many Africans find it difficult to break into the job market due to systemic racism, credential disparities and the challenges of navigating the American labour market. Even with citizenship, the discrimination and biases that many African immigrants face often limit career growth and financial stability. For many, the promise of economic prosperity remains unfulfilled.\n\nSocio-economic implications\n\nIn addition to the legal and psychological implications, Trump’s executive orders also had socio-economic consequences for African families. Many African immigrants who went to the U.S. to provide a better life for their children now faced heightened financial and emotional strains due to uncertainty surrounding their children’s citizenship status. In many cases, parents who had worked tirelessly to support their families were left to navigate a legal landscape that made it harder for them to secure stable futures for their children. This uncertainty extended to the children themselves, who, in some cases, had to grapple with a feeling of displacement and alienation in a country where they had been born but could not always be guaranteed full protection under the law. Discrimination reigns supreme.\n\nWhile the U.S. has long served as a magnet for African professionals—particularly from Nigeria, where education and employment opportunities are often limited—Trump’s executive order raised a more urgent concern: the future of the African brain trust. The order not only created a hostile environment for those hoping to secure a better life for their families but also led many to question whether the long-term impact would be a “brain drain” of a different kind. Would Nigerians (and Africans), disillusioned by an unwelcoming America, begin to reconsider their plans for raising a family on American soil and return home instead?\n\nThere is also systematic discrimination in employment and society. Despite being among the most educated immigrant groups in the United States, Nigerian and other African immigrants often encounter systemic challenges. A study published in the Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics found that Nigerian immigrants experience both racial and workplace discrimination, which negatively impacts their overall satisfaction with life in the United States Esther Jack-Vickers).\n\nSuspension of foreign assistance programmemes\n\nTrump complained about international agreements and initiatives “that do not reflect our country’s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives”, saying they “steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people”.\n\nTrump’s executive order freezes disbursement of all US foreign development assistance for 90 days pending a review of “programmematic efficiencies” and ensuring that disbursements are “aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States”, arguing “foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values”.\n\nUnder the executive order, all department and agency heads with responsibility for the US foreign development assistance programmemes shall immediately pause new obligations and disbursement of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organisations, international organisations and contractors. (To be continued).\n\nThought for the week\n\n“The criteria for serving one’s country should be competence, courage and willingness to serve. When we deny people the chance to serve because of their sexual orientation, we deprive them of their rights of citizenship, and we deprive our armed forces the service of willing and capable Americans”. -Dianne Feinstein","summary":"INTRODUCTION In the shimmering glow of the American Dream, the notion of birthright citizenship was like a golden key, unlocking doors to freedom, opportunity and a future brimming with possibilities.

Clearly we’ve got commitments in our manifesto about not making tax rises on working people and we will stick to our manifesto commitments.”\n\nAs Iran and Israel traded further strikes overnight, Sir Keir warned that Britain is facing “volatile times, probably more volatile than most of us have lived through recently”.\n\n“We have entered a new era for defence and security. And the first duty of prime minister is to keep the country safe, and that sits above all other duties, and I take it really seriously.”\n\nAmid a growing rebellion over the government’s controversial plan to slash the welfare bill by cutting disability benefits, the prime minister also denied that money for defence spending is coming from welfare receipts.\n\n“The commitment we've made on defence to go to 2.5 by 2027-28, it's absolutely clear that we've set out where the money comes from, and it's not coming from welfare. It's coming from the overseas development aid.\n\n“So it's a misdescription to suggest that defence spending commitment we've made is at the expense of money on welfare, and obviously on the welfare front, we're making huge commitment to the money we're putting in to get people back to work.”\n\nMr Johnson warned that the defence spending increase would need to be funded by “£30 or £40bn more taxes”.\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio about the increase, he said: “Where that's going to come from, goodness only knows. Well, I think we do know it's going to come from; £30 or £40bn more taxes, because in the end there's nowhere else it can come from.\n\n“I can't really see this government cutting spending on pensions or the health service or welfare or what have you by that amount. I mean they can't.”\n\nThe prime minister’s remarks on the flight to The Hague also saw him insist that Donald Trump is still a “close ally” – just minutes before the US president declined to commit to Nato's Article 5, which requires members to defend each other from attack.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr Trump launched strikes on Iran, despite Sir Keir saying he has \"no doubt\" the prime minister supports his goal of de-escalation.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, the PM said that while de-escalation was his priority, he had also been preparing to take \"necessary measures should there be American action taken\".\n\nAsked by The Independent whether the US president is still a reliable enough partner for British lives to be put on the line alongside the US, Sir Keir said: \"We’re a close ally, we work together.\n\n\"As you’ll have seen on Tuesday as I immediately landed back from Canada from the G7 we went straight into a Cobra in Downing Street because we obviously had the G7 statement on the Monday after the session over dinner which was clear about de-escalation.\n\n\"I obviously wanted to take necessary measures should there be American action taken. So where we had the G7 statement my first step on getting back was to cover all eventualities – including the eventuality of a US attack.\n\n\"We had then been talking to the US all of last week into the attack on Saturday.

You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends, you know, I’ve become friends with many of those leaders, and I’m committed to helping them,” the US president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-leaves-door-open-tax-132412187.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/97f5562445f1b5ed583f1997dfc62e5f","video":"","publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:48:23","author":"Millie Cooke","authors":["Millie Cooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":334871488,"title":"Trump publicizes fawning private letter from NATO chief","text":"US President Donald Trump has posted screenshots of a private text message from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, in which he showered the American leader with praise for “decisive action in Iran.” \n\nThe message, which Trump shared on his Truth Social platform, appears to have been sent ahead of the two-day NATO summit in The Hague, which opened on Tuesday. \n\n“Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, that was truly extraordinary, and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer,” Rutte wrote, seemingly referring to US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 22. \n\nIn his message, Rutte also promised “another big success” for Trump in The Hague, saying that all NATO members had agreed to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done,” he wrote. \n\nA NATO spokesperson has confirmed to the BBC that the text is authentic.\n\nTrump has long insisted that NATO members in Europe should significantly increase their military budgets, which many pledged to do in recent years, citing the Russian-Ukraine conflict. \n\nSpain has reportedly decided to opt out of the 5% spending target, after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez rejected the idea as “not only unreasonable but also counterproductive.” Madrid is currently below the existing 2% spending threshold, with only about 1.3% of its GDP allocated for the military.\n\nRutte, however, told journalists on Monday that NATO rules don’t allow such exemptions.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has shared a glowing letter from NATO chief Mark Rutte \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/620453-trump-nato-chief-gushing-praise/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.06/article/685b151085f5407bf94a06fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:46:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.257},{"id":334866044,"title":"Dolly Parton, 79, announces major career news almost 10 years after quitting touring","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jun 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite House furious at top secret leak on Iran nuclear site bombing as Trump faces impeachment calls: Live updates\n\nRevealed: Brit who 'married nine-year-old at Disneyland Paris' is convicted paedophile who paid for children to worship him at fake West End premiere, masterminded scam funeral with young actors and detonated explosion while naked opposite the O2\n\nBritain is buying 12 fighter jets that can drop nuclear bombs, Sir Keir Starmer will announce\n\nThis is the shocking next move desperate Donald Trump will take if the ceasefire between Israel and Iran fails - and why it will be the most astonishing twist of this conflict yet: MARK ALMOND\n\nSARAH VINE: This tacky modern breed of super-rich have no respect for anyone... but this is the vile reason why Venice is the perfect setting for the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez\n\nI was a healthy father-of-four until I had the Pfizer Covid vaccine - what happened next destroyed me and I've spent £100k looking for a cure\n\nEmbarrassing no-show to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's Venice wedding is revealed by blundering aide... whose careless ways have also given away ceremony details and guest list\n\nPrince Archie and Princess Lilibet will 'have no role' when William becomes King - despite Harry's intention with their HRH titles\n\nAMANDA PLATELL: Shameless secret I think is behind Beckhams' feud with Nicola Peltz.

Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's campaign has gained significant traction in the New York City mayoral race. The Democratic primary election is on Tuesday, but results are not expected tonight due to the city's ranked choice voting system complicating the balloting and vote counting. Currently a New York state assemblyman, Mamdani has gained some recognition through endorsements from big-name figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. However, he has also gained notoriety in his own right due to a platform chock-full of free services that he has promised New York residents. Mamdani has said he will fund his promised services by raising an extra $10 billion in city revenue by raising taxes on corporations and the top 1% wealthiest New Yorkers. DEM MAYORAL CANDIDATE IN MAJOR AMERICAN CITY LINKED TO RABID ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVISM: REPORT A look through Mamdani’s platform, available on his campaign website, lives up to his socialist affiliation and Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's endorsements. He has promised to immediately freeze rent prices for more than 2 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments, implement free public transit, create a network of city-owned grocery stores that are \"focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit\" and institute free universal childcare for children from ages 6 weeks to 5 years. He has also promised to create a New York City Department of Community Safety that he says will deploy outreach workers in 100 subway stations, expand gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to \"hate violence prevention programs\" by 800%. Mamdani has also pledged to champion a law to raise the minimum wage in New York City to $30 an hour by 2030. COLBERT GRILLS DEM SOCIALIST NYC MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI ON ISRAEL, ANTISEMITISM Another major tenet of Mamdani’s platform is \"Trump-proofing\" New York City. His website states that President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement, tariffs and other policies are \"tearing at the fabric of New York City.\" Mamdani’s website states that he will strengthen the city’s sanctuary city apparatus by kicking ICE out of all city facilities and ending any cooperation with the agency as well as increasing legal support for immigrants and shielding their personal data. His website further states that, as mayor, Mamdani will make New York City an LGBTQ+ sanctuary city and protect \"reproductive rights.\" So, what does the bill look like for all this? According to reporting by Politico this week, Mamdani’s campaign estimates that providing universal childcare would cost between $5 and $7 billion, his Department of Community Safety would cost up to $450 million in new spending, and the city-run food stores cost another $60 million. SANDERS ENDORSES SOCIALIST MAMDANI IN MOVE TO BLOCK CUOMO IN NYC MAYORAL RACE Mamdani is further proposing tripling the city’s $30 billion budget to carry out his housing agenda. Meanwhile, the free buses are projected to cost the MTA roughly $900 million a year in annual revenue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Where will the extra money come from? Mamdani’s website says that he plans to raise the corporate tax rate to 11.5%, which he says will bring in an extra $5 billion. He plans to further set a flat 2% tax on those earning above $1 million annually, which he believes will bring in an extra $4 billion a year in taxes. He has also said he will hire more tax auditors, end no-bid contracts and crack down on fine collection from \"corrupt landlords\" to raise an additional $1 billion. Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","summary":"Pledging a slate of free programs and services, Democratic primary candidate Zohran Mamdani has propelled himself to be among the top candidates for New York City mayor.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-backed-mayoral-candidate-planning-massive-spending-increases-nyc","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/3d1fa08b-aoc-mamdani-sanders.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:43:50","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":334867214,"title":"World leaders gather to discuss defence amid Israel-Iran tensions","text":"Tensions between Israel and Iran could dominate discussions among world leaders at the Nato summit amid a fragile ceasefire.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is among those in The Hague for a gathering of the alliance, having called on the Middle Eastern nations to maintain the pause in hostilities.\n\nIn a conversation with the French and German leaders at the summit on Tuesday, Sir Keir “reflected on the volatile situation in the Middle East,” according to a Downing Street spokeswoman.\n\nThe leaders agreed that “now was the time for diplomacy and for Iran to come to the negotiating table”, the spokeswoman added.\n\nIt comes as intelligence reports in the US suggested that the American attack on Iran’s nuclear programme over the weekend have only set it back by a few months, rather than destroyed it as Donald Trump previously suggested.\n\nThe White House pushed back on the reports on Tuesday evening, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying it was “flat out wrong”.\n\n“The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said in a statement.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday Sir Keir had said that the US had helped in “alleviating” the threat of nuclear capability for Iran with their strikes on Saturday.\n\nAsked on his visit to The Hague whether he personally felt safe with Mr Trump in the White House and why others should, the Prime Minister told Channel 5 News: “Look, I think what we’ve seen over the last few days is the Americans alleviating a threat to nuclear weaponry by the Iranians and bringing about a ceasefire in the early hours of today.\n\n“I think now what needs to happen is that ceasefire needs to be maintained, and that will be the focus of our attention, our engagement, our discussions, because that ceasefire provides the space for the negotiations that need to take place.”\n\nAfter the ceasefire was initially struck early on Tuesday, Israel claimed Iran had violated the deal by carrying out strikes after it came into force.\n\nMr Trump called for Israel to withdraw its warplanes, and claimed both it and Iran “don’t know what the f*** they’re doing” as he departed for the summit in the Netherlands.\n\nThe UK has continued to evacuate Britons out of Israel, and a second flight left Tel Aviv on Tuesday.\n\nThe Foreign Office confirmed the plane had left Israel and said further flights would be considered depending on demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have said that MPs should be given a vote in the event of any future deployment of troops.\n\nThe party’s foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said: “With the Middle East in the throes of an all-out regional war, we are reckoning once again with the prospect of the UK becoming embroiled in foreign conflict.\n\n“No one knows the fragility of peace in that region, or the price paid for our safety, better than our British troops. It’s critical that, if they are asked to put their lives on the line for the UK in active conflict zones, this decision is subject to the strongest democratic scrutiny our country can offer.”","summary":"The UK has continued to evacuate Britons out of Israel, and a second flight left Tel Aviv on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/iran-keir-starmer-donald-trump-israel-white-house-b1234728.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/06/25/00/360fb1e347d9c30dbcbe7731c1f5ede6Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzUwODkyNzgw-2.80780395.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:42:57","author":"Pa Political Staff","authors":["Pa Political Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":334866462,"title":"Julie Chrisley Recalls 'Busting Out Crying' After Learning About Her Pardon from Savannah: 'I'm Getting Out of Here'","text":"Julie Chrisley is speaking out for the first time exactly one month after returning home.\n\n The Chrisley Knows Best matriarch, 52, made her first public remarks since her release from prison in a preview for a June 28 interview on FOX News Channel's My View with Lara Trump. In the short clip, Julie shared her reaction to learning that President Donald Trump granted her and her husband Todd Chrisley full pardons, relieving them of the serving the remainder of their 2022 sentence for bank fraud and tax evasion.\n\n \"I called Savannah one more time, and she said, 'He did it, he signed it,'\" Julie recalled of the moment her 27-year-old daughter delivered the news. \"And I just started busting out crying. And everyone was looking around, and then I just hung up. I was so nervous, I just hung up.\"\n\n Seated beside her were Todd, 56, Savannah and son Grayson, 19, who smiled as they listened to her tell the story to host Lara Trump, who is also President Trump's daughter-in-law.\n\n \"It was the craziest thing, and everybody was just looking at me, because unfortunately, most of the news that you get in prison is bad news,\" Julie continued. \"So they're like, 'Are you okay?' I'm like, 'I am. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting out of here!'\"\n\n Todd also reflected on how he got word of his release: \"This guy stops me and goes, 'Man, I think you just got pardoned.' And I said, 'Yeah, okay.' And I just kept on walking. So when I went into my dorm, one of the guys, the COs, he came by and he goes, 'Are you good?' And I said, 'As good as I can be.' And he said, 'Todd, you just got pardoned. They sent me down here to make sure you're okay.'\"\n\n \"I said, 'Well, they don't need to be worrying about me now. Hell, if I'm pardoned, I'm great,'\" he jokes, going on to thank God, who he believes \"touched President Trump's heart.\"\n\n \"God led the people to advocate for us,\" Todd concluded. \"And so I'm grateful because every night I would pray that God would return me home to my wife and my children. And he did that, so I'm grateful.\n\n The official Instagram page for the show also posted a series of behind the scenes images and a video from the day they recorded the segment. The first photo saw Lara join the family as they smile for a group photo, while the video captured the moment the host kicking off the interview.\n\n Todd made his return to the spotlight just two days after his release, holding a press conference on Friday, May 30 with Savannah in Nashville. He began by thanking “every person that has prayed for us and stayed in the fight and fought for the truth to come out,” before explaining why Julie wasn’t present.\n\n “Julie, who is a wonderful, decent, God-fearing woman, that I am blessed to have been married to and been with for over 30 years now, an excellent mother, she is at home with Chloe right now,” he shared of the 12-year-old, who is the biological daughter of his son Kyle Chrisley, though Todd and Julie adopted her in 2016. \"Chloe will not let her go, so we’re blessed to have our family back.”\n\n He went on to gush over Julie being his “best friend” who has been through “all the ups and downs” of life with.\n\n “It was great to be home,” Todd said. “No matter where that is, as long as she's there, it's home.”\n\n Julie has been spotted out in public, first stepping out spotted out on May 29 after spending two years behind bars in a Kentucky facility. Photos shared by Fox News Digital captured Julie smiling as she ran errands in Nashville and sported her natural gray hair.\n\n That same day, she reunited with Todd, who had been in a separate prison in Florida. \n\n Todd and Julie will be reviving their podcast to share more about their experience in prison. \n\n This won't be the last the public will be hearing from the Todd and Julie together. In the June 3 episode of Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley, Savannah revealed that her parents would be appearing on her podcast in the near future.\n\n She also revealed that the couple will be \"relaunching\" their podcast, Chrisley Confessions, which is under the PodcastOne umbrella like Savannah's and went on hiatus during their incarceration.\n\n \"I am so excited for that … and for them to have a place to share their story and be truly authentically themselves after the past two and a half years,\" Savannah said.\n\n The couple were indicted in August 2019 and later convicted and sentenced to a combined 19 years in prison in November 2022 (though that number was reduced by around two years each in September 2023).\n\n They immediately began appealing their case, and while Todd’s appeal was upheld, Julie's was initially granted due to insufficient evidence. However, a judge later ruled that her original punishment was sufficient. \n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Lara Trump’s interview with Julie, Todd, Savannah and Grayson Chrisley is airing Saturday, June 28, at 9 p.m. ET during FOX News Channel’s My View with Lara Trump.","summary":"Julie Chrisley spoke out for the first time since her release from prison in a preview of her upcoming interview on FOX News Channel's 'My View with Lara Trump'","url":"https://people.com/julie-chrisley-recalls-busting-out-crying-after-learning-about-her-pardon-11746556","image":"https://people.com/thmb/xcyMVRuvWGcyqfswq7fBx8c5-VE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/julie-chrisley-speaks-out-on-fox-18-062425-31eda3cee38446aca42e037e656fece9.jpg","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/n3sFjHLg-91tJl0lw.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:42:25","author":"Liza Esquibias","authors":["Liza Esquibias"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.092},{"id":334864064,"title":"House Democrat Rep. Melanie Stansbury Shows Poll With Obvious Error","text":"Look, math is hard. I've never been much of a math guy, but if I were in Congress, I'd probably make sure any statistics I brought to a hearing didn't have an obvious error in them. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) and her staff did not do that. Stansbury was at a Horse Oversight subcommittee on DOGE hearing, and she decided to roll up with what might be one of the ugliest visual aids I've ever seen. I mean, don't go overboard and waste money on it, but maybe try. But hey, all that matters is the data, because you can't argue raw data… unless that data adds up in a way that is not mathematically possible. According to Mediaite, Rep. Brian Jack (R-GA) pointed out the mistake. \"The poll behind you, behind our ranking member, it adds up to 110 percent,\" Rep. Jack noted. \"Just wanted to clarify, is it meant to add up to 110 percent, or is that an error?\" Now, again, I'm no math guy, but if you're talking in terms of percentages, you can't go above 100%. I think most of us would've turned around, done a bit of quick mental math, realized the mistake, and pulled down the piece of posterboard, but not Rep. Stansbury. She doubled down, because that poll came from Quinnipiac, dammit. \"This is from a Quinnipiac poll that was held two weeks ago, and this is the data that was provided,\" Stansbury said. \"There’s a wealth of information, including information about Donald Trump’s falling poll numbers. So you should take a look.\" That smug response and ricochet at the Quinnipiac pollsters (great hockey school too, by the way) was a choice, and it probably would've worked in her favor if she wasn't sitting in front of stats that even a remedial fourth grader could tell you were wrong. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — not one to shy away from opportunities like this — also took a moment to call out the goofed-up poll when given an opportunity. \"The gentleman yields, and it still adds up to 110 percent!\" Greene said. \"That’s a fake poll right there!\" But hey, people make mistakes — and so do congressional interns — so we reached out to Rep. Stansbury's office to see if the congresswoman is now aware that the poll results added up to 110%, making them mathematically impossible. We have not yet received a response.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/house-democrat-rep-melanie-stansbury-shows-poll-very-obvious-error","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2206861271.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:41:41","author":"Matt Reigle","authors":["Matt Reigle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.686},{"id":334863044,"title":"World News | El Salvador Judge Orders Prominent Critic of President Bukele to Remain in Jail Before Trial","text":"San Salvador, Jun 25 (AP) A judge in El Salvador ordered Tuesday that a lawyer and well-known critic of President Nayib Bukele remain in jail as his prosecution on charges of money laundering proceeds in a blow to critics pushing back against the government. Enrique Anaya was detained by police earlier this month on money laundering allegations just days after calling Bukele a \"dictator\" on live TV. His arrest has been the subject of an outcry by human rights defenders. Also Read | Donald Trump Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for His Role in Israel-Iran Ceasefire and Preventing Tehran From Acquiring Nuclear Weapons. \"Unfortunately, the result was not what we had hoped for,\" Anaya's attorney Jaime Quintanilla said, adding that the case would now proceed into an investigative phase. He said they expected to hear more in the coming weeks. Upon Anaya's arrest, authorities did not provide details about the allegations against him despite posting a photo of the constitutional lawyer in handcuffs surrounded by armed police. Also Read | Iran Military Commander Ali Fadavi Arrested for Spying for Israel? Know Truth As Rumours Go Viral. Advocates, legal experts and international watchdogs have warned that Bukele has grown emboldened by his alliance with US President Donald Trump. He has moved to silence critics through recent arrests and a new foreign agents law that sent chills through nongovernmental organisations that receive overseas funding. Anaya's June 10 arrest was just the latest example. Another judge issued a similar decision against prominent human rights attorney Ruth Leonora López earlier this month. That judge ordered López, another outspoken Bukele critic, held for six months on charges of illegal enrichment. Anaya's legal team insists that he is innocent and that the detention was purely political. Quintanilla, his lawyer, said it also violated his rights because he was not brought before a judge within 72 hours of his arrest as required by the country's constitution. Rather, he was held for 14 days and instead appeared to be detained under emergency provisions that Bukele has used to crack down on the country's gangs and detain alleged gang members with little access to due process. Tuesday was the first time Anaya has appeared before a judge. Quintanilla said this was illegal because Anaya was accused of a crime unconnected to gang violence. He had appealed to the country's Supreme Court, using a habeas corpus petition, which was partially granted Saturday, leading to Tuesday's hearing. He had hoped that Anaya would be set free, but the detained lawyer was walked out of court in handcuffs surrounded by police. He nodded to reporters with his cuffed hands held to his chest. Speaking to reporters during a break in the hearing, Quintanilla said he could not share further details about what occurred in the courtroom because the case is sealed, but said that prosecutors presented charges, the defence responded, and the judge ultimately allowed Anaya to speak. \"He (Anaya) obviously described what he has suffered during his detention, what has happened to him and matters specific to the case that cannot be disclosed,\" Quintanilla said. The defence attorney said Anaya's medical condition is critical and blamed it on \"overcrowding and confinement.\" He mentioned that Anaya suffers from a chronic illness but did not provide further details. Bukele has long faced criticism of what watchdogs say are clear human rights violations. But with recent moves by the Bukele administration, they see a worrisome escalation by the popular president, who enjoys extremely high approval ratings due to his gangs crackdown. By suspending fundamental rights, Bukele has severely weakened gangs but also locked up 87,000 people for alleged gang ties, often with little evidence or due process. A number of those detained were also critics. Bukele and his New Ideas party have taken control of all three branches of government, stacking the country's Supreme Court with loyalists.

(AFP pic)WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that China can continue to purchase Iranian oil after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, a move that the White House clarified did not indicate a relaxation of US sanctions.“China can now continue to purchase Oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, just days after he ordered US bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites.Trump was drawing attention to no attempts by Iran so far to close the Strait of Hormuz to oil tankers, as a closure would have been hard for China, the world’s top importer of Iranian oil, a senior White House official told Reuters.“The president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions,” the official said.After the ceasefire announcement, Trump’s comments on China were another bearish signal for oil prices, which fell nearly 6%.Any relaxation of sanctions enforcement on Iran would mark a US policy shift after Trump said in February he was re-imposing maximum pressure on Iran, aiming to drive its oil exports to zero, over its nuclear programme and funding of militants across the Middle East.Trump imposed waves of Iran-related sanctions on several of China’s so-called independent “teapot” refineries and port terminal operators for purchases of Iranian oil.“President Trump’s greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,” said Scott Modell, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group.In addition to not enforcing sanctions, Trump could suspend or waive sanctions imposed by executive order or under authorities a president is granted in laws passed by Congress.Trump will likely not waive sanctions ahead of coming rounds of US-Iran nuclear talks, Modell said. The measures provide leverage given Tehran’s demand that any deal includes lifting them permanently.Jeremy Paner, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed lawfirm, said if Trump chooses to suspend Iran oil-related sanctions, it would require lots of work between agencies.The treasury would need to issue licenses, and the state department would have to issue waivers, which require Congressional notification.‘Flashed the Glock’China has long opposed what it has called Washington’s “abuse of illegal unilateral sanctions.” China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s post.Larger purchases of Iranian oil by China and other consumers could upset US ally Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.The impact of US sanctions on Iran’s exports, however, has been limited since Trump’s first administration when he cracked down harder on Tehran.Trump has “flashed the Glock” this year with sanctions on Chinese trading companies and terminals, but the results have been far more “minimum pressure” than maximum, Modell said.State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that Trump had signalled what he wanted to happen and that his administration is focused on delivering that. She would not say what the process would entail.“But clearly we are focused on making sure that (the) guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward, so we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like,” Bruce said.","summary":"The president also urges China to buy US crude while the White House denies easing sanctions on Iranian exports.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/06/25/trump-says-china-can-continue-buying-iranian-oil/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1662216a-iran-oil-rig.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 23:38:49","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.498},{"id":334863774,"title":"YOURSAY | Akmal, look in the mirror, remember KK Mart","text":"YOURSAY | ‘Don’t underestimate the students and never call them stupid!’Akmal wants to meet 'stupid' protesters who burned PM's imageBOBBYO: The problem with these leaders is that they want to shut their minds to the real problem facing the nation. Instead, they are redirecting the problem to these students and their frustration.Has Umno leader Dr Akmal Saleh forgotten how rude he was concerning just five socks and KK Mart? Instead of going down to find the root of the problem, he held the nation at ransom.Akmal should look in the mirror. He is the master of being or behaving rudely.Akmal, the corruption in this nation has reached its height. Those in power are simply turning their backs on the issue.The people have been shouting and screaming from the top of the mountain, and the leaders have turned a blind eye. Those involved are their own colleagues, or if exposed, will form a threat to their position.People elected into office or positions have questionable backgrounds. The people reject such candidates, yet the leaders put up a deaf and dumb front.So, Akmal, instead of meeting these so-called rude students, you should instead meet those in power who are responsible for the frustrations the people are going through.If the leaders keep on acting deaf and dumb, then one day they will be forced out of their positions. Akmal should very well know that as an Umno member.WINNING Scarecrow: I would like to advise Akmal to be careful when dealing with Sabahans. Sabahans are unlike the cowardly DAP leaders who just keep silent when facing a great Malay rights fighter like Akmal.If you go to Sabah to meet these young heroes, they may bring you to their cowboy town, Kota Belud, and burn more than your image.Leave the Sabahans alone. They are fearless people who never tolerate corruption, unlike the West Malaysians who blindly vote for Pakatan Harapan and Umno.MerdekaMerdeka: Akmal wants to meet those protesters. They don’t have time for circus shows. Take your circus elsewhere.Akmal called the protesters stupid and rude for burning the caricature of a hopeless PM? This also translates to you calling your godfather, PMX, “stupid and rude,” because he did the same public burning protest decades ago.You are saying Anwar is stupid and rude for burning the book written by our Bapa Kemerdekaan (Father of Independence), Tunku Abdul Rahman.Just a Malaysian: Akmal, you should meet the students and understand why they are angry. The reasons behind their anger are key to defending race and country.Akmal if you are truly pahlawan bangsa (national warrior), side with the students and demand accountability of all politicians sucking tanah Melayu (Malay land) empty.Getting into an easy fight against helpless students with authority on your side is not jantan (gentleman). It’s pure political opportunism and cheap chest thumping against people who cannot fight back.Sudah lah (enough lah), Akmal, your cheap matinee show has been exposed.World Citizen: The student protesters should take up the challenge from this “small boy”. Give it to him nicely until he will never set foot in Sabah ever again.This small boy has no guts to confront all those corrupt politicians in Sabah who have been exposed by the whistleblower, he could only but thump his chest at these brave student protesters. What a coward!A Little Bit Crazy: Alamak Akmal, don’t be so jealous. Relax, watch the show.No one will burn your image, because you are a small fry. Only those Very Important Persons might face the same consequences.US President Donald Trump’s images have been burned, stepped on, thousands of times. Because he is super hated by many people.Anwar’s image was burned one time only; what is so big a deal about it? If you don’t shout out, many people don’t even realise this case.So, are you trying to protect Anwar’s image, or are you trying to pour oil into the flame? TM My Foot: Are you trying to be a hero?

Even selling the stocks upon their debuts would have fetched a 10 per cent gain, the data showed.\nThe eye-popping returns have coaxed institutional investors back to Asia’s third-largest stock market after years of retreat. Local individual investors have also shifted from the moribund property market – plagued by high borrowing costs and a supply glut – to the IPO market, where they are taking advantage of financial leverage to maximise their chances of winning share lotteries.\nMark Yue, a 36-year-old fintech worker, is one of thousands caught up in the frenzy. He is subscribing to popular, high-capitalisation IPOs, usually funded by margin financing equivalent to 10 times the principal. Since February, he has won shares in six out of the seven IPOs he took part in, including Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Mixue Group.\n“The risk isn’t too high if you pick up popular names with margin financing,” said Yue, who sells the shares on the first day of trading in anticipation of an average 10 per cent return.\nFew asset classes globally can match Hong Kong IPOs this year. Gold has jumped 28 per cent on a global flight to haven assets, while the S&P 500 has risen less than 2 per cent after recovering from President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” sell-offs. The Hang Seng Index has advanced 18 per cent, but most of the gains came early in the year after DeepSeek’s abrupt ascent, and momentum has slowed recently.\nOf the city’s 34 IPOs this year, 22 have traded above their offer prices, according to Bloomberg data. The biggest gainer is Soft International Group, a maker of baby and feminine-care products that has surged 216 per cent since its March 27 trading debut. Duality Biotherapeutics and Chinese drinks and ice cream chain Mixue Group had the second- and third-biggest gains, jumping by 168 and 163 per cent, respectively.\nHong Kong’s IPO market had been in the doldrums until the start of the year, when a turnaround in sentiment bolstered demand and the city’s exchange operator fast-tracked listings of large, high-quality Chinese companies that already traded on mainland bourses. These included CATL, the world’s biggest maker of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China’s biggest drug maker by market value, and condiment maker Foshan Haitian Flavouring and Food.\nUnlike the last IPO boom in 2018 and 2019, when technology companies dominated, this surge features established companies in traditional sectors and new-consumer names buttressed by Generation Z spending. Besides Mixue, the latter category includes cosmetics maker Maogeping, toymaker Bloks Group and jeweller Laopu Gold. The more than sixfold surge in Pop Mart International Group since its listing in 2020 has created a halo effect for such consumer-focused companies.\nStill, hitting the IPO jackpot is not easy for retail investors. Bloks, the most popular IPO this year, drew orders for almost 6,000 times the available shares, implying a less than 0.02 per cent success rate. The oversubscription ratio for Mixue was more than 5,000 times, while that for Haitian Flavoring was above 900 times.\n\nJanet Lin, a 30-year-old media worker, has had no luck winning shares in IPOs including CATL, Haitian and Hengrui.\n“It has drawn my attention when I see more mainland firms coming to Hong Kong [for listings],” she said. “My strategy is to apply for several IPOs with smaller amounts to spread the risk.”\nDespite frustration, Lin said she did not plan to stop trying.\nSome 34 companies have raised a combined HK$99.8 billion (US$12.7 billion) from Hong Kong’s stock market this year, according to Bloomberg data. That made the city the world’s biggest IPO venue in 2025, according to the London Stock Exchange Group.\nThe momentum is set to extend throughout the year. Bonnie Chan Yiting, CEO of bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said that about 160 companies were in the IPO pipeline, with more than 20 of those aiming to raise at least US$1 billion.\nShenwan Hongyuan Group, a Shanghai-based brokerage, said that another 29 mainland-listed companies were lined up for Hong Kong listings this year.\nThat is good news for individual Hong Kong investors who hope for prolonged euphoria in the primary market.\n“The boom on Hong Kong’s IPOs can definitely carry on, and retail investors will benefit a lot from that,” said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Huichen Asset Management in Shanghai. “But how long the boom can last also rests on the performance of the secondary market.”\nIn periods of heightened optimism, IPOs can draw in more capital and lift the broader market, said Kevin Liu Gang, managing director and chief offshore China and overseas strategist at CICC, adding that inflows from mainland China had already reached HK$700 billion this year, compared with HK$800 billion in all of 2024.\n“Historically, about half of all IPOs deliver positive returns, depending on the time frame,” he said. “So while persistent outperformance is rare over the long run, periodic windows of strong returns are certainly possible.”","summary":"A blistering recovery in Hong Kong’s initial public offering (IPO) market this year has delivered a bonanza for investors, with returns above 30 per cent bucking a sluggish economy and languid property market.\nHolding new shares from the 34 companies that have pulled off offerings in 2025 would generate an average return of 34 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.

Actually, MAGA doesn’t want him, doesn’t know him, and doesn’t respect him,’ Trump also wrote. \n\nMassie repeatedly criticized the president, especially after Trump floated the prospect of regime change in Iran. \n\n‘This is not America First folks,’ he wrote. I will not vote for the United States to get dragged into another regime change war. In fact, I will actively oppose it.’ \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also took on Massie during a Fox News segment on Monday. \n\n‘He should be a Democrat because he is more aligned with them than with the Republican Party,’ she said. \n\nShe also pushed back on Massie’s claim that Trump’s action was unconstitutional. \n\n‘The White House was not obligated to call anyone because the president was acting within his legal authority under Article 2 of the Constitution, as commander-in-chief of the president of the United States,’ Leavitt concluded. \n\nOn Sunday, Trump additionally criticized Massie for grandstanding on television after the successful military strikes on Iran. \n\n‘He’s a simple minded ‘grandstander’ who thinks it’s good politics for Iran to have the highest level Nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’ at every chance they get,’ Trump wrote on social media, describing him as ‘weak’ and ‘ineffective’ and ‘disrespectful to our great military.’\n\n ‘MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague!’ Trump concluded. \n\nMassie responded to Trump on his own social media account. \n\n‘Donald Trump declared so much War on me today it should require an Act of Congress,’ the congressman wrote with the hashtag #sassywithmassie.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublican maverick Rep.

But the bombing provoked a retaliatory strike, with Iran launching missiles at the US’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday.\n\nSince then, Trump has announced a ceasefire between all parties and claimed he was able to “stop the war”. He credited the bombing with bringing “everyone together”.\n\nBut media outlets have questioned whether Trump was successful in destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities, as he has claimed. And Trump has denounced both Iran and Israel for early violations of the ceasefire.\n\n“As soon as we made the deal, [Israel] came out and dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I’ve never seen before,” Trump told reporters in an unvarnished moment on the White House lawn on Tuesday.\n\n“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing.”\n\nBehind the rhetoric\n\nDespite the rocky first hours after the ceasefire announcement, Israeli and Iranian leaders appear to have fallen in line with Trump’s messaging about peace.\n\nFollowing a call from the US president, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that his country would refrain from further attacks. Israel had “achieved all of the war’s goals”, his office said.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, meanwhile, hailed his country’s “heroic resistance”. He said Iran would respect the truce and seek to protect its interests through diplomacy.\n\nBut experts warn that the talk of peace and diplomacy might conceal greater challenges ahead.\n\nTrita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s harsh words for the latest attack reveal his increasingly public frustrations with Israel, a longtime US ally.\n\nThey might also indicate that extracting the US from Israel’s war with Iran might be more difficult than it seems.\n\n“I think it’s crucial to understand Israel does not want an end to the fighting, and I think Trump is starting to recognise how deeply America and Israel’s interests in all of this diverge,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.\n\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly signalled that their military operations against Iran are aimed at prompting wider regime change, a goal Trump appeared to endorse last week but has since disavowed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, issued a statement to the media confirming that Israel had “concluded a significant chapter, but the campaign against Iran is not over”.\n\nThat viewpoint may diverge from Trump’s, according to Parsi. Nevertheless, Parsi believes Trump has shown more willingness to tell Israel “no” than many of his presidential predecessors.\n\n“But Trump has not been able to sustain that ‘no’ in an effective way,” Parsi added, pointing to the US president’s interventions in Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\n“He pressured the Israelis into the ceasefire in Gaza, but then he relented and let Netanyahu get out of the ceasefire and never go to phase two of that agreement. If he wants to deal with Iran, he’s going to have to make sure he does not repeat that mistake.”\n\nStill, Parsi noted that Trump has shown “a remarkable nimbleness” in his ability to commit – then withdraw – US military forces from foreign conflicts. Earlier this year, for instance, Trump entered into 45 days of air strikes against the Yemen-based Houthi armed group, but by May, he had unveiled a ceasefire.\n\nRisk of a ‘quagmire’\n\nFor its part, Iran has been seen as eager to find an off-ramp to exit the conflict. Several analysts told Al Jazeera that Tehran would likely take pains to avoid any actions that could draw the US back into the fight.\n\nThe US and Iran had been in talks to scale back Tehran’s nuclear programme. But Israel’s initial surprise attack on June 13 had derailed the negotiations.\n\nNegar Mortazavi, a non-resident fellow at the nonprofit Center for International Policy, said that Iran still remains open to returning to the negotiating table.\n\nThe country has long denied seeking a nuclear weapon and has instead framed its efforts as aimed at developing civilian energy infrastructure.\n\n“Iran wants to have a civilian nuclear programme,” Mortazavi told Al Jazeera. “And I think, if Trump accepts that, then there’s a very strong path and possibility for a deal.”\n\nTrump, however, has been vague about what he may accept. He described the US attack on Sunday as the destruction of “all Nuclear facilities & capability” in Iran, in a series of statements that did not appear to distinguish between nuclear enrichment for civilian energy purposes or for weapons.\n\nHis statements were also at odds with a classified report leaked to US media, indicating that Iran’s nuclear programme was damaged but not obliterated – and could be rebuilt in a matter of months.\n\n“IRAN WILL NEVER REBUILD THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES,” Trump wrote in one of the messages on Tuesday.\n\nStill, Mortazavi believes Iran will likely have no choice but to return to negotiations, even if Trump again takes a maximalist position and opposes all uranium enrichment.\n\n“They might be able to meet somewhere half way,” Mortazavi said of the US and Iran. She added that one possible compromise would be to have a “consortium” of regional countries that would monitor a civilian nuclear programme.\n\n“The alternative, which is military conflict and war, is just going to be devastating for a lot more civilians”, she explained, “and could potentially turn into a quagmire like Iraq or Afghanistan”.\n\nSina Azodi, an assistant professor of Middle East politics at George Washington University, pointed out that Trump’s ceasefire announcement on Monday could hold clues about his approach to any renewed negotiations.\n\nTrump started his statement by writing, “CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!” Then, he ended the missive with, “God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!”\n\nAzodi said that the message – which appeared to put Iran in the same standing as Israel – was unprecedented from a US president since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. He noted that Trump appeared to be setting a “conciliatory” tone.\n\nThat sentiment was also reflected on the economic front. On Tuesday, Trump said that China could continue to buy oil from Iran, despite US sanctions that would otherwise limit such trade.\n\nThat, too, was interpreted by many analysts as a goodwill offering to officials in Tehran, as Trump seeks a resolution to the conflict.\n\n“Trump wants to be the one who used military force, showed strength, and then quickly brought an end to the conflict,” Azodi told Al Jazeera.\n\n“He certainly does not want a broader conflict in the region, because then there’s a possibility that he would have to resort to more military intervention.”\n\nAny further military involvement, analysts say, could inflame tensions within Trump’s base, as many of his “America First” followers oppose overseas military action.\n\nSome have speculated that Trump’s strike-and-exit approach allowed him to split the difference, satisfying the war hawks in the Republican Party while mollifying those who disagree with foreign intervention.\n\n“But it’s impossible to know what comes next, given his style,” Azodi said. “One day, he’s on a good side. One day, he’s belligerent and angry.”\n\nLong-term success?\n\nWhether Trump will continue his calls for peace after Sunday’s attack remains unclear.\n\nThe US president has been on the defensive, as journalists continue to question the effectiveness of the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities like Fordow.\n\n“That place is under rock. That place is demolished,” Trump told journalists on Tuesday.\n\nHe called on news outlets to apologise for casting doubt on the success of the mission. “It’s all fake news,” he said. “Those pilots hit their targets. Those targets were obliterated.”\n\nAzodi noted that the US strikes appear to be less successful than the Trump administration has claimed. Evidence has surfaced that Iran relocated much of its uranium stockpile in the lead-up to the attack.\n\nWhat is clear, Azodi said, is that the US violated international law in striking a facility under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThat could lead Iran to make good on its threat to withdraw from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), freeing it from international obligations that would limit any weapons development.\n\n“In the short term, yes, Trump can come and brag about [the US strikes] on Truth Social, saying that he ‘obliterated’ the Iranian nuclear programme,” Azodi said.\n\n“But in the long term, you can’t bomb the knowledge. Iran’s fissile material appears to have survived. And now Iranians have a lot of motive for withdrawing from the NPT.”\n\nThat, he warned, would mean that “it would be impossible to monitor their nuclear programme”.","summary":"After bombing Iran, the US president announced a ceasefire.
