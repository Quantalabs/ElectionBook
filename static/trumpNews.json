The loved-up couple brushed off speculation surrounding their relationship, which was fueled by a leaked fake contract earlier this week, as they watched world No. 1 Jannik Sinner defeat Taylor Fritz in the men’s final at Flushing Meadows. Taylor and Travis couldn’t keep their hands off each other as they were joined by pals Patrick and Brittany Mahomes in a luxury suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium. However, it seems the Kansas City Chiefs tight end may have had a wandering eye. The NFL star’s attention has been called into question by fans on social media who have suggested his focus wasn’t entirely on the on-court action – or even his girlfriend. In several snaps, the three-time Super Bowl winner could be seen with his phone propped up against a US Open commemorative glass, which no doubt was filled with the tournament’s infamous Honey Deuce cocktail. The cell phone had been rotated on its side to show the screen in landscape mode, leading many social media sleuths to believe Travis was watching something on it. The Chiefs’ NFL action was over and done with Thursday when the reigning Super Bowl champions beat the Baltimore Ravens 27-20 but Sunday’s schedule was still packed with Week 1 matchups and fans believe Travis didn’t want to miss a minute. ‘He’s for sure watching football,’ one Taylor Swift fan account posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, alongside a photo which had been zoomed in on Travis’s phone. ‘Bro seen the Bengals take the L,’ another wrote referring to the Chiefs’ AFC rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals, and their loss to the New England Patriots Sunday. The Chiefs host the Bengals at Arrowhead Stadium during Week 2’s Sunday slate on September 15 and other social media users agreed that Travis was keeping an eye on Joe Burrow and co. in preparation for the clash against one of Kansas City’s old AFC Championship nemeses. ‘I bet he’s watching the bengals game, they’re losing,’ one user posted, while another chimed in adding, ‘Studying bengals for next weekend.’ However, others theorized that Travis was studying for more than his on-field job. ‘Gotta be ready for New Heights,’ one fan posted, referring to Travis’ weekly NFL podcast with brother Jason. The couple’s appearance in Queens not only brushed off speculation about their relationship but also dispelled rumors of a rift between Taylor and Brittany, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick. A few weeks after Brittany liked a Donald Trump posts on Instagram, Taylor sparked talk a potential rift with her BFF after choosing not to sit together for the Chiefs’ win over the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday. Yet amid fears for their friendship, Swift proved there’s no bad blood between them at Flushing Meadow on Sunday. Both Chiefs WAGs were spotted at the US Open final along with partners Travis and Patrick , with the four friends in the house for Sinner’s clash against Fritz at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Brittany and Taylor looked in fine spirits as they watched Sinner, the current world No 1, locked horns with the American hopeful for the last Grand Slam title of the year. Unusually, the wife of Kansas City’s superstar quarterback and his teammate Travis appeared to be wearing matching Gucci outfits on the day. DailyMail.com revealed at the end of last month that Taylor and Brittany have implemented measures to save their friendship amid mounting speculation that the the latter’s support of Trump could cause an explosive feud with the singer. Fans predicted a huge fallout could be on the cards after Mahomes sparked controversy for liking multiple posts in support of the Republican presidential candidate, 78, ahead of the upcoming election, seemingly going against the views of Swift. However, a source has exclusively told DailyMail.com that they ‘respect that they have different views’ and have made a ‘pact’ to avoid discussing politics. ‘Taylor is not going to be written into this anti-Brittany narrative because they have made a pact to not discuss politics,’ they said. ‘They both know it can tear apart friendships and they respect that they have different views.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce put on an extremely PDA-packed display at&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Fans speculate on what Travis Kelce was truly viewing while in the US Open box with Taylor Swift first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/fans-speculate-on-what-travis-kelce-was-truly-viewing-while-in-the-us-open-box-with-taylor-swift/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Fans-are-convinced-they-know-what-Travis.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:48:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":255944886,"title":"The Harris campaign is ‘already downplaying her performance before it even happens’","text":"Panelists on \"The Big Weekend Show\" discuss the established rules of the upcoming ABC News presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Tour de force aren't going to be what you hear from the headlines, because the campaign's already downplaying her performance before it even happens,\" Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins said.

DirecTV filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission on Saturday night accusing Disney of negotiating in bad faith. Disney channels, including ESPN and ABC-owned stations in nine markets, have been off DirecTV since the evening of Sept. 1. That meant DirecTV customers were blacked out from viewing most college football games and the final week of the US Open tennis tournament, including the women’s and men’s finals. DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation’s third-largest pay TV provider. ABC and ESPN will have the “Monday Night Football” opener between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. ABC will also produce and carry a presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday in Philadelphia. ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, are off DirecTV. Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel are dark. DirecTV says in its 10-page complaint that Disney is violating the FCC’s good faith mandates by asking it to waive any legal claims on any anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands. DirecTV has asked Disney for the option to provide consumers with cheaper and skinnier bundles of programming, instead of bigger bundles that carry programming some viewers might not be interested in watching. The complaint states: “Along with these anticompetitive demands, Disney has also insisted that DirecTV agree to a ‘clean slate’ provision and a covenant not to sue, both of which are intended to prevent DirecTV from taking legal action regarding Disney’s anticompetitive demands, which would include filing good faith complaints at the Commission. Not three months ago, however, the Media Bureau made clear that such a demand itself constitutes bad faith.” DirecTV CEO Ray Carpenter said during a conference call with business and media analysts on Tuesday that they would not agree to a new carriage deal with Disney without bundling changes. “We’re not playing a short-term game,” Carpenter said. “We need something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers. The resolve is there.” Disney has claimed since the blackout began that mutual release of claims is standard practice after licensing agreements are negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. It has also had one with DirecTV under its past renewals. A Disney spokesperson said: “We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible. We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.” Last year, Disney and Charter Spectrum — the nation’s second-largest cable TV provider — were involved in a nearly 12-day impasse until coming to an agreement hours before the first Monday night NFL game of the season.","summary":"The impasse between DirecTV and Disney over a new carriage agreement has become more heated as it entered its second week.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/media/directv-files-complaint-against-disney-with-fcc-as-impasse-enters-2nd-week/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-ypelawn0y-1725842336862.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725828010&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9edUvnkS-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:40:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":255944948,"title":"Joe Biden criticized for taking equivalent of 48 years of vacation in just four years as president – much more than Trump","text":"Saturday, July 13 – Donald Trump is shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Republican frontrunner is hit in the ear but stands up and pumps his fist to the crowd. Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, is shot dead but the Secret Service is slammed for suspected security blunders. Ex-fire chief Corey Comperatore is killed protecting his family. Sunday, July 14 – President Joe Biden calls on Americans to unite and “cool down” political rhetoric in the wake of Trump’s shooting. The Democrat had faced growing calls since his disastrous performance in June’s CNN debate. Shocking video reveals how close Trump came to being killed after turning his head at the last minute. Monday, July 15 – The Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump is formally nominated as the Republican candidate. An emotional-looking Trump makes his first appearance since surviving the shooting wearing a large ear bandage. It quickly becomes a must-have fashion item at the RNC. Ohio Senator JD Vance is named as Trump’s running mate. Previously anti-Trump, Vance at just 39 is an inexperienced choice, but seen as having a connection with ordinary Americans. In an interview, Biden admits it was a “mistake” to talk about putting Trump in “the bullseye” days before the assassination attempt. Tuesday, July 16 – The FBI warns of more potential violence in the wake of Trump’s shooting. Intelligence claims Iran had a separate plot to assassinate Trump, but there is no proven link to Crooks. Biden returns to the campaign trail for the first time since the assassination attempt and insists he isn’t stepping down. Wednesday, July 17 – Joe Biden tests positive for Covid, just days after saying he would drop out of the presidential race if he was diagnosed with a medical condition. It intensifies the calls for him to step aside with Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom floated as potential replacements. At the RNC, JD Vance makes his first speech since being selected as Trump’s VP pick, to the delight of the MAGA crowd. Thursday, July 18 – Donald Trump addresses the RNC, his first speech since surviving an attempted assassination. He appears slower and more subdued than usual but gives the longest convention acceptance speech in US history. Just before he goes on, former wrestler Hulk Hogan rips his shirt off and tells cheering crowds “Trumpomania” will sweep America. Former First Lady Melania, who has barely been seen on the campaign trail, makes an appearance but does not speak. Barack Obama joins calls for Biden to step aside. Friday, July 19 – President Biden appears to consider resigning, as a source says he is in a “contemplative stage” while isolating with Covid. Video emerges showing Biden appearing to lean into the wrong woman after mistaking her for his wife Jill. Meanwhile, the world’s biggest tech outage sparks travel chaos for Republicans leaving the RNC in Milwaukee. Saturday, July 20 – Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally since the shooting in Butler. He appears in Michigan without his ear bandage. His former doctor Ronny Jackson describes his injuries. He appears in his first interview alongside his running mate Vance. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi speaks for the first time since being linked to growing calls for Biden to resign. Meanwhile, Biden’s reelection campaign continues to insist he is running, as a spokesperson slams Trump’s rally remarks as showing he is “focused only on himself.” Sunday, July 21 – Joe Biden announces he isn’t running in November in a shock letter, just hours after insisting he was staying in the race. He is the first incumbent to step down in their first term since 1968. Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president as senior Dems through their support behind the Vice President. The news appears to throw the Republicans off their stride. Biden vows to continue his term until November’s election. Monday, July 22 – Kamala Harris raises a record $81 million in 24 hours as she secures the Democratic candidacy. She also inherits some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden. Harris gives her first speech since Biden stepped out, and speaks to the president on the phone, although he doesn’t appear in person. Under-pressure Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle appears on Capitol Hill and faces increasing calls to resign over the shooting of Trump. She admits the Secret Service “failed” on July 13 and resigns the following day.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Joe Biden has been slammed for his excessive use of vacation&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden criticized for taking equivalent of 48 years of vacation in just four years as president – much more than Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-criticized-for-taking-equivalent-of-48-years-of-vacation-in-just-four-years-as-president-much-more-than-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Joe-Biden-slammed-for-taking-48-years-worth-of-vacation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:38:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":255944636,"title":"Asia shares dragged by Wall Street dive, bonds bullish","text":"SYDNEY: Asian share markets slid on Monday (Sep 9) after worries about a possible US economic downturn slugged Wall Street while dragging bond yields and commodity prices lower as investors avoided risk assets for safer harbours. Japan's Nikkei bore the brunt of the early selling as a stronger yen pressured exporters, losing 2.4 per cent on top of a near 6 per cent slide last week. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.6 per cent, after losing 2.25 per cent last week. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both a fraction lower, after Friday's slide. Fed fund futures were little changed as investors wondered whether the mixed US August payrolls report would be enough to tip the Federal Reserve into cutting rates by an outsized 50 basis points when it meets next week. So far, markets imply only a 29 per cent chance of a large cut, in part due to comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams on Friday, though Waller did leave open the option of aggressive easing. \"Our read of the data is that the labour market continues to cool, but we see no sign of the kind of rapid deterioration in conditions that would call for a 50bp rate cut,\" Barclays economist Christian Keller said. \"Importantly, we also see no indication of any appetite for this in Fed communications,\" he added. \"We retain our call for the Fed to begin its cycle with a 25bp cut, followed by two more 25bp at the remaining two meetings this year, and a total of 75bp of cuts next year.\" Investors are considerably more dovish and have priced in 115 basis points of easing by Christmas and another 127 basis points for 2025. Data on August US consumer prices on Wednesday should underline the case for a cut, if not the size, with headline inflation seen slowing to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent. ECB TO EASE Markets are also fully priced for a quarter-point cut from the European Central Bank on Thursday, but are less sure on whether it will ease in both October and December. \"What matters will be guidance beyond September, where there's strong pressure on both sides,\" analysts at TD Securities noted in a note. \"Wage growth and services inflation remain strong, emboldening the hawks, while growth indicators are flagging softer, emboldening the doves,\" they added. \"Quarterly cuts are likely more consistent with the new projections.\" The prospect of global policy easing boosted bonds, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting 15-month lows and two-year yields the lowest since March 2023. The 10-year was last at 3.734 per cent and the two at 3.661 per cent, leaving the curve near its steepest since mid-2022. The drop in yields encouraged a further unwinding of yen carry trades which saw the dollar sink as deep as 141.75 yen on Friday before steadying at 142.41 early on Monday. The euro held at US$1.1090, having briefly been as high as US$1.1155 on Friday. Data on consumer prices (CPI) from China due later Monday are expected to show the Asian giant remains a force for disinflation, with producer prices seen falling an annual 1.4 per cent in August. The CPI is forecast to edge up to 0.7 per cent for the year, from 0.5 per cent, mainly due to rising food prices. Figures on China's trade account due Tuesday are expected to show a slowdown in both export and import growth. Also on Tuesday, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump debate for the first time ahead of the presidential election on Nov 5. In commodity markets, the slide in bond yields kept gold restrained at US$2,496 an ounce and short of its recent all-time top of US$2.531. Oil prices found some support after suffering their biggest weekly fall in 11 months last week amid persistent concerns about global demand. Brent added 57 cents to US$71.63 a barrel, while US crude firmed 60 cents to US$68.27 per barrel.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/asia-shares-dragged-wall-street-dive-bonds-bullish-4594986","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--cTfA3xOp--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-09-09t002509z_1_lynxmpek88008_rtroptp_3_global-markets.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:35:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":255944712,"title":"Kimberly Guilfoyle Channels Jeb Bush While Bombing at GOP Event","text":"Kimberly Guilfoyle, a conservative activist, former prosecutor, and the fiancée to Donald Trump Jr., had to ask an audience of Republican loyalists for applause on Saturday night, in a moment that recalled an infamous blunder from former Florida Gov.

And we are ready, we are willing, and we are able to spark a new era of American exceptionalism.” “And you can clap for that,” Guilfoyle added after pausing briefly for applause that didn’t seem to commence. Guilfoyle’s speech took place at a Florida Republican Party “victory dinner” at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida on Saturday, where GOP leaders celebrated their “million voter advantage over the Democrats.” Florida, once thought of as a swing state that could decide the outcome of elections, has drifted to the right for years. Former President Donald Trump won the state by more than three percentage points in 2020, and is ahead of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in most polls. Roughly 700 Republicans were in attendance, according to the Palm Beach Post. Despite their loyalty to the party, Guilfoyle seemed to have a hard time connecting with the audience of GOP loyalists. Even attacks against the Democratic nominee were met with apathy. “I have known her for 25 years. And let me tell you something—do whatever it takes to keep her out of the White House,” Guilfoyle said, pausing for muted applause. Guilfoyle, a native Californian, was previously married to the Golden State’s current Gov. Gavin Newsom until 2006. Harris was a fixture in California politics for over a decade before her election to the Senate in 2017, previously serving as the San Francisco District Attorney and the state’s Attorney General. The lackluster response to Guilfoyle’s speech seemed to rhyme with another poor performance from a Florida Republican—former Gov. Jeb Bush’s notorious “please clap” moment before a bored audience in Iowa during his failed presidential campaign in 2016. Some parts of Guilfoyle’s speech did strike a chord with the conservative audience. “We will achieve not just American energy independence, but complete and total American energy dominance,” Guilfoyle said adamantly, repeating a Trump campaign platform that went over a bit better with the crowd. Guilfoyle’s speech began later in the lineup, potentially explaining the lackluster reception. She followed speeches from Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, Florida Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Byron Donalds. Guilfoyle still received cheers and some standing ovations from the crowd seated closest to the stage as she wrapped up, proclaiming “God bless the United States of America, she’s worth fighting for.” But the crowd became noticeably more animated for the next speaker immediately after Guilfoyle—current Gov. Ron DeSantis. “Are you glad to be in the free state of Florida?” the governor asked, and was answered with rapturous applause from his state party.","summary":"Anadolu/Getty ImagesKimberly Guilfoyle, a conservative activist, former prosecutor, and the fiancée to Donald Trump Jr., had to ask an audience of Republican loyalists for applause on Saturday night, in a moment that recalled an infamous blunder from former Florida Gov.

The partisan review lays out the final months of military and civilian failures, following Trump’s February 2020 withdrawal deal, that allowed America’s fundamentalist Taliban enemy to sweep through and conquer all of the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens, Afghan battlefield allies, women activists and others at risk from the Taliban. But House Republicans’ report breaks little new ground as the withdrawal has been exhaustively litigated through several independent reviews. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame. Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, who led the investigation as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the GOP review reveals that the Biden administration “had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our brave Afghan allies.” “At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security,” he said in a statement. McCaul earlier in the day denied that the timing of the report’s release ahead of the presidential election was political, or that Republicans ignored Trump’s mistakes in the U.S. withdrawal. Defending the administration after release of the report, a State Department spokesman said that Biden acted in the U.S.’s best interest in finally ending the country’s deployment in Afghanistan. The spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Republicans produced a narrative “meant only to harm the Administration, instead of seeking to actually inform Americans on how our longest war came to an end.” House Democrats in a statement said the report by their Republican colleagues “cherry-picked witness testimony to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal” and ignored facts about Trump’s role. The more than 18-month investigation by Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee zeroed in on the months leading up to the removal of U.S. troops, saying that Biden and his administration undermined high-ranking officials and ignored warnings as the Taliban seized key cities far faster than most U.S. officials had expected or prepared for. “I called their advance ‘the Red Blob,’” retired Col. Seth Krummrich said of the Taliban, telling the committee that at the special operations’ central command where he was chief of staff, ”we tracked the Taliban advance daily, looking like a red blob gobbling up terrain.” “I don’t think we ever thought — you know, nobody ever talked about, ‘Well, what’s going to happen when the Taliban come over the wall?”’ Carol Perez, the State Department’s acting undersecretary for management at the time of the withdrawal, said of what House Republicans said was minimal State Department planning before abandoning the embassy in mid-August 2021 when the Taliban swept into Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. The withdrawal ended a nearly two-decade occupation by U.S. and allied forces begun to rout out the al-Qaida militants responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The Taliban had allowed al-Qaida’s leader, Osama bin Laden, to shelter in Afghanistan. Committee staffers noted reports since the U.S. withdrawal of the group rebuilding in Afghanistan, such as a U.N. report of up to eight al-Qaida training camps there. The Taliban overthrew an Afghan government and military that the U.S. had spent nearly 20 years and trillions of dollars building in hopes of keeping the country from again becoming a base for anti-Western extremists. A 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in Afghanistan singles out Trump’s February 2020 deal with the Taliban agreeing to withdraw all American forces and military contractors by the spring of the next year, and both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to keep pulling out U.S. forces despite the Taliban breaking key commitments in the withdrawal deal. House Republicans’ more than 350-page document is the product of hours of testimony — including with former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, U.S. Central Command retired Gen. Frank McKenzie and others who were senior officials at the time — seven public hearings and round-tables as well as more than 20,000 pages of State Department documents reviewed by the committees. With Biden no longer running for reelection, Trump and his GOP allies have tried to elevate the withdrawal as a campaign issue against Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential race. The report by House Republican cites Harris’ overall responsibility as an adviser to Biden, but doesn’t point to specific counsel or action by Harris that contributed to the many failures. Some highlights of the report: Decision to withdraw Republicans point to testimony and records that claim the Biden administration’s reliance on input from military and civilian leaders on the ground in Afghanistan in the months before the withdrawal was “severely limited,” with most of the decision-making taking place by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan without consultation with key stakeholders. The report says Biden proceeded with the withdrawal even though the Taliban was failing to keep some of its agreements under the deal, including breaking its promise to enter talks with the then-U.S.- backed Afghan government. Former State Department spokesperson Ned Price testified to the committee that adherence to the Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to Biden’s decision to withdraw, according to the report. Earlier reviews have said Trump also carried out his early steps of the withdrawal deal, cutting the U.S. troop presence from about 13,000 to an eventual 2,500 despite early Taliban noncompliance with some parts of the deal, and despite the Taliban escalating attacks on Afghan forces. The House report faults a longtime U.S. diplomat for Afghanistan, former Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, not Trump, for Trump administration actions in its negotiations with the Taliban. The new report says that Trump was following recommendations of American military leaders in making sharp cuts in U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan after the signing. ‘We were still in planning’ when Kabul fell McKenzie, who was one of the two U.S. generals who oversaw the evacuation, told lawmakers that the administration’s insistence at keeping the embassy open and fully operational was the “fatal flaw that created what happened in August,” according to the report. The committee report claims that State Department officials went as far as watering down or “even completely rewriting reports” from heads of diplomatic security and the Department of Defense that had warned of the threats to U.S. personnel as the withdrawal date got closer. “We were still in planning” when Kabul fell, Perez, the senior U.S. diplomat, testified to the committee. ___ Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – House Republicans on Sunday issued a scathing report on their&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republicans in the House publish a biased report holding Biden responsible for the chaotic conclusion of the US military presence in Afghanistan. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/republicans-in-the-house-publish-a-biased-report-holding-biden-responsible-for-the-chaotic-conclusion-of-the-us-military-presence-in-afghanistan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-House-Republicans-release-partisan-report-blaming-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:55:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":255943574,"title":"Speaker seeks citizenship proof for voters","text":"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson is heeding the demands of the more conservative wing of his Republican conference and has teed up a vote this week on a bill that would keep the federal government funded for six more months and require states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when registering a person to vote. Congress needs to approve a stop-gap spending bill before the end of the budget year on Sept. 30 to avoid a government shutdown just a few weeks before voters go the polls and elect the next president. Johnson’s decision to combine the proof of citizenship mandate with government funding complicates prospects for getting that task done. The bill is not expected to go anywhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, if it even makes it that far. But the effort could help Johnson, R-La., next year should House Republicans retain their majority and he seeks to become speaker again. The vote also could give Republicans an issue to go after Democrats in competitive swing districts as Republicans make immigration-related matters a campaign cornerstone. “Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,” Johnson said Friday. “Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.” Democrats will oppose the GOP effort overwhelmingly and warn that any continuing resolution must have buy-in from both political parties. They said Johnson was making the same mistake then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., did a year ago as he tried to placate conservatives. In the end, they rejected his efforts, forcing him to rely on Democrats to get a temporary spending bill passed. That fight led just a few days later to eight Republicans joining with Democrats in removing McCarthy from the speaker’s job. “As we have said repeatedly, avoiding a government shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party. Speaker Johnson is making the same mistake as former Speaker McCarthy did a year ago, by wasting precious time catering to the hard MAGA right, Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington state said in a statement, referring to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. “This tactic didn’t work last September and it will not work this year either.” They said that if Johnson “drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans’ hands.” Schumer is the Senate’s majority leader. Murray leads the Senate Appropriations Committee. The voter registration measure is popular with House Republicans. The House Freedom Caucus, which generally includes the chamber’s most conservative members, called for it to be attached to a stop-gap bill that would keep the government funded into early 2025. Republicans say that requiring proof of citizenship would ensure U.S. elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the nation’s federal election system, something that Trump has sought to undermine over the years. Opponents say it is already against the law for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and that the document requirements would disenfranchise millions of people who do not have the necessary documents readily available when they get a chance to register, say at a concert, county fair or at a college voter registration drive. Some Republicans are arguing that if Schumer will allow a vote, assuming the bill passes the House, then a government shutdown would be on him. “If Chuck Schumer decides he doesn’t want to bring it, then Chuck Schumer will be deciding that he wants to shut down government. It’s not us,” said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., during an interview on Fox Business News.","summary":"House Speaker Mike Johnson is heeding the demands of the more conservative wing of his Republican conference and has teed up a vote this week on a bill that would keep the federal government funded for six more months and require states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when registering a person to vote.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/08/speaker-seeks-citizenship-proof-for-voters/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24251048594602.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:54:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":255943500,"title":"Trump’s psychologist niece says he’s ‘dementing’ in wake of ‘gibberish’ answer on childcare question","text":"Mary Trump, the niece of Donald Trump, has shared her analysis that the former president’s mental health is deteriorating after he struggled to answer a question on childcare. In a piece on Substack on Sunday, the psychologist argued that Trump is “dementing,” citing his appearance at the Economic Club of New York last week, where he was asked what type of legislation he would push to make childcare affordable. “Well, I would do that, and we’re sitting down, I was somebody, we had Senator Marco Rubio, and my daughter Ivanka was so impactful on that issue,” Trump began his long, rambling answer. “It’s a very important issue, but I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I’m talking about that because look, childcare is childcare. There’s something, you have to have it in this country, you have to have it.” He went on to say that his proposed tariffs on imports would generate more than enough money to pay for childcare, but he did not explain what his actual policy would look like. Mary Trump wrote that the answer was “gibberish” and the only thing that made any sense was the phrase “childcare is childcare.” She went on to slam the “corporate media” for not properly reporting on Trump’s answer, instead thinking that “they must translate Donald’s nonsensical ramblings into a version of the English language we can all understand.” Mary Trump argued that reporters were “imbuing” words with “meaning that is not there,” adding that it’s “deeply disturbing that somebody as unhinged and incoherent as Donald is allowed to run for the presidency in the first place.” The psychologist wrote that her uncle is “demonstrably untethered from reality” and that “the warning lights” aren’t flashing “because nobody covering him expects otherwise.” “Surely a political press corps that spent months arguing that President Biden’s age rendered him mentally unfit, wouldn’t look the other way when the Republican candidate, the oldest person to run for president in American history, is not only old but decompensating before our very eyes,” she wrote. “The difference of course is that Biden is aging while Donald is dementing.” Calling him “frightened” and “desperate,” Mary Trump argued that the former president is concerned that his very freedom relies on his ability to get back into the White House and make the pending federal cases against him go away. As she lambasted the media for its coverage of the ex-commander-in-chief, Mary Trump concluded: “The American people deserve to know what we’re up against. We deserve to be told that there’s a maniac on the loose.” On Saturday night, the former president vowed to jail anyone “involved in unscrupulous behavior” in connection to the election in November. “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,” Donald Trump wrote. He added: “Please beware, that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.” Trump has repeatedly threatened to use the presidency to enact revenge on those he believes have wronged him despite there being no evidence of the kind of fraud that he falsely insists lost him the 2020 election.","summary":"‘We deserve to be told that there’s a maniac on the loose,’ Mary Trump writes as she lambasts the media","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-mary-childcare-dementia-b2609220.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/08/18/2170734124.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AHvwupmp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:49:28","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":255943616,"title":"Tommy Fury 'moves into £15,000-a-month bachelor pad' following shock split from Molly-Mae Hague","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 9th 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Kate Moss reveals the 'awful abuse' she receivedfrom anorexic girls' parents over her infamous 'heroin chic' look in the nineties... and the ONE comment she regrets making Sir Keir Starmer's plan to strip 10 million pensioners of winter fuel payments could KILL 4,000 people... says LABOUR'S own research King Charles is 'losing patience' with Prince Andrew and says there are only 'two possible options' left for his brother - as row over the Duke's refusal to leave £30m Royal Lodge rages on We left 'horrible' Australia and moved back to Scotland with our kids after just 18 months.

The boxer, 25, is said to be settling into the six-bed home as the 'first step for his new life', according to The Sun. Molly-Mae, also 25, shocked fans when she ended her engagement to the boxer, 25, last month after a five-year relationship. A source told the publication: 'Tommy was heartbroken when Molly-Mae dumped him and maintains he's done nothing wrong. 'But he's had to accept she doesn't want him in her life.' Tommy Fury, 25, has reportedly 'moved into a £15,000-a-month bachelor pad' after his shock split from ex-fiancée Molly-Mae Hague, also 25, amid cheating claims Molly-Mae shocked fans when she ended her engagement to the boxer, 25, last month after a five-year relationship 'The house is stunning and he is familiar with the area so he's getting it furnished.' Last week Tommy broke his silence on his shock split with ex-fiancée Molly-Mae claiming the 'false allegations have been horrendous'. He took to Instagram exactly 24 hours after the influencer thanked her loyal followers for supporting her through their split. Sharing a photo of him in the gym looking glum with his head looking down, Tommy wrote: 'These last few weeks have been heartbreaking. 'The false allegations about me have been horrendous, thank you to everybody who has stood by me through this.' In a recent Vlog, Molly-Mae discussed co-parenting daughter Bambi, after previously saying the 20-month-old can 'sense' their split. Opening up to her followers, the influencer said: 'I've had quite a positive day today, this weekend was a lot more positive than I thought it was going to be. 'We went to the soft play this morning and then Tommy picked Bambi up this afternoon, spent the afternoon with her, so things are going well. 'I've not been feeling too bad so I feel like that is a positive.' The boxer is said to be settling down in the six-bed home as the 'first step for his new life', according to The Sun Read More Tommy Fury breaks his silence on 'heartbreaking' split from Molly-Mae Hague and says the 'false allegations about me have been horrendous'... 24 hours after she thanked fans for their support amid cheating rumours Molly-Mae said in her break-up announcement: 'Never in a million years did I think I'd ever have to write this... after five years of being together I never imagined our story would end, especially not this way.' She added: 'I will forever be grateful for the most important thing to me now and always, my beautiful daughter. 'Without us there would be no her, she will always be my priority.' Molly-Mae admitted that she's lonely and bed bound in the wake of her split. In another vlog shared last week, Molly-Mae opened up on life after the break-up, confessing to her fans that weekends are 'horrendous' because it's 'freaking lonely' without her former love. In another video she shared that she had booked a spa day and was looking forward to getting out of the house. She explained: 'I couldn't think of anything worse than just sitting at home all day, especially as that's what I've done for so many days now. 'I've just been sort of house bound, bed bound, Zoe's been coming around to help me a lot with Bambi and also Tommy's been having Bambi as well.' Later in the video, Molly-Mae reflected on how tough it has been to keep herself occupied since Tommy moved out. Speaking to the camera, she said: 'I'm having a day today where I'm trying to stay busy and trying to stay distracted and just trying to find things to do to fill my time. 'And I'm kind of dreading this weekend because I feel like weekends are c**p! 'When you're going through a break-up, I feel like weekends are literally the worst because weekends are for me something I really look forward to, especially when you're in a family because it's family time and memory making time. 'You always do nice things and I don't know, the weekends now are the hardest time because it's freaking lonely and just sad really.' Tommy has denied that he was unfaithful to Molly and the exes are now co-parenting their daughter Bambi She added: 'I'm not really looking forward to this weekend but I feel like every weekend that passes, it should be getting easier - we hope for that.' Molly-Mae, who shares 20-month-old daughter Bambi with Tommy, went on to say: 'In break-ups, there are parts of the days that are definitely worst and better than others. 'Mornings - horrendous. Evenings - horrendous. Weekends for me, horrendous. And then when you're busy in the middle of the day and you're not thinking about things and distracted, that is prime time. That is your few hours of like, okay, I'm not thinking about it. In a recent vlog, Molly-Mae discussed co-parenting daughter Bambi, after previously saying the 20-month-old can 'sense' their split 'And then the minute things slow down...' 'As well for me, you're so used to how life is and when you're in a routine and everything is done with your person, and then I don't know, obviously there's a lot of change and it's really... it's pretty crap.' Molly-Mae then went on to speculate that her fans will wonder why she's making this vlog like 'everything's normal', but that star insisted that this was 'the best way for me to cope with this'.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's memo urges a continued focus on the ideas of freedom as a pathway to regaining the majority in the U.S. House, which remains highly competitive in the homestretch to Election Day.\"It is incumbent on House Democrats to focus on calling out GOP attacks on reproductive freedom, economic freedom, and freedom from violence or fear,\" the memo says. \"In public-facing media, both paid and earned, House Democrats and candidates are engaging and energizing voters with messaging that centers on the fight for our freedoms.\"The memo includes an array of issues in which such a message has been — and can be — utilized. For example, the memo says \"Donald Trump and House Republicans are attacking Americans' freedoms — rolling back reproductive freedoms, banning books in schools, and dictating to people who they are allowed to love or how they can or cannot build a family. These far-right extremists are hellbent on restricting rights and taking away Americans' freedoms.\"The final months of the race for control of the House have featured campaign advertisements, mailings and speeches focused on a variety of wedge issues, including consumer prices, border security, gun control and public safety. The Democratic campaign memo includes a broader argument that concept of \"freedoms\" can be utilized to encompass several pressing issues that are important voters, including women's reproductive rights, the controversial Project 2025 to overhaul the executive branch, the ongoing criticisms of Trump's defense of Jan. 6 Capitol rioters and his baseless claims of 2020 election fraud.\"Across the battlefield, DCCC candidates and 'frontliners' are engaging the issue and working diligently to ensure voters know that electing House Democrats means codifying the protections of Roe, fighting for families and investing in their economic freedom, and standing up to Donald Trump and House Republicans' plans to attack their freedoms,\" the memo says. \"This strong contrast messaging is essential to help Democrats reclaim the House majority to defend our rights, freedoms, democracy, and future.\"Speaking with CBS News between campaign stops in Nebraska, Democratic Congressional candidate Tony Vargas invoked some of his party's messaging on freedom issues.\"This is a Republican party that wants to take away — and tell you — what you can learn,\" Vargas said. \"They want to tell you what you can and cannot do with your body. They're inserting themselves between women's healthcare decisions.\"After meeting with Democratic party volunteers in Dutchess County, New York, last month, Rep. Pat Ryan also emphasized a message that invoked the word freedom. Ryan, a Democrat facing a stiff reelection fight, told CBS News, \"We've seen the far right and Donald Trump double-down and triple-down on taking away rights. \"A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee responded to the Democrats' messaging efforts, telling CBS News that \"the Republican platform is to grant Americans freedom from Kamala Harris' inflation, border, and public safety crises. We will win in November because voters refuse to live in fear of Democrats' effect on their economic and community security.\"","summary":"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's memo urges a continued focus on the ideas of freedom as a pathway to regaining the majority in the House.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-memo-2024-election/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/08/b14517f3-761f-484b-826d-c7bbbe27ef5d/thumbnail/1200x630/e695fc39e0dd8fd9e154930a31f37898/ap22235000886961.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3123858_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:45:08","author":"Scott Macfarlane","authors":["Scott Macfarlane"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":255943538,"title":"Harris says she's ready to debate Trump","text":"BAKU, Azerbaijan, September 9.

Earlier, The New York Times cited the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the Siena Research Institute before the September 10 debate.

The loved-up couple brushed off speculation surrounding their relationship, which was fueled by a leaked fake contract earlier this week, as they watched world No. 1 Jannik Sinner defeat Taylor Fritz in the men's final at Flushing Meadows. Taylor and Travis couldn't keep their hands off each other as they were joined by pals Patrick and Brittany Mahomes in a luxury suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium. However, it seems the Kansas City Chiefs tight end may have had a wandering eye. The NFL star's attention has been called into question by fans on social media who have suggested his focus wasn't entirely on the on-court action - or even his girlfriend. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce put on an extremely PDA-packed display at the US Open Sunday Fans are convinced Travis was watching something on his phone which was propped up Read More Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift head to US Open final in NYC - with Chiefs star's teammate Patrick Mahomes also in town for Jannik Sinner vs Taylor Fritz In several snaps, the three-time Super Bowl winner could be seen with his phone propped up against a US Open commemorative glass, which no doubt was filled with the tournament's infamous Honey Deuce cocktail. The cell phone had been rotated on its side to show the screen in landscape mode, leading many social media sleuths to believe Travis was watching something on it. The Chiefs' NFL action was over and done with Thursday when the reigning Super Bowl champions beat the Baltimore Ravens 27-20 but Sunday's schedule was still packed with Week 1 matchups and fans believe Travis didn't want to miss a minute. 'He’s for sure watching football,' one Taylor Swift fan account posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, alongside a photo which had been zoomed in on Travis's phone. 'Bro seen the Bengals take the L,' another wrote referring to the Chiefs' AFC rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals, and their loss to the New England Patriots Sunday. The Chiefs host the Bengals at Arrowhead Stadium during Week 2's Sunday slate on September 15 and other social media users agreed that Travis was keeping an eye on Joe Burrow and co. in preparation for the clash against one of Kansas City's old AFC Championship nemeses. 'I bet he’s watching the bengals game, they’re losing,' one user posted, while another chimed in adding, 'Studying bengals for next weekend.' However, others theorized that Travis was studying for more than his on-field job. Many social media users claimed the Tight end was keeping an eye on the NFL action 'Gotta be ready for New Heights,' one fan posted, referring to Travis' weekly NFL podcast with brother Jason. The couple's appearance in Queens not only brushed off speculation about their relationship but also dispelled rumors of a rift between Taylor and Brittany, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick. A few weeks after Brittany liked a Donald Trump posts on Instagram, Taylor sparked talk a potential rift with her BFF after choosing not to sit together for the Chiefs' win over the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday. Yet amid fears for their friendship, Swift proved there's no bad blood between them at Flushing Meadow on Sunday. Both Chiefs WAGs were spotted at the US Open final along with partners Travis and Patrick , with the four friends in the house for Sinner's clash against Fritz at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Brittany and Taylor looked in fine spirits as they watched Sinner, the current world No 1, locked horns with the American hopeful for the last Grand Slam title of the year. Unusually, the wife of Kansas City's superstar quarterback and his teammate Travis appeared to be wearing matching Gucci outfits on the day. DailyMail.com revealed at the end of last month that Taylor and Brittany have implemented measures to save their friendship amid mounting speculation that the the latter's support of Trump could cause an explosive feud with the singer. The Kansas City Chiefs star and his popstar girlfriend put on a PDA-packed display Taylor and Brittany Mahomes were back together at the US Open final on Sunday Brittany and Taylor looked in fine spirits as they watched Jannik Sinner vs Taylor Fritz The group posed for a photo together at Arthur Ashe Stadium, ending talk of a potential rift between Brittany and Taylor Fans predicted a huge fallout could be on the cards after Mahomes sparked controversy for liking multiple posts in support of the Republican presidential candidate, 78, ahead of the upcoming election, seemingly going against the views of Swift. However, a source has exclusively told DailyMail.com that they 'respect that they have different views' and have made a 'pact' to avoid discussing politics. 'Taylor is not going to be written into this anti-Brittany narrative because they have made a pact to not discuss politics,' they said. 'They both know it can tear apart friendships and they respect that they have different views.'

That was the one of the main takeaways from the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s more than two-year investigation into America’s chaotic, deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, according to a blistering report released Sunday. “During his decades-long tenure as a Delaware US senator, eight years as vice president of the United States and nearly four years as president, Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the roughly 350-page report asserted. His administration consistently lied to and misled the American public to try to convince them to support his consequences-be-damned view that the US should swiftly end it’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the review said. Former President Donald Trump’s administration had previously created and entered into the Doha Agreement with the Afghan government and the Taliban to end the US war in Afghanistan. But Biden forged ahead with little deference to the terms of the agreement — no matter the cost — though he would later blame the same document for forcing his hand, the report found. The Doha Agreement, formed in 2020, held that the US would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan if the Taliban met certain obligations. For example, the terrorist group was responsible for “cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, ceasing attacks on US and coalition troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces and starting negotiations with the Afghan government,” according to the report. But Biden’s reckless, blind determination pushed aside the agreement’s critical details, the document said. All for show On Feb. 4, 2021, then-State Department spokesman Ned Price announced that the US would begin the review to assess the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement to evaluate whether the US should imminently withdraw from Afghanistan. But “in his testimony before the committee, contrary to his public statement, Mr. Price asserted the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was in fact ‘immaterial’ to the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,” the document found. The administration’s “lies” and “misrepresentations” only continued, the report said. “Missing from press releases was information related to the Taliban’s failure to adhere to the Doha Agreement, the ongoing presence of terrorism in Afghanistan, the capabilities of the Afghan government and military with and without U.S. support, and dissent from NATO allies on the US plan to withdraw,” according to the report. “The Taliban were in breach of key elements of the Doha Agreement, [though] the Biden-Harris administration claimed to be assessing the Taliban’s compliance therewith,” the report said. “In reality, the conditions were entirely irrelevant to them.” Advice ignored Biden made the decision to pull out entirely despite nearly every military official advising against it, the document said. “Despite President Biden’s public assertions to the contrary, our investigation has revealed the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of US Central Command, the secretary of state, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission and United States Forces-Afghanistan all advised against withdrawing all US troops from the country — both during and after the interagency review,” the report said. The Harris-Biden administration also ignored the international community’s concerns, barreling past the objections of other NATO nations that deployed to Afghanistan in support of the US. Even key figures in Afghanistan had pleaded against a total US withdrawal, arguing the landlocked nation simply needed more time to prepare. “General Haibatullah Alizai — former Afghan Army general — informed the committee majority staff that he pleaded for more time from American commanders on the ground, saying, ‘Just tell your leadership to stay with us for two more years. … We’re going to take the initiative … it’s in our favor and we can defeat the Taliban,’ ” the report recounted. Failure to plan Across the board, the report painted a picture of an administration that was heavily fixated on the political optics of the withdrawal while lacking the foresight to plan ahead, even for predictable scenarios. In one striking passage, the report underscored that Biden didn’t officially order a noncombatant evacuation operation — the largest the US had ever pursued in history — until Aug. 16, 2021, a day after Kabul fell to the Taliban and just two weeks before the last US troops left the city. “The failure to prepare for a NEO had ramifications not only for Americans and allies in Afghanistan, but US personnel on the ground forced to evacuate desperate civilians in a hostile environment,” the report said. “Those concerns were sidelined by the Biden-Harris administration in favor of optics. “Rather than concede their negligence, US service members and foreign service officers were directed to prioritize evacuating as many people as possible, no matter the threat posed to their lives.” Implications for Kamala Vice President Kamala Harris was sparingly mentioned in the report, which was one factor that former committee senior investigator Jerry Dunleavy cited in his protest resignation from the probe. “Harris was the last person in the room when President Biden made the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan; a fact she boasted shortly after President Biden issued his go-to-zero order,” the report stressed, pointing to previous public reporting. She was one of 15 administration officials that the report recommended Congress pass a resolution condemning over the debacle. The report’s release comes just two days before Harris’ televised debate against Trump in Philadelphia.Critics such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have accused the panel of timing the report’s release for political purposes. But the panel’s chairman, Michael McCaul (R-Texas), fired back to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “It’s taken me two years to get to this point because of the obstruction — I’ve had to serve subpoena after subpoena.’’ McCaul did fault Trump for one key aspect of the withdrawal — the omission of the Afghan government from negotiations over the Doha Agreement, which occurred under his watch. Fallout Despite the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s decision to release its sprawling report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, its work on the matter is far from over. “We have a lot of unanswered questions regarding the [Department of Defense] … [about] what happened on the ground,” McCaul said. The panel, which conducted 18 transcribed interviews, poured through over 20,000 pages worth of documents and held seven public hearings to produce the scathing report, is also eyeing reforms for the National Security Council and State Department. “Everything we have seen and heard of Chairman McCaul’s latest partisan report shows that it is based on cherry-picked facts, inaccurate characterizations, and pre-existing biases that have plagued this investigation from the start,” said Sharon Yang, a rep for oversight and investigations at the White House.","summary":"WASHINGTON — President Biden was so hellbent on getting out of Afghanistan that he rebuked any advice to the contrary, ignored the pleas of the Afghan government and disregarded objections from US allies.

The scathing report from GOP lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accuses President Joe Biden and his deputies, especially the acting ambassador to Kabul, of botching the 2021 pullout by reducing troop levels while keeping a large embassy staff in place and failing to prepare evacuation plans. The report was based on internal State Department documents and testimony from officials. “Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the committee’s chair. “At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security.” Click here to read the report Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee dismissed the report in advance, saying it was a purely partisan exercise timed for political effect in the final stage of this year’s presidential election. Biden administration officials have defended how they handled the exit and accused former President Donald Trump of tying their hands by agreeing to a flawed deal with the Taliban that committed the U.S. to withdrawing all troops by May 2021. According to experts and former officials, however, while each political party has tried to blame the other, both Trump and Biden share responsibility for the debacle in Afghanistan. Trump reduced American troop levels in Afghanistan from 13,000 to 2,500 after he agreed to a flawed pact with the Taliban, and Biden bungled the execution of the withdrawal itself. Both presidents strongly supported pulling U.S. troops out, ignored the Taliban’s failure to abide by their commitments and rejected advice from military commanders to retain a small U.S. force on the ground. Afghan refugee advocates and former officials say neither the Trump nor the Biden administrations prepared detailed contingency plans for an evacuation of U.S. Embassy staff and Afghan allies. “Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do,” Trump said after Biden announced the withdrawal in April 2021. Trump criticized Biden for not sticking to a May withdrawal deadline and later boasted that he had made it difficult for his successor to reverse his decision to pull out. “I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible,” he said. The last U.S. troops left Afghanistan on Aug. 30, 2021. The House report says many U.S. officials in Kabul tried to convey the dire security situation in the months leading up to the withdrawal but that their superiors played down the warnings and sanitized their memos. The report cited government documents and interviews from an internal State Department “after action report” obtained by the committee. Greg Sherman, a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, recounted how officials watered down memos outlining security threats before they were sent on to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the report said, citing the State Department’s internal review of the withdrawal. “He believed this was done pursuant to the pressure imposed by State Department leaders to keep Embassy Kabul open despite the Taliban’s rapid territorial gains in the spring and summer of 2021,” the report said. After Biden announced in April that all U.S. troops would leave by the end of August, an employee at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul described being stunned that “our posture had not shifted to a point that we could get out relatively easily,” the report said, citing the State Department documents. Embassy staff members “tried to raise these issues in various ways, but post leadership never wanted to hear it,” the report said. By July 13, 2021, 26 officials and staff members at the embassy wrote to senior leadership about their concerns in a “dissent cable,” the State Department’s official channel for expressing internal disagreements. Warning the Afghan government would lose control in Kabul soon after American troops departed, the cable urged the State Department to take its evacuation planning seriously, address the backlog of visa applications from Afghans who worked for the U.S. government and secure the safety of those aiding the embassy in Afghanistan. The report focuses heavily on what it said was a failure by the White House and the State Department to plan for an emergency evacuation of Americans and Afghans out of the country in case of a Taliban takeover. It also criticized what it said was the Biden administration’s failure to promptly order the evacuation once circumstances deteriorated. A State Department employee said that given that the U.S. withdrawal was announced six months in advance, “more should have been done to prepare for the eventuality of the military departure,” the report said, citing the State Department’s internal review. The employee described complete inaction by the embassy and said “not making a decision was the embassy’s decision,” the report said. The report pins much of the blame on the acting ambassador in Kabul, Ross Wilson, alleging he failed to properly plan for a possible emergency evacuation even as the Afghan government’s survival appeared increasingly tenuous. As the security situation deteriorated and U.S. troop levels dramatically declined, Wilson increased embassy staffing and resisted repeated appeals from military commanders to formally request an evacuation of civilian personnel. In previous testimony to the committee, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time of the withdrawal, said the State Department’s decision not to request an evacuation of personnel until Aug. 15 — the day Kabul fell to the Taliban — was a “fundamental mistake” that led to the frenzied scenes at the Kabul airport. Wilson, in previous testimony to the committee, defended his actions and the timing of his request for an evacuation, arguing that the embassy staff could not have helped Afghans trying to get out had they left earlier. “I’m comfortable with the conclusion that I came to when I came to it,” Wilson said. The report criticized the embassy and the State Department over the plight of tens of thousands of Afghans who had worked as interpreters or in other jobs for the U.S. military or government but could not gain entry to the airport, even though they had the proper paperwork. In the months leading up to the withdrawal, the State Department never defined the size of the Afghan population that was eligible for evacuation or how their cases could be handled, the report said. It was not until late July — weeks before the Taliban seized power — that the State Department launched an operation to start flying out Afghans who were promised special immigrant visas. Instead, amid the confusion at the airport, significant numbers of Afghans with no work histories for the U.S. government were able to secure spots on flights out of Kabul, the report said. Much of the criticism of the Biden administration in the report has been expressed by Republican lawmakers previously in the years since the withdrawal. Trump’s role The report offers muted criticism of the Trump administration. Trump, who at one point ordered a complete withdrawal before his advisers persuaded him otherwise, reduced the troop footprint to 2,500 by the time he left office, even though the Taliban had failed to live up its promises to reduce violence and cut ties with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Trump also privately proposed that the leaders of the Taliban be invited for peace talks at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. The report singles out Trump’s envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad — who negotiated the agreement that committed the U.S. to pulling out — for criticism. It accuses Khalilzad of trusting the Taliban’s written promises despite evidence they were not fulfilling their commitments, and it says Khalilzad undermined the Afghan government’s legitimacy by shutting them out of negotiations. U.S. officials had hoped that the Afghan government would still be in control by the time American troops departed by a scheduled September deadline, but the Afghan army rapidly collapsed as U.S. forces — and contractors — departed. By the time the evacuation launched, the Taliban controlled Kabul, and there was growing concern about a possible security breakdown or a terrorist attack at the airport. As a result, the Afghans who worked at the embassy for years became a low priority as officials focused on trying to get State Department employees onto waiting aircraft, the report said. A State Department employee said embassy leadership “failed” the local staff. “They weren’t prioritized,” the employee said, according to the report. At one point, a group of Afghan staff members who had made it into the airport and were expecting to be evacuated were escorted out, the report said. The fears of a terrorist attack on the crowds at the airport were realized when a suicide bomber killed 170 civilians and 13 U.S. military personnel in what became known as the Abbey Gate bombing. The Afghan ISIS affiliate known as ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn the months before the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden administration&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New report from House GOP states that Biden officials reduced warnings about deteriorating security before withdrawing from Afghanistan. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-report-from-house-gop-states-that-biden-officials-reduced-warnings-about-deteriorating-security-before-withdrawing-from-afghanistan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Biden-officials-watered-down-warnings-about-crumbling.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:30:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.611},{"id":255944276,"title":"LIVE@12:45pm – The Politics of Desperation – Trump, Netanyahu, Maduro, Ortega","text":"The LIVE Recording of A View from Afar podcast will begin today at 12:45pm September 9, 2024 (NZST) which is Sunday evening, 8:45pm (USEDT). Building upon recent episodes of A View from Afar, Political Scientist Paul G Buchanan and journalist Selwyn Manning will discuss The Politics of Desperation. This episode flows on from our discussions about long transitions and the moment of friction. As the old status quo begins to crumble (under the weight of fraction), political leaders and elites invested in it get increasingly desperate, leading to more dangerous decisions, more acute moments, and, increased chances of mistake, miscalculation and unanticipated backlash. The Politics of Desperation accentuates an ongoing downward spiral. And, the Politics of Desperation takes form in differing degrees. For some, the risk of losing is merely a dent in the leader’s ego, reputation, and an awakening that voters have moved on from their style of politics. But for others, a loss will prove to be devastating, for example; should Donald Trump lose his bid to regain the United States presidency, he will face sentencing as a felon and perhaps even face jail time. For Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu, a future loss or a collapse of his right-wing coalition would likely see him facing domestic charges and possibly charges laid by the International Criminal Court for his role in the disproportionate use of military might in Israel’s war on Gaza. So today, Paul and Selwyn will discuss the examples of the Politics of Desperation from around the world and assess the risks as the world rests on the cusp of an unknown future.

If you haven’t seen it the new Times/Siena poll shows Donald Trump with a one point lead over Harris nationally. That’s the first major poll to show Trump in the lead in weeks. What do I make of it? Not a huge amount. And I would recommend the same to anyone else. It’s certainly possible that this is a leading indicator of a shift in support away from Harris after a month and a half of generally positive news and poll numbers. But you simply can’t change your whole theory of the race around a single poll. I’m not going to get into picking apart all the details of the poll. And I’m definitely not going to try to unskew it. It’s a quality poll. But it does show a very different race than other polls we’re seeing – ones taken over the same time period, ones with which we’re able to make pretty straightforward apples to apples comparisons. It’ not just the top line number that’s different. It shows a more popular Trump, a less popular Harris, key demographics much closer to how they were when Joe Biden was still the nominee. Like I said, you just can’t put so much stock in a single poll unless the basic trends are confirmed by other polls. There’s one thing I would especially stress and that is that, as often with the Times/Sienna poll, there’s this great urge people have to develop theories of the race based on this specific poll and its crosstabs. That’s a mistake. She needs to do more interviews. She needs to come out with new policy proposals. She needs to shift more to the center. She’s moving to the center on too many issues.

De Niro kicked off the event — hosted by comedian Paul Mecurio, former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Providence, R.I., Mayor Joseph Paolino Jr. — by saying he’s hopeful that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win the 2024 presidential election but warned that their supporters should not get complacent. “I’m very optimistic about it all,” he said. “I’m very excited, but to me, it ain’t over till it’s over. So we can’t for one second think that we’re ahead of this thing. We just have to be on it all the time until the very end because they’re going to try everything when the election day comes. When will these things be final? What will they question? What will they play games about? We know it’s coming, we see it coming. We have to just be ever vigilant, and it’s not over till it’s over.” De Niro also said he hopes that, if the Democratic ticket of Harris and Walz beats the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance, that there won’t be a repeat of the January 6 Capitol riot. “Hopefully, if God willing that it’s Kamala and Walz, that the ones who make the big thing and what happened [on] January 6, I think people will think twice about doing something about that no matter what Trump says, because … people pay a price, and is it worth it for them? Especially following someone like him? You know, it’s just insane.” De Niro added that he hopes some Trump supporters will see something in the Harris-Walz ticket that speaks to them. “I think people who would normally support Trump … could very well see that that there is a way with them that’s more for them than with Trump because Trump doesn’t offer anything,” he added. “And we’ve seen this before in other countries and other societies and other times in history, they think they can control someone like him. But once he becomes the boss … if God forbid, he becomes the boss, all the people who thought they could control him, they’re gonna find out differently.” Steve Buscemi also spoke during the event, calling Harris “smart, strong, kind, tough, inclusive [and] uniquely qualified.” “There’s, there’s so many issues and policies at stake: affordable health care education, meaningful green initiatives, enacting sensible gun laws,” he said. “I don’t understand why we are banning books and not automatic weapons. And of course a woman’s right to choose so important and respecting people’s choices to not have kids. Everyone has a stake in our future. Sorry JD.” Buscemi also shared his concerns about a second Trump presidency. “We know that there’s no perfect candidates or politicians or presidents and we’re not always going to agree with every policy and decision, foreign or domestic, and that’s OK,” he added. “We still have free speech in this country and the right to peacefully protest, and voting is a right that we should never take for granted. And of course, what worries me about another Trump administration is that … he’s a my-way-or-the-highway type of guy. He says he only hires the best people but he actually fired most of his best people. And he’s just going to surround himself this time, if he’s elected, with people who are just 100 percent loyal to him and his ways. And we know all too well, he’ll do anything to stay in power including inciting violence.” Other Hollywood stars expected to appear on the live stream are Mark Ruffalo, Alyssa Milano, Lorraine Bracco, Lisa Ann Walter, Marisa Tomei, John Turturro and Patti LuPone.

Covertly taped by an undercover righty, Chief of Public Affairs Nicholas Biase slammed the case as “nonsense” and a “perversion of justice,” accusing Bragg of “stacking charges [against Trump] and, like, rearranging things just to make it fit a case.” Secretly recording private conversations for a “gotcha” is slimy (we’ve said before), but Biase’s comments prove what Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Turley have long warned: Bragg’s case never made any sense to begin with. Bragg twisted what should have been, at most, a misdemeanor into a typhoon of felonies by claiming Trump intended to defraud voters in the 2016 election when he repaid Michael Cohen in 2017 to cover his (perfectly legal) go-away payment to Stormy Daniels the year before. Biase guessed the persecution is all about Bragg’s ambitions: “He wants to be, something … a mayor? I’m not sure what he wants to be, but I know he’s not happy just being the DA of New York County.” That is: It was never about justice for Bragg, but scoring with Democratic voters and politicians. Biase stated more of the obvious: Democrats are “obsessed with getting” Trump because “it affects his candidacy if he’s a convicted felon.” And Fulton County, Ga., DA Fani Willis’ case against Trump is “a mockery of justice,” he added; “the whole thing is disgusting.” Biase is now in clean-up mode, with fulsome apologies and excuses: Getting caught telling the truth won’t help his career. We expect most of the legal community is silent out of similar fears, even as the worst characters look forward to boosting their own fortunes by weaponizing the justice system against future Democratic targets. And never mind how badly it undermines the rule of law and public trust in the courts.

Republicans were racing against the political clock to release their report before the next Congress, which polling shows could be either party’s game. Though Biden is no longer the Democratic presidential nominee, the report does seek to tie Harris to the decisions of the commander-in-chief, and Foreign Affairs committee staff noted they couldn’t find any evidence that she disagreed with his decisions. The GOP Foreign Affairs Committee staff told reporters that because the Biden administration has referred to itself as the “Biden-Harris” administration, the committee decided to call the administration as such in their report. The committee held seven public hearings for their investigation into the withdrawal, as well as conducted 18 transcribed interviews with members of the Biden-Harris administration and military officials in charge of overseeing the withdrawal. The committee noted in its report that it analyzed over 20,000 pages of documents provided by the State Department. McCaul said in a statement that he would have preferred for the report to be released “earlier than today” and blamed congressional Democrats for providing “political cover” for the Biden-Harris administration. “Anyone who reads this report will be able to see that we conducted this investigation with integrity, not drawing conclusion ahead of time but rather looking at the facts and evidence we collected,” McCaul said. “The report is simply a recitation of those facts and evidence. This is not about politics to me — it never has been. It’s about getting to the bottom of what happened so we can make sure it never happens again. And it’s about finding who was responsible for this catastrophe so they can finally, after three long years, be held accountable.” Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to Biden’s decision to withdraw The committee found that Biden was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan “no matter the cost” and ignored the Doha Agreement, a conditions-based deal struck between the Taliban and the administration under former President Donald Trump in February 2020. Under the agreement, the U.S. would withdraw troops from the country if the Taliban met certain obligations, such as cutting ties with al Qaeda, ceasing attacks on U.S. troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces, and starting negotiations with the Afghan government. By late 2020, it was evident that the Taliban was violating the terms of the agreement, forcing Trump to keep 2,500 troops in the country until he left office in January 2021. Because the Doha Agreement had been violated, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans said in a call with reporters ahead of the report’s release that Biden could have maintained the Doha Agreement and kept U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Instead, he initiated a “go to zero” withdrawal with no plans to mitigate any fallout, the committee determined. The majority said even the Afghan government asked the Biden-Harris administration to tear up the Doha Agreement, but documents reviewed by the committee found that the president was determined to leave no matter what. Col. Seth Krummrich, chief of staff for Special Operations Command (SOCOM), told the committee in an interview that military advisers told Biden that if the U.S. withdraws, “the Taliban are going to come pouring in and there’s nothing that’s going to stop them.” Documents showed Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also called on Biden to keep between 2,500 and 4,500 U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “The president decided we’re gonna leave, and he’s not listening to anybody,” Krummrich said. Ned Price, then-spokesperson for the State Department, admitted in testimony to the committee that the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to the administration’s decision to withdraw. Biden-Harris administration prioritized optics over U.S. troop and employee security The committee stressed throughout its report that the Biden-Harris administration was worried primarily over the optics of the withdrawal rather than protecting U.S. troops and embassy employees. Documents, interviews, and communications reviewed found that the administration did not prepare for worst-case scenarios, which the GOP said negates the claim the administration didn’t want to alert the Afghan government the U.S. was leaving. The committee noted there were conflicting reports on whether Afghan military officials were aware that Americans were pulling out of the Bagram air base. General Mir Asadullah Kohistani, who took over command of Bagram for the Afghan military, said he heard a “rumor” about the departure, and then “by seven o’clock in the morning, we understood that it was confirmed they had already left Bagram.” His account was confirmed by another Bagram official, arguing the departure was done “without proper coordination with local Afghan officials.” Gen. Frank McKenzie, who oversaw the withdrawal, disputed these claims to the committee, asserting, “We did this in close coordination with our allies and partners. Every departure of every element was carefully synchronized across the coalition and with our Afghan partners. On no occasion were they caught unaware by our movements.” Notes from a National Security Council meeting found that the U.S. government had still not determined who would be eligible for evacuation, nor found third-party countries to serve as transit points for evacuation, at the time the Taliban had surrounded Kabul on Aug. 14, 2021, per the report. Administration’s lack of plans led to service member deaths and classified information in Taliban hands Another large component of the withdrawal failures, the committee noted, was that the administration did not prepare for a noncombat evacuation operation or NEO. The NEO was not formerly ordered until Aug. 16, days after the Taliban had taken control of Kabul. The GOP committee told reporters every single witness told them that the State Department and Biden-Harris administration did not plan for a Taliban takeover. The committee argues in its report that the Biden administration was more concerned with maintaining a large U.S. Embassy presence over embassy personnel safety, so much so that Ambassador Ross L. Wilson ignored pleas from Austin to call for a NEO. Documents and interviews determined that Wilson said a NEO was not necessary, despite the presence of the Taliban meeting the criteria for one. A U.S. military officer recalled Wilson saying, “I am maniacal about the Embassy remaining in Kabul,” per the report. Because no advanced planning or notice was given, foreign service officers at the embassy have attested that classified documents and other materials were left in the Taliban’s possession. Wilson was told that he had less than 72 hours to get all information destroyed. According to the report, the Taliban’s arrival at the embassy caused panic, devolving into officials filling Tupperware containers with passports and visa foils to burn so that the terrorist organization could not obtain them. During the evacuation, Taliban checkpoints were set up. On Aug. 15, one day after the Taliban entered Kabul, the State Department offered advice to hide at home and “not travel to the airport until you have been informed by email that departure options exist.” When Americans or Afghan citizens who did not have a blue passport attempted to enter the checkpoints, they were “brutalized” by the Taliban. Servicemembers were reportedly forbidden from intervening to stop the Taliban’s brutal actions against Afghans, stating that U.S. troops had to watch the Taliban burn women and execute civilians. Wilson himself faced scrutiny for the evacuation after he tested positive for COVID-19. The New York Times had reported in September that year that he tested positive for the virus and that in a rush to complete the evacuation, military officials had scrambled to put a system in place to screen those airlifted out of Afghanistan for the virus. The committee said in its report that Wilson got a foreign service officer to take a test for him to produce a negative result in order to leave the country. U.S. national security degraded after the withdrawal The committee concluded that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and therefore a withdrawal of U.S. surveillance and detection, opened the door for the country to become a haven for al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. Afterward, the majority said, America’s standing was “severely damaged.” In a tie to 2024 political discourse, the committee worked to tie the influx of illegal immigrants at the southern border to the withdrawal of Afghanistan. In June, eight suspected terrorists who were on the FBI’s Joint Terrorist Task Force radar were arrested in New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. The men, who had ties to ISIS-K, were from Tajikistan and all crossed through the southern border, with their background checks coming back clean, per NBC News. In the report, the committee notes that current U.S. Central Command Commander Michael Kurilla testified in 2023 that the Defense Department “lacks the granularity to see the full picture” in Afghanistan. He also agreed in a March 2024 interview that the country is now a “hotbed” for terrorism with limited U.S. insights into Afghanistan due to the withdrawal. The committee also noted that the Biden-Harris administration has not conducted a strike against ISIS-K since 2021, “which stands in stark contrast to the 313 operations carried out by CENTCOM against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in 2022.” McKenzie released a warning in 2022 that ISIS-K may gain strength and be emboldened to target neighboring countries in an effort to expand operations. Since the withdrawal, ISIS-K has conducted several terrorist attacks in Kabul, including a suicide bombing at a military hospital, a bombing outside the Russian embassy, and an attack on the Pakistani embassy, per the report. Committee accuses Biden-Harris administration of purposely misleading Americans on withdrawal The committee said the State Department watered down or completely rewrote reports and action memoranda that warned of security threats to U.S. embassy staff and the U.S.’s mission in Afghanistan. In a recent interview with the committee, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said no one anticipated the fall of Kabul but was presented with real-time assessments from McKenzie and Gen. Austin Miller that said whether the city would fall was a matter of “when,” not “if.” When presented with the information, Psaki said, “I answered the question based on the information I had available at the time, which is what we were all basing the information on.” The committee plans to release more reports from their investigation as new information comes to light, the majority said. Most recently, McCaul subpoenaed Secretary of State Antony Blinken over his refusal to testify on the withdrawal. In a letter from McCaul, he said Blinken was asked to appear in a letter on Aug. 12. The letter said Blinken instead repeatedly requested phone calls to delay. Blinken is asked to testify before the committee on Sept. 19 at 10 a.m. “Every single document and every single word of testimony we received from administration officials were obtained only after a subpoena being served, or a threat of contempt of Congress,” McCaul said. “To this day, Secretary Blinken and NSA [Jake] Sullivan continue to refuse to testify before this committee. I want to be clear — I will use every tool in my belt to compel both men to answer for the catastrophic failure of epic proportions their decisions caused.”","summary":"The Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee released a lengthy report Sunday on its investigation into the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, with the report detailing preparation failures and department-level mistakes that led to the deaths of 13 service members.

That was the one of the main takeaways from the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s more than two-year investigation into America’s chaotic, deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, according to a blistering report released Sunday. “During his decades-long tenure as a Delaware US senator, eight years as vice president of the United States and nearly four years as president, Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the roughly 350-page report asserted. His administration consistently lied to and misled the American public to try to convince them to support his consequences-be-damned view that the US should swiftly end it’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the review said. Former President Donald Trump’s administration had previously created and entered into the Doha Agreement with the Afghan government and the Taliban to end the US war in Afghanistan. But Biden forged ahead with little deference to the terms of the agreement — no matter the cost — though he would later blame the same document for forcing his hand, the report found. The Doha Agreement, formed in 2020, held that the US would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan if the Taliban met certain obligations. For example, the terrorist group was responsible for “cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, ceasing attacks on US and coalition troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces and starting negotiations with the Afghan government,” according to the report. But Biden’s reckless, blind determination pushed aside the agreement’s critical details, the document said. All for show On Feb. 4, 2021, then-State Department spokesman Ned Price announced that the US would begin the review to assess the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement to evaluate whether the US should imminently withdraw from Afghanistan. But “in his testimony before the committee, contrary to his public statement, Mr. Price asserted the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was in fact ‘immaterial’ to the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,” the document found. The administration’s “lies” and “misrepresentations” only continued, the report said. “Missing from press releases was information related to the Taliban’s failure to adhere to the Doha Agreement, the ongoing presence of terrorism in Afghanistan, the capabilities of the Afghan government and military with and without U.S. support, and dissent from NATO allies on the US plan to withdraw,” according to the report. “The Taliban were in breach of key elements of the Doha Agreement, [though] the Biden-Harris administration claimed to be assessing the Taliban’s compliance therewith,” the report said. “In reality, the conditions were entirely irrelevant to them.” Advice ignored Biden made the decision to pull out entirely despite nearly every military official advising against it, the document said. “Despite President Biden’s public assertions to the contrary, our investigation has revealed the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of US Central Command, the secretary of state, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission and United States Forces-Afghanistan all advised against withdrawing all US troops from the country — both during and after the interagency review,” the report said. The Harris-Biden administration also ignored the international community’s concerns, barreling past the objections of other NATO nations that deployed to Afghanistan in support of the US. Even key figures in Afghanistan had pleaded against a total US withdrawal, arguing the landlocked nation simply needed more time to prepare. “General Haibatullah Alizai — former Afghan Army general — informed the committee majority staff that he pleaded for more time from American commanders on the ground, saying, ‘Just tell your leadership to stay with us for two more years. … We’re going to take the initiative … it’s in our favor and we can defeat the Taliban,’ ” the report recounted. Failure to plan Across the board, the report painted a picture of an administration that was heavily fixated on the political optics of the withdrawal while lacking the foresight to plan ahead, even for predictable scenarios. In one striking passage, the report underscored that Biden didn’t officially order a noncombatant evacuation operation — the largest the US had ever pursued in history — until Aug. 16, 2021, a day after Kabul fell to the Taliban and just two weeks before the last US troops left the city. “The failure to prepare for a NEO had ramifications not only for Americans and allies in Afghanistan, but US personnel on the ground forced to evacuate desperate civilians in a hostile environment,” the report said. “Those concerns were sidelined by the Biden-Harris administration in favor of optics. “Rather than concede their negligence, US service members and foreign service officers were directed to prioritize evacuating as many people as possible, no matter the threat posed to their lives.” Implications for Kamala Vice President Kamala Harris was sparingly mentioned in the report, which was one factor that former committee senior investigator Jerry Dunleavy cited in his protest resignation from the probe. “Harris was the last person in the room when President Biden made the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan; a fact she boasted shortly after President Biden issued his go-to-zero order,” the report stressed, pointing to previous public reporting. She was one of 15 administration officials that the report recommended Congress pass a resolution condemning over the debacle. The report’s release comes just two days before Harris’ televised debate against Trump in Philadelphia.Critics such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have accused the panel of timing the report’s release for political purposes. But the panel’s chairman, Michael McCaul (R-Texas), fired back to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “It’s taken me two years to get to this point because of the obstruction — I’ve had to serve subpoena after subpoena.’’ McCaul did fault Trump for one key aspect of the withdrawal — the omission of the Afghan government from negotiations over the Doha Agreement, which occurred under his watch. Fallout Despite the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s decision to release its sprawling report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, its work on the matter is far from over. “We have a lot of unanswered questions regarding the [Department of Defense] … [about] what happened on the ground,” McCaul said. The panel, which conducted 18 transcribed interviews, poured through over 20,000 pages worth of documents and held seven public hearings to produce the scathing report, is also eyeing reforms for the National Security Council and State Department. “Everything we have seen and heard of Chairman McCaul’s latest partisan report shows that it is based on cherry-picked facts, inaccurate characterizations, and pre-existing biases that have plagued this investigation from the start,” said Sharon Yang, a rep for oversight and investigations at the White House.","summary":"\"Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the report asserted.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/us-news/biden-was-hellbent-on-leaving-afghanistan-ignoring-military-advice-nato-objections-and-afghan-pleas-house-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89097919.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QmTwTW8k-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:12:53","author":"Caitlin Doornbos,Ryan King","authors":["Caitlin Doornbos","Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":255942526,"title":"NY House races could determine whether GOP or Dems control Congress","text":"Several hotly contested New York congressional races could decide which party controls Congress for the next years — after the Empire State surpisingly titled the balance in favor of the GOP two years ago. There are now 220 Republicans and 211 Democrats as the GOP looks to hold onto power in the Nov. 5 elections while Democrats are looking to reclaim the gavel in a deeply blue state with presidential pick Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. Four GOP wins in New York’s swing districts in the 2022 midterm elections helped secure the GOP majority, but now those first-term incumbents face tough re-election fights. Three other races are deemed potentially competitive. The Democrats regained one seat in a February special election, when Rep. Tom Suozzi won back House District 3 covering parts of Nassau County and Queens vacated when serial fibber and convicted crook — first-term Republican Rep. George Santos — was expelled from office. Suozzi had previously represented the district but did not seek re-election in 2022 as he launched an ill-fated run for governor. Key factors in the races this year will include how well former Republican President Donald Trump and Harris fare at the top of the ticket in the purple districts — and how that will affect down ballot races, political insiders said. It’s also the first presidential election since the U.S. Supreme overturned the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling, largely leaving abortion legislation up to state governments. Over the summer, the Super Pac for the Democratic Congressional Committee and other allied groups came out swinging — running million of dollars in TV ads attacking Republicans as anti-women. The incumbents’ campaigns ran counter ads saying they oppose imposing a national ban on abortion. New York has one of the nation’s strongest abortion rights laws. Republicans say the voters are with them on the major bread-and-butter issue and will put Democrats on the defensive on the inflation-impacted economy during the Harris-Biden years, crime and illegal immigration. Democrats are bullish about picking up seats. “Eight weeks out from Election Day, New York Democrats are building formidable campaigns to reach every voter possible across Long Island, the Hudson Valley, and Central New York,” said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Ellie Dougherty. “Meanwhile, their Republican opponents are running on a disastrous record of restricting abortion rights, slashing Social Security and Medicare, and defunding law enforcement — which is why they’re panicking about their increasing money gap and losing momentum in these swing House races,” State Republican Party chairman Ed Cox said the major issues a broad swath of voters care about — the economy, illegal immigration and crime — favor Repubilcans. “The impact of inflation has cut into the incomes of workers by 5% to 15%,” Cox said.

But that’s what happened to Dawn Allen, who lost her son to a fentanyl overdose, and who is now listening more closely to former President Donald Trump’s tough talk on the border: Dawn Allen wasn’t just a voting booth Democrat — she knocked on doors and donated money, including to President Joe Biden. But after her son died from fentanyl poisoning last year, she grew frustrated by what she viewed as Biden’s hands-off approach to the opioid crisis. Now she says she won’t vote for a Democrat, and she finds herself more in line with the candidate who has focused sharply on the deadly fentanyl epidemic: former President Donald Trump.“It feels like a really bad breakup,” the 47-year-old mother of three other children said from her home in a Chicago suburb. “I’m really, really hurt.” This is heartbreaking. Dawn Allen’s son won’t be carrying on her family’s legacy, and it’s because of a pernicious drug that is flowing into our country across the southern border by the carload. Now, the mom says she’s starting to see some sense in what Trump is saying, the NBC News piece, linked above, reports: Trump speaks about fentanyl frequently; Harris less so.“We’ll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks, and bloodthirsty cartels. And we will stop the fentanyl,” Trump said during a recent campaign appearance in Michigan. Trump has called for expanding the death penalty for drug dealers, using the military to target Mexican cartels and halting illegal border crossings to stop the importation of the drug. That first line in that quote is something of an understatement; Kamala Harris has barely spoken about the fentanyl crisis at all. And isn’t she supposed to be in charge of something to do with the border? Finding “root causes” of the border invasion, and so on? Sure seems like someone would want to spend some time looking into the massive profit motive of smuggling illegal drugs as a cause.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThere&#8217;s an old saying that goes, &#8220;A conservative is a liberal who&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Realizing the Truth: Mother Advocating for Biden, Considers Trump&#8217;s Perspective After Son&#8217;s Fentanyl Overdose first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/realizing-the-truth-mother-advocating-for-biden-considers-trumps-perspective-after-sons-fentanyl-overdose/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Mugged-by-Reality-Mom-Whose-Son-Died.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:03:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.463},{"id":255942650,"title":"Biden officials watered down warnings about crumbling security before Afghan exit, House GOP report says","text":"In the months before the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden administration officials “watered down” warnings about crumbling security and failed to launch an emergency evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies until it was too late, says a new report by House Republicans. The scathing report from GOP lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accuses President Joe Biden and his deputies, especially the acting ambassador to Kabul, of botching the 2021 pullout by reducing troop levels while keeping a large embassy staff in place and failing to prepare evacuation plans. The report was based on internal State Department documents and testimony from officials. “Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the committee's chair. \"At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security.\" Click here to read the report Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee dismissed the report in advance, saying it was a purely partisan exercise timed for political effect in the final stage of this year’s presidential election. Biden administration officials have defended how they handled the exit and accused former President Donald Trump of tying their hands by agreeing to a flawed deal with the Taliban that committed the U.S. to withdrawing all troops by May 2021. According to experts and former officials, however, while each political party has tried to blame the other, both Trump and Biden share responsibility for the debacle in Afghanistan. Trump reduced American troop levels in Afghanistan from 13,000 to 2,500 after agreeing to a flawed pact with the Taliban and Biden bungled the execution of the withdrawal itself. Both presidents strongly supported pulling U.S. troops out, ignored the Taliban’s failure to abide by their commitments and rejected advice from military commanders to retain a small U.S. force on the ground. Afghan refugee advocates and former officials say neither the Trump nor the Biden administration prepared detailed contingency plans for an evacuation of U.S. Embassy staff and Afghan allies. “Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do,” Trump said after Biden announced the withdrawal in April 2021. Trump criticized Biden for not sticking to a May withdrawal deadline and later boasted that he had made it difficult for his successor to reverse his decision to pull out. “I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible,” Trump said. The last U.S. troops left Afghanistan on Aug. 30, 2021. The House report says many U.S. officials in Kabul tried to convey the dire security situation in the months leading up to the withdrawal, but their superiors played down the warnings and sanitized their memos. The report cited government documents and interviews from an internal State Department “after action report” obtained by the committee. Greg Sherman, a senior official in the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, recounted how memos outlining security threats were watered down by officials before being sent on to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the report said, citing the State Department’s internal review of the withdrawal. “He believed this was done pursuant to the pressure imposed by State Department leaders to keep Embassy Kabul open despite the Taliban’s rapid territorial gains in the spring and summer of 2021,” the report said. After Biden announced in April that all U.S. troops would leave by the end of August, one employee at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul described being stunned “our posture had not shifted to a point that we could get out relatively easily,” the report said, citing the State Department documents. Embassy staff “tried to raise these issues in various ways, but post leadership never wanted to hear it,” the report said. By July 13, 2021, 26 officials and staff at the embassy wrote to senior leadership about their concerns in a “dissent cable,” the State Department’s official channel for expressing internal disagreements. Warning the Afghan government would lose control in Kabul soon after American troops departed, the cable urged the State Department to take seriously its evacuation planning, address the backlog of visa applications from Afghans who worked for the U.S. government and secure the safety of those aiding the embassy in Afghanistan. The report focuses heavily on what it said was a failure by the White House and the State Department to plan for an emergency evacuation of Americans and Afghans out of the country in case of a Taliban takeover. It also criticized what it said was the Biden administration’s failure to promptly order the evacuation once circumstances deteriorated. One State Department employee said that given that the U.S. withdrawal was announced six months in advance, “more should have been done to prepare for the eventuality of the military departure,” the report said, citing the State Department’s internal review. The employee described complete inaction by the embassy, and that “not making a decision was the embassy’s decision,” the report said. The report pins much of the blame on the acting ambassador in Kabul, Ross Wilson, alleging he failed to properly plan for a possible emergency evacuation even as the Afghan government’s survival appeared increasingly tenuous. As the security situation deteriorated and U.S. troop levels dramatically declined, Wilson increased embassy staffing and resisted repeated appeals from military commanders to formally request an evacuation of civilian personnel. In previous testimony to the committee, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time of the withdrawal, said the State Department’s decision not to request an evacuation of personnel until Aug. 15 — the day Kabul fell to the Taliban — was a “fundamental mistake” that led to the frenzied scenes at the Kabul airport. Wilson, in previous testimony to the committee, defended his actions and the timing of his request for an evacuation, arguing that the embassy staff could not have helped Afghans trying to get out if they had left earlier. “I’m comfortable with the conclusion that I came to when I came to it,” Wilson said. The report criticized the embassy and the State Department over the plight of tens of thousands of Afghans who had worked as interpreters or in other jobs for the U.S. military or government but could not gain entry to the airport, even though they had the proper paperwork. In the months leading up to the withdrawal, the State Department never defined the size of the Afghan population that was eligible for evacuation or how their cases could be handled, the report said. It was not until late July — weeks before the Taliban seized power — that the State Department launched an operation to start flying out Afghans who were promised special immigrant visas. Instead, amid the confusion at the airport, significant numbers of Afghans with no work history for the U.S. government were able to secure a spot on flights out of Kabul, the report said. Much of the criticism of the Biden administration in the report has been expressed by Republican lawmakers previously in the years since the withdrawal. Trump's role The report offers muted criticism of the Trump administration. Trump, who at one point ordered a complete withdrawal before his advisers persuaded him otherwise, reduced the troop footprint to 2,500 by the time he left office, even though the Taliban had failed to live up its promises to reduce violence and cut ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Trump also privately proposed that the leaders of the Taliban be invited to Camp David for peace talks. The report singles out Trump’s envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad — who negotiated the agreement that committed the U.S. to pulling out — for criticism. It accuses Khalilzad of trusting the Taliban’s written promises despite evidence they were not fulfilling their commitments, and says Khalilzad undermined the Afghan government’s legitimacy by shutting them out of negotiations. U.S. officials had hoped that the Afghan government would still be in control by the time American troops departed by a scheduled September deadline, but the Afghan army rapidly collapsed as U.S. forces — and contractors — departed. By the time the evacuation launched, the Taliban controlled Kabul, and there was growing concern about a possible security breakdown or a terrorist attack at the airport. As a result, the Afghans who worked at the embassy for years became a low priority as officials focused on trying to get State Department employees onto waiting aircraft, the report said. One State Department employee said that embassy leadership “failed” the local staff. “They weren’t prioritized,” the employee said, according to the report. At one point, a group of Afghan staff who had made it into the airport and were expecting to be evacuated were escorted out, the report said. The fears of a terrorist attack on the crowds at the airport were realized when a suicide bomber killed 170 civilians and 13 U.S. military personnel in what became known as the Abbey Gate bombing. The Afghan ISIS affiliate known as ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack.","summary":"In a new report, House Republicans say Biden administration officials watered down warnings about crumbling security in Afghanistan and botched the U.S. withdrawal.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/biden-officials-warnings-crumbling-security-afghan-withdrawal-rcna170121","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240908-us-air-force-kabul-afghanistan-vl-206p-8578e0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:50:53","author":"Dan De Luce","authors":["Dan De Luce"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":255941808,"title":"Nikki Haley says JD Vance’s ‘childless cat ladies’ slur is ‘not helpful’","text":"Former Trump UN Ambassador Nikki Haley acknowledged during a Sunday interview that JD Vance’s comments about “childless cat ladies” are not “helpful.” Vance has faced criticism for a number of unearthed comments from his past, most notably for telling Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio Cortez] — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” he said. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Harris has two stepchildren and Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, adopted twins in August 2021. Appearing on Face the Nation, Haley said: “No, it is not helpful to talk about whether women have children or whether they don’t. It’s not helpful to say any of those things that are personality-driven, or anything else.” “I’ve said that now, will continue to say to Republicans, ‘Stop it. That’s not helpful. You know, if you want to talk about things, stick with policy,’” she added. The former South Carolina governor also referenced other Vance comments from 2021 regarding the leader of a teacher’s union, whom Vance said should have “her own” children if she wants to “brainwash” students in school. Haley noted that while she’s backing former President Donald Trump on policy, she disagrees with his personal style. She added that she also departs from Trump on child tax credits, instead supporting more widespread tax cuts. Haley said that she also disagrees with mandating that insurance companies or the government pay for fertility treatments. She noted that she hasn’t been asked to support Trump on the campaign trail or to advise on debate preparations ahead of Tuesday’s showdown, but added that she’s “happy to be helpful” if her aid was requested. Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney sharply criticized Haley for backing Trump during an appearance on ABC’s This Week on Sunday. “I can’t understand her position on this in any kind of a principled way,” Cheney said. “I think that the things that she said, that she made clear when she was running in the primary, those things are true,” she added. During the primary, Haley slammed Trump as unqualified to serve in the nation’s highest office, but since dropping out has changed to a more supportive tune. “Those of us who have fidelity to the Constitution, have a responsibility and a duty to recognize [that] this is not about partisan politics,” Cheney said.","summary":"‘If you want to talk about things, stick with policy,’ former Trump UN ambassador tells fellow Republicans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/nikki-haley-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-b2609200.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/08/22/SEI218406254.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bkkCTRsI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:48:33","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":255941574,"title":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Show Affection at the US Open Tennis Final Amid Speculation About Fauxmance Contract and Reunite with Singer’s Trump-Supporting BFF WAG Despite Rumors of a Rift","text":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce defied fake romance rumours as they put on a loved-up display at the US Open final together in New York City.

Halkias and other Trump supporters were at the former prez’s event in Harrisburg just hours after Walz — whose botched handling of the 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis are now infamous — stopped down the road in Lancaster. Joyce Portk, a retiree from Lake Wynonah, attended the town hall in the crucial swing state with her daughter. Portk called Walz’s Lancaster trip a “waste of time,” pointing out the lack of specific policy proposals from Kamala Harris’ campaign and saying that is enough to dishearten Keystone voters. “They don’t tell you what they’re running on, so how can you make an informed decision about who to vote for?” she said. Another mother-daughter duo, Mary Lou Flores and Christine Mitchko of Yardley, balked at the portrayal of Walz as a “centrist. “He seems pretty far left, and they’re kinda painting him as this centrist, like he’s this good old boy with the guns,” said Mitchko, a 54-year-old software engineer. “People should start asking him about his record, and he should really speak truly to the stolen valor accusations,” she added, referring to controversy of what Walz claimed about his rank in the Army National Guard and the circumstances surrounding his retirement. “I think that’s pretty important,” she said. Flores, a 76-year-old retired nurse, brought up GOP South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s comments about Walz shifting from a moderate Democratic congressman with whom she had a good working relationship to a “radical” governor of Minnesota. “Somebody in Congress was saying she served with him and he was a great guy, really seemed moderate at that time,” Flores said of Noem’s comments. “But when he became governor and I look at his record, I’m not for his [policies],” she said of Walz, who is running with Veep and Dem presidential nominee Kamala Harris for the White House against Trump and his choice for No. 2, JD Vance.","summary":"Attendees of last week’s town-hall event featuring Donald Trump and “Fox News” host Sean Hannity had a clear side message for Democratic veep nominee Tim Walz: Your ticket doesn’t stand a chance here.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/us-news/pa-town-hall-attendees-dismiss-tim-walz-people-should-start-asking-him-about-his-record/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/republican-presidential-nominee-former-u-89070464.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:35:15","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":255941196,"title":"How Trump and Harris are preparing for their first debate of 2024","text":"Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off for the first time this week as Election Day quickly approaches — with the race upended since the last debate matchup between Trump and President Biden. Hosted by ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the debate could be the only time Trump and Harris go head to head on the debate stage. Tuesday’s debate follows weeks of back and forth over whether the matchup would occur — and under what terms. Though the president and former president agreed in May to participate in two presidential debates, one hosted by CNN in June and another hosted by ABC in September, the second debate was thrown into question once Mr. Biden left the race in July. Trump suggested on multiple occasions that he would not participate at all, criticizing the network. But after Harris baited the former president, accusing him of “backpedaling” on the debate, Trump agreed to the Sept. 10 matchup, while proposing additional debates on Fox and NBC News. Harris only agreed to the ABC debate. What we know about the debate structure so far Tuesday’s 90-minute debate, which will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place without an audience. It’s also expected to feature two commercial breaks, when campaign staff will not be allowed to interact with the candidates, among other rules that mirror the rules at the CNN debate. During the debate, the candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and for rebuttals, along with an extra minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses, ABC outlined. No props or pre-written notes are permitted onstage. The candidates will have two minutes to deliver closing statements, and Trump will deliver the final statement after winning a coin toss, ABC said. There will be no opening statements. Candidates’ microphones will only be live when it’s their turn to speak, an issue that the two sides have been at odds over for weeks. While the Harris campaign argued that both candidates’ microphones should be on throughout the debate, Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules regarding microphones in place for the first presidential debate. The Harris campaign ultimately agreed to have the microphones muted when a candidate isn’t speaking, although the campaign said a pool of reporters will be present and will be able to hear what a muted candidate may be trying to say. The Harris campaign wrote in a letter to ABC obtained by CBS News that the vice president “will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format,” while noting that the campaign accepted the terms so as not to “jeopardize the debate” from occurring. How Donald Trump is preparing for the debate Heading into the debate, both Trump and Harris highlighted their policy platforms on the campaign trail in battleground states throughout the country, where they remained locked in a close race with fewer than 60 days before Election Day. Trump campaigned in North Carolina and Wisconsin in recent days. The former president has been reviewing policy positions with advisors in the lead up to the debate, sources familiar with the former president’s preparation told CBS News, though his preparations are characterized as somewhat informal and include speaking with voters and engaging with the media. Trump told “Good Morning New Hampshire” last week that he’s “been preparing all my life for this debate.” “So, you know, I do. I have meetings on it,” Trump added. “We talk about it, but there’s not a lot you can do.” How Kamala Harris is preparing for the debate Harris traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Thursday to prepare for the presidential debate, according to campaign officials and advisers to the vice president. She is set to remain in the area until Tuesday’s debate. The vice president and her team have used the time to go back to the drawing board on their debate strategy, a senior campaign official told CBS News, after the decision was made to keep candidates’ microphones muted during the debate when they aren’t speaking. While Harris had planned to pepper Trump with questions, her campaign has had to seek out a new approach, fearing that her ability to most effectively engage with the former president will be hampered by the microphone restrictions. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was involved in Harris’ debate preparations against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, praised Harris’ debate skills and intellect on Sunday, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that “she is a very focused and disciplined leader.” But he noted that “it will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate.” “It’s no ordinary proposition, not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they’re going to make people better off,” Buttigieg said. “It’s because he’s a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.” When and how to watch the presidential debate The debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Sept. 10. CBS will have coverage beginning at 8 p.m. ET.

With approximately 70 days left in a compressed campaign, Harris is poised not only to become the first woman to ascend to the presidency but also to be the first president of Black and South Asian descent. Despite the significance of these firsts, Harris has made it clear that her identity is not the focal point of her campaign. Instead, she has chosen to transcend these aspects, focusing on broader themes of unity, patriotism, and a shared American future. At the recent Democratic National Convention, Harris’s acceptance speech was a masterclass in navigating the complexities of identity politics while appealing to a broad electorate. Notably, she refrained from directly addressing her race or gender, except in brief references to her Jamaican father and her mother, a “brilliant five-foot-tall woman with an accent.” This deliberate vagueness allows Harris to sidestep the potential pitfalls of being pigeonholed by her identity, positioning herself as a candidate for all Americans. Harris’s campaign strategy appears to be built on the premise that this election is about more than just party lines or personal identity. It is about the future of the nation and the values that bind its people together. Her message is one of optimism, emphasizing the potential for positive change and the need to move beyond the bitterness and division that has characterized recent years. In her words, this election offers a “precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past.” Harris’s campaign faces significant challenges, particularly in winning over the approximately 10 percent of undecided and independent voters in a deeply polarized electorate. While the Democratic convention succeeded in introducing Harris to a broader audience and effectively reframing Donald Trump as a small yet dangerous threat, the task of convincing undecided voters remains daunting. Harris’s speech at the convention was a careful balancing act. While she leaned toward centrist policies, avoiding extravagant promises on healthcare or the economy, some observers noted a conservative tilt, particularly in her support for a bipartisan border bill. This centrist approach is likely an attempt to appeal to a broader spectrum of voters, including those who may have been alienated by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party. However, there is a recognition within the Democratic camp that Harris must do more than just present herself as a safer alternative to Trump. She must also address the widespread perception that Trump is better equipped to handle the economy, a key issue for many voters. While Trump has faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his erratic behaviour, his sharp political instincts and ability to adapt to shifting circumstances make him a formidable opponent. The Democratic Party entered the convention riding a wave of “Kamalamania” following Joe Biden’s decision to step aside, allowing Harris to take the helm. This surge of enthusiasm, however, must be tempered by the reality that the race remains tight, with Trump leading in five of the seven crucial swing states. To overcome this deficit, Harris will need to leverage the support of key allies and continue to campaign aggressively in the remaining days leading up to the election. The presence of popular figures like Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and the Clintons at the convention provided a significant boost, with each of them taking turns to eviscerate Trump. Michelle Obama’s speech, in particular, resonated strongly, with her pointed remarks about Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and her critique of his policies. Harris’s choice of Minnesota Governor Tim “Coach” Walz as her running mate is also strategic. Walz’s appeal among rural voters and his popularity in the Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania could prove crucial in tipping the balance in Harris’s favour. The Democrats are hopeful that Walz can attract some of the non-college-educated Gen X men and rural voters who form a significant part of Trump’s base. Republicans have dubbed this early phase of Harris’s campaign her “honeymoon” period, predicting that the real challenges lie ahead. Indeed, the upcoming debate against Trump on September 10 will be a critical moment for Harris, as her performance could sway undecided voters and shape the narrative for the remainder of the campaign. Moreover, the US media is eager to scrutinize Harris’s policies and her ability to handle the pressures of the presidency. Her bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 was derailed by a disastrous press interview, and there is a sense that she must avoid a repeat of that experience. The first press conference or detailed interview as the Democratic nominee will be a key test of her resilience and ability to stay on message. Despite these challenges, there is a growing sense that something different is happening in this election cycle. As Republican strategist Mark Mackinnon observed, “This feels like something completely different is happening. And I don’t know what it is yet, but, you know, just the circumstances, the timing, the compressed election, the nomination – it just feels, looks and smells like something completely different.” As Kamala Harris continues her historic campaign, she is positioning herself not just as a candidate for the Democratic Party but as a guardian of American values and a unifying force for the nation. Her focus on positivity, patriotism, and inclusivity, combined with her strategic approach to policy and her appeal to a broad electorate, gives her a unique opportunity to transcend the divisions that have plagued American politics. In the remaining days of the campaign, Harris will need to continue to navigate these challenges while staying true to her message of unity and hope. Whether or not she succeeds in becoming the first woman and the first person of Black and South Asian origin to be elected president, her campaign has already reshaped the landscape of American politics and set the stage for a new era of leadership.

Liz Cheney and the second from her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. When asked what kinds of voters these two endorsements appeal to, Carville contended the endorsements could push voters hesitant to support Democrats to finally take the plunge, especially those who dislike former President Donald Trump. “And it’s not going to be a huge number of people, but it has the potential to be very helpful,” Carville said on MSNBC’s Inside with Jen Psaki. “I could see some of that on the main line. I could see some of that in parts of Phoenix, political parts. I could see some of that in Buckhead. There’s plenty of places where we might lose 63-37. We might lose 60-40 over a period of time, that accumulates. We know that. The theory that small changes lead to big results is absolutely true.” Ahead of the next debate, Carville argued the debate is an opportunity for Harris to portray herself as a new candidate while being someone who will “supplement” President Joe Biden’s work as president. He added that Trump’s support is always going to remain at “48” no matter what, while Harris can either push her support over this threshold or push it lower. Last week, Carville encouraged Harris to “enable” what the Trump campaign is afraid of in Tuesday’s debate, which is to “let Trump be Trump.” Part of this strategy, he explained, is to let him talk over her and “get under his skin and show he’s not getting to her.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER While Carville has argued that the endorsements from the Cheney family could be useful for Harris, Gov.

And any concerns anyone had about her lackluster 2020 presidential campaign were largely put to rest.Her favorability rating has soared among likely voters. She quickly rallied the Democratic base and saw a bump in support among independents, which helped give her polling leads across swing states in recent weeks. And, last week, the Harris campaign announced it had raised $361 million in August alone — nearly three times the $130 million former President Donald Trump brought in that same month.Still, in a reminder of just how volatile American elections can be, a newly released New York Times/Siena College poll found Trump had a one-point edge over Harris among likely voters. The poll might indicate that Harris' momentum has stalled or it could be an outlier. New polls in the coming days will tell more, as will Tuesday's presidential debate.What is certain is that many of the complexities of the 2024 contest never went away after Biden's exit from the race. Here's why the contest remains a nail-biter at this late stage.Despite a series of polls showing Harris with advantages in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the leads are generally in the single digits and within the margin of error.The latest Times national poll showed Trump with 48% support among likely voters, with Harris at 47% support.The result is unchanged from the Times national survey taken in July.Some important figures stick out in the most recent Times poll.Harris saw majority support among voters under 45. She performed strongest among voters aged 30 to 44, winning this group by nine points (51% to 42%). Meanwhile, Trump led among Gen X and voters aged 65 and older by margins within 10 points.For Harris, turnout among the youngest voters will be key as she seeks to win traditional swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and hold Sun Belt battlegrounds like Arizona and Nevada. Harris' appeal with young voters is a major reason she's been able to put North Carolina back into play for Democrats, which was a far cry from even three months ago when Biden struggled there.In the Times survey, Harris also had a 10-point lead (52% to 42%) with suburban voters, a significant show of support that could make a huge difference should she extend that advantage over her GOP rival.Despite Trump's lead in the Times survey, the former president's woes in the suburbs are perhaps one the biggest threats to his campaign, as it would likely dampen his ability to win in a critical state like Pennsylvania should Harris gain more steam closer to the election.The presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be perhaps the most critical opportunity for Harris to reach voters that remain on the fence about who they'll support at the top of the ticket.In the Times survey, 27% of likely voters said they wanted to \"learn more\" about Harris. Meanwhile, only 9% of likely voters expressed a similar sentiment about Trump.For the voters who indicated they wanted to learn more about Harris, nearly 7 in 10 said they wanted to hear more about the vice president's policies and plans. An additional 10% said they wanted to learn \"everything\" about Harris.So, in effect, Trump boasts a slender lead against a candidate who remains a blank slate to a significant slice of the electorate.The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a first step for Harris in emerging from the shadows and onto the national stage. But the debate in Philadelphia will give her time to articulate her vision for what remains the biggest issue of the election: the economy.In the latest Times poll, Trump had a 13-point lead (55% to 42%) over Harris on who would be better equipped to handle the economy.Trump, who has relentlessly criticized Democrats over the issue, has made it a centerpiece of his campaign.Harris has begun to cut into Trump's advantage on the issue in recent weeks, which had dogged Biden as a candidate. Other surveys, including a Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll released last month, actually showed Harris with a one-point edge (42% to 41%) over Trump on economic matters among registered voters.That close result is just another reflection of the competitive nature of the race, a dynamic that will likely remain the same until November.","summary":"Kamala Harris has shaken up the presidential race, cutting into Donald Trump's margins in swing states.

DirecTV filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission on Saturday night accusing Disney of negotiating in bad faith. Disney channels, including ESPN and ABC-owned stations in nine markets, have been off DirecTV since the evening of Sept. 1. That meant DirecTV customers were blacked out from viewing most college football games and the final week of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, including the women's and men's finals. DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation’s third-largest pay TV provider. ABC and ESPN will have the “Monday Night Football” opener between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. ABC will also produce and carry a presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday in Philadelphia. ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, are off DirecTV. Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel are dark. DirecTV says in its 10-page complaint that Disney is violating the FCC's good faith mandates by asking it to waive any legal claims on any anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands. DirecTV has asked Disney for the option to provide consumers with cheaper and skinnier bundles of programming, instead of bigger bundles that carry programming some viewers might not be interested in watching. The complaint states: “Along with these anticompetitive demands, Disney has also insisted that DirecTV agree to a ‘clean slate’ provision and a covenant not to sue, both of which are intended to prevent DirecTV from taking legal action regarding Disney’s anticompetitive demands, which would include filing good faith complaints at the Commission. Not three months ago, however, the Media Bureau made clear that such a demand itself constitutes bad faith.” DirecTV CEO Ray Carpenter said during a conference call with business and media analysts on Tuesday that they would not agree to a new carriage deal with Disney without bundling changes. \"We’re not playing a short-term game,” Carpenter said. “We need something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers. The resolve is there.” Disney has claimed since the blackout began that mutual release of claims is standard practice after licensing agreements are negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. It has also had one with DirecTV under its past renewals. A Disney spokesperson said: “We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible. We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.” Last year, Disney and Charter Spectrum — the nation’s second-largest cable TV provider — were involved in a nearly 12-day impasse until coming to an agreement hours before the first Monday night NFL game of the season. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports","summary":"The impasse between DirecTV and Disney over a new carriage agreement has become more heated as it entered its second week","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-abc-fcc-espn-new-york-jets-b2609214.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/28/23/Media_ESPN_New_Services_43512.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:13:09","author":"Joe Reedy","authors":["Joe Reedy"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":255943156,"title":"Thousands of holidaymakers affected by Gatwick travel chaos as air-traffic control staff shortage at airport sees at least 100 flights cancelled","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Breaking News Australia Video University Guide China Debate Meghan Markle Prince Harry King Charles III Weather Most read My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 9th 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce put on a VERY loved-up display at the US Open tennis final after 'fauxmance contract' claims... and singer is back in the arms of her 'Trump fan' WAG BFF despite rift talk Sir Keir Starmer's plan to strip 10 million pensioners of winter fuel payments could KILL 4,000 people... says LABOUR'S own research King Charles is 'losing patience' with Prince Andrew and says there are only 'two possible options' left for his brother - as row over the Duke's refusal to leave £30m Royal Lodge rages on We left 'horrible' Australia and moved back to Scotland with our kids after just 18 months.

According to Nats, the air-traffic control provider that runs the tower, temporary air traffic restrictions are currently in place at the airport 'in order to maintain safety'. This is expected to cost airlines millions of pounds and lead to more than 15,000 passengers having their travel plans disrupted. At least 64 easyJet arrivals and departures have been grounded at the Sussex airport on one of the busiest and most lucrative days of the summer. The mass cancellations are a repeat of problems suffered at the same airport a year ago and in June 2024. A Nats spokesperson apologised for 'the inconvenience caused' but gave no indication as to when the disruption would end.

'This has been further exacerbated by air traffic control restrictions due to adverse weather in Europe.

'We are doing all possible to minimise the impact of the disruption and have notified those on cancelled flights of their options to rebook or receive a refund and are providing hotel accommodation and meals where required.' A Brit set to fly to London Gatwick this evening from Nantes in Brittany, France, revealed the travel chaos to MailOnline. The holidaymaker had to shell out an extra £130 on top of his original £110 flight - which he has applied to get a refund for. He said: 'It's an absolute nightmare. I'm meant to be at work tomorrow and now I might have to take an extra day's annual leave. 'I'd already started making my way to the airport when EasyJet said the flight was delayed. I can't get a refund on my train and I'm out of pocket more than £240 now. 'EasyJet also said there weren't enough air traffic controllers because of illness. Then finally they cancelled the flight because of bad weather in London. Four EasyJet round-trips between Gatwick and Amsterdam have been axed, along with two return journeys to each of Faro, Paris, Geneva and Belfast (file image) 'The flight wasn't due to leave until 9pm this evening and of course there was no number to call from EasyJet.

'We are doing all possible to minimise the impact of the disruption and have notified those on cancelled flights of their options to rebook or receive a refund and are providing hotel accommodation and meals where required.'

A spokesperson for Gatwick said: 'Due to short-notice absence in the air-traffic control tower, temporary restrictions have been put in place today, in addition to existing restrictions in place due to adverse weather across UK and Europe. These may result in some delays and cancellations. 'London Gatwick apologises to any passengers impacted by these restrictions. Please contact your airline for more information.'

Here's how it'll work","text":"If there was ever any doubt about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign, it's recently been put to rest. So both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are awake to the high stakes as they prepare to face off this week. The debate is being hosted by America's ABC network in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – one of the crucial battleground states that both candidates have been targeting during the campaign. Given how close the polls are, including in those swing states, this debate has the potential to have a big impact on the race for the White House, again. When is the presidential debate? Their debate is scheduled for 9pm on Tuesday, September 10, local time. That's 11am on Wednesday, September 11, AEST. What are the rules this time? They're very similar to last time: The debate will go for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks.Candidates will have two minutes to answer each question, with a two-minute rebuttal, and an extra minute for a follow-up, clarification or response.There will be no audience. (But, unlike the CNN debate, some reporters will be allowed in the room.)No props are allowed.No pre-written notes are allowed, but candidates will be given a pen and paper.Microphones will be muted except for when candidates are asked to speak.There will be no opening statements. The candidates will be asked to give two-minute closing statements. ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir will ask the questions. Trump last week won a coin toss and opted to give his closing statement last. Harris chose to stand at the podium on the right of screen. Have Harris and Trump debated before? No. In fact, Harris and Trump have not met in person. According to CNN, the only time they've been in the same room was during Trump's State of the Union addresses to Congress. This is the second, and possibly final, presidential debate of the 2024 election campaign. The first was hosted by CNN on June 27, local time. Of course, that debate was between Trump and President Joe Biden, whose poor performance triggered a crisis of confidence among Democrats that ultimately led to Biden's withdrawal from the election. Here are the key takeaways from that event. Loading... Harris's last election campaign debate was against Trump's then-vice-president, Mike Pence, during the 2020 race. Their only debate was a less fiery affair than those involving the presidential contenders, Trump and Biden. But Harris – who was separated from her opponent by a plexiglass screen because of the pandemic – inspired some viral content by twice shutting Pence's interruptions down with the line, \"I'm speaking.\" Loading... There were few standout moments, though, as both vice-presidential candidates aimed to do what vice-presidents are supposed to do – avoid stealing the limelight. It's telling that the big meme-generating moment came thanks to a housefly that perched itself on Pence's head and stayed there for a good couple of minutes. Loading... Last week, Trump said Harris was a \"nasty person\" and \"the way she treated Mike Pence was horrible\". (Pence has refused to endorsed Trump, whose supporters brought a noose to the Capitol and chanted \"hang Mike Pence\" during the January 6 insurrection.) Both candidates complain they're disadvantaged True to form, Trump has been trashing the host network and attempting to set early expectations that the debate is stacked against him. \"ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,\" he told Fox News last week. \"They are the most dishonest network, the meanest, the nastiest, but that was what I was presented with.\" Trump has also complained that Harris's \"best friend is the head of the network\", an apparent reference to Dana Walden, the co-chair of Disney Entertainment, which owns America's ABC. Walden and her husband are long-time friends of Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. The couple has donated to Harris's past political campaigns, and they held a fundraiser for her at their LA home in 2022. But Disney says Walden is only involved in corporate matters, like budgets and staff size. The company recently told the New York Times that \"all editorial decisions are in the hands of ABC News management and the seasoned journalists and producers of ABC, who hold themselves to the highest journalistic standards\". The Harris campaign is also complaining of being disadvantaged, after it failed to persuade ABC to keep both candidates' microphones on throughout the debate. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President,\" the Harris campaign wrote in a letter to ABC. How have they been preparing? Harris's debate preparation appears to have been more intense than Trump's. She's been staying at a hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, doing some practice sessions with trusted staff. One of them is Philippe Reines, who has been playing the part of Trump in mock debates. He did the same thing for Hillary Clinton back in 2016. Trump told a New Hampshire radio station that there was \"not a lot you can do\" to prepare, but that he had \"been prepared for this debate my whole life\". \"You can't sit in a log cabin like [2012 Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney,\" Trump said. \"Do you remember? He sat there for four weeks at a log cabin, didn't talk to anybody, and then he came out, he couldn't speak. You can't do that.\" However, the New York Times reported at the weekend that Trump was having multiple debate preparation sessions, and had put in more work to prepare for the 2024 debates than he did in 2016 or 2020. When is the vice-presidential debate? Harris's running mate Tim Walz and Trump's running mate JD Vance have agreed to debate on October 1. That debate is set to be hosted by TV network CBS in New York City. Where can I watch the presidential debate? America's ABC will stream the debate on its website and YouTube channel. In Australia, you can watch on the (Australian) ABC News Channel, including on YouTube and iview. We'll also be live blogging the debate here on the ABC News website.","summary":"Any doubts about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign have been put to rest.

He served as a state councillor from 2011 to 2021 and is an expert in the foreign policies and strategies of China and the US, as well as East Asian security. This interview was first published in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here. Professor, you have been paying close attention to China-US relations for a long time. Many are calling the present era a new cold war, despite the recent establishment of communications channels. What are your thoughts on the overall trend? I’ve repeatedly emphasised that establishing communication channels between China and the US – no matter how frequent or senior level – is one thing, while producing tangible results is another. Since the 2013 summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US president Barack Obama at Sunnylands, California, Sino-US interactions have been frequent and have included online and in-person meetings at the highest level. However, it’s clear that Sino-US relations have consistently deteriorated over the past 11 years. The trend has definitely gone down, again and again. This fully demonstrates that establishing communication channels is one thing, while improving relations and resolving major issues is another. Moreover, if both sides engage in too many talks and are too candid with each other, there may be another scenario: that [both sides] think the other one is not really a good country. Their thoughts may become clearer than if they had not held these talks, which also proves that talks themselves, communication itself, and exchanges themselves, are distinct from the results they produce. Of course, after the [Xi-Biden] summit in San Francisco last November, there were significant and notable advancements in one area between China and the US – namely, a significant reduction in the number of dangerous, non-professional encounters between their naval vessels. This is a major breakthrough in preventing military conflicts. On the other hand, it also indicates that both sides have heightened their attention and efforts to prevent military conflicts because the danger of such conflicts is escalating. You mentioned that, in some fields, the more China and the US engage in talks, the more they will reveal their vast differences. Can you give some examples? For instance, the North Korea nuclear issue. The UN Security Council passed a resolution on sanctions against North Korea in December 2016, just after [former US president Donald] Trump took office. After that, North Korea’s nuclear and missile activities continued to develop, including the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Every time Western countries propose new sanctions resolutions, China and Russia always veto them, up to this day. The second example is the Taiwan issue, which has been very clear recently. In May, China conducted Joint Sword-2024A, its biggest military drill [near Taiwan] since early August 2022. Meanwhile, around the same time at the graduation ceremony of the US Military Academy at West Point, [US President Joe Biden] said he had “always been willing to use force when required” to protect the US, its allies, and core interests. These words are all pointed remarks that carry a lot of meaning. Another major issue is that since April 2, when Biden and Xi spoke over the phone, the US has repeatedly threatened China over the so-called large-scale revitalisation of Russia’s military industrial foundation and has already taken some measures. On May 1, more than 10 Chinese entities were sanctioned by the US [for their support of Russia’s war in Ukraine]. The most intense one was when [US Secretary of State Antony] Blinken told Beijing that if China didn’t change its approach towards Russia, they would impose sanctions. To conclude, these events clearly demonstrate that China and the US have been nearly in full-scale confrontations, and it is not uncommon for non-military conflicts to occur over certain major issues. Is commerce another area of division despite more talks on it? What are your thoughts on the Biden administration’s Section 301 US trade office investigation into Chinese goods? There is a special reason for this, which is the US presidential election. From initiating the 301 investigation to implementing high tariffs on multiple [Chinese] sectors at an unprecedented speed, Biden did all this because he was in a hurry to compete with Trump for votes. This is a domestic political issue in the US, and it’s not a new thing to harm China’s economy, but he raised some fields to a higher level. However, the sanctions regarding Russia are quite significant and brand new. In fact, the difference between Trump and Biden rests in their attitudes towards the United States’ allies. But this difference is mainly evident in Europe and the Atlantic region. In the Indo-Pacific region, we should note that the Quad initiative was launched by Trump, the US Pacific military build-up and strategic military deployment were initiated by Trump, and the trade war and the hi-tech war against China were also initiated by Trump. Some people would point out that former president Barack Obama also had an Asia pivot strategy during his term. The principle was established in Obama’s “pivot”, which stated that this region was important and must be competed for. However, specific measures, especially significant and powerful ones, were lacking at the time. Obama focused on diplomatic relations with countries, but he didn’t do much about boosting US military power or strategic weapons systems in the Pacific. It was Trump who did that. How do Biden and Kamala Harris differ from Trump in their overall policies towards China? China has neither the ability nor intention to intervene in the US election, but there’s hope. China is hoping to take the lesser of “two evils”, not the “more evil” option. Trump is truly not good for China. Biden is also not good [for China], but at least he never says the “Chinese Communist Party is this or that”, and he always uses the name of the People’s Republic of China. At least, as stated in his publicised policies, he doesn’t directly aim to overthrow the Chinese government. Biden and [Vice-President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee] Harris have never and will never regard changing the Chinese regime as a programmatic goal. In contrast, Trump was extremely hostile towards China after the pandemic outbreak prevailed in the US after March 2020. This is one thing. Second, Trump is a very ruthless Machiavellian. Based on these two points, both options are harmful [to China], and China would rather pick the lesser of two evils. China has already announced that it won’t intervene in the US election, and it can’t. Moreover, the act of expressing goodwill in itself would be seen as interfering in the election. Whoever wins, China will still have to deal with it. Some say that the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have given China an opportunity to increase its influence on the global stage. What’s your opinion? Has China’s influence increased? Absolutely not. On Gaza, although the proposal for a two-state solution between Palestine and Israel is supported by more and more countries, for various reasons if you have a strong bias towards the Arab-Palestinian side, your relationship with Israel has been ruined. A mediator needs to have good relationships with both sides. The same is true for Ukraine and Russia. Will Ukraine’s Western allies listen to you? They will say you’re not neutral, so you have no [increased] influence. A true mediator must meet two conditions: first, it must be a major country or one that has a crucial position, like Qatar [mediating between Israel and Hamas] because of its location and geopolitical weight. Second, it must be genuinely neutral. Without being neutral, how can both sides listen to you? If we shift our focus back to the Asia-Pacific region, many people look at three places when they assess the risk of military conflict: Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Northeast Asia. From a geopolitical risk perspective, which of these places do you think is the most dangerous? There are two flashpoints. First, the Korean peninsula, because no one knows what’s happening there, and North Korea is not susceptible to external influence or control. No one can directly and clearly influence [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un. In the first half of 2017, Beijing almost pushed North Korea to a position of long-standing enmity with China. But it didn’t work out. So in March 2018, when Kim made his first visit to China, Beijing put the [denuclearisation] issue on the back burner. The top priority was to maintain a good relationship with North Korea, no matter what. Denuclearisation should not seriously damage China’s relations with North Korea. Then, in March 2021, after the high-level talks between China and the US in Anchorage, Alaska, it became clear that denuclearisation was no longer a key element of China’s Korean peninsula policy. It was no longer important. The second most dangerous flashpoint is the military arms race [in the Asia-Pacific region]. No matter how many talks there are between China and the US, or how many achievements there are, the strategic military build-up between the two sides will continue to escalate, as long as they have the financial ability to do so. Meanwhile, Taiwan is actually the most stable issue. China and the US have had many interactions, and as long as the one-China policy exists – even if it’s just a shell – as long as Taiwan doesn’t pursue de jure independence or allow foreign countries to directly control it, China will not use force to attack Taiwan. Because using force to attack Taiwan would at least potentially lead to a massive joint military intervention by the US, Japan and other allied countries, including Britain and others. In the East and South China seas, except for some occasional confrontations, things have basically cooled down. China is really not eager to start a war in the South China Sea. The possibility of a military conflict breaking out on the Korean peninsula is the greatest; the military arms race is the biggest and most common direct driving force behind the possible conflict between China and the United States. The risk of a conflict between China and the US in the South China Sea is low and controllable. Many people actually assess the risk of Taiwan by debating what signals are worth paying attention to. What signals translate to a high-risk period, or to a manageable situation? China’s Anti-Secession Law in 2005 [offers some hints]. Firstly, Taiwan’s de jure independence and secondly, foreign countries’ control over Taiwan. Now, the US is actually controlling Taiwan in essence, but according to the law, the foreign force has to directly control Taiwan, such as establishing a US-Taiwan joint command, or stationing US troops and warships in Kaohsiung harbour. However, even if such a situation arises, making the call is very difficult. Both China and the US are constantly preparing for war, but making a formal decision to launch a massive attack is extremely difficult. Therefore, preparing for war is day-in and day-out, but making a formal decision to launch a massive attack is just as challenging as it was five years or even 10 years ago. You don’t agree that the military power gap between China and the US is narrowing and that China is becoming more confident in this area? Many scientists believe that it’s not the case. In some areas, the gap may be narrowing, but overall, it has probably widened even further. For example, recently there has been an opinion that if China wants to engage in large-scale military intervention, [the US] will change its tactics and not move a single inch. Instead, the US will rely on 200 strategic bombers, each carrying at least 12 or 14 missiles. What does this mean? With 200 strategic bombers, there will be more than 2,000 conventional bombs with excellent range and radar-evading capabilities. Assuming that four Ohio-class cruise missile submarines are added, each about 150 metres (492ft) long and known for their excellent sonar capabilities, they can basically get to [mainland China’s] Yangtze River mouth, Xiamen [in Fujian province, opposite Taiwan], or even Bohai Bay without being detected. China’s destroyers are being built at a rapid pace, but China’s anti-submarine warfare and anti-submarine capabilities are extremely weak. The worst part is that China barely has a missile defence system, which is crucial. To conclude, everything in the world is contradictory. If China is weak, it is relatively safe. But if China becomes strong, despite increasing its security, it will mobilise its opponents to counter-attack it, making it relatively less safe. From a broad strategic perspective, some say China’s foreign policy is becoming more ambitious. Recently, it is becoming more distant from developed countries, while interacting more frequently with the developing world. What do you think? This is a cliché, and it may have been true three to 10 years ago, but not now. It’s been a few years since China began interacting more frequently with developing countries. China’s national income and tax revenue have been decreasing, and debt has been increasing. Now with shallow pockets, when China visits other countries it doesn’t give anything in return or pay back, will they be happy about that? First, China has been working on the Belt and Road Initiative for a long time, and is more aware that the countries along the route are very complex and [the projects] risky. Secondly, China’s financial ability has significantly decreased. So I think overall, the interconnection between China and developing countries has somewhat reduced – which is good and right, because a country’s foreign policy has to conform to its capabilities. So you think China is being more cautious about the Belt and Road Initiative? It’s very clear. President Xi emphasised in August 2018 the need to do a good job of painting a “fine brushstroke painting”, which means to observe and analyse carefully, and plan and negotiate specifically, according to the actual situation. Within a few months, all informed media outlets and think tanks had concluded that China’s belt and road programme was shrinking significantly. And up to now, it has indeed shrunk further. As a professor who has been teaching at Renmin University for many years, what changes have you observed in the understanding of international affairs among Chinese university students? To begin with, I have to admit that my assumption is limited, as I only interact with a specific group of students, and it may not be representative of all Chinese university students. However, I can generalise that Chinese universities are tiered. Top-tier universities are quite different from second or third-tier ones. Even though students from these top-tier universities may have a somewhat simplistic view of the world and China’s place in it, they are more sophisticated and less nationalistic than students in lower tiers. Renmin University is also a major alma mater for government officials. How do you compare the new generation of Chinese officials’ understanding of the country and international perspective with their predecessors of 10 years ago? To become a government official, you need to be cautious about what you say. So, even when you’re speaking to someone you know well, unless you’re very familiar with each other, you can’t really expect them to be completely honest with you. Those who pass the civil service exam are undoubtedly clever and understand what can be said and what cannot be said. Over time, they may not only stop talking about certain topics but also become unable to imagine anything different. How would you compare the academic communities in China and the US that study each other? I think in general, American scholars’ views on China are correct, just like Chinese scholars’ views on the US are basically correct as well. [US scholars think] China is challenging American dominance, the US-led existing international order and key political security rules. Chinese [academics] believe that the US is trying to maintain its dominance and won’t allow China to adjust the international system according to its own legitimate rights and core interests – and won’t even allow China’s military aircraft and ships to cross the Taiwan Strait median line. Although the mutual views may contain biases, in general, I think their views of each other are correct. What are your thoughts about people-to-people exchanges between the US and China? There are pros and cons of people-to-people exchanges. The positive effects include increased understanding, but that won’t necessarily mean reduced biases. With more interactions, people can reduce the exaggeration of certain aspects. However, there is a possibility that such exchanges can also prove [many Chinese people’s] original assumption: that Americans are indeed trying to ruin China and exercise global hegemony. And just imagine if Americans were to live in China like Chinese do, what would be the possible repercussions? The depiction of China by mainstream media and the government in the US can be summarised in two words: “suppressive” and “aggressive”. If many Americans were to live in China for quite a period, the two perceptions may become even more solidified.","summary":"Taiwan is actually the most stable issue between Beijing and Washington, as long as the one-China policy exists, distinguished expert says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3277614/more-talk-not-always-best-us-china-relationship-its-results-count","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/07/16dcb273-d6e8-4da5-9150-c0069263cc0e_a944d2a1.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/04/11/web.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:00:27","author":"Jun Mai,Xinlu Liang","authors":["Jun Mai","Xinlu Liang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.137},{"id":255940366,"title":"Asian markets can recover and rise further despite volatility: Analysts","text":"The adage \"when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold\" is highly relevant here, said Mr Chen Jingwei, chief investment strategist of wealth management platform Wrise Private Singapore. Pointing to the global economy's interconnectedness in terms of supply chains and financial markets, he added: \"The synchronised downturn in both US and Asian markets highlights how global investor sentiment has shifted, with a move toward safer assets like government bonds and investment-grade credit.\" Nvidia alone, along with expectations of a rate cut in the US, are also significant forces in the market, said Mr Chen. The analysts also pointed out that September has historically been a volatile month for stocks, with Mr Cheo noting that the month has recorded the biggest stock market corrections over the years. This year, investors also have two major events to deal with, besides the US jobs report on Friday, Mr Menon added. He pointed to the debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on Sep 10 ahead of a November election, and a Fed meeting a week later on Sep 17. OPPORTUNITIES IN SECTORS, MARKETS Meanwhile observers said that tech sector still has long-term potential, even if it might have been hit harder in recent times. \"We maintain a bullish outlook on generative (artificial intelligence) and Nvidia,\" said Mr Chen of Wrise Private. \"Strong demand from servers and AI remains intact, and we continue to view market dips as buying opportunities.\" He also said defensive sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples appear more resilient in a lower interest rate environment. Mr Cheo of HSBC said the bank continues to favour the tech sector as well, but wants to increase exposure to others such as US industrial stocks. The bank wants to reduce holdings of consumer discretionary stocks to reflect the growth slowdown, as well as headwinds from the price war in electric vehicle and auto sectors. Broadly, Asia's economic engine benefits from structural trends, AI-driven innovation and an investment boom fueled by supply chain revamps and green transformation, he said. \"We favour equities in Japan, India and South Korea to capitalise on their growth trends, as well as corporate governance reform winners in select markets,\" Mr Cheo added. OCBC's Mr Menon said India's large economy and young population could see more upside in its market. The economy there is driven by domestic demand, and India could benefit as companies try to diversify their operations away from China. \"We are also positive on the Singapore bourse where valuations are relatively cheap, and the market offers lots of yield opportunities for those in search of income,\" he said, adding that real estate investment trusts or REITS are expected to perform better when interest rates fall.","summary":"\"There's still a case for investors to stay invested and remain medium-term positive,\" says one observer after a major sell-off in stocks this week.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/asian-markets-stocks-nvidia-opportunities-4590676","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--BTRc_MK8--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/financial_markets_69916.jpg?itok=d7yVyyJn","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:00:00","author":"Abigail Ng","authors":["Abigail Ng"],"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":255942112,"title":"From Kennedy-Nixon to Harris-Trump: Six decades of debate quips, rips and slips","text":"Democratic vice president Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump face off in a presidential debate on Tuesday ahead of a November 5th election, upholding a tradition marked by some memorable moments of modern US political history: - 1960: The first televised debate pitted Democratic nominee John F Kennedy against Republican vice president Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o'clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Mr Kennedy won the election. - 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.\" Mr Carter won the election. - 1980: Mr Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for Americans 65 and older. Mr Reagan, who already had complained that Mr Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: \"There you go again\" and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Mr Reagan won the election. - 1984: Mr Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: \"I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Mr Reagan was re-elected. - 1988: A debate against Republican vice president George HW Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favour the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed \"the iceman\" by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Mr Bush won the election. The vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Mr Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" - 1992: Three candidates - Mr Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Mr Clinton won the election. - 1996: In a debate with Mr Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether, at 73, he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Mr Clinton retorted: \"I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" Mr Clinton was re-elected. - 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W Bush, Democratic vice president Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Mr Bush spoke. \"We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,\" Mr Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing \"syllable\". Mr Bush won the election. - 2004: The last debate between Mr Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Mr Bush sticking to simple arguments while Mr Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Mr Bush was re-elected. - 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Ms Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: \"Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,\" adding a \"doggone it\" for good measure. Mr Biden and Ms Palin both vowed to make US economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Mr Biden said Mr McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election. - 2012: Mr Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate, Mr Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had \"binders full of women\" as candidates for cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Mr Romney. Mr Obama won again. - 2016: The first debate between businessman Donald Trump and Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Clinton drew 84 million US television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Ms Clinton jabbing at Mr Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Mr Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate's husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Ms Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage, and she wondered if she should have told him to “back up, you creep\". Instead, she said, “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” In the third debate, Mr Trump called Ms Clinton “such a nasty woman” and declined to say he would accept the election results. Mr Trump won the election. - 2020: Down in opinion polls, then-president Trump came into his first debate with Mr Biden, the former vice president, looking for a fight. But his belligerence worked against him. He repeatedly interrupted Mr Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, to the point where the entire event veered out of control. He attacked Mr Biden's family. Polls and focus groups conducted afterward showed swing voters were repulsed by his behaviour. At one point when Mr Trump was interrupting him, Mr Biden said: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\" Mr Wallace told Mr Trump: \"I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.\" Mr Trump, referring to Mr Biden, responded: \"And him, too.\" Mr Wallace: \"Well, frankly you've been doing more interrupting.\" Mr Trump would later drop out of the second debate after it was switched to a virtual format in the wake of his Covid-19 diagnosis. He then adopted a more restrained tone for the final face-off with Biden. At the vice presidential debate, a stray housefly briefly commanded the national stage, generating buzz when it perched on vice president Mike Pence's cropped white hair while he debated his Democratic rival, then-US senator Kamala Harris. - June 27th, 2024: President Biden, 81, delivered a shaky, halting performance while former president Trump, 78, battered him with a series of often false attacks, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged insults. Mr Biden's performance rattled fellow Democrats and deepened voter concerns his faculties had dulled with age. The two candidates appeared with no live audience, and their microphones automatically cut off when it was not their turn to speak - both atypical rules imposed to avoid the chaos that derailed their first debate in 2020, when Mr Trump interrupted Mr Biden repeatedly. The two men - who made little secret of their mutual dislike - did not shake hands or acknowledge each other before or after the debate. On July 21st, Mr Biden abandoned his re-election bid under growing pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed vice president Harris as the party's candidate to face Mr Trump in the November 5th election. Ms Harris, 59, formally accepted the nomination on August 22nd.","summary":"From Kennedy-Nixon to Harris-Trump: Six decades of debate quips, rips and slips","url":"https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/timeline-from-kennedy-nixon-to-harris-trump-six-decades-of-debate-quips-rips-and-slips-1669936.html","image":"https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDlcXFwvMDgyMTU0MTRcXFwvR2V0dHlJbWFnZXMtMTIzMDM0Mzc1MS0xLWUxNzI1ODI4ODc1Mzk4LmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo3MD","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:59:43","author":"BreakingNews.ie,Reuters","authors":["BreakingNews.ie","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":255944850,"title":"'Stick to policy': Voters want less drama in Harris-Trump debate","text":"A Republican born and raised in Utah, he voted for Mr Biden in the 2020 election but plans to switch to Trump in November.

Musk had been among the high-profile people who had taken to social media and pilled on Khelif over the unsubstantiated claims that she wasn’t a woman and should have been competing against women in the Olympics. “Elon Musk was one of the first to attack me during this hate campaign,” Khelif told French TV show CLIQUE, according to a translated video of the interview. “’He posted this video and it was retweeted. So, he was one of the first to have spread this buzz, this campaign against me. ‘I would say, you hate me but you don’t even know me. I don’t even know why you led this attack. You have been cruel to me, cruel to my family, to my mother. At that time, my mother was going to the hospital every day.” At that point in the interview, Khelif had to fight back tears before she continued. “So I don’t understand the behavior of people today,” she said. “God is my guide, I am a practicing Muslim woman. I am a Muslim Arabic woman and I got through this moment. I hope I will be even stronger in the future and come back even more motivated.” Khelif has continued to push back against those who took aim at her during the Olympics over the controversy and Musk was among those in a lawsuit she filed in France over the online harassment she faced. “Harry Potter” author JK Rowling was also named in the suit and Khelif’s attorney asked that former President and current Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump be part of the investigation. Khelif won gold at the Paris Olympics in the 66kg division and controversy came to the forefront after Italian boxer Angela Carini had thrown in the towel 46 seconds into their bout. More focus came onto the IBA ruling the year before and the International Olympic Committee defended its decision to let Khelif compete this summer. The IBA had been stripped of its recognition by the IOC as boxing’s governing body and there have been more questions than answers over the test that led to them banning Khelif.","summary":"Olympic boxer Imane Khelif labeled Elon Musk “cruel” and questioned why the Tesla founder would come at her with such hate when “you don't even know me.” ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/sports/imane-khelif-slams-elon-musk-for-attack-during-olympics-gender-controversy/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-j2laf9hvc-1725831527520.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725817186&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:47:46","author":"Christian Arnold","authors":["Christian Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":255943154,"title":"Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins lineup is revealed as John Barrowman and Rachel Johnson sign up for brutal reality show after one contestant quit within 24 hours","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 9th 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce put on a VERY loved-up display at the US Open tennis final after 'fauxmance contract' claims... and singer is back in the arms of her 'Trump fan' WAG BFF despite rift talk Sir Keir Starmer's plan to strip 10 million pensioners of winter fuel payments could KILL 4,000 people... says LABOUR'S own research King Charles is 'losing patience' with Prince Andrew and says there are only 'two possible options' left for his brother - as row over the Duke's refusal to leave £30m Royal Lodge rages on We left 'horrible' Australia and moved back to Scotland with our kids after just 18 months.

The star had been tasked with jumping out of a helicopter into a lake when he knocked himself out with his backpack, hitting the surface at full speed, and was left face down in the water. Luckily he was rescued by the show's ex-special services staff and its health and safety team who concluded his injuries were mainly a few broken ribs. Speaking about his return to the show, Pete said: 'After being medically withdrawn in Jordan, I felt like I hadn't given it my best, and that bothered me. 'So when I got an opportunity to go back, I jumped in, and I would do it again.' Rachel added: 'This experience was much more than I was expecting. I mean, given how ghastly reality television can be, this was top notch. Really top notch.'

Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\" READ MORE: Trump in court as lawyers fight to overturn verdict in E. Jean Carroll sex abuse suit﻿ Trump's message represents his latest threat to use the office of the presidency to exact retribution if he wins a second term. There is no evidence of the kind of fraud he continues to insist marred the 2020 election; in fact, dozens of courts, Republican state officials and his own administration have said he lost fairly. Just days ago, Trump himself acknowledged in a podcast interview that he had indeed \"lost by a whisker.\" While Trump's campaign aides and allies have urged him to keep his focus on Harris and make the election a referendum on issues such as inflation and border security, Trump in recent days has veered far off course. On Friday, he delivered a stunning statement to news cameras in which he brought up a string of past allegations of sexual misconduct, describing several in graphic detail, even as he denied his accusers' allegations. Earlier, he had voluntarily appeared in court for a hearing on the appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, turning focus to his legal woes in the campaign's final stretch. READ MORE: Former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney endorses Kamala Harris﻿ Earlier Saturday, Trump had leaned into familiar grievances about everything from his indictments to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election as he campaigned in one of the most deeply Republican swaths of battleground Wisconsin. \"The Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail — they want me in jail — for the crime of exposing their corruption,\" Trump claimed at an outdoor rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, where he spoke behind a wall of bulletproof glass due to new security protocols following his July assassination attempt. There's no evidence that US President Joe Biden or Harris have had any influence over decisions by the Justice Department or state prosecutors to indict the former president. Trump has eschewed traditional debate preparation, choosing to hold rallies and events while Harris has been cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, working with aides since last Thursday. Harris has agreed so far to a single debate on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST), which will be hosted by ABC.","summary":"He has escalated the campaign rhetoric a﻿head of this week&#x27;s pivotal debate with Democrat opponent Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-adversaries-ahead-of-us-presidential-debate/736cd775-db45-4f8f-9de4-7664a14bbe97","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/GNVDqMVwEAvddMMGYPviHeSUd5M=/0x0:4829x2716/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fa0f69f57-983b-4992-8739-525ac4007d89","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:37:37","author":"9News,Associated Press","authors":["9News","Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":255941224,"title":"Slide over salsa: K-pop takes socialist Cuba by storm","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Bloc Quebecois ready to extract gains for Quebec in exchange for supporting Liberals The Bloc Québécois says its ready to wheel and deal with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party for support during confidence votes now that the Liberal government's confidence and supply agreement with the NDP has ended.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce defied fake romance rumours as they put on a loved-up display at the US Open final together in New York City on Sunday The pair have been in the midst of a media storm after pictures of a 'break-up contract' circulated online - causing Travis to draft in lawyers READ MORE Brittany Mahomes mocked after Taylor Swift sits with Chariah Gordon instead of her at Chiefs opener Taylor was also back in the arms of her 'Trump fan' BFF Brittany Mahomes despite talk of a rift between the pair. On Tuesday, Travis's representatives were forced to deny that the couple have plans to split later this month after a document written on the headed paper of his US PR company was spread online. The paperwork which appears to have been created by Los Angeles-based firm Full Scope, reveals a strategy to make their split, and says the date for an announcement is September 28. It also outlines a supposed plan to release an official statement at the end of this month – three days 'post-break up' to 'allow the initial media frenzy to settle and ensure clarity'. It adds that the announcement will be 'gracious, respectful and stress mutual respect. Laying out what the statement would say, they write: 'Example: Travis and Taylor have decided to part ways after careful consideration. They both value and respect each other's personal lives and appreciate your respect for privacy during this time. 'They are both committed to their careers and personal growth. They remain friends and wish each other the best.' At the US Open on Sunday, another reunion took place between Taylor and her BFF Brittany - after they recently sat apart following rumours of a rift. But in recent days they have quashed speculating with numerous loved-up outings to prove they are as strong as ever In their most recent appearance on Sunday, Taylor looked sensational in a red gingham mini dress complete with a corset bust - as well as sporting a striking red lip At the US Open, Taylor and Travis were seen embracing one another in the stands as they got enthusiastic about the match between Jannik Sinner, of Italy, and Taylor Fritz, of the United States On Tuesday, Travis's representatives were forced to deny that the couple have plans to split later this month after a document written on the headed paper of his US PR company was spread online. Taylor was also back in the arms of her 'Trump fan' BFF Brittany Mahomes despite talk of a rift between the pair Brittany and Taylor looked in fine spirits as they watched Jannik Sinner vs Taylor Fritz DailyMail.com revealed at the end of last month that Taylor and Brittany have implemented measures to save their friendship amid mounting speculation that the the latter's support of Trump could cause an explosive feud with the singer. Fans predicted a huge fallout could be on the cards after Brittany sparked controversy for liking multiple posts in support of Donald Trump, 78, ahead of the upcoming election, seemingly going against the views of Swift. However, a source has exclusively told DailyMail.com that they 'respect that they have different views' and have made a 'pact' to avoid discussing politics. 'Taylor is not going to be written into this anti-Brittany narrative because they have made a pact to not discuss politics,' they said. 'They both know it can tear apart friendships and they respect that they have different views.' The group posed for a photo together at Arthur Ashe Stadium, ending talk of a potential rift between Brittany and Taylor The pair did not sit together for the Kansas City Chiefs' opening game on Thursday night But all appeared to be in order as Swift and Mahomes shared a joke with their men at the US Open final Brittany and Travis appeared to be wearing matching Gucci outfits at the game Patrick also seemed in good spirits three days on from the Chiefs' opening NFL victory The group were happy with what they saw as the two tennis superstars went head to head The source claimed 'Brittany knew better than to discuss politics' at a recent party Taylor threw for Blake Lively at her Rhode Island mansion as she didn't want to 'risk confrontation over opposing views.' 'It was an unspoken rule for everyone to avoid politics at Taylor's home in Rhode Island,' they said. 'The topic was off limits. 'It is not only Taylor who has not spoken out in strong support for either candidate, but Travis as well. They know how much influence they have.' It has also emerged that Swift and Mahomes chose to sit apart for the Chiefs vs Ravens game this week because they wanted different experiences watching the NFL opener. The BFFs sat together for multiple games last season and spent time with each other in Amsterdam earlier this year when the pop megastar was on tour. Yet according to The Sun there is no animosity between them whatsoever. 'They are very good friends and they were so excited to go to the game, but they had different plans as it happens sometimes,' a source was quoted as saying. Rather than waiting for the rumour mill to die down, the Bejeweled singer, 34, ensured all eyes would be on her and Travis for Kansas City Chiefs' game against Baltimore Ravens Putting her incredible figure on display, she wowed in a figure-hugging Versace corset worth £1,000 ($1,325) tiny denim hot pants, and thigh-high Giuseppe Zanotti worth £1,250 ($1,650) 'Brittany is a family woman, and Taylor likes to enjoy the game sometimes like it’s a party. They felt like they were in a different vibe for the first game of the season. They did hang out for a bit before and after the game while waiting for Patrick and Travis. 'But Brittany preferred for the first game of the season to be in a suite with family and the kids, in a bit more of a \"low key\" vibe. Taylor wanted more of a ‘party and drinks vibe’ for the game and enjoy it differently. 'There are absolutely zero tensions between them, they love and respect each other a lot, they were just wanting a different kind of vibe for the first game of the season at home.' Mahomes shared a selfie from the field with her daughter Sterling before the game, while Swift was filmed throughout the game in the stands with Kelce's friends and his parents, Ed and Donna. Taylor and Travis jetted to New York for the weekend after the game and were pictured at a Brooklyn pizza joint on Friday night.

The most populous presidential swing state has sided with the winner of the past two elections, each time by just tens of thousands of votes. Polling this year suggests Pennsylvania will be close once more in November. A loss in the state will make it difficult to make up the electoral votes elsewhere to win the presidency. Trump and Harris have been frequent visitors in recent days — Harris plans to return on Friday — and the former president was speaking in Butler County on July 14 when he was the target of an assassination attempt. The stakes may be especially high for Harris: No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. Pennsylvanians broke a string of six Democratic victories in the state when they helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, then backed native son Joe Biden in the 2020 race against Trump. “They say that ‘If you win Pennsylvania, you’re going to win the whole thing,’” Trump told a crowd in Wilkes-Barre’s Mohegan Arena in August. Republicans are looking to blunt Trump’s unpopularity in Pennsylvania’s growing and increasingly liberal suburbs by criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the economy. They hope to counter the Democrats’ massive advantage in early voting by encouraging their base to vote by mail. Harris is looking to reassemble the coalition behind Biden's winning campaign, including college students, Black voters and women animated by protecting abortion rights. Democrats also say it will be critical for Harris to win big in Philadelphia — the state's largest city, where Black residents are the largest group by race — and its suburbs, while paring Trump's large margins among white voters across wide swaths of rural and small-town Pennsylvania. The debate is set for the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The city is a Democratic stronghold where Trump in 2020 notoriously said “ bad things happen,” one of his baseless broadsides suggesting that Democrats could only win Pennsylvania by cheating. Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 not just by winning big in Philadelphia, but by running up bigger margins in the heavily populated suburbs around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He also got a boost in northeastern Pennsylvania in the counties around Scranton, where he grew up. Ed Rendell, a former two-term Democratic governor who was hugely popular in Philadelphia and its suburbs, says Harris can do better than Biden in the suburbs. “There’s plenty of votes to get, a Democrat can get a greater margin in those counties,” Rendell said. Lawrence Tabas, chair of Pennsylvania’s Republican Party, said Trump can make gains there, too. The GOP’s polling and outreach shows that the effect of inflation on the economy is a priority for those suburbanites, he said, and that the issue works in the party's favor. “A lot of people are really now starting to say, ‘Look, personalities aside, they are what they are, but we really need the American economy to become strong again,’” Tabas said. Rendell dismisses that claim. He said Trump is veering off script and saying bizarre things that will ensure he gets a smaller share of independents and Republicans in the suburbs than he did in 2020. “He’s gotten so weird that he’ll lose a lot of votes,\" Rendell said. Harris has championed various steps to fight inflation, including capping the cost of prescription drugs, helping families afford child care, lowering the cost of groceries and offering incentives to encourage home ownership. Pennsylvania’s relatively stagnant economy usually lags the national economy, but its unemployment rate in July was nearly a full percentage point lower. The state's private sector wage growth, however, has slightly lagged behind the nation’s since Biden took office in 2021, according to federal data. Meanwhile, Democrats are hoping the enthusiasm since Biden withdrew from the race and Harris stepped in will carry through Election Day in November. For one, they hope she will do better with women and Black voters, as the first female presidential nominee of Black heritage. Rendell said he is more optimistic about Harris' chances to win Pennsylvania than he was with Biden in the race. \"I think we're the favorite now,\" Rendell said. The debate takes place before voting starts — in Pennsylvania and everywhere else. A national Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in July showed that about 8 in 10 Democrats said they would be satisfied with Harris as the party’s nominee compared with 4 in 10 Democrats in March saying they would be satisfied with Biden as the candidate. There is some optimism among Pennsylvania Democrats even in Republican-leaning counties, including a number of whiter, less affluent counties near Pittsburgh and Scranton that once voted for Democrats consistently. In Washington County, just outside Pittsburgh in the heart of the state's natural gas-producing region, Larry Maggi, a Democratic county commissioner, thinks she will outrun Biden there. Maggi is seeing more lawn signs for Harris than he ever saw for Biden, as well as more volunteers, many of whom are young women concerned about protecting abortion rights. “I’ve been doing this for 25 years and I’m seeing people I’ve never seen,” Maggi said. Democrats also hope there is a growing number of voters like Ray Robbins, a retired FBI agent and registered independent, who regrets voting for Trump in 2016. Robbins did so, he said, because he thought a businessperson could break congressional deadlock. “He’s a liar,” Robbins said. “I think he’s totally devoid of any morals whatsoever. And you can quote me: I think he’s a despicable human being even though I voted for him.” But Republicans have reason to be optimistic, too. In the nation's No. 2 gas-producing state, even Democrats acknowledge that Harris' prior support for a fracking ban in her run for the 2020 nomination could prove costly. In this campaign, the vice president said the nation can achieve its clean energy goals without a ban, though Trump insists she will reverse course again. Meanwhile, the Democratic advantage in the state's voter registration rolls has steadily shrunk since 2008, from 1.2 million to about 350,000 now. Republicans credit their outreach to younger voters, as well as Black, Asian and Hispanic voters. “A lot of them tell us it’s the economy,\" Tabas said. “And in Philly, it's also the crime and safety in the neighborhoods and communities.” Those gains have yet to translate into GOP wins as Democrats have beaten Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in statewide contests the past decade. Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, chalks up the narrowing registration gap, in part, to “Reagan Democrats” who have long voted for Republicans, but did not change their registration right away. One of those voters is Larry Mitko, a longtime Democrat-turned-Republican who lives in a Pittsburgh suburb. Mitko, 74, voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, and was leaning toward voting for Trump in 2024 because of inflation and Biden's handling of the economy before Biden exited the race. That is when Mitko became sure he would vote for Trump. “I don’t like the fact of how they lied to us telling us, ‘He’s OK, he’s OK,’ and he can’t walk up the steps, he can’t finish a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about,” Mitko said of Biden. Harris’ late entry into the race could mean that many voters are still learning about her, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania professor of communication who researches presidential debates. More voters than usual may not be locked into a decision even as voting looms, Jamieson said, so this debate could make a difference. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
