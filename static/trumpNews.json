Governor Gavin Newsom is announcing a new effort by CAL FIRE to recruit thousands of firefighters and emergency personnel. The call comes in the wake of a reduction in California's National Guard firefighting capacity, after hundreds were redeployed to LA by President Trump.\n\nOne of the world's largest firefighting departments is hiring. CAL FIRE is looking for as many as 2,000 firefighters, emergency personnel and support staff over the next four years. There's even a new and improved website to check out.\n\n\"Best way to put it, it's a one stop shop where someone can go to find all the information and then work through the process of getting the job,\" said CAL FIRE captain, Robert Foxworthy.\n\nCAL FIRE says seasonal firefighters are being trained all the time, but there are lots of job vacancies due to staff retirements.\n\nMORE: Trump can keep National Guard in LA for now after appeals court blocks order\n\nThe new hiring effort comes when the state's firefighting capabilities are being squeezed by federal actions, including Pres. Trump's re-assignment of roughly 300 National Guard fire crews to Los Angeles, slashing the state's 'Cal-Guard' firefighting force considerably.\n\nThe Trump administration has also reduced funding to the U.S. Forest Service, limiting federal support for wildfire management in California, placing increased pressure on State resources. Gov. Newsom made these comments Thursday before an appeals court temporarily allowed Trump to keep National Guard troops in LA.\n\n\"The National Guard will go back to working in 'Rattlesnake Teams' vegetation and forest management, which Donald Trump took them off in preparation for wildfire season. The national guard men and women will go back to their day jobs which includes law enforcement, that he took them off the job,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe new recruiting effort follows new state wildfire resilience initiatives, like $72 million in funding for 13 vegetation management efforts across 7,000 acres in California.","summary":"The new hiring effort comes when the state's firefighting capabilities are being squeezed by federal actions, including Trump's re-assignment of roughly 300 National Guard fire crews to Los Angeles.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/cal-fire-is-hiring-gov-newsom-ramping-recruitment-national-guard-firefighting-capacity-drops/16743605/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16744913_061325-kgo-cal-fire-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kgo/061325-kgo-4p-fire-national-guard-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-14 01:15:51","author":"Cornell Barnard,KGO","authors":["Cornell Barnard","KGO"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":331225076,"title":"Iran fires missiles at Israel in response to attacks","text":"OCCUPIED JERUSALEM/DUBAI/WASHINGTON: Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as sirens sounded on Friday night across Israel following what the country’s military spokesman said was the firing of missiles from Iran.\n\nIran’s state news agency IRNA said hundreds of ballistic missiles had been launched in retaliation for Israel’s biggest ever attacks on Iran, blasting Iran’s huge underground nuclear site at Natanz and wiping out its top military commanders. \n\nThere were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. \n\nIsrael said the strikes were the start of “Operation Rising Lion”.

The controversial decision has sparked outrage on social media among users left dismayed by a female athlete being punished for choosing not to line up against a biological male.\n\nDespite the uproar, USA Fencing issued a statement justifying its decision while supporting Sullivan, 20, and the inclusion of trans athletes in women's sports.\n\nIn the wake of that controversy, which saw woke pro-trans chairman Damien Lehfeldt scrutinized by federal lawmakers at a congressional hearing last month, USA Fencing's directors voted the changes surrounding LGBTQ-friendly sites and the national anthem at a board meeting last Saturday, reports Fox News. \n\nUSA Fencing has voted to amend policies over LGBTQ-friendly venues and the playing of the national anthem after the controversy over a fencer who refused to face a trans rival (pictured)\n\nUSA Fencing chief Damien Lehfeldt endured a brutal interrogation by lawmakers last month\n\nFencer who took a knee against trans rival gets reward for gesture that stunned sports world\n\nUSA Fencing announced in an official statement that it has 'adopted a streamlined policy that applies criteria prioritizing cost, safety and convenience to every national-event bid across all 50 states.' The new policy is said to ensure host cities meet 'stringent member-safety and cost-efficiency standards.'\n\nThe previous host site policy gave preference to cities without laws that 'harm members of the LGBTQ communities' and states that do not 'have laws undermining the reproductive health of women'.\n\nStates on the 'do not allow' list included Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nThe tweaked national anthem policy, which will go into effect at the 2025 Summer Nationals and be reviewed annually, will 'provide consistent, respectful minimum guidance for honoring the flag and anthem across nine annual tournaments.'\n\nIn December of last year, the board saw a vote to play the national anthem at the start of tournaments voted down.\n\nHowever, USA Fencing said in a statement to Fox News: 'The anthem has always been played at the start of every national tournament. The Board simply wrote that long‑standing practice into policy and added that it will also be played on any U.S. holiday that occurs during an event, such as Independence Day, which falls during our upcoming Summer Nationals.'\n\nWeeks after Turner took a knee instead of face a trans rival, Lehfeldt - the controversial chairman of USA Fencing - endured a brutal interrogation by lawmakers over his stance on transgender athletes, including why he once compared concerned parents to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe incident involving Turner shone a light on Lehfeldt, who previously wrote in a blog post that 'transgender women are women' and '(they) deserve the right to compete with the gender they identify with.'\n\nStephanie Turner, 31, took a knee and walked out of her match against a trans rival in Maryland\n\nSince returning to office, however, Donald Trump has signed an executive order entitled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports'.\n\nOn May 7, both Turner and Lehfeldt appeared at a hearing involving a Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE). The hearing was shown a photo, apparently posted on social media by Lehfeldt, in which he made a profane two-finger gesture at the camera with the caption 'Game day'.\n\nHe was grilled by lawmakers including chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, with his governing body accused of 'ignoring science' and putting 'politics ahead of women and the law.'\n\nGreene pressed him on why USA Fencing's 'site selection policy' for tournaments takes into account an area's policies on abortion and LGBT rights.\n\n'We try to have tournaments in sites that are safe for all of our members. Period,' he said.\n\nBut Lehfeldt refused to answer whether he would 'want (his) daughter to change in front of biological men in locker rooms? Yes or no.'\n\nThe chairman responded to Greene: 'My daughter isn't really something that should be part of this hearing, respectfully.'\n\nGreene later posted a clip of the incident on social media and wrote: 'He couldn’t say “NO.” That tells you EVERYTHING. These people have lost all common sense.'\n\nTurner, meanwhile, claimed she was left feeling 'isolated and strangled' by USA Fencing, having spent '7,000 hours training and over $100,000' on her fencing career.\n\nLehfeldt eventually said the organization would comply with law changes regarding transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nUSA Fencing makes dramatic policy change months after female fencer protested facing a trans rival\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The governing body's directors agreed on the change following months of criticism over Stephanie Turner - who was infamously punished for refusing to face a transgender opponent.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14811617/usa-fencing-trans-policy-stephanie-turner-damien-lehfeldt.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/14/01/96869505-0-image-m-61_1749860856480.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/03/4206030250040537556/1024x576_MP4_4206030250040537556.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-14 01:05:00","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.069},{"id":331225646,"title":"Oil up 6pc after Israel’s strikes on Iran","text":"HOUSTON: Oil prices fell off multi-month highs hit earlier on Friday as Israeli air strikes avoided Iranian oil sites, but prices still up about 6% as investors worried that the tensions could disrupt Middle East oil supplies. \n\nBrent crude futures were up $4.11, or 5.9%, to $73.47 a barrel by 11:12 a.m. EDT (1712 GMT), after earlier soaring over 13% to an intraday high of $78.50, the strongest level since January 27.

The very fact that Trump is thinking about revising Aukus likely brings celebrations in Beijing,” Nagy said.\nChina has been a vocal critic of the multibillion-dollar pact, describing it as a threat to regional stability.\n\nUnder the agreement, Australia and Britain are expected to co-produce an attack submarine class known as the SSN-Aukus that will come into service in the early 2040s.\nThe US also agreed to sell up to five Virginia-class submarines to Australia from 2032 as the Australian navy retires its existing vessels.\nWhile the agreement signed in 2021 was not expected to be scrapped, Nagy said some quarters of the Trump administration would like to see “either Australians pay much more for what they may be provided” or feel that Washington needed the submarines itself.\n“[Trump’s Aukus pact review] really is about rechecking, recalibrating and rethinking the United States’ security partnerships and ensuring that they are not only effective, but also involve a fair and equal burden sharing amongst partners within the Aukus agreement,” he said.\nThe Trump administration would remain committed to regional partnerships but it would not step back from its goal of boosting military spending by its allies, Nagy said.\n“I think that the US under Trump has really focused on strong and committed minilateral partnerships, such as those with Japan, the Philippines, Australia, perhaps the Quad members as priority partners that not only must be effective at deterring China, but at the same time, they must shoulder a fair share of the burden within these partnerships,” he said.\nShi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Beijing’s Renmin University, agreed that the likelihood of Aukus being scrapped entirely was very low.\n“That would seriously weaken one of America’s key pillars in the Indo-Pacific. It would run counter to Trump’s overall foreign policy objectives,” he said.\nBut he noted that it was still too early to say what the impact on China would be.\n“What we do know is that Trump’s approach typically involves the US paying less while demanding more in return – and doing so more efficiently.”\nTrump’s approach typically involves the US paying less while demanding more in return\nShi Yinhong, international relations professor\nZhao, with Fudan University, noted that unlike the administration of former president Joe Biden, which leaned on minilateral groupings to counter China, the Trump administration might see too many of these small multilateral formats as ineffective.\n“[Trump] might prefer to keep core frameworks like the Quad, while focusing more on coercively pressing allies to raise defence spending from a bilateral approach,” he said.\nHowever, the US president’s sweeping tariffs could “restrict and challenge” his ambitions for the region, he said.\nMalcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, also said it was unlikely that Trump would withdraw entirely from the Aukus agreement because it would “hand a huge victory to Beijing”.\nBut there was still a risk that the US could renegotiate the Optimal Pathway plan under Aukus to provide Australia with a lasting nuclear-powered submarine force.\nIf the US could not meet the demands of pathway and if delivery of the Virginia subs was delayed, it could “place the agreement under strain”, and raise the prospect of a serious gap in submarine strength for Canberra.\n“If the US cannot ensure increased submarine production rates, going from 1.2 hulls per year to three hulls per year, then the Optimal Pathway could be threatened.”","summary":"The United States may be rethinking its Indo-Pacific strategy with its review of the Aukus security agreement, but its focus on countering China is unlikely to change, according to analysts.\nThe pact with Australia and the United Kingdom has been thrown into doubt with the Pentagon’s announcement this week that it is reviewing the US’ role in the Biden-era agreement to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\nSome observers suggested that this could be cause for celebration in Beijing,...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3314397/aukus-pact-air-us-stay-focused-china-analysts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/13/4648ea24-b269-4c02-a881-93037c0d292d_06ce5055.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 01:00:14","author":"Meredith Chen,Seong Hyeon Choi","authors":["Meredith Chen","Seong Hyeon Choi"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":331223260,"title":"“Aussie Government Issues New Travel Alert for Israel Amid Iran’s Response”","text":"Share this @internewscast.com\n\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nFirefighters assess the damage outside a building that was hit by Israeli airstrikes north of Tehran.

Several children had been killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, it said.\n\nThe Tasnim news agency said six nuclear scientists were killed in the attacks.\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head Hossein Salami was reportedly killed in Israeli airstrikes. Source: AAP / Abedin Taherkenareh\n\nEarlier, in a recorded video message, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country faced a “decisive moment” in its history.\n\n“Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”\n\nThat threat, Israel says, is Iran building a nuclear weapon. The Israeli military said its intelligence gathering showed Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear program.\n\nAn Israeli security source told the Reuters news agency that commandos from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency led a series of covert operations deep inside Iran leading up to the military strikes.\n\nThose operations included deploying precision-guided weapons in open areas near Iranian surface-to-air missile systems sites, advanced technology used against Iran’s air defence systems and the establishment of an attack-drone base near Tehran, the security source reportedly said.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would face “harsh punishment” for the attack. Source: AAP / Vahid Salemi/AP\n\nA Hezbollah official said on Friday the Lebanese armed group, which is backed by Iran, would not unilaterally launch its own attack on Israel in response to Israeli strikes on Iran.\n\n“Hezbollah will not initiate its own attack on Israel in retaliation for Israel’s strikes,” the official told Reuters. A public statement from Hezbollah condemned Israel’s strikes and expressed full solidarity with Iran.\n\nWhile the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.\n\nAnthony Albanese says escalation ‘concerning’\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the escalation was “concerning”.\n\n“We … are very conscious of the threat that Iran becoming a nuclear state would represent to peace and security in the region as well,” Albanese told reporters on Friday.\n\nEarlier, Foreign Minister Penny Wong echoed Albanese’s concern, saying the attacks risked “further destabilising a region that is already volatile”.\n\n“We call on all parties to refrain from actions and rhetoric that would further exacerbate tensions.\n\n“We all understand the need, the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, it represents a threat to international peace and security and we urge the parties to prioritise dialogue and diplomacy.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with Fox News after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had earlier warned Israel will face “severe punishment ” for its attacks. Source: AAP / Vahid Salemi/AP\n\n“We will see,” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump urged Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, saying that there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.\n\n“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” he wrote.\n\nIran has repeatedly denied such intentions, saying it wants nuclear energy only for civilian purposes, and has publicly rejected Washington’s demand to scrap enrichment as an attack on its national sovereignty.\n\nIran’s government said in a statement that Israel’s “cowardly” attack shows why Tehran insists on enrichment, nuclear technology and missile power.\n\nFlights cancelled, ships avoiding Red Sea\n\nSeveral international airlines have cancelled flights to the region amid the attacks. The Lufthansa group, a German aviation group with subsidiaries throughout Europe, cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran and other cities in the Middle East, a statement said on Friday.\n\nThe group has cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Tehran until July 31 and cancelled flights to Amman, Erbil and Beirut until June 20, a statement said.\n\n“The Lufthansa Group will also continue to refrain from using the airspace of the affected countries until further notice,” it said.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it will operate flights to Lebanon only during daylight hours.\n\nGreek ship owners were urged to send details of their vessels sailing through the Strait of Hormuz to Greece’s maritime ministry, according to one of the documents issued by Greece’s shipping association, which was sent on Friday.\n\nAll UK-flagged vessels, which include the Gibraltar and Bermuda registries, were advised to avoid sailing through the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, a separate document issued by the UK’s transport ministry said.\n\n— With additional reporting by the Agence France-Presse and Reuters news agencies.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#8220;There is an elevated danger of military and terrorist actions against Israel&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Aussie Government Issues New Travel Alert for Israel Amid Iran&#8217;s Response&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/aussie-government-issues-new-travel-alert-for-israel-amid-irans-response/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/c6/bf/4ae825ad4dadb7aa8eb6afdbac9f/firefighters-assess-the-damage-outside-a-building-that-was-hit-by-israeli-air-strikes-north-of-tehran-abedin-taherkenareh-aap.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:49:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":331225370,"title":"Trump urges Iran to make a nuclear deal after Israel attacks (Video)","text":"International\n\nSouth Cinema\n\nSocial News XYZ Reviews\n\nMovie Schedules\n\nMovies News\n\nLive Events\n\nMotorsports\n\nOther Sports\n\nScience/Tech\n\nBusiness Wire India\n\nEnvironment\n\nHome » Videos » Trump urges Iran to make a nuclear deal after Israel attacks (Video) \n\nTrump urges Iran to make a nuclear deal after Israel attacks (Video)\n\nPosted By: Social News XYZ\nJune 13, 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump is urging Iran to make a nuclear deal now that Israel has launched strikes against the country.

Reuters obtained photographs of armed Marines temporarily detaining a civilian. The U.S. military confirmed the incident, which took place at the Wilshire Federal Building, to the outlet. The New York Times reported that the individual said he was an Army veteran and tried to reach the Veteran’s Affairs office located past caution tape. The man said he was undisturbed by his brief detention.\n\n Earlier this week, the commander overseeing military operations in the city said that military personnel can only temporarily detain people but cannot make arrests.\n\n The move to have Marines involved in local police work tests the boundaries of the Posse Comitatus Act, which broadly prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement.\n\n The pictures have surfaced a day after a federal judge attempted to place a restraining order on Trump’s move to federalize 4,000 California National Guard Troops. (That injunction has since been stayed by an appeals court.)\n\n The judge did not address the role of Marines under Trump’s command, writing that he would await a court date to weigh evidence as to whether these federal forces were engaging in police-like behavior including “interrogating, detaining, or searching civilians.”\n\n Trump has long dreamed of using military force to counter his domestic opposition. On June 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeted warehouses, clothing manufacturers, and Home Depot parking lots across Los Angeles, prompting a wave of local protests. Trump seized the opportunity to exert control over the state, deploying 2,000 National Guard troops into the city despite protests from both California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass.\n\n The president has since mobilized as many as 4,000 members of the California National Guard along with the 700 Marines to deploy in Los Angeles.\n\n On Thursday, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was dragged out of a Department of Homeland Security press conference, forced to the ground, and handcuffed by members of the FBI after attempting to ask DHS Secretary Kristi Noem a question. Padilla later said in a press conference that he was “there peacefully” and was hoping to get answers from the administration about their immigration policies. “I began to ask a question,” the senator recalled. “I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed,” he said, clarifying: “I was not arrested. I was not detained.” Padilla then addressed reporters: “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question you can only imagine what they’re doing do farmers … and day laborers.”\n\n Millions are expected to protest President Trump’s military parade on his birthday (which is also Flag Day and the 250th anniversary of the Army). The president has planned for a procession of tanks, Howitzers, mobile rocket launchers, and other war machines to roll through the streets of Washington, D.C., as military aircraft, including Apache helicopters, fly overhead. \n\n Protest organizers have called June 14 a “nationwide day of defiance.” The protest website reads: “They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services. The corruption has gone too. far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.”\n\n Trump has threatened demonstrators planning to show up at his military spectacle, declaring, “If any protester wants to come out, they will be met with very big force.”","summary":"Marines have carried out the first known detainment of a civilian in L.A.","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-marines-los-angeles-no-kings-protests-1235364607/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/marines-trump-los-angeles.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:43:34","author":"Charisma Madarang,Tim Dickinson","authors":["Charisma Madarang","Tim Dickinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":331223254,"title":"Trump Believes National Security Issues in US-Japan Steel Deal Can Be Addressed","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the potential national security risks associated with Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion proposal to acquire U.S. Steel can be addressed if specific conditions outlined by his administration are met, clearing the path for the transaction’s approval.\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares of U.S. Steel rose by 3.5% after trading hours, as investors speculated that the deal was nearing completion. In an executive order, Trump indicated that the conditions to mitigate national security concerns would be specified in an agreement, though he did not provide specific details. “I additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met,” Trump stated in the order, which was released by the White House.\n\nIn response, the companies expressed gratitude to Trump in a news release, mentioning that the agreement involves $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and governance commitments, such as issuing a golden share to the U.S. government. However, they did not specify the extent of control this golden share would grant the U.S. Earlier on Friday, U.S. Steel shares had declined after a Nippon Steel executive informed the Japanese Nikkei newspaper that their planned acquisition of U.S. Steel would require “a degree of management freedom” following Trump’s earlier statement that the U.S. would retain control through a golden share.\n\nThe bid, first announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023, has faced opposition from the start. Both Democratic former President Joe Biden and Trump, a Republican, asserted last year that U.S. Steel should remain U.S.-owned, as they sought to woo voters ahead of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered.\n\nBiden in January, shortly before leaving office, blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.\n\nThe steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which began on January 20 and opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.\n\nBut Trump’s public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple “investment” in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.\n\nAt a rally in Pennsylvania on May 30, Trump lauded an agreement between the companies and said Nippon Steel would make a “great partner” for U.S. Steel. But he later told reporters the deal still lacked his final approval, leaving unresolved whether he would allow Nippon Steel to take ownership.\n\nNippon Steel and the Trump administration asked a U.S. appeals court on June 5 for an eight-day extension of a pause in litigation to give them more time to reach a deal for the Japanese firm. The pause expires Friday, but could be extended.\n\nJune 18 is the expiration date of the current acquisition contract between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, but the firms could agree to postpone that date","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the potential national security&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Believes National Security Issues in US-Japan Steel Deal Can Be Addressed first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-believes-national-security-issues-in-us-japan-steel-deal-can-be-addressed/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-says-national-security-concerns-in-Nippon-US-Steel-deal-can.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:42:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.416},{"id":331220744,"title":"Sony Music CEO Talks AI: ‘We Are Going to Do Deals for New Music AI Products This Year’","text":"Sony Music CEO/chairman Rob Stringer spoke to investors on Friday (June 13) about his vision for how generative AI can be integrated into his business, stating that the company is “going to do deals for new music AI products this year with those that want to construct the future with us the right way.”\n\n To date, Stringer says the major music company has “actively engaged with more than 800 companies on ethical product creation, content protection and detection, enhancing metadata and audio tuning and translation amongst many other shared strategies.” He went on to say that he believes “AI will be a powerful tool in creating exciting new music that will be innovative and futuristic. There is no doubt about this,” but later added: “So far, there is too little collaboration, with the exception of a handful of more ethically minded players.”\n\n Stringer’s statements about the emerging tech, which he made at Sony Group’s 2025 Business Segment Presentation, arrived just a week after news broke that Sony — and its competitors Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group — were engaged in talks with generative AI music companies Suno and Udio about creating a music license for their models. Suno and Udio are currently using copyrighted material, including music from the three majors, to train their models without a license. This spurred the trio to file blockbuster lawsuits against Suno and Udio in June 2024, in which they alleged copyright infringement on an “almost unimaginable scale.”\n\n In his remarks on Friday, Stringer likened the current AI revolution to “the shift from ownership to streaming” just over a decade ago. “We will share all revenues with our artists and songwriters, whether from training or related to outputs, so they are appropriately compensated from day one of this new frontier,” he said.\n\n “I do think that what AI is based on, which is learning models and training models based on existing content, means that those people who have paved the way for this technology do have to be fairly treated in terms of how they get recompense for that usage in the training model,” Stringer continued. “We have been pretty clear on this since day one that there is absolutely no backwards view as to what this technology will do. There will be artists, probably there will be young people sitting in bedrooms today, who will end up making the music of tomorrow through AI. But if they use existing content to blend something into something magical, then those original creators have to be fairly compensated. And I think that’s where we are at the moment.”\n\n There are challenges ahead to figure out proper remuneration for musical artists from generative AI, as Billboard recently described in an analysis of the Suno and Udio licensing talks. While the AI license could borrow the streaming licensing model by having AI firms obtain blanket licenses for a company’s full musical catalog in exchange for payment, it remains to be seen how the payments would be divided up from there. On streaming services, it’s simple to determine how often any given song is consumed and to route money to songs based on their popularity. But for generative AI, the calculation would be far more complicated. To date, Suno and Udio do not offer guidance as to which tracks were used in the making of an output, and experts are divided on whether or not the technology needed to figure that out is ready yet.\n\n Also on Friday, Stringer expressed a desire to come to agreements with AI companies in a free market, stating: “With deals being carried out, it will be clear to governments that a functioning marketplace does exist, so there is no need for them to listen to the lobbying from the tech companies so heavily.”\n\n Today, many AI companies don’t believe they need to license music or other copyrights at all, citing a “fair use” defense. But in his statements, Stringer was optimistic that this would change, citing the recent position of the U.S. Copyright Office, which said that “making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries.” One day after publishing this position about the value of copyrights in the AI age, however, the Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, was fired by President Donald Trump. (Perlmutter sued soon after, calling Trump’s move “unlawful and ineffective.”)\n\n “We are between us and the AI tech platforms trying to find common ground,” Stringer continued. “And that common ground is not going to take a minute. It’s going to take a moment, and then it’s going to take the trial and error process, and we are in that era right now.”","summary":"Rob Stringer says the major has \"engaged with more than 800 companies on ethical product creation, content protection and detection, enhancing metadata\" and more.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/sony-music-ceo-ai-deals-2025-suno-udio-talks/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_Rob-Stringer-credit-Allison-Michael-Orenstein-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:41:01","author":"Kristin Robinson","authors":["Kristin Robinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":331222748,"title":"Ivanka Trump parties with nepo baby model who made hateful claim against dad Donald","text":"Ivanka, 43, attended Joshua Kushner's birthday celebration on Thursday night.

West Jerusalem said the attacks aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Tehran condemned the Israeli strikes as “blatant aggression” and vowed a “crushing” response.\n\nThe attacks occurred just days before the sixth round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran, planned for Sunday in Oman.\n\nIDF bombs nuclear and military sites\n\nEarly Friday morning, around 200 Israeli fighter jets struck targets across Iran, including a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. Strikes were also reported at nuclear sites in Fordo and Isfahan, as well as military airfields near the cities of Hamadan and Tabriz.\n\nAlmost 80 people were killed and over 320 injured in the attacks, according to the Iranian ambassador to the UN. Tehran confirmed the deaths of top military leaders, including Major General Hossein Salami, commander of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, and Brigadier General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC’s Aerospace Division. Several veteran nuclear scientists were also killed. Iran said only “superficial damage” was done to the Natanz site.\n\nNetanyahu defends ‘preemptive’ strikes\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, aimed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. “We struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program,” he said in a statement following the air raids.\n\nIDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said the situation had “reached the point of no return” due to advancements in Iran’s nuclear program. Tehran has repeatedly stated its program pursues only peaceful goals and that it does not seek nuclear weapons.\n\nIran launches missiles at Tel Aviv\n\nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned the strikes as unjustified and accused Israel of killing civilians. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the attacks “amount to a declaration of war.”\n\nThe Iranian army launched more than 100 drones at Israel hours after the strikes on its territory, followed by ballistic missile fire. Some missiles broke through Israeli defenses and landed in Tel Aviv. At least one person has been killed and more than 60 injured, according to Israeli media.\n\nIsrael also carried out additional strikes in Iran throughout the day.\n\nTrump hails ‘excellent’ Israeli operation\n\nThe US State Department denied American involvement in the Israeli strikes. However, President Donald Trump told Fox News he had been aware of the planned operation and praised its “excellent” outcome. He criticized Iran for failing to reach a deal on its nuclear program under his “60-day ultimatum.”\n\nRussia calls for de-escalation\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin spoke over the phone with Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday afternoon. He condemned Israel’s strikes as illegal under international law and expressed condolences for the deaths of civilians in Iran.\n\nPutin said Russia would seek to “advance the de-escalation of the conflict,” according to the Kremlin. The tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear program must be resolved through diplomacy, he added.\n\nNuclear talks in jeopardy\n\nIran suspended its participation in the Omani-mediated negotiations with the US, the sixth round of which was due to take place on Sunday. Trump previously accused Tehran of “slow-walking” the talks and insisted on complete dismantlement of its nuclear program.\n\nTehran rejected Trump’s demands as unacceptable, insisting it would continue nuclear research for civilian purposes.","summary":"Israeli jets bombed military and nuclear sites in Iran, prompting Tehran to retaliate with missile strikes \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/619234-israel-iran-exchange-strikes/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.06/article/684cade12030275ec53aa6cd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:39:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":331224882,"title":"Tucker Carlson Blasts Former Fox News Colleague Sean Hannity: 'Warmongers'","text":"Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson blasted his former Fox News colleague Sean Hannity on Friday, calling Hannity and other MAGA hawks \"warmongers\" for cheering Israel's missile strikes against the Iranian regime.The ContextIsrael launched a series of strikes against Iran early Friday, local time, which decimated the regime's military chain of command, hit critical nuclear facilities and took out top Iranian nuclear scientists.After the strikes, Iran pulled out of scheduled nuclear talks with the U.S. and retaliated against Israel with a wave of rocket attacks that struck Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial center and also home to the country's central military base.Israel and Iran have been engaged in an increasingly destructive array of tit-for-tat strikes against one another since Hamas—backed by the Iran-led Axis of Resistance—carried out its attack against Israel on October 7, 2023. But the strikes commenced by Israel early Friday marked the most serious escalation yet between Jerusalem and Tehran.What To KnowWhen Israel struck Iran, it capped a long-running foreign policy battle being waged in President Donald Trump's inner circle.Carlson, a staunch isolationist, was among the voices urging against escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, which were at a tipping point before Israel's strikes against the regime early Friday. He also supported Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, as he spearheaded the nuclear discussions with Iran.On the other side of the coin were Hannity and conservative media host Mark Levin, who, among others, were deeply skeptical that Iran would agree to end its nuclear program and expressed support for Israel taking military action.On Friday, Carlson tore into Hannity, Levin, conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch and conservative megadonors Isaac Perlmutter and Miriam Adelson.\"The real divide isn't between people who support Israel and people who support Iran or the Palestinians. The real divide is between those who casually encourage violence, and those who seek to prevent it — between warmongers and peacemakers,\" Carlson wrote on X, formerly Twitter.He added: \"Who are the warmongers? They would include anyone who's calling Donald Trump today to demand air strikes and other direct US military involvement in a war with Iran. On that list: Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Rupert Murdoch, Ike Perlmutter and Miriam Adelson. At some point they will all have to answer for this, but you should know their names now.\"Newsweek reached out to Fox News for comment via email on Friday.Hannity and Levin took a victory lap on Fox News shortly after Israel carried out its first strike against Iran early Friday, with Hannity rattling off a list of Iran's provocations and nuclear threats and Levin saying that \"the Iranians are about to get their asses kicked and it's been coming since Jimmy Carter.\"\"They think this is Joe Biden's administration, that they would get away, get nuclear weapons and then the world would sit there, wouldn't know what to do about it,\" he said, adding that Israel \"is not going to sit there and take it.\"Hours after the strikes, Carlson put out what he called his potential \"final newsletter before all-out war\" and accused Trump of being \"complicit.\"\"While the American military may not have physically perpetrated the assault, years of funding and sending weapons to Israel, which Donald Trump just bragged about on Truth Social, undeniably place the U.S. at the center of last night's events. Washington knew these attacks would happen,\" Carlson wrote. \"They aided Israel in carrying them out. Politicians purporting to be America First can't now credibly turn around and say they had nothing to do with it. Our country is in deep.\"\"Despite being complicit in the act of war, the president hopes last night's events will help his ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran,\" Carlson added. \"Steve Witkoff was scheduled to participate in the next round of talks on Sunday, but whether that will still happen is up in the air.\"Israel's strikes against Iran came after months of Trump urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Tehran, saying that it would torpedo America's already tenuous negotiations with the Iranian regime.What People Are SayingOn Friday, after Israel's strikes, Trump again pushed Iran to come back to the table, writing on Truth Social: \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\"After Iran initiated its retaliatory rocket attacks against Israel, a U.S. defense official told Newsweek: \"Yes, the U.S. is assisting in shooting down missiles targeting Israel.\"What Happens NextIsrael and Iran have been bombing each other since the first wave of strikes early Friday, with Israel saying it plans to \"escalate\" in response to Iran's retaliatory attack. Iran, meanwhile, has warned that it will target the military bases of any countries that assist Israel.","summary":"Carlson blasted Hannity and other conservative hawks as \"warmongers\" for lauding Israel's attack of Iran.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-sean-hannity-maga-trump-iran-israel-2085472","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2663041/tucker-carlson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:37:03","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.192},{"id":331224266,"title":"Adam Brody calls “Blue's Clues” audition the role he fought hardest for: 'I would've loved it'","text":"Everybody wants this: Adam Brody says he \"tried real hard\" to star on Blue's Clues.\n\n The actor called his audition for the beloved children's show the role he fought the hardest for during the early days of his career, sharing the endearing anecdote with fellow funnymen Ted Danson, Seth Rogen, Julio Torres, John Mulaney, and Jason Segel for The Hollywood Reporter's comedy actor roundtable.\n\n \"I really wanted Blue's Clues early on when I first moved to L.A.,\" Brody shared.\n\n \"And you fought for it?\" Rogen asked.\n\n \"I tried real hard, yeah,\" the Nobody Wants This star said. \"It was like 1999, I auditioned for it, I wanted it, I didn’t get it.

They were set for their biggest one-day jump since 2022, when energy costs spiked after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. US oil futures rose 7.3pc to around $73. \n\nGold, a safe haven in times of global uncertai-nty, rose 1.1pc to $3,422 per ounce, bringing it close to the record high of $3,500.05 from April.\n\nThe rush to safety was matched by a dash out of risk assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9pc, the S&P 500 dropped 0.34pc, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4pc. European shares dro-pped almost 1pc, and in Asia, major bourses in Japan, S.

Hill and Fort Lee.\n\nThose forts were renamed during the left’s crazed push, in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests in 2020, to purge public-property references to any figure it deemed controversial.\n\nMuch of the frenzy was a ridiculous exercise in woke revisionism: The hysteria got so bad that not even Teddy Roosevelt, a once-hero of progressivism, was safe. \n\nTrump has made his disdain for the whole gambit clear: One of his first acts as president was giving Mount McKinley its name back. \n\nBut both the left and the right made the argument for nixing the names of traitorous Confederates from public property, especially in cases where the names were picked during the 1950s and ’60s, purely out of hostility toward the Civil Rights movement. \n\nSo both sides should be happy to learn that the restored fort names technically won’t honor Confederates.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Congress passed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act, which required the Pentagon’s newly established Naming Commission to remove Confederate-linked names from Defense Department-owned property. \n\nSo in order to give the forts their names back, the DOD is nodding to service members with identical surnames.\n\nThat silly trick doesn’t might go a bit too far: For instance, Fort Bragg is now named after a relatively unknown World War II private, Roland Bragg, instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg.\n\nBut many of the new honorees do merit the recognition: Fort Rucker will now be named after heroic World War I Capt. Edward W. Rucker, instead of Confederate brigade commander Col. Edmund Rucker; Fort Robert E. Lee will now be simply “Fort Lee,” paying tribute to Army Private Fitz Lee, a black Medal of Honor recipient who served in the Spanish-American War.\n\nThis seems a fair compromise: The bases no longer reference men who fought against the Union, but locals will be able to call the forts by their long-held names.\n\nAnd Trump’s move makes a point — the ever-escalating, Orwellian push to scrub flawed men from the history books needs to stop.\n\nTens of millions of taxpayer dollars were shelled out to change the fort names once, and a similar amount will presumably be spent changing them back. \n\n‘Round and ’round we go. \n\nIn fact, every time any publicly owned building, street or base goes through this process, it’s a costly, divisive mess. \n\nWithout a cease-fire, it’ll never stop; any man or woman deemed worthy of honoring today could be vilified tomorrow, as the standards and values of the time change.\n\nEnough is enough: By finding a solution that should satisfy both sides, Trump is offering an opportunity to end the expensive, renaming war the left started.\n\nAn opportunity neither side should miss.","summary":"During Tuesday's speech at Fort Bragg, Trump announced that his administration would be restoring the names to Fort Pickett, Fort Hood, Fort Gordon, Fort Rucker, Fort Polk, Fort A.P.

There's a realisation in Europe that a lot of its problems and solutions will have to be analysed and thought through by Europe itself. Today's Europe is more self-aware, self-reliant and strategically autonomous, and will want to look for partners who can work with Europe in that respect...

We seek to conclude a defence and security partnership with the European Union. We are looking at a space agreement. We have individual agreements with the states of Europe on talent mobility. We are now trying to see if we can get across an understanding across the entire Union... There is a lot of discussion about connectivity because if you're going to do more business and we're all trying to de-risk and stabilise the global economy, connectivity is very much part of that conversation,\" he added.\nHe spoke about the progress in FTA negotiations.\n\"We have set the goal of trying to complete it by this year. I'm told that half the chapters are done, and for the remaining half, considerable progress has been made. Our trade ministers have met 3 times in the last 6 weeks.

The negotiators and the stakeholders are reacting to a global environment where the importance of doing this FTA has become much more,\" he added.\nIndia and France have completed 25 years of strategic partnership. The bilateral relations with France are rooted in deep trust and commitment, and the two countries cooperate closely across all domains of strategic and contemporary relevance besides sharing similar outlook on many regional and global issues.

But a political agenda was also emerging yesterday, as regime change in Tehran appeared a distinct possibility.\n\nAt around 1am UK time about 200 Israeli military aircraft took off from bases inside the country. But by then much of the painstaking work had already been done, entirely in secret.\n\nThe ground had been laid some time ago by Mossad agents and Israeli special forces who infiltrated Iran, smuggled weapons into the country and prepared drones ahead of what Israel named Operation Rising Lion.\n\nWith only hours to go, the Israeli government informed the White House that the mission was going ahead, despite US and Iranian officials having arranged to hold talks on Sunday about descaling Iran’s nuclear-enrichment programme.\n\nThis warning allowed US diplomats and their families posted to the region to take additional security precautions.\n\nDonald Trump had previously indicated that while he was not prepared to assist Israel militarily, he would not stand in the country’s way either.\n\nIsrael’s hand was also strengthened by the announcement, only days earlier, by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog that, for the first time in two decades, Iran was refusing to work with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nIran’s dismissive response to their pronouncement was to indicate it would establish a third nuclear-enrichment site and install more advanced centrifuges – a move which appeared to have sealed the country’s fate.\n\nFirst reports of Israeli airstrikes emerged in northern Tehran: an explosion in the residential area of Nobonyad.\n\nDetails remained scant yesterday, but some reports indicated this may have been where some of the country’s leading nuclear scientists lived.\n\nSubsequently, the Iranian government confirmed the deaths of a number of academics: Fereydoun Abbasi, former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Dr Mohammed Mehdi Tehranchi, president of the Islamic Azad University of Tehran, and Abdolhamid Minouchehr, Ahmad Zolfaghari and Amirhossein Feqhi, from Tehran’s Shahid Behesti University.\n\nMeanwhile, deep in the deserts of central and western Iran, Israeli special forces troops released swarms of drones which targeted radar facilities and surface-to-air missile capabilities – the military hardware an Iranian response to Israel’s attacks would rely on.\n\nIsrael is expert in such clandestine operations. Even so, the methodology represented a ‘hat-tip’ to Ukraine, which is understood to secretly exchange ‘tactics, techniques and procedures’ (TTPs), in military vernacular, with Israel.\n\nThe rationale for that cooperation from Israel’s perspective is it supports Ukraine – though it does not publicise that support – because Iran supplies Russia with thousands of drones.\n\nWith so many layers of Iran’s defences destroyed, Israeli jets focused on their main target, the centrepiece of Iran’s nuclear-enrichment programme, the Natanz atomic facility in Ishfahan province, 140 miles south of Tehran.\n\nThe IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and the International Atomic Energy Authority confirmed damage to the multi-storey enrichment hall where the nuclear centrifuges are housed.\n\nNatanz has tens of thousands of centrifuges and significantly contributes towards Iran’s highly enriched uranium stockpile.\n\nThe IDF also targeted infrastructure at the site which, in its words, ‘enables the continuous functioning and the continued advancement of the Iranian regime’s project to obtain nuclear weapons’.\n\nIDF spokesman Effie Defrin said its forces had ‘significantly harmed’ the site, which he added was used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to ‘advance their military nuclear programme’.\n\nCrucially, the Bushehr nuclear power plant was left unscathed. This ensured there was no increase in radiation levels.\n\nThis was by no means the first Israeli strike on Natanz.\n\nIt was the target of a major cyber attack in 2010 and a guerrilla-warfare style attack in 2020, when explosives were hidden inside one of the buildings.\n\nAs many as ten strikes were reported at Tabriz airport and a nearby oil refinery in north-west Iran. A long column of black smoke was seen rising from the airport. Three people were reported dead in the city itself.\n\nIsrael also struck dozens of radar installations in western Iran, probably by means of special forces troops approaching the sites on foot, assembling miniature kamikaze drones and setting them off towards these military facilities. Operating at such short range, these drones evaded Iran’s limited surveillance capabilities.\n\nExplosions were also reported at the Nojeh airbase in Hamedan, western Iran. A number of senior Iranian military officers were also said to have been killed when they convened for what they thought was a secret meeting to plan pre-emptive strikes on Israel.\n\nThe venue was chosen for its protection, a bunker deep underground. But, according to reports, the bunker was not deep enough, as an Israeli warhead penetrated the basement.\n\nIran later confirmed the deaths of Major General Gholam Ali Rashid, Major General Hossein Salami, commander of the IRGC, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) force, aerial commander Davoud Shaykhian and Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Army’s Chief of Staff.\n\nAs precautionary measures, Israel closed its airspace and its diplomatic missions overseas. It also suspended gas production at sites in the Mediterranean.\n\nMeanwhile its attacks across Iran lasted for at least five hours – possibly much longer as reports last night suggested that, having secured aerial supremacy, Israeli jets were returning to some of the targets to inflict further damage.\n\nBy way of response, Iran is said to have launched at least 100 drones towards Israel. Its officials also declared the attacks ‘declaration of war’.\n\nIranian drones were found on the ground in Syria after being intercepted by the Israelis.\n\nThe IDF also released footage of the country’s navy shooting down an Iranian drone using Barak-8 surface-to-air missile.\n\nThat no Iranian ordnance seemingly struck any Israeli targets may have convinced its state news agency Fars to deny it had launched any drones at all, claiming Iran’s revenge will ‘take place in the near future’. Iranian media also reported at least 78 deaths and 329 casualties from the Israeli attacks, including women and children.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel should ‘anticipate a severe punishment’, adding the country’s armed forces would defend Iran’s sovereignty.\n\nTo the surprise of Western observers, Iran’s most loyal proxy group in the region, Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon and armed and financed by Iran, said it would not respond.\n\nIran halted all domestic and international flights from its airspace.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mark Rubio suggested Israel’s actions were ‘unilateral’.\n\nWhile the US did not take part in the military action it was fully aware of Israel’s intention.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, sidelined by Israel after condemnation of its continuing campaign in Gaza, called for de-escalation. A No 10 spokesman said: ‘Our priority is to prevent further escalation in the Middle East, that’s in no one’s interest... we’re working closely with all our allies to press for that diplomatic solution’.\n\nRussia, which recently signed a military cooperation pact with Iran, condemned Israel’s ‘unprovoked attack on a sovereign state’. While China expressed ‘concern’. So did Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was last night due to speak to Vladimir Putin.\n\nUN secretary general Antonio Guterres asked both sides to ‘show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a deeper conflict’.\n\nMr Trump advised Iran to ‘make a deal’ while it still has the opportunity. He described Israel’s attack as ‘excellent’. Israel has claimed it was ‘just the beginning’.\n\nThe UN Security Council was meeting yesterday to discuss the continuing crisis.\n\nMr Netanyahu was expected to speak to Sir Keir. The Prime Minister has also discussed the Middle East security crisis with German chancellor Friedrich Merz and French president Emmanuel Macron.","summary":"It was a perfect fusion of high-grade conventional capabilities, human ingenuity and the latest advances in military technologies.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14811049/Israel-attack-Iran-years-planning.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/14/01/99336075-0-image-m-124_1749859800661.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:14:18","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol,Natalie Lisbona","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol","Natalie Lisbona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.416},{"id":331218054,"title":"World News | Earthquake of Magnitude 3.4 Strikes Myanmar","text":"Naypyitaw [Mynamar], June 14 (ANI): An earthquake of magnitude 3.4 struck Myanmar, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said.\nAs per the NCS, the earthquake occurred on late Friday at a shallow depth of 80km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says Iran Has ‘Second Chance’ to Come to Nuclear Deal After Israeli Strikes Devastate Tehran.\nIn a post on X, the NCS said, \"EQ of M: 3.4, On: 13/06/2025 23:02:29 IST, Lat: 23.30 N, Long: 93.52 E, Depth: 80 Km, Location: Myanmar.\"\nhttps://x.com/NCS_Earthquake/status/1933579827128513026\nAlso Read | Iran-Israel Conflict: Iranian News Outlet Close to Government Says 2 Explosions Heard Near Fordo Nuclear Site.\nEarlier on June 10, two earthquakes struck the region.

Although Yangon is relatively far from the fault trace, it still suffers from significant risk due to its dense population. For instance, in 1903, an intense earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 that occurred in Bago also struck Yangon.

The smart set's latest whispers about her once closest confidante, revealed by RICHARD EDEN","text":"Misha Nonoo has often been called the Duchess of Sussex’s best friend, ever since Meghan turned up at the Invictus Games in Toronto in 2017, hand in hand with Prince Harry, in ripped jeans and a £137 shirt known as ‘The Husband’, designed by Misha.\n\nBut has Misha, 39, been jinxed by the association – at least where her fashion business is concerned? \n\nI ask only because her eponymous online brand has seemingly been put on hold. \n\nIts website bears the promise ‘Launching Soon’, but a link for would-be subscribers leads only to a bleak notice saying: ‘Page Not Found’.\n\nA similar fate awaits those attempting to find out more via Misha’s Instagram account, which says her brand offers ‘chic, sustainable fashion for Women on the Go’.\n\nMy inquiry to the company goes unanswered. Misha may, of course, have decided family comes first. \n\nAfter divorcing suave Old Etonian Alexander Gilkes, she wed oil tycoon Michael Hess in Rome in 2019, with Harry and Meghan among the guests, and now has two young children.\n\nHas Emma found a love match with childhood friend?\n\nTennis fans wondering how Emma Raducanu blazed back to British No 1 ranking at Queen’s this week should take a look at her support team.\n\nRoaring her on as she reached the quarter-finals was not just her coach Nick Cavaday (far left) and agent Thomas Houchin, but a dashing former tennis protege close to her heart, Benjamin Heynold.\n\nHe and Emma, 22, have known each other since the age of six and have represented Team GB together. Heynold, 24, is a student at the the University of North Carolina in the US and friends suggest that his long friendship with Emma may have turned to romance.\n\nEmma split up with her Harrow-educated boyfriend, Carlo Agostinelli, last year.\n\nHaving changed coaches seven times in the space of four years as she tried to recapture the form that saw her win a Grand Slam at the 2021 US Open, perhaps Benjamin is her ace?\n\nShe's been a sex symbol since she floated round a spaceship nearly naked in 1960s sci-fi film Barbarella, but Jane Fonda prefers a bit more privacy these days.\n\n‘I don’t get naked in bed with anybody anymore,’ says the 87-year-old actress. ‘If was going to have sex, I would want it to be with a 20-year-old. I like certain kinds of skin. But I don’t want to impose my old skin on somebody else, so I decided to quit altogether.’\n\nIt's fortunate that this meeting wasn’t scheduled for a day later: on Thursday King Charles received the new Iranian ambassador, His Excellency Mr Seyyed Ali Mousavi, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nJust hours later, Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting its nuclear programme and killing senior military figures and scientists. President Donald Trump said he was aware of Israel’s plans beforehand. Presumably, the King wasn’t?\n\nAnthony Hopkins's estranged daughter shares cancer battle\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins won his second Best Actor Oscar for his role opposite Olivia Colman in The Father.\n\nIn real life, his performance as a father is less praiseworthy.\n\nHe has been estranged from his only child, Abigail Hopkins, for more than two decades.\n\nAnd now, I can disclose, she has been fighting a brave battle against cancer.\n\nAbigail, 55, pictured with her dad in 1991, is an actress and musician and she documents her private health challenges on her new album, Stardust. ‘Stardust charts my healing journey from bowel cancer,’ she reveals. ‘I was determined to channel my personal pain through creative work.\n\n‘While finishing my chemotherapy, I came up with the idea of creating an album with proceeds going to charity. I’ve had side effects which included frozen shoulders, and neuropathy and more, so undertaking an album has required a lot from me.’\n\nAsked which of her songs is the most personally meaningful, she replies: ‘The Corridors of Hospitals.’ In addition to the album, she is planning to publish a ‘memoir about my cancer journey’, she says.\n\nPort Talbot-born Sir Anthony, 87, whose films include The Silence of The Lambs and The Mask of Zorro, is so sensitive about his estrangement from Abigail that he refuses to discuss it with even his closest friends.\n\nAn attempt to explain the situation publicly in 2018 backfired so badly that he vowed never to talk about her in interviews again.\n\n‘People make choices,’ he said. ‘I don’t care one way or the other. You don’t have to like your family. Children don’t like their fathers. You don’t have to love each other.’\n\nWhen told his remarks sounded cold he replied: ‘Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.’\n\nAbigail was born at a time his drinking was spiralling out of control. He walked out on her and his first wife, Petronella Baker, in 1971.\n\nEarlier this year, the £15 million mansion overlooking the ocean in Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles where Sir Anthony lived with his third wife Stella, a Colombian, was reduced to rubble in the wild fires.\n\nBride Basia’s barney with scene-stealing Bond girl\n\nBasia Briggs has marked her wedding anniversary in unusual fashion.\n\nBasia, a close friend of Prince Michael of Kent, has accused a Bond girl of trying to upstage her on her big day.\n\nOn the anniversary of her marriage to late property developer Richard Briggs, who owned Hyde Park Stables in London, Basia posted a wedding snap online. ‘On this day a long time ago I married Mr Briggs,’ she wrote. Then she shared a second photograph of her with Marilyn Galsworthy wearing a summer dress more ornate than her own.\n\n‘This horrible woman decided to upstage the bride and turned up dressed in white with flowers in her hair, and hogged every photo,’ Basia commented. Marilyn, who appeared opposite Roger Moore in The Spy Who Loved Me, declines to respond, telling me: ‘Life is too short. It’s very sad.’\n\nThe smart set’s talking about...\n\nParty pooper V&A bosses failure over summer bash \n\nSo delighted to show the Princess of Wales around the Victoria and Albert Museum’s new East Storehouse in London’s Olympic Park this week, its director, Tristram Hunt, appears to have overlooked another big date in his calendar.\n\nThe V&A has failed to organise its traditional summer party, a cherished fixture among the capital’s beau monde.\n\n‘It’s very sad,’ a regular tells me. ‘It was the greatest party, with 1,200 guests. It drew rock stars, prime ministers, creatives, art collectors, tycoons.’\n\nSources claim the museum could not attract a corporate sponsor.\n\nIn the past the bash has been paid for by names such as Harrods, Dior and Chanel.\n\nA V&A spokesman tells me: ‘We won’t be hosting our summer party this year. Our attentions have been focused on the unveiling of V&A East Storehouse.’ Clearly, the V&A is missing the fundraising skills of its party-loving former chairman, Sir Nicholas Coleridge.","summary":"Has Meghan's pal been jinxed by the association - at least where her fashion business is concerned?","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14810901/RICHARD-EDEN-curse-Meghan-struck-again.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/13/19/99356573-0-image-m-15_1749840395043.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:11:45","author":"Editor,Richard Eden","authors":["Editor","Richard Eden"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":331218058,"title":"World News | Earthquake of Magnitude 6.1 Rocks Kuril Islands","text":"Kuril Islands, June 14 (ANI): An earthquake of magnitude 6.1 on the Richter Scale jolted Kuril Islands in the Russian Far East, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said.\nAs per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a shallow depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says Iran Has ‘Second Chance’ to Come to Nuclear Deal After Israeli Strikes Devastate Tehran.\nIn a post on X, the NCS said, \"EQ of M: 6.1, On: 14/06/2025 00:05:11 IST, Lat: 46.01 N, Long: 153.38 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Kuril Islands.\"\nhttps://x.com/NCS_Earthquake/status/1933598858954879329\nAlso Read | Iran-Israel Conflict: Iranian News Outlet Close to Government Says 2 Explosions Heard Near Fordo Nuclear Site.\nShallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka Arc is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. Deformation of the overriding North America plate and associated microplates generates shallow crustal earthquakes, while slip at the subduction zone interface between the Pacific and North America plates generates interplate earthquakes that extend from near the base of the trench to depths of 40 to 60 km. The aftershock zones of great historic earthquakes abut one another along the strike of the arc but generally do not overlap; sections of the subduction zone have typically experienced earthquakes of a consistent size at fairly regular recurrence intervals, though the length of seismicity catalogs is typically shorter than the expected repeat times of the largest earthquakes known to have occurred in the region.\nThe Kuril-Kamchatka region frequently experiences large (M>=7) and great (M>=8) earthquakes. In the 114 years since 1900, 133 large and 12 great earthquakes have occurred along the arc. Damaging tsunamis followed several of the large interplate megathrust earthquakes.\nWhile most large earthquakes along the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc occur at shallow or intermediate depths, the region also hosts large events that rupture at depths greater than 300 km. The most significant of these deep-focus earthquakes to date was the May 24, 2013 M 8.3 event beneath the Sea of Okhotsk, currently the largest deep-focus earthquake on record.

This action could facilitate finding individuals as part of his extensive immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nAn internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press indicate that Medicaid officials attempted to prevent the data exchange due to legal and ethical issues, but were unsuccessful.\n\nDespite this, two senior advisers to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instructed that the dataset be given to the Department of Homeland Security, according to the emails. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were only given 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply with the order.\n\nThe dataset includes the information of people living in Illinois, California Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. CMS transferred the information just as the Trump administration was ramping up its enforcement efforts in Southern California.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nBesides helping authorities locate migrants, experts said, the government could also use the information to scuttle the hopes of migrants seeking green cards, permanent residency or citizenship if they had ever obtained Medicaid benefits funded by the federal government.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom ‘s office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles.\n\n“We deeply value the privacy of all Californians,” the statement said. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.”\n\nABC7 Chicago has reached out to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s officer for comment.\n\nSome California lawmakers on Friday also expressed alarm. U.S. Rep. Laura Friedman, a Democrat, wrote on X that “we should never use a person’s need to go to the doctor against them. This will only lead to more chaos and pain in our communities.”\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal. He declined to answer questions about why the data was shared with DHS and how it would be used.\n\n“With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said.\n\nAn official with DHS, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that Trump “promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.”\n\nThe initiative appears to be part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to provide DHS with more data on migrants. In May, for example, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help agents locate and detain people living without legal status in the U.S.\n\nA targeted review of millions of immigrant Medicaid enrollees\n\nCMS announced late last month that it was reviewing some state’s Medicaid enrollees to ensure federal funds have not been used to pay for coverage for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.” In a letter sent to state Medicaid officials, CMS said that the effort was part of Trump’s Feb. 19 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.”\n\nAs part of the review, California, Washington and Illinois shared details about non-U.S. citizens who have enrolled in their state’s Medicaid program, according to a June 6 memo signed by Medicaid Deputy Director Sara Vitolo that was obtained by the AP. The memo was written by several CMS officials under Vitolo’s supervision, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nThe data includes addresses, names, social security numbers and claims data for enrollees in those states, according to the memo and two people familiar with what the states sent to CMS. Both individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details about the data exchange.\n\nCMS officials attempted to fight the data sharing request from Homeland Security, saying that to do so would violate federal laws, including the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, according to Vitolo’s memo.\n\n“Multiple federal statutory and regulatory authorities do not permit CMS to share this information with entities outside of CMS,” Vitolo wrote, further explaining that the sharing of such personal data is only allowed for directly administering the Medicaid program.\n\nSharing information about Medicaid applicants or enrollees with DHS officials would violate a “longstanding policy,” wrote Vitolo, a career employee, to Trump appointee Kim Brandt, deputy administrator and chief operating officer of CMS .\n\nVitolo and Brandt could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe legal arguments outlined in the memo were not persuasive to Trump appointees at HHS, which oversees the Medicaid agency.\n\nFour days after the memo was sent, on June 10, HHS officials directed the transfer of “the data to DHS by 5:30 ET today,” according to email exchanges obtained by AP.\n\nFormer government officials said the move was unusual because CMS, which has access to personal health data for nearly half of the country, does not typically share such sensitive information with other departments.\n\n“DHS has no role in anything related to Medicaid,” said Jeffrey Grant, a former career employee at CMS.\n\nBeyond her legal arguments, Vitolo said sharing the information with DHS could have a chilling effect on states, perhaps prompting them to withhold information. States, she added needed to guard against the “legal risk” they were taking by giving federal officials data that could be shared with deportation officials.\n\nA ‘concerning’ development\n\nAll states must legally provide emergency Medicaid services to non-U.S. citizens, including to those who are lawfully present but have not yet met a five-year wait to apply for Medicaid.\n\nSeven states, along with the District, allow immigrants who are not living legally in the country to enroll – with full benefits – in their state’s Medicaid program. The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover those immigrants’ health care costs.\n\nThe Trump administration has raised doubts about that pledge.\n\nNixon, the HHS spokesman, said that the state’s Medicaid programs for immigrants “opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid – and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill.”\n\nAll of the states – California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado – have Democratic governors. Due to his state’s budget woes, Newsom announced earlier this year he would freeze enrollment into the program; Illinois will also shut down its program for roughly 30,000 non-U.S. citizens in July.\n\nThe remaining states – New York, Oregon, Minnesota and Colorado – have not yet submitted the identifiable data to CMS as part of the review, according to a public health official who has reviewed CMS’ requests to the states.\n\nState health officials from the District, Washington and Illinois did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement issued after publication of AP’s story, Newsom said the decision to share the data “will jeopardize the safety, health, and security of those who will undoubtedly be targeted by this abuse.”\n\nABC7 Chicago contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration has shared personal data, including immigration&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Administration Shares Illinois Immigrant Medicaid Enrollees&#8217; Personal Data with Deportation Authorities first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-administration-shares-illinois-immigrant-medicaid-enrollees-personal-data-with-deportation-authorities/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-administration-gives-personal-data-of-Illinois-immigrant-Medicaid-enrollees.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:07:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":331218050,"title":"World News | Iran Fires Approx 150 Ballistic Missiles at Israel in Two Barrages: Sources","text":"Tel Aviv [Israel], June 14 (ANI): The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated on Saturday that so far, Iran has fired some 150 ballistic missiles at Israel in two barrages, The Times of Israel stated.\nThere have been reports of nine impact sites, with some 15 people wounded, mostly in good condition, according to medics, as per the Times of Israel.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says Iran Has ‘Second Chance’ to Come to Nuclear Deal After Israeli Strikes Devastate Tehran.\nIsrael Defense Minister Israel Katz says Iran has \"crossed red lines after it dared to fire missiles at civilian population concentrations in Israel.\"\n\"We will continue to defend the citizens of Israel and ensure that the Ayatollah regime pays a very heavy price for its heinous actions,\" he added.\nAlso Read | Iran-Israel Conflict: Iranian News Outlet Close to Government Says 2 Explosions Heard Near Fordo Nuclear Site.\nThe US is assisting Israel in intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles that have been launched at the country this evening, as per The Times of Israel.

This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.\nBhutan is prone to earthquakes due to its location in the Himalayan Mountains, an area known for seismic activity. The country is situated along the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which collide and cause the Himalayas to rise, leading to frequent and strong earthquakes. Bhutan also experiences other natural hazards like landslides, flash floods, and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Bhutan is located in a seismically active region, considered one of the most active in the world. It lies within seismic zones IV and V, as per the Indian Seismic Code, which are the most active zones. The collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates is the primary reason for Bhutan's earthquake risk. The Indian plate is moving northward, pushing the Himalayas upward, and causing stress that eventually releases as earthquakes. Bhutan has experienced numerous earthquakes in the past, including a 2009 earthquake in Mongar with a magnitude of 6.1. While Bhutan acknowledges the high earthquake risk, there is a lack of a comprehensive and official disaster management system in place. The government is promoting confined masonry construction to improve seismic performance in rural areas, and urban buildings undergo strict structural safety inspections.

The companies did not elaborate on what powers the U.S. government will wield with its golden share.\n\n\"All necessary regulatory approvals for the partnership have now been received, and the partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\" U.S. Steel and Nippon said in a statement.\n\nThe national security agreement calls for Nippon to make $11 billion in new investments by 2028, including initial spending on a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, the companies said.\n\nTrump said Thursday that the golden share gives the president \"total control\" without elaborating. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC last month that the golden share will effectively allow the government to control a number of board seats.\n\nTrump opposed U.S. Steel's controversial sale to Nippon in the runup to the 2024 president election, as Republicans and Democrats have leaned into protecting U.S. companies against foreign competitors.\n\nBut Trump started softening his opposition to the takeover after assuming office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. President Joe Biden had blocked U.S. Steel's sale to Nippon during his final days in office, citing national security concerns, despite Japan being a close ally.\n\nTrump has avoided calling the deal an acquisition or merger, describing it as a \"partnership\" in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social.

Defence spending is also poised to skyrocket by 20 per cent as the threat level from India ratchets higher.\n“The army has bolstered its reputation after the skirmishes with India,” said Uday Chandra, assistant professor at Georgetown University.\n“It has emphasised to its critics, especially to Imran Khan’s supporters, that Pakistan without the army in charge would be unviable.”\n\nBoth governments are making bold claims over who came out worse for the short conflict and are deflecting any criticism of their handling of the conflict as unpatriotic.\nWhile Islamabad says six Indian fighter jets were downed by its forces, Modi has declared Operation Sindoor a “humiliating defeat” for Pakistan.\n“[The conflict] has added to his image of being a strong and decisive leader and that he showed Pakistan their place. This will have political benefits for the BJP,” Behera added.\nElections are due in the politically strategic eastern state of Bihar from November this year. Polls in other states including West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are due through 2026 to 2029 before national elections are held again in the country.\nTroubled land\nKashmir – a Muslim-majority Himalayan region claimed in full but controlled in part by both India and Pakistan – has been the site of a bloody conflict since an anti-Indian insurgency erupted in 1989. Tens of thousands of people have died, though violence has tapered off in recent years.\nStill, Kashmir is perhaps Asia’s most incendiary flashpoint – and leaders from India and Pakistan routinely trade on the festering enmity for domestic political gain, particularly among arch-nationalists.\n\nIn 2016 Indian army commandos crossed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir to attack targets, following a militant attack on an Indian army outpost at Uri, also in Jammu and Kashmir.\nThree years later India sent fighter jets deep into Pakistani territory to bomb what it claimed was a militant training facility in Balakot in retaliation for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy of Indian security personnel in Pulwama in Kashmir.\nThis time, Pakistan has made the louder splash with its claims of military success.\nPakistan said its Chinese-made J-10 jets took down several Indian Air Force aircraft, a claim partly substantiated by India’s chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan earlier this month.\nThe Indian military has said it destroyed an air-defence system in the city of Lahore and caused significant damage on Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan in Rawalpindi, where the country’s military and nuclear command are located. India also said it had downed “hi-tech” Pakistani jets.\n\nPakistanis have rallied around the flag – and that has given a timely image boost to the powerful military in a country where no elected leader has ever served out their full five-year term.\nIn May 2023 security forces arrested former prime minister Khan on charges of corruption – allegations that he called politically motivated.\nThe arrest prompted thousands of his supporters to storm government buildings and military installations. The government arrested about 1,400 people at that time, though ultimately only a handful were convicted for their role after military trials.\n“On the surface, things appear under control [in Pakistan] with war jingoism obscuring the country’s domestic troubles. But scratch below the surface and you find that the army enjoys prestige but limited legitimacy,” Chandra said.\n“The popular demand for clean civilian governance remains strong in the country,” he added.\nThe Pakistan military had “resurrected itself a little” with the India flare-up, Behera said. “What happens in the long term, we have to wait and see.”\n\nUnmovable Modi?\nIn September Modi will hit 75, the informal age of political retirement within the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.\nThe menace of Pakistan may fuel any attempt to prolong his stay in office, analysts say, amid local media reports speculating on potential successors.\nYashwant Deshmukh, founder of pollster C-voter, estimates that Modi’s popularity ratings have gone up a notch since the conflict, saying that he is likely to continue in power until at least the end of his prime ministerial tenure in 2029.\n“There are maybe a couple of people who can be successors to Modi such as Home Minister Amit Shah and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari,” Deshmukh said.\n“But the question of someone succeeding Modi only arises if he goes anywhere. I don’t see that happening yet.”\n\nSome critics have spotlighted Modi’s abrupt ceasefire call after just four days of conflict as a sign of weakness. Hindu hardliners had urged the military to push deep into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, rather than end hostilities with a draw.\n“There are people in the BJP who have been disappointed. But they are likely to bottle up their sentiments and stay on because they would not like to join the Congress party,” Deshmukh said, of the main opposition party.\nIndia says the ceasefire followed a call by Pakistan’s director general of military operations after Indian forces inflicted extensive damage on nine Pakistani air bases.\nPakistan says it downed several Indian jets during the clash, while India too has claimed that it shot Pakistani planes. In the fog of war, neither side’s claims have been fully substantiated.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has thrown a spanner in the works.\nHe has repeatedly claimed that he mediated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, embarrassing New Delhi which has always insisted that any dispute with Pakistan will be sorted bilaterally without involving a third party.\nIndian officials have denied Trump’s claim that he single-handedly brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.\nModi “lost face” over the episode, Chandra said.\n“He [Modi] has not directly contradicted the statement by Trump. But he has also not answered a basic question raised by ordinary Indians: ‘If India was really as successful as media outlets showed, then why pull out of the conflict?’” he asked.\nPolitical opponents have also been quick to seize on Trump’s comments.\nK.C. Venugopal, a member of parliament from Congress, took a veiled dig at Modi saying in a social media post on X: “Time has passed when any nation sitting 3-4 thousand miles away could give orders to Indians.”\nCongress’ de facto leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan, alleging it was a surrender influenced by Trump.\n“Donald Trump picked up his phone and signalled Modi-ji – Narendra, surrender. And PM Modi abided by Trump’s orders,” Gandhi told a gathering in Madhya Pradesh state capital Bhopal on June 3.\n\nDiplomatic offensive\nIndia’s federal government sent seven multiparty delegations to visit 33 countries over two weeks to present the country’s stance on cross-border terrorism and Operation Sindoor, billed as a show of national unity following the Pahalgam attack.\nThe effort outflanked domestic opponents and raised “questions whether they are levelling criticism only for the sake of criticism”, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political commentator.\nYet Indian observers have also been disappointed with the feedback from their international community, mainly over the lack of unequivocal condemnation of Pakistan.\n“I don’t think India was very successful in convincing other parties that there was a direct connection between the Pahalgam terror attack and Pakistan,” Mukhopadhyay added.\nOthers say the Indian delegations made their mark.\n“I think we did make an impact,” said Vivek Mishra, deputy director of the strategic studies programme at the Observer Research Foundation.\n“But few countries would give out statements in the middle of a conflict because things are too dense to know what is really happening.”\n\nWhile the ceasefire is holding, both countries have braced themselves for the next flare-up of tensions, aware that they are on dangerous new ground since India conducted raids directly into Pakistan.\nAnd the rhetoric from Delhi remains sharp.\nAt an election rally in the eastern state of Bihar last month, Modi promised to hunt down terrorists wherever they might be if they dared to attack India again.\n“Our Indian army brought to the knees the terrorists who thought they were safe and secure under the shelter of Pakistan’s army,” Modi told a mammoth gathering, lauding the Indian forces.\n“During Operation Sindoor, the enemy faced the brunt of India’s military might. They should understand that we had fired just one arrow in India’s quiver. India will neither pause, nor halt its onslaught on terrorism,” he said.\n“If terrorists dare to raise their heads again, then India will snatch them out of their hiding holes and crush them.”","summary":"Pulled back from the brink by a ceasefire, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan avoided a potentially catastrophic collision, but the tides of nationalism unleashed by the four-day clash are still rising on either side of the border.\nNow, leaders of the two nations are seeking to cement a political dividend from the May conflict, with competing claims of victory relayed to domestic audiences attuned to triumphalism whenever the two nations clash.\n“The conflict has created a national fervour on both...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3314346/winning-narrative-how-india-pakistans-leaders-seek-cover-under-their-flags-after-ceasefire","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/13/f622d351-f786-4ec3-b4d4-76c43bb76572_b22822b3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:00:16","author":"Biman Mukherji","authors":["Biman Mukherji"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":331220544,"title":"UN Ocean Summit Ends with Progress but No Clear Funding","text":"The UN Ocean Summit concluded in Nice with advances in protecting the high seas—but without any clear financial commitments. After bringing together around 60 world leaders, the summit also ended with tougher warnings against deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates and leaders from island nations, however, criticized what they see as backsliding on fossil fuels and expressed disappointment over limited progress in marine area protection.\n\nFull Speed Ahead for the High Seas\n\nWidely celebrated, the ratification of the High Seas Treaty by around 50 countries—formalized Monday in Nice—offers hope for the rapid entry into force of this international agreement, which aims to strengthen protections for international waters (beyond 200 nautical miles or 370 kilometers from shore).\n\nRebecca Hubbard of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of about 50 NGOs, hailed it as an “incredible breakthrough.” But “we must keep our foot on the gas,” she warned, since the treaty will only take effect 120 days after the 60th ratification is deposited. France was unable to reach that key number in Nice, as French President Emmanuel Macron had hoped.\n\nStill, “there’s been an incredible mobilization,” said Romain Troublé, director of the Tara Ocean Foundation. “A real acceleration,” echoed François Chartier of Greenpeace. “The treaty should be finalized before the end of the year, and we can begin work on the first marine protected areas in the high seas,” he added.\n\nHarsh Criticism of Deep-Sea Mining\n\nFrom the summit’s outset, global leaders took a harsher stance against former U.S. President Donald Trump’s unilateral decision to begin mining polymetallic nodules in international waters of the Pacific. “The deep sea is not for sale,” declared Emmanuel Macron, calling it “madness” and a “predatory economic action,” while UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned against a new “Wild West.”\n\nStill, this strong rhetoric failed to significantly expand the coalition calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining—from 32 to just 37 countries out of the 169 members of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which is tasked with drafting a mining code.\n\nMore (and Better) Marine Protected Areas\n\nFrom Colombia to Samoa, and Portugal to Greece, countries around the world announced either the creation of new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) or the strengthening of existing ones—particularly by banning bottom trawling. The global share of ocean designated as protected areas could exceed 10% by the end of the summit, up from the previous 8.34%.\n\nHowever, France’s limited measures—restricting bottom trawling in only 4% of its metropolitan waters—disappointed environmental NGOs.\n\nSilence on Fossil Fuels\n\nDespite being the main cause of global warming, fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal) were not mentioned in the final draft declaration expected to be adopted Friday. The document refers only to the “harmful effects of climate change” on oceans and ecosystems but does not explicitly call for a transition away from fossil fuels—unlike the COP28 agreement in Dubai in 2023.\n\n“It’s the primary driver of ocean degradation, and we’re not talking about it enough. That’s regrettable,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Environment Minister of Vanuatu, a volcanic Pacific archipelago. Meanwhile, the $100 billion in funding mentioned by Costa Rica prior to the summit never materialized. According to a 2022 World Economic Forum report, an estimated $175 billion per year is needed to meet the Sustainable Ocean Development Goal by 2030.","summary":"The UN Ocean Summit concluded in Nice with advances in protecting the high seas—but without any clear financial commitments.

Skyscrapers as big as mountains, he said, and dancing girls on tables in the bars. Every colour and creed of man just going about their business. He had a brother in Yonkers you see. Left Leitirmor aged 18. Still spoke Irish in the pubs on McLean Avenue.\n\n Such was the wholesomeness of his wonder I wasn’t sure was he taking the piss — you can’t go to Connemara without a local taking the piss — but with no wink of inclusion in my direction forthcoming, I took him at his word. “See Times Square and die,” as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe famously said.\n\n The coup de grace for Turf Man was not the Empire State Building, nor Ellis Island, it wasn’t even the Abercrombie and Fitch store on 5th Avenue, it was, as he described in colourful detail, the fact that you could get a steak at 5 O’clock in the morning. \n\n“Can you believe it?” he asked us, doubting that we did, “A steak! And spuds! The whole shebang at 5am! I’ve never seen anything like it.” \n\nNow, I’m not sure if he told the steak story to every exotic visitor that passed through the doors of the establishment — an establishment that only seemed to employ him to reload the turf — but if he did, there was literally no way he could’ve brought such gusto to each telling. The colour and detail were enough to make Joan Didion weep. \n\n“It's distinctly possible to stay too long at the fair,” she famously said of her beloved New York. Perhaps wise to her warning, Turf Man only stayed a long weekend.\n\n Only the cities of London and Boston hold the same place in Irish hearts that New York does, and that love affair owes much to the embrace it has given to millions for generations. So many exiled under duress through hunger and poverty, others so privileged to go there by choice. \n\nFamily ties\n\nMy own father lived there in the 60s and, by his telling, he happened to meet every key historical figure of that decade while he was holed up in the Bronx, which is remarkable for a guy who drove a delivery truck for Canada Dry and took coats at the University Club on West 54th Street. \n\nMy mother took him back for the first time in three decades almost 20 years ago, and after a brief stop into an aforementioned department store to buy boxer shorts for her sons (because, you know), she found my dad out front, chatting to a topless Black male model, himself in little more than briefs, telling him about the time he took Eisenhower’s hat.\n\n It’s always been that kind of town, but times they are a changing. Last month there were reports of undocumented Irish staying away from GAA matches in Gaelic Park, from Irish dances, from weddings, fearing raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) squads, the same type of raids that have set Los Angeles ablaze in the last week. The riots on the West Coast will only amplify that sense of paranoia that only undocumented immigrants know.\n\n The Irish in America are no more deserving of better treatment than a Haitian immigrant, say, and they must know they have it much better, though it will serve as little consolation. Black and Brown people have and will be targeted much faster by ICE, an agency that is acting very much in the likeness of the country’s president, Donald Trump. Racism, as much as capitalism, is at the core of each and every domestic policy in America presently, and undocumented Irish people may well be the unintended victims of that.\n\n We need not look so far West to audit the results of systemic bigotry. Events in Ballymena this week function as a cold reminder that manmade fear and paranoia injected into a society by nefarious actors only begets more hatred and violence. \n\nThere isn’t an Irish person alive whose family has not benefited from the open arms of other countries, whether through a J1 visa or a generous aunt in Dorchester. How people fall for the same tired lines of scaremongering and gaslighting is beyond me.

Explosions were heard there on Friday evening.\n\nUS president Donald Trump warned that Iran must come to the nuclear negotiating table and make a deal “with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal”.\n\nHowever, the danger for the Israeli leadership is that when Operation Rising Lion is over, Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan may be capable of being repaired in a matter of months.\n\nAll that Mr Netanyahu will have achieved is a short delay, a temporary roadblock, on Iran’s progress towards an atomic arsenal.\n\nThis implies a prolonged campaign. \n\nJust as Mr Netanyahu has pledged to eradicate the involvement of Hamas in the affairs of Gaza — a war aim increasingly acknowledged by many of the countries attempting to broker a settlement and recognition of Palestine — so the dismantling of Iran’s predominantly secret 20-year programme will be another red line.\n\nThe attack on Iran rewrites the agenda for the three day G7 leaders’ summit which starts in the Rockies of Kananaskis, Alberta, on Sunday.\n\nHopes for international peace are further away today than they were on Friday. \n\nBy the middle of next week, they may have disappeared far beyond the event horizon.\n\nSize isn’t everything when you’re on the road\n\nThere are many reasons why buying an SUV might be considered a contentious purchase.\n\nTheir weight and consequential impact on road surfaces is one.\n\nFuel consumption could be another in an era where it’s widely recognised that reducing carbon gases is a desirable objective for the good of society.\n\nThen there’s the amount of space they can take up, particularly in car parks which were designed at the end of the last century.\n\nOr the visual obstruction they present when a driver is attempting to assess whether to overtake.\n\nIf none of this cuts any ice with Irish motorists, and all the purchasing evidence suggests that it doesn’t, then what about considering a comprehensive report which concludes that the relentlessly rising bonnet height of new cars is a “clear and growing threat to public safety, especially for children”.\n\nThe report, by lobbyists Transport & Environment (T&E), said the average bonnet height of new cars in Europe rose from 77cm in 2010 to 84cm last year.\n\nA Belgian study of 300,000 casualties concluded that a 10cm increase from 80cm to 90cm raised the risk of death in a crash by 27% for pedestrians and cyclists. \n\nChildren were substantially more likely to be killed as pedestrians in collisions than adults.\n\nT&E also commissioned Loughborough University’s school of design to test the visibility of children from high-fronted cars. \n\nThe driver of a Ram TRX was unable to see children aged up to nine who were standing directly in front, while a Land Rover Defender driver could not see children aged up to four and a half.\n\nIn collisions with pedestrians, high-bonneted vehicles are more likely to strike vital core organs in the bodies of adults and the heads of children. Lower bonnets tend to hit legs.\n\nIn Europe, there is no legal limit to bonnet height, and researchers argue that one should be introduced by 2035 and set no higher than 85cm.\n\nThe campaign against SUVs shows no sign of abating.\n\nParis and Lyon in France, and Aachen in Germany, charge bigger cars more to park.\n\nIn Britain, Cardiff, Bristol, Oxford, and Haringey are considering similar measures and last week the London Assembly called for limits on bonnet height.\n\nThe International Energy Agency reported record global SUV sales in 2024 and record SUV CO2 emissions of 1bn tonnes. \n\nIf SUVs were a country, they would rank as the fifth most polluting in the world, the IEA said.\n\nIn Ireland, as many SUVs, which have their design inspiration in rugged terrain vehicles, are sold to urban and city dwellers as to people who live in rural locations. \n\nIn other words, it is often a style choice.\n\nLike deliveries by drone and the establishment of large power-hungry and water-hungry data centres, it is a commercial development whose consequences have not been fully thought through.","summary":"All eyes are on Iran’s retaliatory measures against Israel","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41651222.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9325/4662971_11_seoimage1x1_Tel_Aviv_AP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":331225768,"title":"Letters to the Editor: Airports need to be used to their full potential","text":"Why are airline passengers being forced to travel mostly in the middle of the night from these regions bypassing their local airport to be in Dublin more than two hours before their departure?\n\nBelfast Airport handles more passengers than these three regional airports combined with a throughput of nearly 7m and is nearer to Dublin. \n\nDAA will tell us that the airlines will not fly to these airports but insist on using Dublin — but is this not a case of the tail wagging the dog? \n\nThe airlines go where the passengers are and would willingly serve these regions if the flights were organised and ease the pressure on Dublin.\n\nDAA talks about connectivity but connectivity should not be confined to the capital but rather be on a national scale where the regional benefits would be enormous in terms of investment, local economic development, and employment.\n\nIf one takes a close look at DAA annual returns you will discover that the majority of the income comes not from airlines but rather from hospitality, car park income, and other related activities.\n\nThis is the real reason why there is such huge pressure to expand Dublin and ignore the regions.\n\nThe public representatives from the South, Midwest, and the West of Ireland would want to stand up and demand a fair slice of the cake for their constituents before it’s too late.\n\n Jim Scully, St Margarets, Co Dublin\n\nPigs treated as a commodity, not sentient beings\n\nThe majority of your readers will know that pigs are intelligent, sociable animals. \n\nWhat they may not know is that they are (with the possible exception of the broiler chicken) the most exploited farmed animal on the planet.\n\nIf you are born a pig — in China, in the US, in Vietnam, in Brazil, or in Ireland — you’re unlikely to ever see the light of day, and you’ll be slaughtered when you’re a mere six months old; unless you have the misfortune to be a breeding sow, in which case your life will be longer but considerably more stressful before a premature slaughter at the age of three or four.\n\nIn natural conditions, pigs thrive in stable social groups which typically consist of a few sows with their young. \n\nThey range over hundreds of kilometres and spend much of their day foraging and rooting for food. \n\nThey make nests to sleep in and they dig out wallows in the mud when they need to cool down.\n\nOn a factory farm (approximately 98% of all Irish pigs are raised on factory farms), the pigs to be fattened for slaughter are raised in large groups in overcrowded pens, on concrete floors without bedding.\n\nAlmost all are mutilated: Their tails are docked and their teeth are clipped or crushed. The latter procedure is to prevent the piglets from damaging their mother’s teats, while the former procedure is to eliminate the biting of other pigs’ tails. Both procedures are painful and are usually carried out without anaesthetic.\n\nSows are confined in gestation stalls and in farrowing crates for lengthy periods; the stalls and crates are so small that the sows cannot even turn around.\n\nThe economic model of the industry operates on the basis of cramming as many animals as possible into as small a space as possible and rearing them in the shortest time possible.\n\nIt ignores the fact that pigs have a complex range of emotions and an ability to experience pain and distress in the same way that a dog can. \n\nIt treats pigs as a commodity, not as intelligent, social, sentient beings.\n\nIf we exploited our companion animals in the way that the industry exploits pigs, there would be a public outcry followed by a public enquiry.\n\n Gerry Boland, Keadue, Co Roscommon\n\nTrump is a tap-dancing puppet to Putin’s tune\n\nIn the past month or so US president Donald Trump has gone from referring to Vladimir Putin as \"absolutely crazy\" (arguably with admiring undertones) to threatening to change his attitude to Putin if he believed the Russian was \"tapping him along\" in terms of peace efforts with Ukraine, to being a spokesman for Putin in announcing, in the wake of Ukraine’s devastating attack on Russian airfields by a fleet of small suicide drones, that Putin \"did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields\".\n\nThis isn’t just \"tapping him along\", this is Trump in full tap-dancing puppetry to the Putin philharmonic.\n\nThe libretto for which Americans voted has been lamentably clear for some time, now we are getting the score.\n\n Michael Gannon, Saint Thomas Sq, Kilkenny City","summary":"A reader that lives beside Dublin Airport says Shannon, Cork, and Knock airports deserve a fair slice of the cake","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-41651051.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9325/4662572_5_seoimage1x1_4J9A3953-min_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":331216618,"title":"Americans weigh in on Trump's deployment of troops to quell Los Angeles unrest","text":"A new national poll indicates that Americans are divided over President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the nation's second most populous city.

Trump has been squared. The mullahs in Tehran must now fear for their existence","text":"The United States did not participate in Israel’s initial attacks on Iran but it certainly knew they were coming. Donald Trump admitted as much to the US media yesterday morning.\n\nAs early as Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had indicated to him on a call that military action was looking imminent. He spoke again with the President on Thursday to give him a further ‘heads up’.\n\nEven though US-Iranian talks were ongoing it doesn’t look as if the President made much of an effort to dissuade Netanyahu. Instead, the US started evacuating non-essential personnel and the families of diplomats and the military from the region in anticipation of Israeli strikes. By mid-week most senior aides in the White House were expecting an Israeli attack ‘within days’.\n\nIt is true that Trump and Netanyahu don’t get along. Both are strong-willed, self-serving men with massive egos. They tend to rub each other up the wrong way.\n\nTrump’s personal likes or dislikes often play a disproportionate part in determining US policy. But not this time. The President was more miffed by Iran rejecting his peace proposals than he was by Netanyahu’s determination to launch an attack.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump was dropping so many hints of impending military strikes that Israeli officials feared he was giving the game away, and unwittingly alerting Iran to what was in store. ‘I don’t want to say it’s imminent but it [an Israeli attack] looks like something that could very well happen,’ he said at one stage.\n\nIsrael prevailed on him to post a ‘give peace a chance’ message on social media to put Tehran off the scent, which he duly did around midnight Tel Aviv time on Thursday, with a tweet declaring that ‘we are still committed to a diplomatic solution’.\n\nA few hours later Israel launched 200 jet fighters against Iran and activated its covert operations inside the country.\n\nThe strikes were mounted under cover of US talk about of continued diplomacy – a modern version of the Trojan Horse.\n\nThroughout its negotiations with Iran, the US insisted that the Islamist regime in Tehran must give up its ambitions to develop nuclear bombs, which meant ending its efforts to enrich uranium to so-called ‘weapons grade’, which is far beyond the level needed for nuclear power stations. Throughout Iran refused point-blank to any such commitment.\n\nThen, this week came a crucial development. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), tasked by the UN with getting a handle on Iran’s secret nuclear activity, ruled that Tehran was failing to comply with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – the first such ruling in two decades of arm-wrestling with the Iranian regime.\n\nThe IAEA’s report on the extent of Iran’s efforts to avoid detection was devastating. Every time an illicit nuclear site was identified by the UN agency, Iran would destroy the facility, move the uranium containers to another site and rake over the ground to make it seem as if nothing had ever happened there.\n\nIran remained defiant. The head of its atomic agency vowed to accelerate its production of near-weapons-grade uranium and open a previously unknown enrichment site in what was said to be a secure location – likely in the mountains of Natanz. At the same time Iran was upgrading its centrifuges (for enriching uranium) at another location to make them ten times as powerful.\n\nIn other words, they had committed to accelerating the enrichment of larger amounts of uranium for more bombs, at not one site but two, and with both designed to be difficult to destroy in a military strike. Iran had run out of road with the IAEA – and with the Trump administration. When Trump began his efforts to clinch a deal with Iran he gave negotiations two months to succeed. That deadline was reached on Thursday.\n\nOn that very day, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Trump had ‘given Iran every opportunity’ to agree a deal. Though a sixth round of talks was scheduled for this weekend in Oman it was clear Trump now thought the time for talk was over.\n\nThe President has stayed pretty much onside with Israel in the aftermath of its initial strikes. Speculation of a rift with Netanyahu has proved unfounded. Trump has told Iran that much worse is to come. The talk in Israel is of a two-week onslaught, maybe more.\n\nIsrael’s ambition is to do to Iran what it’s already done to Hezbollah, Iran’s terrorist proxy in Lebanon, but on a much larger scale.\n\nThat means decapitating the leadership (three generals, including the head of the regime’s praetorian troops, the Revolutionary Guard, were killed in the first strike); degrading its arsenals of missiles and drones (the covert teams on the ground are doing that as much as the Israeli jet fighters); and – specific to Iran – destroying its nuclear bomb facilities (Israel claims it’s already done ‘significant damage’ to the Natanz enrichment site).\n\nThe strategy is to force a much-weakened Iran into a settlement. Trump agrees. ‘Iran must make a deal,’ Trump urged ‘before there is nothing left.’ Early assessments by various intelligence agencies suggest Iran’s skies are already largely open and undefended after just the first wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nYesterday Trump warned Tehran that Israel had access to US-made ‘lethal military equipment’ which ‘they know how to use’ and that further attacks would be ‘even more brutal’.\n\nI am told by one usually reliable source (but have not been able to confirm from other sources) that the US has made its infamous ‘bunker buster’ bomb available to the Israeli air force.\n\nTechnically known as the ‘GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator’, it is 30,000lb of explosive and the only bomb likely to take out Iranian nuclear bomb-making facilities buried deep underground.\n\nThe US air force uses the stealth B2 bomber to deliver it but the Israeli air force has no B2s. It’s not clear on what Israeli military aircraft it could be deployed. America is not inclined to oblige with a B2 bombing run of its own. The US administration clearly approves of – and has even been complicit in – the Israeli strikes. Even so, Trump is anxious to avoid any direct military involvement unless US bases or close allies in the region are attacked.\n\nAmerica’s Sunni Arab allies in the Gulf have criticised Israel’s actions. But such criticism is simply a matter of course.\n\nIn truth, the largely Sunni Arab Gulf states have every interest in Iran – a Shia theocracy that seeks to dominate the region – being humiliated and deprived of the ability to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Jordanian air force has already taken to the skies to take down Iranian drones dispatched to Israel in retaliation.\n\nThe usual anti-Israeli voices are loud in their outrage at the attacks on Iran. Yet even European governments are quietly agreeing with America that Iran was given every opportunity to make a deal – but chose to string the US along instead.\n\nAnd that Trump had made it clear from the start that a nuclear-armed Iran was not something that would be tolerated.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic there is admiration for Israel’s military prowess, especially the destructive work of its covert operations inside Iran, and for the strategic thinking behind its strikes.\n\nThe Trump-Netanyahu bust-up so hoped-for by Israel’s enemies has failed to materialise. Fashionable opinion is now saying the strikes will only delay Iran developing the Bomb – indeed it might even speed it up. But that is less credible with every day the effectively defenceless facilities of Iran are pounded from the skies.\n\nThe fact is that Israel holds most of the cards. America has been squared. The Europeans barely matter. The Sunni Arabs are quietly content.\n\nAn unpopular Iranian dictatorship is reeling from the onslaught. Its terrorist proxies throughout the region have been largely brought to heel. It must now fear for its own future.\n\nIsrael’s next move might well be to threaten Iran’s vulnerable oil refineries, which would destroy an already tottering economy whose fossil fuel revenues are the only thing propping it up. That, in turn, would further undermine the regime.\n\nOf course Israel might equally say: we’ll leave the refineries intact if you let us destroy your nuclear bomb facilities. That would leave the mullahs in a real quandary – a Catch-22 for Tehran if ever there was one.","summary":"The United States did not participate in Israel's initial attacks on Iran but it certainly knew they were coming.

The state of California and America’s second largest city have long been in Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nNo other state is home to as many immigrants, documented and undocumented. And no state is more innovative or more prosperous; it recently bypassed Japan to become the world’s fourth largest economy.\n\nCalifornia has wrestled with inequality and unrest, racism and political extremes throughout its history, but for 150 years America’s wealthiest and most populous state has doubled as the petri dish that fuelled almost every surge in America’s economic fortunes.\n\nFrom Levi’s jeans to Mickey Mouse, from the movie industry to the internet, from smartphones to electric cars to CAT scans, California has been synonymous with creativity and innovation. \n\nIt’s where surgeons first removed an appendix through a mouth and a gallbladder through a bellybutton. \n\nCheap immigrant labour has allowed its construction, agriculture and hospitality industries to flourish, while progressive policies laid the groundwork for investment in technology and green energy.\n\nNow it seems it may become the testing ground for Trump’s strongman tactics.\n\nA combination of border proximity, liberal policies, and a labour market that relies on migrants both documented and undocumented has contributed to California’s disproportionately high migrant population. \n\nLos Angeles county is home to 10 million people of whom almost four million live in Los Angeles city.\n\nAround 3.5 million are first-generation immigrants and of these an estimated 800,000 to 950,000 are undocumented. \n\nMany live in ‘mixed status’ households where one or more family members may be legally working in the US while others are undocumented. \n\nThey are concentrated in working-class neighbourhoods like Paramount, which along with a downtown clothing wholesaler, was the site of the initial ICE raids that triggered the protests that prompted Trump to deploy of US troops onto its streets.\n\nProtests and clashes\n\nTrump’s decision to deploy the military marks the first time in 60 years that a US President federalised the National Guard without consulting, much less obtaining the consent, of its governor. \n\nThe last time it happened Lyndon Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect civil rights activists against a virulently racist governor and police force.\n\nThe city bears decades-old psychic scars from riots in the 1960s and the 1990s when mob violence and mayhem took a savage toll on the city and left an abiding mistrust of the Los Angeles Police Department, which has a long and undistinguished history of corruption and racism. \n\nRecently, however, community policing initiatives have led to significant drops in violent crime in some of Los Angeles’s most dangerous neighbourhoods.\n\nPredictably, the protests against ICE led to clashes with the LAPD and re-inflamed tensions, with thugs setting fire to Waymo cars and providing the sort of made-for-FOX-News images that Trump seized upon to retrospectively justify his overreach. \n\nTrump's narrative\n\nLA was \"trash\", he said. \n\nWilling supplicants fanned out across pro-MAGA media outlets peddling the narrative that the military prevented an all-out conflagration, protecting ICE agents and federal buildings from marauding hordes of homegrown anarchists, leftists, and communists who are simultaneously seeking to destroy the US from within, whilst preventing the rounding up and deporting of an invasion of foreign terrorists, drug cartel members, murderers and child traffickers.\n\nIt’s a narrative that Trump has pushed to justify his trampling of the presidential norms that have thus far protected and nurtured the American experiment as it approaches its 250th anniversary. \n\nWhile previous presidents from both parties have dinged the guardrails of democracy in furtherance of their aims, none has attempted the sort of blatant transgressions of the past five months.\n\nHis Department of Justice is a willing and eager accomplice, defending the absurdity of deploying more US troops to Los Angeles than is currently spread across Iraq and Syria to prevent a resurgence of ISIS – just hours after the LAPD police chief issued a press statement acknowledging the peaceful nature of the protests.\n\nProtests spread\n\nAt the time of writing, protests had spread across the United States to other cities with significant migrant populations – Denver, St Louis, Chicago, San Antonio, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Philadelphia. \n\nMost are cities in blue states but protests also broke out in Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania – four of the six swing states that Biden won in 2020 and Trump claimed back in 2024, both candidates doing so with the narrowest of margins.\n\nTrump may not be particularly bothered by the political impact of his flirtation with authoritarianism in the 2026 midterms – or indeed the 2028 presidential election. Thus far, his presidency seems to be primarily an exercise in self-enrichment and retribution. \n\nBut even Congressional Republicans who have drowned their political principles in a murky bath of expediency and denial are aware that, to paraphrase Elon Musk, Trump has 3.5 years left while the GOP presumably hopes to match and exceed Musk’s prophesied expiry date of 40 years hence.\n\nThe border crisis\n\nThe current crisis has its roots in part at least in Joe Biden’s reckless border policies. \n\nThe Biden administration did little to curb or control the post-covid surge of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers. \n\nWhen he and the Democrats finally acted, delivering a comprehensive bipartisan border reform bill in early 2024, it was deliberately tanked by Trump’s Congressional lackeys, who knew a solution to America’s decades-old border crisis would stall the engine that was powering his 2024 comeback campaign.\n\nPolls have shown so far that the public remains largely on Trump’s side. \n\nA majority of Americans prefer the performative hyper kinetics of his immigration policies to the listlessness of the Biden era. \n\nBut outside the far-right faction of the GOP, that support is contingent upon the belief that mass deportations will lead to increased prosperity for American citizens, to cheaper homes, lower crime rates, and better paying jobs.\n\nIt’s unclear to what degree and for how long America will remain willing to tolerate chaos and the suppression of individual rights if prices keep rising and Trump fails to deliver on his side of the economic Faustian pact that America has entered. \n\nLast week may be just the beginning of a dark new chapter in US history.","summary":"Los Angeles was always going to be first to be on the receiving end of Donald Trump's deployment of the US military.

He was the first high-profile protester to be arrested under Trump’s campaign to expel foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nJust this week, Farbiarz appeared poised to order Khalil’s release, on the basis that his detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was unconstitutional.\n\nThat law stipulates that the secretary of state – in this case, Marco Rubio – has the power to remove foreign nationals who have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. But Farbiarz ruled that Rubio’s use of the law violated Khalil’s freedom of speech.\n\nStill, the Trump administration filed additional court papers saying it had another reason for wanting to deport Khalil.\n\nIt alleged that Khalil, a permanent US resident, had omitted information from his green-card application that would have otherwise disqualified him from gaining residency.\n\nThe Trump administration has long accused Khalil of supporting terrorism through his protest-related activities, something the former graduate student has vehemently denied.\n\nIn the case of his green-card application, it argues that Khalil failed to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), a humanitarian organisation. Politicians in Israel and the US have accused UNRWA of ties to the armed group Hamas, an allegation reportedly made without evidence.\n\nKhalil, however, has denied he was ever an “officer” in UNRWA, as alleged. Instead, his legal team points out that he completed a United Nations internship through Columbia University.\n\nThe Trump administration also argues that Khalil did not accurately identify the length of his employment with the Syria Office of the British Embassy in Beirut. Khalil and his legal team, meanwhile, say he accurately identified his departure date from the job as December 2022.\n\nJudge Farbiarz had set Friday morning as a deadline for the Trump administration to appeal Khalil’s release on bail. But that deadline was extended to give the government more time to challenge Khalil’s release.\n\nUltimately, Farbiarz allowed the Trump administration to continue its detention of Khalil. He advised Khalil’s lawyers to seek release on bail from the immigration court where his deportation trial is being held in Louisiana.\n\nFarbiarz had been weighing a separate habeas corpus petition from the Khalil team that called into question the constitutionality of his continued detention.\n\nMarc Van Der Hout, a lawyer for Khalil, told the Reuters news agency that immigration fraud charges are exceedingly rare, and the Trump administration’s use of such charges was simply a political manoeuvre to keep Khalil in lock-up.\n\n“Detaining someone on a charge like this is highly unusual and frankly outrageous,” said Van Der Hout. “There continues to be no constitutional basis for his detention.”\n\nAnother lawyer representing Khalil, Amy Greer, described the new allegations against his green-card application as part of the government’s “cruel, transparent delay tactics”. She noted that Khalil, a new father whose child was born in April, would miss his first Father’s Day, which falls this Sunday in the US.\n\n“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians,” Greer said in a statement.\n\n“It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful.”","summary":"The Trump administration has argued that Khalil, a Columbia University student, did not disclose past affiliations.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/13/judge-rules-mahmoud-khalil-can-remain-in-custody-amid-green-card-dispute?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-05-23T021638Z_31499324_RC2OKEABTOQS_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-COLUMBIA-KHALIL-1749855201.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 23:53:21","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.557},{"id":331217840,"title":"The normal presidency of Donald Trump","text":"The presidents and the events of their presidencies were entirely different. And yet, in mid-June of the first year of their second term, all were in almost precisely the same place in terms of job approval. \n\nWhat does it mean? For one thing, it means the efforts to portray Trump as a uniquely dangerous threat to American democracy — to denormalize him — aren’t working.\n\nLast year, the Left-wing journalist David Corn published a newsletter headlined “Trump Normalization Syndrome: A Threat to America.” The point was that Trump represented such a serious threat to democracy that normalizing him — that is, treating him as if he were any other politician — would lead to disastrous consequences. Trump’s “outrageous remarks have become less newsworthy,” Corn wrote. “Trump saying something hateful or inciteful is a dog-bites-man story. Sure, some Americans are enraged, but others either cheer him on or simply ignore it. Collectively, we’re experiencing Trump Normalization Syndrome.”\n\nThat was published in March 2024, when most Democrats still believed they would defeat Trump in November. Now, with Trump in the White House, a New York Times opinion columnist, Masha Gessen, recently said, “We’re entering the most dangerous phase of the Trump era: Normalization.”\n\nThe premise of such a critique is that Trump is doing outrageous things that Americans should never accept. The problem is that many Americans, in some cases, majorities of Americans, don’t think Trump’s actions are outrageous. They support what he is doing on immigration. They support what he is doing for the economy. They support what he is doing to cut federal spending on wokeism and Left-wing causes. That’s what is keeping Trump’s job approval numbers in the same place as Obama’s and Bush’s. \n\nAnother factor in this is that the Left’s protests appear to be having progressively less effect on public opinion. In a recent column, the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel went down a list of protests, from the current immigration activism to a long list of protests in Trump’s first term. “These actions accomplished none of their stated aims — they didn’t move the Trump White House to alter a single policy,” Strassel wrote, “though they did prove effective at shoring up Trump loyalty and inspiring Republicans to tune out criticism.”\n\nThis weekend, we’ll be seeing a new run-through of the ineffective protest cycle with so-called “No Kings” anti-Trump protests around the country. It seems highly unlikely they will have any cumulative effect at all.\n\nJust look at those comparative poll numbers. After all that has happened, Trump is in the same place that his two predecessors were at this time in their second terms. It’s almost… normal.","summary":"THE NORMAL PRESIDENCY OF DONALD TRUMP. There&#8217;s something interesting going on in President Donald Trump&#8217;s job approval rating.

The Marine troops with rifles, combat gear and walkie-talkies took over some posts from National Guard members who were deployed to the city after the protests erupted last week. Those protests sparked dozens more over several days around the country, with some leading to clashes with police and hundreds of arrests.

They finished training on civil disturbance and have started to replace Guard members protecting the federal building west of downtown, so the Guard soldiers can be assigned to protect law enforcement officers on raids, the commander in charge of 4,700 troops deployed to the LA protests said. The Marines moved into Los Angeles before Saturday's planned \"No Kings\" demonstrations nationally against Trump's policies, which will also happen the same day as a military parade in Washington, DC, when troops will march and tanks will rumble through the streets of the nation's capital.

The Marines' arrival also came a day after the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that had directed Trump to return control of Guard troops to California. The judge had ruled the Guard deployment was illegal, violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines the power between state and federal governments, and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The judge did not rule on the presence of the Marines. Military mission Some 2,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles this week. Hundreds have provided protection to immigration agents making arrests. Another 2,000 Guard members were notified of deployment earlier this week. None of the military troops will be detaining anyone, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, the commander of Task Force 51 who is overseeing the 4,700 combined troops, said. \"I would like to emphasise that the soldiers will not participate in law enforcement activities,” Sherman said. \"Rather, they will be focused on protecting federal law enforcement personnel.\" Roughly 500 National Guard members have been used to provide security on immigration raids after undergoing expanded instruction, legal training and rehearsals with the agents doing the enforcement before they go on those missions. By mid-afternoon on Friday, more than a dozen Marines were stationed outside the 17-story Wilshire Federal Building, replacing some members of the National Guard at various entrances. They mostly appeared to be checking tickets from members of the public who were there to renew their passports. The building is the same place Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla on Thursday was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about the immigration raids. There were no protesters around the building. Occasionally, a passing driver shouted from their window, registering a mix of anger and support for the military presence. Sherman said the US Marine Corps is responsible for guarding US embassies overseas so they are well-trained on how to defend a federal building. California vs. Trump California Governor Gavin Newsom has called the troop deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty\" and a power grab by Trump, and he has gone to court to stop it. The president has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilise federal service members when there is \"a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\". A federal judge said in a ruling late on Thursday that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion and issued an order to return control of the Guard to California before the appeals court stopped it from going into effect on Friday. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump thanked the appeals court on Friday morning. \"If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now,\" he said. The court will hold a hearing on the matter on Tuesday. Under federal law, active-duty forces are prohibited by law from conducting law enforcement. The Trump administration has characterised the city as a \"war zone\", which local authorities dispute. Recent protests have drawn a few hundred attendees who marched through downtown chanting, dancing and poking fun at the Trump administration's characterisation of the city. There have been about 500 arrests since Saturday, mostly for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to police. There have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injuries. An 8 pm curfew has been in place in a one-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometre) section of downtown. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometres). Protests have ended after a few hours with arrests this week largely for failure to disperse. No Kings \"No Kings\" demonstrations are planned in nearly 2,000 locations around the country, according to the movement's website.

Just over a quarter of California’s roughly 40 million residents were born elsewhere, but in many parts of the Bay Area, immigrants account for over a third of the population.\n\nSanta Clara County has the state’s highest proportion of immigrants, with 41% of residents born outside of the country. San Mateo, San Francisco and Alameda counties are next on the list, with between 34% and 36% immigrants. All four of those Bay Area counties have a higher rate of immigrants than Los Angeles County, where one-third of residents are immigrants.\n\nWhile immigration raids in Los Angeles have dominated the news, with President Donald Trump making good on campaign promises to increase immigration enforcement, the Bay Area’s population is also especially vulnerable to changes in immigration policies, including H1-B visa policies, and other changes to federal policy because of the large immigrant population.\n\nWhile the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey does not collect data on the legal status of non-citizens, a report from the Migration Policy Institute estimates that as of 2023, 73% of immigrants in the country were naturalized citizens, had permanent legal status, or were on temporary work visas. The remaining 27% of immigrants in the country are “unauthorized,” according to the report.\n\nIn Fremont and Sunnyvale, half of residents were born outside of the United States. Only one of California’s 100 largest cities has a higher percentage of immigrants: Glendale, a city in Los Angeles County adjacent to Griffith Park that is known for its large Armenian population.\n\nAround the Golden State, there are just over 24 million naturalized U.S. citizens, people who were born elsewhere but now have U.S. citizenship. And there are nearly 22 million people living in California who are not citizens, including those here temporarily, those with work authorization, those seeking asylum, and those without formal authorization.\n\nWe also know that the Bay Area gets a disproportionate number of the country’s H1-B visa beneficiaries, mostly highly skilled workers, especially in tech.\n\nIn part due to the region’s high number of immigrant tech workers, Santa Clara County has a higher proportion of both naturalized U.S. citizens and non-citizens compared to other counties in the region. And the number of non-citizens has grown by 15% since 2010, more than in any other Bay Area county.\n\nIn San Francisco, Solano, Marin, Sonoma and Napa counties, there are now fewer non-citizen residents than in 2010, while San Mateo, Contra Costa, Alameda and Santa Clara counties have more non-citizens than 13 years before.\n\nAround the country, there are now about 50 million immigrants, more than ever before. Proportionally, immigrants now make up nearly 15% of the nation’s residents, similar to the rate in the late 1800s. In the first part of the 20th century, the share of U.S. residents who were immigrants dropped to just over 5% by 1970, but that figure has been growing consistently since then.\n\nStatewide, Mexico is by far the most common country of birth among immigrants, but the share of immigrants from our neighbor to the south is shrinking. In 2010, there were 4.3 million people living in California who were born in Mexico. Now that total is 3.8 million.
