industry on 'anticompetitive' concerns","text":"The United States said Monday it is opening an investigation into China's policies for its semiconductor industry, over concerns that Beijing is turning to \"extensive anticompetitive and non-market means\" to undermine other economies.\n\nThe probe centers on foundational semiconductors — which go into everything from cars to medical devices — and whether China's actions create burdens for U.S. commerce, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office.\n\nThe fear is that Beijing's practices undermine \"the competitiveness of American industry and workers, critical U.S. supply chains, and U.S. economic security,\" the USTR's office added.\n\n\"We have seen time and again, a pattern of harmful impact from nonmarket policies and practices across industries that the PRC has targeted for worldwide market dominance,\" said USTR Katherine Tai, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nPrevious instances have included steel, aluminum, solar cells, electric vehicles and now, semiconductors, Tai told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"This is enabling its companies to rapidly expand capacity and to offer artificially lower-priced chips that threaten to significantly harm and potentially eliminate fair, market-oriented competition,\" Tai added.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that an analysis of the U.S. semiconductor supply chain found two-thirds of U.S. products contain Chinese-made foundational chips.\n\n\"About half of companies didn't know whether they had Chinese chips in their products,\" she said, adding that this included firms making defense systems, critical infrastructure and consumer electronics.\n\nIn recent years, President Joe Biden has sought to shore up U.S. chipmaking capabilities to reduce reliance on other countries.\n\nThe latest probe will initially focus on China's foundational semiconductors production, including the extent that these are used in other products like medical devices and vehicles.\n\nThe probe is also expected to consider whether Beijing's policies on inputs for semiconductor fabrication contribute to \"burden or restriction on U.S. commerce,\" the USTR's office said.\n\n\"This investigation is part of our broader strategy to strengthen the resilience of our supply chains and revitalize domestic manufacturing,\" said National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard.\n\nThe investigation falls under Section 301 of the Trade Act, the same tool used during President-elect Donald Trump's first administration to impose tariff hikes on Chinese products.\n\nOfficials will have a year to carry out the investigation and decide on responses.

They presented shamrocks to Genocide Joe Biden and waited for Israel to remove its own Irish embassy from Dublin. US planes still pass through Shannon and Aldergrove and arms flow straight from Britain.\n\nAt year's end, it couldn’t be clearer that Ireland and Britain’s subservience to the agenda of Israel’s greatest ally - the US - must be broken. In the New Year, the onus on us to hold their feet to the fire will only grow. Irish people are world renowned for our solidarity with Palestinians, and those in power must act accordingly.\n\nAnother international trend has been the dangerous growth of the far-right, who treat the progressive liberation movements of women and LGBTQ+ people, as well as increasing diversity, as a threat to their worldview. Donald Trump was returned to the White House, with victories in Italy, and beyond for his ilk. We cannot separate their success from the miserable conditions facing millions of people, which create fertile ground for their divisive tactics and scaremongering.\n\nThe abject failure of the establishment to provide for the basic needs of people at the expense of massive profits of the super-wealthy has allowed the far-right to scapegoat minorities for the entrenched poverty in working class communities. Of course, neither the far-right nor the centrist failures in government have any intention of improving our lives and so the fight for a better society remains in the hands of those who deserve it.\n\nAs we reflect on the year, I think progressive forces in Ireland should be proud of the local response which met far-right and racist agitators on the streets and rallied around those in their crosshairs. Fifteen thousand of us in Belfast, organised by United Against Racism and supported by hundreds of other groups, sent a clear message that we will not allow their divisive vitriol to go unchallenged.\n\nPride should also be felt by those activists who have exposed local ecological crises including the Save Lough Neagh campaign. The warmer months of 2024 saw another algal bloom which threatens the health of local people and ecosystems in the lake. Like Mubuoy, the Sperrins and more, the mistreatment of Lough Neagh, and the impact of private interests in particular, are a stain on the record of those charged with protecting our natural resources. The drive to accumulate and maximise profit no matter the cost is destroying our water and the planet in the process.\n\nAs the year draws to an end and the days grow colder, it’s difficult not to sum up by thinking of those who struggle to afford to keep their homes warm - and those without a home at all. Around 90,000 people are on the waiting list for a social home, including 58,000 who are homeless.\n\nI am working hard to introduce a People’s Housing Bill, which would keep more people in their homes and more money in their pockets. It is long past time for rent controls, a no-fault eviction ban, proper enforcement of housing fitness standards and taking empty homes into public ownership.\n\nOf course, this should be a job for the Stormont Executive but they have no such plans. We should remind ourselves that Stormont is only functioning this year because hundreds of thousands of public sector workers shamed the DUP back to work by striking for decent pay in January. Unsurprisingly, however, the re-establishment of Stormont has not delivered for those workers. Instead, we have heard endless talk of ‘revenue raising’ measures such as water and prescription charges, and the raising of tuition fees.\n\nIt’s tempting to think, all of the above considered, that the world has gone to hell in a handbasket in 2024. But we must remember that there are more than enough resources in our society to alleviate poverty, pay workers fairly, tackle homelessness and make our public services resilient and fit-for-purpose. There are vastly more people on this planet who support the freedom and liberation of oppressed people the world over than those who don’t. Our movements have incredible power when we stand and fight the roots of oppression together.\n\nLet me remind readers, as James Connolly once did, that ‘opportunities are for those who seize them, and that the coming year may be as bright as we choose to make it’. A brighter future is what People Before Profit and I will be fighting for in 2025, and I hope many of you will join that fight. Happy Christmas to all who celebrate, and here’s to a fighting New Year.\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our politics newsletter here.","url":"https://www.nation.lk/online/gerry-carroll-global-crisis-defined-2024-but-solidarity-offered-hope-289350.html","image":"https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article26137268.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Hospital-Sick-Children-03_JK.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 01:09:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":276102908,"title":"Korea unlikely to slap duties on Chinese EVs","text":"China escalates rhetoric against Korea’s potential move to impose tariffs on BYD\n\nBy Lee Min-hyung\n\nKorea is unlikely to impose countervailing duties on Chinese electric vehicles (EV) amid fears of possible trade retaliation from the world’s second-largest economy, experts and industry officials said Monday.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the positions of the United States and the European Union (EU), both of which are moving to raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Starting in September, the U.S. quadrupled its tariff on China-made EVs to 100 percent, while the EU decided to impose an increased tariff of up to 45.3 percent on EVs imported from China.\n\nKorea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy is also weighing the option of imposing similar duties on Chinese EVs, as BYD plans to start selling its vehicles in Korea in January 2025. The ministry stated that it has developed a detailed guideline outlining the legal foundation for potential sanctions on Chinese imported goods.\n\nHowever, Korea's saber-rattling is unlikely to materialize due to the trade-reliant structure of its economy, according to industry insiders.\n\n“Korea will not be able to play the card in the end, as the economy is still heavily reliant on China,” Lee Ho-geun, an automotive engineering professor at Daedeok University, said. “This means Korea remains highly vulnerable to any possible trade retaliation from China.”\n\nIn response, China is also intensifying its rhetoric against Korea’s potential sanctions on Chinese EV imports. State-controlled media in China argued that such regulations will ultimately harm the interests of Korean companies and citizens.\n\nThe professor also noted a slim chance of Korea imposing tariffs or regulatory pressure on BYD or other China-made EVs, citing the country’s current political circumstances.\n\n“The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea prefers to adopt a pro-China policy drive, so it will be tough for the government to push ahead with the move,” Lee said.\n\nData from the Korea International Trade Association shows that in 2023, Korea's export dependence on China reached 19.7 percent, making it the highest in the world. Meanwhile, Korea's dependence on the U.S. was recorded at 18.3 percent during the same period.\n\nIndustry officials said Korea cannot follow a similar path to that of the U.S. or the EU when it comes to China regulations, as the Korean economy has much more to lose under such a scenario.\n\n“Even if the move is a step in the right direction amid the global rise of protectionism in the wake of the second Donald Trump presidency, the Korean economy is vulnerable to external variables due to the trade reliance,” an automotive industry official said.\n\nAccording to the official, Hyundai Motor and Kia — two major Korean carmakers — would face significant risks from China's retaliation if the Korean government imposes punitive sanctions on Chinese EVs.\n\n“The two carmakers are moving to redirect their strategic focus on China by recently making mega-sized investments there, but their fate will be clouded once again if both countries engage in any unnecessary trade conflict,” the official said.","url":"https://www.nation.lk/online/korea-unlikely-to-slap-duties-on-chinese-evs-289341.html","image":"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/c6b19a0076dc402ea2fcbfb14b5a4fb4.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 01:09:24","author":"Lee Min","authors":["Lee Min"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":276102062,"title":"Katy Perry to Joker sequel: 17 flops and fails in culture in 2024","text":"Live tours and concerts were disrupted this year for all kinds of reasons. \n\nJennifer Lopez cancelled her lives shows after reports of poor ticket sales, although she said it was so she could spend time with family and friends.\n\nTenacious D’s tour fell apart after one member made some ill-advised comments about Donald Trump. \n\nAnd Madonna’s fans became increasingly frustrated with her lateness.\n\nElsewhere, Adele repeatedly swore at an audience member in Las Vegas who she thought had shouted “Pride sucks”.

Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group. If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China. To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern. Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer — and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices. \"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added. \"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.","summary":"Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-impact-on-toy-prices-retailers/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/25/3919cf6f-7aec-4c20-a849-537e9418a046/thumbnail/1200x630/d9125c15bfb5655ee624c1f9891bdf9a/gettyimages-1286755187.jpg?v=fa9977353833f46f40b07abcd9d5240b","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3427713_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-26 00:43:06","author":"Aimee Picchi,Kelly O'grady","authors":["Aimee Picchi","Kelly O'grady"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":276101130,"title":"Biden directs US to keep giving Ukraine weapons after Russian strikes","text":"Outgoing United States President Joe Biden has directed the country's Department of Defense to continue delivering weapons to Ukraine, on the same day Russia launched a Christmas missile attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in multiple cities.\n\nThe strikes targeted power stations in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and the south-eastern Dnipro region killed at least one person and injured six more as the country woke on Christmas Day.\n\nIn the aftermath of the missile strikes, half a million people in the Kharkiv region were left without heating in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital Kyiv and elsewhere.\n\nPresident Biden condemned the attack on Wednesday as \"outrageous\" and said the US will \"continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in its defence against Russian forces.\"\n\n\"The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people's access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardise the safety of its grid,\" Mr Biden said.\n\n\"Let me be clear: the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety.\n\n\"The United States and the international community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over Russia's aggression.\"\n\nThe president's commitment to further weapons deliveries to Ukraine come less than a month before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office on January 20.\n\nWashington has already committed $US175 billion ($280.4 billion) in aid for Ukraine.

Reviving his long-running joke about Canada becoming the 51st US state, Trump’s remarks combined flattery, satire, and a jab at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.“I just left Wayne Gretzky, ‘The Great One,’ as he is known in Ice Hockey circles,” Trump wrote. “I said, ‘Wayne, why don’t you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada – You would win easily, you wouldn’t even have to campaign.’”Trump revealed that Gretzky, 63, wasn’t interested in entering politics but called on Canadians to launch a \"DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,\" claiming it would be “so much fun to watch.” He took the opportunity to wish Trudeau a “Merry Christmas,” while mocking him as “Governor Trudeau” and criticizing Canada’s tax policies. “Taxes are far too high, but if Canada was to become our 51st State, their Taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World,” Trump asserted. Who is Wayne Gretzky?Wayne Gretzky, nicknamed “The Great One,” is a symbol of excellence in hockey and one of Canada’s most beloved sports figures. Born in Brantford, Ontario, in 1961, Gretzky began showing extraordinary talent as a young player, often competing against older children and dominating games with his strategic brilliance.Over his 20-year NHL career, Gretzky shattered records and won hearts, becoming the all-time leader in goals (894), assists (1,963), and total points (2,857). His achievements include four Stanley Cup championships with the Edmonton Oilers, nine Hart Trophies as league MVP, and 10 scoring titles. His legendary career culminated in a first-ballot Hall of Fame induction in 1999, with the league retiring his iconic jersey number 99 across all teams.Gretzky's non-political legacyThough celebrated for his on-ice prowess, Gretzky has remained largely apolitical throughout his life. After retiring, he transitioned into roles as a coach, ambassador for hockey, and entrepreneur. Despite occasional public appearances with political figures, Gretzky has been careful not to wade into partisan debates—a stark contrast to Trump’s brash and divisive style.This makes Trump’s suggestion all the more curious. While many fans relished the humor of imagining “The Great One” as a political leader, others were quick to criticize his association with Trump. A photograph of Gretzky at Mar-a-Lago wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" cap has only fueled the backlash.Gretzky fans dividedWhile some Canadians saw humor in Trump’s comments, Gretzky’s association with the president-elect sparked outrage among others. Social media users expressed disappointment after Gretzky was photographed at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" cap.— theRealRobbyLee (@theRealRobbyLee) “Gretzky was my idol growing up, so this stings. A lot,” wrote one user on X. Another lamented, “You were the role model for decency and family… I will no longer think of you as one of the greats on and off the ice.”— FernOnX (@FernOnX) — gregory_sk81914 (@gregory_sk81914) — Citizen54S (@Citizen54S) Trump’s “51st State” joke and Trudeau criticismTrump’s suggestion also reignited his trolling of Canada as the “51st state” and Trudeau as its “governor.” In his post, Trump had jabbed Trudeau’s leadership and claimed that annexing Canada would resolve many of the nation’s challenges, including its tax policies and economic struggles.“Thanks for dinner last night, President Trump. I look forward to the work we can do together, again,” Trudeau later posted on X, referencing a recent meeting at Mar-a-Lago where the two leaders discussed trade and the fentanyl crisis. Trump claimed Trudeau had made “a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation.”— JustinTrudeau (@JustinTrudeau) Amid growing domestic challenges, including Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s resignation, Trudeau has faced calls to step down. Trump seized the opportunity to criticize Freeland, calling her departure a win for Canada. “Her behavior was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!” Trump wrote.Gretzky’s potential as a leaderAlthough Gretzky has never entertained the idea of entering politics, his leadership qualities and universal admiration make him an intriguing hypothetical candidate. Known for his humility, sportsmanship, and work ethic, Gretzky embodies traits Canadians often seek in public figures.“He’s not just a hockey legend; he’s a cultural icon who brought Canadians together,” said David O’Brien, a Canadian sports historian. “If he ever decided to run for office, he’d likely have widespread appeal.”Still, Gretzky’s reluctance to engage in politics remains evident. Responding to Trump’s post, a source close to Gretzky stated, “Wayne is deeply honored by the respect, but he’s a hockey guy, not a politician.”","summary":"US President-elect Donald Trump humorously suggested Wayne Gretzky run for Canadian Prime Minister, dubbing him \"Governor of Canada.\" Despite Gretzky's refusal and a backlash over his association with Trump, the tongue-in-cheek proposal reignited Trump's mockery of Canada and criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's policies.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-wayne-gretzky-trump-touts-ex-hockey-star-as-canadas-next-pm-trolls-trudeau-in-christmas-message/articleshow/116666058.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116666120/116666120.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 00:35:59","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.418},{"id":276102200,"title":"The impact of tariffs on the U.S. toy industry","text":"The impact of tariffs on the U.S. toy industry\n If President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his threat of imposing new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, it could have major repercussions for the U.S. toy industry.

Business leaders everywhere agree that the Republican crackdown on immigrant workers, along with high tariffs on imports, will raise consumer prices significantly and spike inflation.\n\nI understand their point. That is why this Republican voted for Democrats up and down the ballot in November. Donald Trump promised to deport 11 million immigrants, slap heavy tariffs (taxes) on consumer goods and become dictator on his first day in office. Why did so many of these moguls support Trump, against America’s interests, and wait until now to make their case?\n\nPlease ask the corporate elite to explain why so few of them had the integrity to defend migrant workers and explain tariffs’ impact on inflation — before the election.

In a message delivered on Christmas Day, Trump took aim at the Panama Canal and Greenland, while also addressing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau directly.\n\n “Merry Christmas to all, including to the wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal,” the president-elect began in a Truth Social post, before claiming “38,000 people” died during the waterway’s construction. (BBC previously fact checked that the number was closer to 300.) He continued, writing: “United States puts in Billions of Dollars in ‘repair’ money, but will have absolutely nothing to say about ‘anything.’”\n\n Trump then mocked Trudeau, referring to him as the “Governor” of Canada, and once again floated the idea of the country becoming the “51st State,” while promising its “Taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World.”\n\n The president-elect also reiterated his previous intention to bring Greenland under American control, writing that the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, “is needed by the United States for National Security purposes and, who want the U.S. to be there, and we will!”\n\n Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede made clear on Monday that the territory was not for sale. “Greenland is ours,” the prime minister said in a statement. “We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our years-long struggle for freedom.”\n\n However, the Danish prime minister’s office issued a separate statement saying that the government is “looking forward to welcoming the new American ambassador. And the Government is looking forward to working with the new administration.” \n\n On Monday, the Danish government later announced a huge boost in defense spending for Greenland, per the BBC.\n\n Trump also took the opportunity to deliver another holiday message on Wednesday, urging Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky to run for prime minister of Canada. “I just left Wayne Gretzky, ‘The Great One’ as he is known in Ice Hockey circles,” Trump wrote in another Truth Social post. “I said, ‘Wayne, why don’t you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada – You would win easily, you wouldn’t even have to campaign.'”","summary":"The president-elect referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the \"Governor\" of Canada","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-canada-panama-canal-greenland-1235217402/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/donald-trump-justin-trudeau.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 00:29:09","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":276099118,"title":"Russia Launches 'Inhuman' Christmas Day Attacks, Ukraine Says","text":"TEMPO.CO, Kyiv - Russia attacked Ukraine's energy system and some cities with cruise and ballistic missiles plus drones on Wednesday in an \"inhuman\" Christmas Day assault, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.Nearly three years into the war, the strikes wounded at least six people in the northeastern city of Kharkiv and killed one in the region of Dnipropetrovsk, the governors there said.U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the \"outrageous\" attack and said he had asked the U.S. Defense Department to push forward with a new surge of military aid to Kyiv. Half a million people in Kharkiv region were left without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital Kyiv and elsewhere.\"Today, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack.

For example, Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his need for God’s forgiveness alienated many Christians, a key part of his political base. As someone who attended an evangelical institution deeply tied to Trump’s support during his election, I saw firsthand how such statements created unease within that community. Additionally, his premature departure from the hospital during his COVID-19 treatment – an effort to project strength – ultimately backfired, costing him both sympathy and credibility. Such actions demonstrated a disconnect between his leadership image and the emotional expectations of his followers. People need to see their leaders’ humanity, as it reassures them that their struggles and emotions are understood and shared.\n\nPresident Tinubu’s reliance on spokespersons to deliver “soft” messages after tragedies creates a sense of detachment. Nigerians need to see their president’s heart. A tear, a heartfelt speech, or an open show of grief could go a long way to heal the nation’s wounds. Leaders who don’t show they care risk appearing indifferent, which can deepen anger and disillusionment.\n\nThat said, this is not a time for blame. Even with a free press, lashing out at Tinubu won’t help Nigeria heal. This tragedy demands collective mourning and a shared understanding of the loss and pain. Divisive criticism will only widen the gaps that need bridging.\n\nBeyond emotional leadership, practical solutions are essential. Take Nigeria’s fuel pricing issue: why should Nigerians pay international rates for fuel when they live in an oil-producing country? I’ve argued before that Dangote Refinery should sell fuel domestically at its production cost, not the global benchmark. Policies like this prioritize people over profits, demonstrating that leaders view citizens as individuals, not just statistics.\n\nResearch underscores the importance of combining macroeconomic strategies with microeconomic realities. Articles like “Microeconomic Foundations of Macroeconomic Policy” highlight how integrating small-scale insights can improve large-scale plans. Leaders who focus solely on broad numbers often miss the lived struggles of real families. For example, “Microeconomic Behavior and Macroeconomic Outcomes” explains that effective policies must address daily challenges. By blending these perspectives, governments can create solutions that are fair and meaningful.\n\nHistory also teaches us that the greatest leaders – from Abraham Lincoln to Nelson Mandela – embraced vulnerability. Lincoln’s emotional speeches during the Civil War and Mandela’s tireless reconciliation efforts after apartheid united their people. They understood that true strength comes from compassion and connection.\n\nPresident Tinubu has a rare and pivotal opportunity to lead Nigeria through this moment of sorrow and despair. By demonstrating genuine care for the Nigerian people, he can rebuild trust and foster unity in a time of deep division. True leadership lies in vulnerability, which shows authenticity and strength. When a leader connects with the emotions of their people, it creates solidarity and a shared sense of purpose. This is Tinubu’s chance to demonstrate that genuine empathy and humanity are far more powerful than political posturing.","url":"https://www.newsexpressngr.com/news/247156/rachel-weeping-for-her-children-finding-hope-for-nigeria-this-christmas","image":"https://support.newsexpressngr.com/images/2024/12/1735151486.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 00:23:24","author":"Just Web Services","authors":["Just Web Services"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.165},{"id":276100768,"title":"Colin Sheridan's year in review: Highs, lows, medal glory in Paris, and the takedown of Conor McGregor","text":"“Better be right than first” is a reporting principle that seems long forgotten amidst the cacophony of chaos that is social media, where the instantaneous sharing of (often incorrect) information on a growing number of platforms has only amplified the need for a responsible and ethical legacy news media. \n\nThe failures on that front have been far more egregious. Obedience to paymasters, sensationalism over facts, client journalism — each one has played its part in ethics-washing a genocide in Gaza, mis-calling a presidential election in the United States and failing to hold power the world over to account. \n\nIn a year where more people worldwide voted in elections (approximately four billion) than ever before, this promised to be a year of seismic change. Sadly, little of the change we saw was good.\n\nIncumbents dominated the political landscape (with one heavily fake tanned exception), and within that stasis comes a rude awakening: most people agree the world is a broken place, just not broken enough to fix.\n\nWith the Russia/Ukraine conflict still adversely affecting the cost of living worldwide and the Middle East crumbling under the weight of Benjamin Netanyahu's despotic genocidal intent, legitimate issues such as climate change, immigration and xenophobia became veritable third rails for politicians and electorates alike.\n\n Back to those predictions. Sometimes it’s good to be wrong. It’s with some relief this writer can reflect that Kosovo was not annexed by Serbia.

Hereunder, prepare to be reminded, whether you want it or not.\n\n The year began with a little-known story of a country called the Republic of Artsakh — a breakaway state in the South Caucasus — officially ceasing to exist, in accordance with a decree signed by former president Samvel Shahramanyan. \n\nWhile Israel continued its siege of Khan Younis, Claudine Gay resigned as president of Harvard University following controversial remarks she made during a congressional hearing on antisemitism as a crackdown on students protesting genocide saw hundreds of arrests on American college campuses. \n\nThe first attempted political assassination of 2024 happened when South Korean opposition politician Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck in Gadeokdo, Busan. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree granting Russian citizenship to foreigners who fight for Russia in their war against Ukraine, and for their families, a move indicative of flagging morale as the invasion entered its 23rd month. \n\nIn another blow for legacy media, American sports publication Sports Illustrated laid off the majority of its staff after its publishing license was revoked. \n\nThe US and UK launched fresh airstrikes on what they claimed was Houthi military infrastructure in Yemen, in a very direct involvement in the Red Seas crisis, an offshoot of Israel's multiple military campaigns across the Middle East. Bloody civil wars continued across Congo, Sudan and Myanmar, killing hundreds.\n\n Back home, homelessness figures showed a slight dip in numbers in recording 13,318 people, including more than 3,900 children, accessing homelessness services in December and over Christmas. The dip was not expected to be sustained and decisively wasn’t.\n\n In a welcome distraction to all the war, death, and famine, Cork’s Cillian Murphy was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the guy responsible for developing the atomic bomb. How apt.\n\nWith spring, green shoots of hope. In an historic breakthrough Michelle O'Neill became the First Minister of Northern Ireland, marking the first time that the position is held by an Irish nationalist, while the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly became deputy first minister. Several previous attempts to restart the devolved government had failed since the 2022 assembly elections.\n\n In Washington, the US Court of Appeals ruled that former president Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity and can be prosecuted for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Like almost everything else that fell out of Trump's first presidency, this ruling will receive huge coverage but achieve nothing by way of forcing accountability.\n\n The US intensified airstrikes on Iran and Syria, with the UK joining them on further raids in Yemen. In a twist straight out of Stranger Things, a high-altitude balloon is detected over the Western US, prompting the deployment of fighter jets to intercept the object, whose origin remains unknown.\n\n In the largest drugs haul in the history of the Irish state, gardaí seized 546 kg of crystal meth worth a whopping €32.8 million at Cork harbour. The haul, reportedly destined for Australia, was believed to belong to the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel.\n\n In Gaza, the siege of Khan Younis continues.\n\nWith Russia’s offensive in Ukraine causing existential anxiety across northern and eastern Europe, Sweden officially joins NATO, becoming the alliance's 32nd member. \n\nIn Moscow, Vladimir Putin was unsurprisingly re-elected for a fifth term, his coronation overshadowed by the brutal murder of at least 145 people by ISIS-affiliated gunmen in the Russian city of Krasnogorsk. \n\nAmid spiralling tensions in Islamabad, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for a second term while his political rival and sporting idol Imran Khan continued his campaign of opposition from his prison cell.\n\n In a move that caught everybody (including cabinet colleagues) by surprise, Leo Varadkar announced his resignation as taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael, citing political and personal reasons. \n\nWith his party floundering in the polls, the 45-year-old said that another leader — and therefore another Taoiseach — would be “better placed” to tackle the next Irish general election. His resignation followed a failed attempt by his coalition government to modernise references to family and women in the Irish 87-year-old Constitution in one of the most poorly run referendums in the country’s history.\n\n As another month of slaughter ends in Gaza, the United Nations Security Council passes a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, as well as demanding the unconditional release of all hostages.\n\n On a visit to Galway, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese tells the Irish Examiner about Ireland's inaction regarding the ongoing genocide in Gaza. “There’s this tendency to be very supportive with rhetoric, as Ireland has, but when it comes to taking concrete actions, there is zero. Not a little. Zero. \n\n\"The countries that have been most outspoken — like Ireland — what have they done in practice? Nothing. And this is shameful. It is disgraceful.” \n\nCillian Murphy confirms his status as Cork's third most beloved son (after Roy Keane and Jimmy Barry Murphy) when he collects the Best Actor Oscar for Oppenheimer. In an unprecedented reaction consistent with the esteem in which he's universally held, absolutely nobody begrudged him.\n\nOn the very first day of April, Israel targeted the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people. No significant response is forthcoming from either Bashir Al Asad or the IRGC in Tehran. \n\nSimon Harris succeeds Leo Varadkar as taoiseach, becoming Ireland's youngest ever leader. In one of his first acts as premier, Harris delivers a formal state apology to the victims of the Stardust fire and their families following the verdict of unlawful killing which was delivered by the tragedy’s long-running inquest.\n\n Floods in Brazil, Kenya and Tanzania claim hundreds of lives and displace hundreds of thousands.\n\nMay began with President Joe Biden insisting that any Israeli invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza would be a (new) ‘red line.’ The thinking on red lines heretofore was that to cross them was a crime punishable by some sort of action, in Biden’s case, the turning off of the money tap which had flowed so freely from Washington to Tel Aviv under his administration. \n\nDays after issuing the warning, Israel not just invaded Rafah, but decimated the tent city that had become home to hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Palestinians, killings hundreds in the onslaught. \n\nThe Rafah crossing — a lifeline for humanitarian aid and evacuation of saveable casualties — was disastrously closed following its capture by Israeli military forces. The Rafah offensive remains by far the most graphic and brutal assault of Israel's campaign in Gaza. Any trust in Biden’s red-line rhetoric was incinerated with hundreds of Palestinians.\n\nIn Dublin, an art installation connecting the Irish capital and New York called The Portal is opened and promptly shut, following inappropriate behaviour by some late-night revellers. It re-opens a week later, but tellingly, only during daylight hours.\n\n Following arrest warrants for alleged war crimes issued by the ICC for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and members of Hamas's leadership, the UN's highest court - the ICJ - rules that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah. Israel ignores the ruling.\n\n The Irish governments join Norway and Spain in officially recognising the State of Palestine. While the move is broadly welcomed, it is criticised by both the Israeli ambassador and by commentators who view the announcement as gesture politics, far too little far too late.\n\n In New York, former President Donald Trump is found guilty on 34 counts in a hush money trial. His indictment makes history, as it is the first time a US president is found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe Indian general election, which began in mid-April, concludes with a victory and third consecutive term for Shri Modi, further solidifying his leadership despite his BJP party losing their outright majority. Europeans, too, go to the polls in EU and local elections, with far-right candidates making significant gains across the continent.\n\n As hundreds of thousands of Irish people cement their summer plans, Aer Lingus confirms it is to cancel up to 20% of its flights in late June in response to industrial action by pilots.\n\n Following a suspended sentence received by serving soldier Cathal Crotty for the vicious, unprovoked assault of Limerick woman Natasha O'Brien, Taoiseach Simon Harris condemns the attack as part of “an epidemic of gender-based violence.” \n\nThe Defence Forces come under scrutiny for the number of active service members who have criminal convictions.\n\n With the Republic of Ireland — perhaps judiciously — absent, Euro 24 kicks off in Germany, with England hotly tipped to win their first international trophy since 1966.\n\n Wikileaks founder Julian Assange finally leaves the UK for his native Australia after being released from prison following a plea deal with the United States. His release concludes a 14-year saga that will undoubtedly be made into an Oscar-winning movie directed by Christopher Nolan and starring the inevitable Cillian Murphy.\n\nHigh summer in Dublin was pockmarked by a series of anti-immigrant protests in Coolock with Garda cars set ablaze, petrol bombs thrown and dozens arrested. These incidents were indicative of growing far-right sentiment in Ireland, much of it fuelled on social media by misinformation and influence of external actors in the UK and Europe. In England, far-right riots break out following a mass stabbing in Southport.\n\n Bookending one of the most shambolic periods in British political history, Keir Starmer leads the Labour Party to a landslide victory in the general election there, returning the party to government for the first time in 14 years. In France, meanwhile, the left-wing New Popular Front party causes an upset and wins the most seats in the National Assembly, but fails to achieve a majority.\n\nOn July 13, presumptive nominee of the Republican party Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt while speaking at an open-air campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot and wounded in his upper right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who fired eight rounds from an AR-15–style rifle from the roof of a nearby building. It proves to be a turning point in Trump's campaign, his raised fist of defiance becoming a totem for his resurgence.\n\n Armagh footballers bridge a 22-year gap by beating Galway to claim Sam Maguire, managed by Kieran McGeeney, the same man who led them as captain in 2002. With Limerick's hurlers out of the picture, neighbours Clare recapture Liam McCarthy with a dazzling extra-time win over Cork.\n\n On the most Irish of wet evenings on the River Seine in Paris, Golfer Shane Lowry and athlete Sarah Lavin carried the tricolour for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Paris. Almost 3,000 athletes from 206 countries participate in the three-week sporting bonanza one hundred years on from Jack B Yeat's winning Ireland's first Olympic medal (in art, of all things) in the same city for painting 'The Liffey Swim.’ \n\nIn an historic week for Irish sport, Ireland secured medals of varying colours on seven consecutive days, with Mona McSharry (bronze), Daniel Wiffen (gold and bronze), Kellie Harrington (gold), rowers Daire Lynch and Philip Doyle (bronze), all followed by another gold for the imperious Fintan McCarthy and Paul O'Donovan. \n\nAn epic week was capped off by Rhys McClenaghan's gold in gymnastics. While the track saw heartache for Rashidat Adeleke and her fellow 4 x 400m sprinters, this was an Olympic Games beyond the wildest dreams of athletes and fans.\n\n In Galway, an Irish Army chaplain was seriously injured after being stabbed a number of times outside Renmore military Barracks. A terror motive was investigated and a 16-year-old boy was arrested and charged.\n\nIn the largest prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia since the Cold War, 26 prisoners are released. Among them are Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich and ex-US Marine and Irish citizen Paul Whelan.\n\nIn Barsalogho, Burkina Faso, 600 civilians are victims of a massacre by Islamists associated with Al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, in an escalation of its military campaigns across the Middle East, Israel began a series of pre-emptive strikes against targets in the south of Lebanon, drawing Hezbollah into retaliatory rocket fire.\n\n With the Dáil still in summer recess, figures for homeless people living in emergency accommodation reached another record high, with 10,028 adults and 4,401 children living in emergency accommodation in July — the seventh consecutive month which broke homelessness records.\n\n September \n\nA government-appointed inquiry revealed that over 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse had been made in 308 primary and secondary schools run by religious orders across Ireland, spanning a 30-year period. Minister for Education Norma Foley said the level of abuse was \"truly shocking\" and a commission of investigation would be established.\n\n In one of the most bizarre legal cases involving the State, the European Union Court of Justice ruled that Apple must pay €13 billion to the government of Ireland as compensation for extraordinarily low taxes levied by Ireland against the tech giant. The government reluctantly takes the money, and is even slower to discuss how it is going to be spent.\n\nTorrential rainfall in Central Europe triggers the worst flooding in over a decade, with the south of Spain experiencing the worst of the deluge.\n\n International news is dominated by Israel bringing its bloody war to Lebanon. Over the course of two days, 32 people are killed and more than 3,200 are injured after pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah militants, medics and party members explode in two massive cyberattacks. The attacks rock Lebanon, but are only the beginning of what would become a two-month bombardment of the country, and its capital Beirut. \n\n September \n\n23rd marks the deadliest day in Lebanon since the 2006 war, with 569 people killed and 1,835 wounded by Israeli airstrikes. Things would get much worse. \n\nFour days later, hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly in New York, the Israeli Air Force bombs the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, killing dozens, including Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah October \n\nThe month begins with Israel conducting a ground invasion into South Lebanon. \n\nIrish peacekeepers close to the Blue Line are thrust into the spotlight as IDF infantry commandos take up positions close to where the Irish troops are deployed. Israel demanded the peacekeepers retreat for their own safety. In a stand-off lasting several days, the Defence Forces receiver worldwide commendation for their resolve eventually resulting in an Israeli withdrawal from the area. \n\nThe bombardment of Beirut and the south of the country continues, with hundreds of fatalities reported daily.\n\n Back home, joint money ministers Jack Chambers and Paschal Donohoe unveil Budget 2025 when bonus social welfare payments, energy credits, a higher minimum wage and tax changes are announced.\n\n With an election in the offing, Sinn Féin become embroiled in a scandal the undermines the leadership of Mary Lou McDonald, as Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile is suspended for sending inappropriate messages to a teenage boy and an adult in September 2023. McDonald draws fire for incorrectly stating the minor in question was 17 at the time of the exchange, not 16 which he actually was.\n\n In Gaza, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is killed in a gunfight with Israeli forces in Rafah.\n\n In another metaphor for a muddled year, an internet rumour that a Hallowe'en parade would take place on O'Connell Street in Dublin attracted hundreds of people into the city. The hoax led to brief public transport disruption and gardaí asked the crowd to disperse.\n\n As the month draws to a close, Spain experiences its worst flooding in half a century, with over 200 killed and hundreds more missing, as a year's worth of rain falls in eight hours.\n\nIn Dublin, a civil sexual assault case taken by Nikita Hand against fighter Conor McGregor commences in the High Court. The rape was alleged to have taken place in December 2018. The case would see McGregor take the stand and attempt to discredit Hand. A jury would go on to find the mixed martial arts fighter did in fact assaulted Ms Hand in a Dublin hotel. \n\nMcGregor was ordered to pay her more than €248,000.\n\nThe US presidential election sees Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance coast to victory, securing a second term for Trump, becoming only the second president to secure a non-consecutive stint in the White House. The election is a disaster to Democrat nominee Kamala Harris who is criticised for alienating the Arab vote by refusing to engage with Palestinian voices, not to mention her involvement in the Biden presidency so directly involved in the Israeli led genocide in Gaza.\n\n Taoiseach Simon Harris publicly says the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be arrested if he set foot in Ireland. This followed the issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\n As November draws to a close, the General Election see the lowest voter turnout in the history of the state, with only 59.7% exercising their right to vote. Fianna Fáil emerges as the largest party with 48 Dáil seats, followed by Sinn Féin with 39 and Fine Gael with 38. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is the most high-profile incumbent to lose his seat.\n\n In Syria, opposition forces seize control of most of Aleppo, prompting the first Russian airstrikes on the city since 2016.\n\nMichel Barnier makes some unwelcome history as he becomes the first prime minister of France to lose a motion of no-confidence since Georges Pompidou in 1962 bringing an end to the shortest premiership in French history.\n\n After a week of remarkable rebel gains around the country, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad flees Damascus for Moscow after being overthrown, ending his presidency and the Ba'athist Syria regime after a total of 61 years. The Syrian opposition forms the Syrian Transitional Government as a provisional government as Syrians rejoice the world over. Tens of thousands pour across the Lebanese border, many returning home for the first time in over a decade.\n\n FIFA announces that Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will jointly host the 2030 World Cup, while Saudi Arabia is confirmed as the host for 2034, despite NGOs reporting recently that over 21,000 Indian, Bangladeshi, and Nepalese workers have died in Saudi Arabia working on Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salam’s Saudi Vision 2030, while 100,000 migrant workers have “disappeared.” \n\nOver 20,000 indigenous have been forcibly removed. There is no mention of this during FIFA's announcement. \n\nStorm Darragh brings havoc to the northwest of Ireland with gusts of up to 141 km/h ensuring weather warnings of various colours and a busy few days for the ESB as hundreds are left without electricity.\n\n In a month of geo-political entropy, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's powers and duties are suspended after MPs vote to impeach him, following his disastrous martial law declaration in early December.\n\n With no government due to be formed before Christmas, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris hold \"constructive\" talks aimed at forming the next coalition.\n\n Finally, Israel announces that it will close its embassy in Ireland because of what was described as \"the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government\". The taoiseach says the decision is \"deeply regrettable\" while the Tánaiste says Ireland does not intend to respond in kind. President Michael D Higgins comments that it is a “gross defamation” and “deep slander” for the Israeli government to describe the Irish people as anti-Semitic.\n\n “I think it is very important as President of Ireland to say that [for Israel to say] the Irish people are anti-Semitic is a deep slander,” he says.","summary":"To say it was a year unlike any other is an understatement.

Yet, paradoxically, democracy is in retreat. We MUST reverse this terrifying trend","text":"Twenty twenty-four was the year of elections. More than 50 countries, representing a majority of the world’s population, went to the polls.\n\nFrom Mexico to Mozambique, Moldova to Madagascar, Mauritius to Mongolia, an unprecedented 1.5 billion people marked bits of paper, pulled levers or otherwise registered their preferences.\n\nIt sounds uplifting. But the truth is, many of those elections were decorative, designed to dignify dictators and dishearten dissidents.\n\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin, for example, was re-elected with a deliberately implausible 88 per cent of the vote, the sheer vastness of the number being a way to flaunt his power.\n\nIn Belarus each seat was won by a supporter of Alexander Lukashenko’s autocratic rule. In Syria, the Ba’ath party triumphed – as it has done in every election since 1963 – helped by the fact no independent parties are allowed.\n\nOther elections were flagrantly stolen. Pakistan’s military-backed regime announced plans to bar Imran Khan’s party. And the authorities had to resort to ballot-stuffing to prevent pro-Khan independents from sweeping the board.\n\nVenezuela’s ballot-rigging was so flagrant that the state initially reported a turnout of more than 100 per cent of eligible voters.\n\nIt is a paradox. More countries than ever are going through the motions, with manifestos, candidates, polling stations and returning officers. Yet actual democracy, in the sense of people being able to change their rulers through the ballot box, is in retreat.\n\nFor those of us who grew up in the late 20th century, this is something of a shock. We had become used to representative government and the rule of law becoming more common.\n\nThe process was fitful, but the trend was clear. For nearly seven decades after 1945, more countries became free than the reverse. Sometimes the dictators would fall singly; sometimes, as at the 1990 dissolution of the Soviet bloc, in a rush. And naturally there were some reversals.\n\nBut the direction of travel was clear. Personal freedom and the rule of law were becoming more widespread.\n\nNot any more. Numerous think-tanks and institutes monitor the state of global democracy and, although they all use slightly different measures, they all find the same thing.\n\nAt some point about 15 years ago, the move towards liberty stalled and began to go into reverse. They all also find that things have got worse since the pandemic.\n\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) records that, last year, 46 per cent of countries saw a decline in the rule of law and democratic norms, while 24 per cent have seen an increase.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit states: ‘Less than 8 per cent of the world’s population live in a full democracy, while almost 40 per cent live under authoritarian rule – a share that has been creeping up in recent years.’\n\nFreedom House agrees. ‘Political rights and civil liberties were diminished in 52 countries, while only 21 countries made improvements.’\n\nEven among established democracies, we see voters becoming impatient, irritated and intolerant. Candidates who are honest about the challenges their countries face are trounced by those who pretend everything can be solved by squeezing more money out of the top one per cent, or banks, or energy companies, or foreign firms through tariffs.\n\nAcross the democratic world, governing parties are being turfed out. Each election is different, of course, but the common theme is an unwillingness to accept there is less money than before, especially after lockdown.\n\nTwo democratic leaders were sly enough to hold elections at the height of the pandemic, when restrictions were still popular. Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand and Justin Trudeau in Canada were duly re-elected.\n\nBut when the bills came in, the mood changed, and incumbents were sent packing. Ardern stood aside to avoid a hammering in 2023, and Trudeau looks to be in his last painful weeks.\n\nIncumbents have likewise been clobbered across Europe, from Portugal to Lithuania. France has turned to extreme parties of Left and Right and, in Germany, the single most popular candidate for Chancellor is from the Putinite AfD.\n\nIn this sense, the British and US elections were remarkably unremarkable. Their governments were blamed, as all incumbents were, for the price and tax rises brought by lockdowns their voters had demanded.\n\nIn another sense, though, both were extraordinary. We are all wise after the event, subject to what psychologists call ‘hindsight bias’. But the fact that the United States chose to elect a convicted felon who had refused to accept his previous election defeat is both stunning and revealing.\n\nDonald Trump’s victory is a measure of how ready voters are to clobber the political class with any weapon. Ask Republicans in 2015 whether it would be fine to pay off a porn star and then lie about it provided there was no violation of campaign finance reform, and they’d stare at you incredulously. Now, they take it for granted.\n\nIn Britain, the two main parties got their lowest combined share of the vote in a century. The Conservatives – the oldest party in the world by far if we treat them as heirs to the Tory Party of the 17th and 18th centuries – secured their single lowest percentage of the vote in a General Election in three and a half centuries.\n\nWhat is causing this disruption? What was it, from the start of the 2010s, that undermined so many of the old political certainties – and the parties that upheld them?\n\nWas it the global financial crisis, which delegitimised the entire system in many people’s eyes? Was it mass immigration, which wrecked the sense of shared identity that allows strangers to trust one another?\n\nOr was it the spread of social media and of smartphones, which have left us bored, gullible and angry?\n\nThis third option certainly fits the timeline. When the average time spent on a TikTok video is seven seconds, politicians who come clean about trade-offs are at a massive disadvantage.\n\nIt used to be possible to explain that, for example, rent controls would reduce supply and thus push up rents; or that a lower tax rate might encourage more economic activity and so boost revenue; or that protectionism reduces the funds consumers have to spend, and so harms the entire economy.\n\nBut, in our impatient, screen-addled age, few want to listen.\n\nAre we doomed, then, to turn our backs on the property-based, liberal and democratic order that raised the human race to unprecedented levels of wealth and happiness?\n\nNot necessarily. Argentina’s chainsaw-wielding president, Javier Milei, has so far retained public support while decentralising powers.\n\nIn Canada, Pierre Poilievre seems set to be the first Conservative prime minister since Stephen Harper, campaigning straightforwardly on sound money, low taxes and deregulation.\n\nAnd, to her credit, Kemi Badenoch chose him as the first foreign party leader to meet following her own election. That bodes well – if voters are still listening.\n\nAre they? We shall find out in 2025.\n\nLord Hannan is President of the Institute for Free Trade.","summary":"More countries than ever are going through the motions, with manifestos, candidates, polling stations and returning officers.

However, in the long run, a stronger rupee is more beneficial to trade balance. Trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods and services.The report, published in RBI's Nov bulletin, carries data on the real effective exchange rate (REER), which points to an overvaluation of the rupee in relative terms in Nov as other currencies depreciated at a higher rate against the dollar. REER is an index that measures the country's currency against a basket of other currencies.116665310 According to data published by RBI, the 40-country trade-weighted REER index rose from 90.9 to 91.8 in one month while the six-currency basket rose from 104.4 to 105.3. The six countries in the smaller basket are the US, China, Eurozone, Hong Kong, the UK and Japan.Following Donald Trump's win in the US presidential election in early Nov, the dollar has gained against all major currencies including the rupee. However, the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has been less than that of other currencies resulting in an appreciation of the REER.The researchers note that rising productivity in the tradable goods sector in India has played a role in the continued appreciation of the REER. The report suggests that policymakers need to be mindful of the asymmetric and time-varying impact of REER changes on the trade balance.The REER is also important from a financial stability perspective. In the past, IMF had noted the importance of monitoring REER fluctuations as part of broader financial stability assessments as historical data shows that significant deviations in the index can precede financial crisis.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-sees-relative-gain-as-other-currencies-fall-more-vs-rbi/articleshow/116665295.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116665360/116665360.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 00:06:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.223},{"id":276100838,"title":"Letters: Corporations don’t have a monopoly on corruption","text":"Let’s leave property\nmanagement to pros\n\nRe: “Homeless providers under scrutiny” (Page B1, Dec. 19).\n\nIn the Dec. 19 Mercury News, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan points out that “property management” of housing for the homeless is a specialty that perhaps should be contracted out rather than left to nonprofit homeless providers.\n\nI know of an apartment complex built on church property in partnership with a nonprofit provider in which serious problems have ensued due to a lack of professional property management. Since one hopes that more of these affordable housing complexes will be built, the experience of this church (in my neighborhood) indicates that there is a serious need for specialized property management experienced with the homeless population to ensure the safety and habitability of such housing.\n\nThe city should start thinking about effective training and planning for this kind of property management.\n\nSusan Price\n\nCorporations don’t have\nmonopoly on corruption\n\nRe: “Citizens United is our republic’s greatest threat” (Page A8, Dec. 22).\n\nIn his letter, Bill Wallace ignores the fact that Democrats were able to outspend Republicans by a wide margin in the recent election.\n\nThe attack on corporate influence should be extended to unions.\n\nA greater threat to republican government comes from the egalitarian hate-the-rich crowd who want Citizens United overturned by constitutional amendment or a new ruling involving loose construction of the First Amendment. The second method, favored by liberals, would enable the government to define free speech as it wishes.\n\nWhile a corporation is a legal fiction, workers and stockholders are “people” who deserve constitutional preservation of property rights. Corporations do a much better job of wealth distribution than government. Opposition to the Citizens United ruling, as well as to Donald Trump’s appointees, is based on the delusion that government and unions are less corrupt than corporations.\n\nFred Gutmann\n\nTrump tax cut is\nwrong solution for debt\n\nRe: “House rejects Trump-backed plan to avert government shutdown” (Page A1, Dec. 20).\n\nDonald Trump is not yet sworn in. Still, he wanted to wade in to stop the deal that Speaker Mike Johnson made with Democrats to provide FEMA funds to help Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton victims. In addition, the SBA is totally out of funds and farmers need help to deal with climate change.\n\nTrump wants to give a massive tax cut to the wealthy and lower the corporate tax rate to 15% which will cost trillions. Knowing this, he wanted to take away the debt ceiling altogether. Trump won with the support from the working poor voters who bought into his promise of lowering grocery, electricity, gas and car prices.\n\nWe have $36 trillion in debt and interest alone is not sustainable. A tax cut is not the way to lower the debt and keep his campaign promise.\n\nRate hikes don’t jibe\nwith new revenue\n\nRe: “Nuclear plant stays open; bills to rise” (Page B1, Dec. 23).\n\nIt was recently reported that California regulators have finalized a series of electricity rate increases for California residents.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is that new construction seems to be nonstop everywhere you look, and these new buildings will be connected to PG&E, thus bringing in more money to the utility. With all this new revenue coming in, why is there a need to increase rates so frequently?\n\nScott Simmons\nPortola Valley\n\nNo substitute for\nexperience in housing\n\nRe: “How to pick a housing pro” (Page E1, Dec. 22).\n\nThe best way to select an agent to help you buy or sell a property is to select one with at least five years of experience listing and selling properties in the area and price range you’re looking in.\n\nIt’s also important that an agent be associated with a financially sound brokerage company because they’ll be better able to carry good liability coverage to protect you in the event of any litigation from a sale or purchase.\n\nI base this on my experience as one of the top Realtors in the country before I retired in 2018.\n\nMusk paid handsomely\nfor his path to power\n\nI don’t remember Elon Musk’s name being on my ballot. Even if it had been, I would never have cast my vote for him.\n\nAlthough he has never, in the past, shown the slightest interest in government, he now seems to be the most powerful man in Washington. He owns a major social media platform, by which he can manipulate the political scene, and by contributing over a quarter of a billion dollars to elect Donald Trump and his minions, he seems to be hovering over Trump in most photos and to have more power and influence than the president-elect.\n\nIs Musk our soon-to-be shadow president? Once again, wealth and greed have triumphed in American politics. How did this happen? Possibly because we have the most uneducated electorate possible. Shame on us.\n\nLorraine D’Ambruoso","summary":"Also: Wrong solution &#124; Hikes don't jibe &#124; No substitute &#124; Power purchased.

Between the federal government&apos;s move to ban the live sheep trade by 2028, the closure of Victoria&apos;s last metropolitan saleyard, and droughts and frost across much of the nation, it has been a tough year for the industry too. But farmers across Australia have come together to make their voices heard in Canberra and to help one another in times of need. There have been big debates around renewables and nuclear energy, restrictions on the use of paraquat, and of course, lamb&apos;s generation gap. We have seen shake-ups in the political arena: David Crisafulli took the reins as Queensland Premier as the Liberal National Party ousted Labor for the first time in almost ten years, Murray Watt was bumped as agriculture minister in a frontbench reshuffle, and across the Atlantic, Donald Trump was set to return to the White House in 2025. And we have remembered those who have made their mark on rural Australia, like former Cattle Australia and Northern Territory Cattlemen&apos;s Association CEO Luke Bowen and NSW studstock industry stalwart Sandy Munro.

Earlier in the week, my colleague Bob Hoge wrote about Trump's trading barbs with that island nation's president over the Panama Canal's future.\n\n War of Words: Panamanian President, Trump Go Back and Forth Over Future of Canal—'We'll See About That!'\n\nOf course, Trump also made that (possibly) tongue-in-cheek post about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being a future U.S. governor, and he's riffed quite a bit--both during and after November's election--about tariffs for several nations in our hemisphere.\n\nBonjour, Governor Trudeau?\n\nNow, the incoming president has shared who he's picked to represent the United State in Panama. His endorsement, shared by the transition team on Christmas Day via Truth Social, begins by doubling down on his gripes over how the Panamanians are managing the valuable shipping lane, writing:\n\nI am pleased to announce that Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a Country that is ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams.\n\n Then it continues in a more conventional vein:\n\nKevin is a fierce fighter for America First principles. As a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, and Vice Chairman of the International Trade Consortium, he has been instrumental in driving Economic growth, and fostering International partnerships. In 2020, Kevin did an incredible job as my Florida State Director and, this year, advanced our MAGA Agenda as a Member of the RNC Platform Committee. Few understand Latin American politics as well as Kevin - He will do a FANTASTIC job representing our Nation’s interests in Panama!\n\nWe promise to keep popcorn in stock for everyone, for the ongoing war of words with Panama. Until then, Merry Christmas, everyone!\n\nReminder...There are so many great stories awaiting you, not only here at RedState, but if you join up for VIP Gold membership, you’ll have access to VIP articles across all of the Townhall Media sites, including Townhall, Twitchy, HotAir, Bearing Arms, and PJ Media.

The US President-elect said that he will direct his Justice Department to pursue the death penalty as soon as he takes power on January 20, 2025. Trump’s statement comes after Biden in his final month in office, commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal inmates to life in prison without parole. “Joe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country. When you hear the acts of each, you won't believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can't believe this is happening”, \" he posted on Truth Social, his social media platform. Further, he added, “As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters.” On Monday, Trump’s transition team hit out at Biden’s decision, calling it abhorrent and favouring convicts. Notably, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates citing a moratorium on federal executions except in cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder. For the unversed, Trump resumed federal executions during his presidency, from 2017 to 2021, after a nearly 20-year hiatus. This move was a significant departure from the previous moratorium on federal executions. In contrast, Joe Biden, who opposed the death penalty during his presidential campaign, halted federal executions when he took office in January 2021. Meanwhile, the clemency decisions, unlike executive orders, cannot be reversed by a president's successor. However, future administrations can still pursue the death penalty more aggressively in new cases.

Hundreds of thousands are packed into tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Aid groups have struggled to deliver food and supplies and say there are shortages of blankets, warm clothing and firewood.\n\nIsrael has increased the amount of aid it allows into the territory, reaching an average of 130 trucks a day so far this month, up from around 70 a day in October and November. Still, the amount remains well below than previous months and the United Nations says it is unable to distribute more than half the aid because Israeli forces deny permission to move within Gaza or because of rampant lawlessness and theft from trucks.\n\nThe father of 3-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try and keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it wasn’t enough, he told The Associated Press.\n\nHe said the tent was not sealed from the wind and the ground was cold, as temperatures on Tuesday night dropped to 9 degrees Celsius (48 degrees Fahrenheit.) Muwasi is a desolate area of dunes and farmland on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.\n\n“It was very cold overnight and as adults we couldn’t even take it. We couldn’t stay warm,” he said. Sila woke up crying three times overnight and in the morning they found her unresponsive, her body stiff.\n\n“She was like wood,” said al-Faseeh. They rushed her to a field hospital where doctors tried to revive her, but her lungs had already deteriorated. Images of Sila taken by the AP showed the little girl with purple lips, her pale skin blotchy.\n\nAhmed al-Farra, director of the children’s ward at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, confirmed that the baby died of hypothermia. He said two other babies — one 3 days old, the other a month old — had been brought to the hospital over the past 48 hours after dying of hypothermia.\n\nCeasefire complications\n\nMeanwhile, hopes for a ceasefire looked complicated Wednesday, with Israel and the militant Hamas group that runs Gaza trading accusations of delaying an agreement. In recent weeks, the two sides appeared to be inching toward a deal that would bring home dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza, but differences have emerged.\n\nAlthough Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that progress was being made toward a deal, sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions related to the withdrawal from Gaza, the prisoners and the return of displaced people, which it said was delaying the deal.\n\nIsrael’s government accused Hamas of reneging on understandings that have already been reached.” Still, both sides said discussions are ongoing.\n\nIsrael’s negotiating team, which includes members from its intelligence agencies and the military, returned from Qatar on Tuesday evening for internal consultations, following a week of what it called “significant negotiations.”\n\nDuring its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year.\n\nIsrael says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity.\n\nSporadic talks have taken place for a year, but in recent weeks there’s been a renewed push to reach a deal.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month for his second term, has demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages, saying on social media that if they’re not freed before he is sworn in, there will be “HELL TO PAY.”\n\nFamilies of the hostages are becoming increasingly angry, calling on the Israeli government for a ceasefire before Trump is sworn in.\n\nAfter Israel’s high-level negotiation team returned from Doha this week, hostage families called an emergency press conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, pleading for a ceasefire and a complete end to the war.\n\nShir Siegel, the daughter of Israeli-American Keith Siegel, whose mother was released after more than 50 days in captivity, said every delay could endanger their lives. “There are moments when every second is fateful, and this is one of those moments,” she said.\n\nFamilies of the hostages marked the first night of Hannukah with a candle lighting ceremony in Tel Aviv as well as by the Western Wall in Jerusalem.\n\nThe agreement would take effect in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction.\n\nHouthi attacks\n\nAlso Wednesday, a missile launched by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels triggered air raid sirens across central Israel, sending residents fleeing to shelters. The Houthis said they operations were aimed at Israeli targets in the cities of Jaffa and Ashkelon.\n\nIt was the fourth time in a week that fire from the Yemeni rebels set off sirens in Israel.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will strike anyone threatening lives in Israel and warned the Houthis that they would learn lessons that Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria’s ousted President Bashar Assad have learned.\n\nIsrael also requested an emergency meeting by the U.N. Security Council to address the recent attacks. The meeting is set for Monday.\n\nIsrael’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said he expects the council to condemn the Houthi attacks and called on it “to enforce international law and hold Iran, the Houthis’ patron, accountable.”\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Khaled from Cairo.

president-elect would “kill” Canada’s economy. \n\n“So your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion?” Trump reportedly replied, referencing the US trade deficit with Canada. \n\nThe president-elect then suggested Canada should join the US, becoming the 51st state, and gave Trudeau the nickname “Governor.” \n\nGretzky, 63, has previously endorsed the

$86 billion to launch mass deportations","text":"Tom Homan, the incoming Border Czar under the Donald Trump administration, has revealed that the White House will require $86 billion from Congress to initiate the mass deportation plan set to be a central focus of the new administration.Speaking on Fox Business, Homan emphasized that while the deportation effort will be costly in the short term, it will ultimately save taxpayers billions of dollars in the long run.The proposed funding will go toward increasing detention capacity, with Homan stating a goal to expand the number of detention beds from the current capacity of tens of thousands to 100,000. “Congress needs to fund this deportation operation,” Homan asserted, acknowledging the expense but stressing the long-term financial benefits. He added, “It’s going to be expensive, but it’s going to save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money.”The former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) further detailed that the funds would be used for additional resources, including detention beds, deportation flights, transportation for deported individuals, and medical care during the deportation process. Homan emphasized that this initiative was crucial for national security, calling it “the biggest national security vulnerability this country has.”President-elect Donald Trump said he is commitment to the plan, vowing to begin the \"largest deportation operation in American history\" on his first day back in office.Homan, who has been tapped to lead the operation, echoed Trump’s sentiment, saying that the incoming administration will take swift action to address what they view as an urgent national security issue. The plan is expected to be one of the most significant efforts of its kind in US history.As the proposal moves through Congress, attention will be on how lawmakers respond to the call for funding and the broader implications of such an ambitious deportation strategy.Tom Homan appointed to oversee mass deportations and border crackdownOn November 12, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Tom Homan, was appointed as the \"border czar\" for President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming administration. Homan, a seasoned immigration enforcement expert, has pledged to enact major changes in US border security, focusing on mass deportations, combating human trafficking, and addressing drug smuggling.In his new role, Homan will oversee a comprehensive border security strategy, including both the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Trump has emphasized that Homan’s appointment is central to his administration’s commitment to strengthening border security and implementing large-scale deportations.Homan has expressed his intention to take immediate action on his first day in office, vowing to implement a “shock and awe” approach to border enforcement. His goal is to deter illegal border crossings and establish a stronger and more effective immigration enforcement system. Under his leadership, the Trump administration plans to enforce stricter border control measures, aimed at preventing illegal immigration and ensuring the safety of the nation.As part of the border czar’s responsibilities, Homan will manage deportation initiatives, which align with Trump’s promise to conduct a historic deportation operation. This is expected to be one of the largest and most aggressive deportation efforts in US history, with Homan expected to oversee the logistics of deportations, ensuring coordination between various government agencies involved.Homan’s appointment underscores Trump’s focus on immigration and border security, which were central themes of his 2016 campaign and continue to be pivotal issues in his administration’s priorities. The appointment also signifies the administration’s commitment to fulfilling promises made to voters who support stronger border enforcement and reduced illegal immigration.As Homan prepares to take office, all eyes will be on his leadership as the new border czar and the implementation of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-s-border-czar-tom-homan-calls-for-86-billion-to-launch-mass-deportations-11735160500084.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/25/1600x900/USA-POLITICS-CONSERVATIVES-10_1735161977697_1735161991556.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 22:53:24","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":276090484,"title":"Top Moments When Sports Collided With Politics in 2024","text":"From presidential campaign rhetoric and endorsements to men in female sports, 2024 has been an eventful year for the intersection of politics and sports.\n\nExpect the connection between the political and sports arenas to continue in 2025, especially with President-elect Donald Trump back in the White House.\n\n“I don’t see much change.

I believe that leaders must tell the truth,” he said.\n\nKerr then copied the gesture Warriors superstar Stephen Curry makes toward the other team when he makes a shot to clinch a game: putting his hands at the side of his head as if he is going to sleep.\n\n“After the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump, ‘Night, night,’'” said Kerr.\n\n“This is about preserving hope and belief in our country. Making sure families can be taken care of during the most precious times,” he said.\n\n“I think it’s an important time,” he later told the press, declining to go into detail about why he sported the iconic hat.\n\nIn April, the Biden administration interpreted Title IX to include transgender athletes, by stating that discrimination under that law includes discrimination based on “gender identity.”\n\nNew federal guidance prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in education programs that get federal taxpayer dollars.\n\nMultiple teams in women’s sports have also forfeited games against opposing teams with transgender players.\n\nWitnesses included NCAA President and former Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, former NFL player Johnson Bademosi, former Assistant Attorney General David Rebuck, gambling therapist Harry Levant, and National Council on Problem Gambling Executive Director Keith Whyte.\n\nOne of the issues surrounding the matter is the harassment athletes receive for not fulfilling the bets of gamblers.\n\n“Student athletes publicly revealed they get demands for money from unhappy batters for trivial things that don’t impact the result on the field,” said Baker.\n\n“Many have received death threats from bettors, and they also receive other in-person threats and accusations directed at them while they’re leaving or coming onto the field of play.”\n\nBaker asked Congress to pass legislation banning prop betting on college sports and to “strengthen sport leagues’ abilities to investigate integrity issues.”\n\nThe previous month, Trump attended a game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia in Alabama, where Trump enjoyed wide support. There, he tossed several boxes of chicken tenders into a crowd of fans.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers icon Steve Garvey lost to Sen.

Against this backdrop, certain individuals emerged as key figures, captivating the world and steering its course.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s resounding victory as The Epoch Times’ U.S. Newsmaker of the Year—garnering 96.9 percent of first-choice votes—reflects the significance of his political comeback in 2024. In a year marked by upheaval, Trump dominated headlines, reshaped the political landscape, and cemented his status as a transformative figure in U.S. politics.\n\nAfter a historic election in which he won both the Electoral College and the popular vote, Trump is poised to become the 47th president of the United States when he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2025. His return to the presidency comes at a critical time as the nation grapples with economic struggles and global instability.\n\nTrump’s journey back to the White House was marked by extraordinary challenges, including multiple legal battles and two assassination attempts, underscoring his resilience, the unwavering loyalty of his political base, and the enduring appeal of his rallying cry: “Make America Great Again.”\n\nTrump has outlined an ambitious agenda for his second term, which he has promised to implement swiftly. His plans include sharp reductions in the federal workforce, mass deportations of illegal immigrants, strengthened border security, a rollback of transgender policies in education, pardons for many Jan. 6 detainees, a surge in domestic energy production, and sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.\n\n“I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,” Trump said recently, encapsulating key priorities for his first 100 days back in office.\n\nTrump’s rousing pledge to restore America’s greatness—and his dramatic path back to power in the face of great challenges—has galvanized media attention. Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year,” marking the second time in the past decade that he has received the honor.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. placed second in The Epoch Times’ poll, followed by Vice President Kamala Harris, and President Joe Biden. Each played a significant role in shaping this year’s political narrative.\n\nKennedy’s surprising decision to drop his independent presidential campaign and endorse Trump made headlines, as did his subsequent nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Meanwhile, Harris’s historic yet unsuccessful bid for the presidency captured national attention, while Biden led an administration that oversaw critical events on the global stage, including the U.S. response to the Russia–Ukraine and Israel–Hamas wars.\n\nThe write-in nominees for U.S. Newsmaker of the Year showcased a broad range of influential figures who left their mark on U.S. politics and culture in 2024.\n\nArgentinian President Javier Milei was overwhelmingly chosen as The Epoch Times’ International Newsmaker of the Year, securing 76.6 percent of first-choice votes. Milei’s transformative leadership and bold economic reforms resonated deeply with readers, establishing him as a global icon of libertarian ideals and fiscal discipline.\n\nWhen Milei took office in November 2023, Argentina was grappling with near-catastrophic economic conditions: a monthly pace of inflation at about 25 percent, a poverty rate exceeding 40 percent, a fiscal deficit at 15 percent of gross domestic product, and an economy in recession.\n\nMilei has since implemented sweeping reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy, taking an axe to bureaucratic bloat, slashing government spending by 30 percent, and rebalancing trade. His measures have dramatically reduced inflation to a monthly pace of 2.4 percent, and the country has achieved its first budget surplus in more than a decade, capturing international attention as a model of fiscal turnaround.\n\n“We have passed the test of fire,” Milei recently told Argentinians. “We are leaving the desert, the recession is over, and the country has finally begun to grow.”\n\nMilei’s leadership has also sparked a cultural shift, with his rhetoric on liberty and personal responsibility challenging decades of entrenched socialist ideals in Argentina. By dismantling bureaucratic inefficiencies and promoting free-market policies, Milei has reshaped the national conversation, igniting debate about the future of governance and economic freedom.\n\nRunners-up for International Newsmaker of the Year reflected a diverse set of global leaders making significant impacts.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earned second place for his continued leadership in positioning the world’s largest democracy as a rising global power and for securing a historic reelection mandate. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ranked third, recognized for her trailblazing victory as Mexico’s first female president, with her party securing a supermajority that allows it to pass controversial constitutional reforms.\n\nThe write-in nominees reflected the broad spectrum of leaders whom readers recognized for their significant impact on global affairs in 2024.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received notable mentions for navigating the challenges of the Israel–Hamas war, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remained a symbol of resilience during his country’s prolonged war with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin also appeared among write-ins, reflecting his continued influence on global geopolitics.\n\nElon Musk dominated the innovation landscape in 2024, earning 96.5 percent of first-choice votes as The Epoch Times’ Innovation Newsmaker of the Year.\n\nUnder Musk’s guidance, SpaceX set new benchmarks in reusable spaceflight by using metal pincers to catch a Starship booster rocket, while Neuralink achieved a groundbreaking first with a human brain chip implant. Tesla, which is led by Musk, continued its reign as the leader in the electric vehicle industry, solidifying his influence across multiple sectors.\n\nBeyond his headline-grabbing achievements, Musk also spearheaded advancements in renewable energy and transportation infrastructure. In 2024, Tesla started producing prototype battery cells using dry cathode technology, a development that promises to deliver significant cost reductions and pave the way for more affordable electric vehicles. Also, Musk’s Starlink satellite network reached a new milestone in global internet coverage, bringing high-speed connectivity to underserved regions and fostering economic opportunities in remote areas.\n\nRunners-up for Innovation Newsmaker of the Year included Jensen Huang, who drove Nvidia’s advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, whose contributions sparked crucial conversations on the ethical dimensions of AI. Mads Krogsgaard of Novo Nordisk also earned recognition for game-changing innovations in health care.\n\nThe write-in nominees highlighted a wide range of innovators who left their mark in 2024, with names such as Alex Karp of Palantir and Vivek Ramaswamy showcasing the interplay of technology, leadership, and cultural influence.\n\nCaitlin Clark’s meteoric rise in 2024 had a transformative impact on U.S. women’s basketball, earning her 45.9 percent of first-choice votes as The Epoch Times’ Sports Newsmaker of the Year.\n\nClark’s remarkable talent and dynamic play have elevated the popularity and viewership of women’s basketball, a phenomenon referred to as the “Caitlin Clark effect.”\n\nDuring her college years, Clark’s games attracted unprecedented audiences. The 2023 NCAA women’s basketball championship game, featuring Clark, became the most-watched women’s college basketball game in history, drawing an average of 9.9 million viewers.\n\nFollowing a record-breaking college career, Clark joined the Indiana Fever as the first overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, with an immediate impact on viewership. She helped propel the Fever to their first playoff appearance since 2017, captivating fans with her exceptional shooting range and playmaking abilities.\n\nAfter being named 2024 WNBA Rookie of the Year, she was also picked for the All-WNBA First Team, making her just the fifth rookie in the 28-year history of the league to make the first team.\n\nRunners-up for Sports Newsmaker of the Year included gymnast Simone Biles, who made a triumphant Olympic comeback with multiple gold medals, and swimmer Katie Ledecky, whose dominance at the Paris Olympics further solidified her status as one of the greatest athletes of all time. Novak Djokovic also received recognition for his record-breaking achievements in men’s tennis.\n\nWrite-in nominees such as Shohei Ohtani and Lionel Messi highlighted the global nature of sports and the enduring impact of athletes who continue to inspire across different disciplines.\n\nThe newsmakers of 2024 demonstrated how individual action can shape the course of nations, industries, and culture. Leaders such as Trump and Milei reshaped political landscapes, while Musk and Clark pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in innovation and sports.\n\nAs the page turns to 2025, their stories serve as a reminder that great challenges create great opportunities.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/2024-newsmakers-of-the-year-epoch-times-readers-choice-5780230?cmt=1","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/12/24/id5781511-outside-300x180.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 22:53:24","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.573},{"id":276090460,"title":"ABC to Pay Trump $15 Million in Defamation Settlement; NY Drone Sightings Shut Down Airfield","text":"Dec-14-2024\n\nABC News will pay President-elect Donald Trump $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit.

lower taxes if Canada becomes ‘51st state’ — and backs hockey legend Wayne Gretzky as PM","text":"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday trolled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by promising to cut Canucks’ taxes if they agree to become “our 51st state,’’ while urging them to draft NHL great Wayne Gretzky to lead the country. \n\n“I just left Wayne Gretzky, ‘The Great One’ as he is known in Ice Hockey circles,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. \n\n“I said, ‘Wayne, why don’t you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada – You would win easily, you wouldn’t even have to campaign,’” the president-elect said.\n\nTrump — who thinks Canada has been ripping off the US over trade — has been taunting Trudeau for weeks by referring to Canada as a prospective US “state” and the prime minister as its “governor.”\n\nGretzky, who has never held political office, apparently has “no interest” in launching a campaign to replace the unpopular Trudeau as PM, according to Trump. \n\nUndeterred, the 78-year-old president-elect Wednesday pushed Canadians to coax the hockey hall-of-famer and Brantford, Ontario, native into mounting a campaign. \n\n“He had no interest, but I think the people of Canada should start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,” Trump wrote. \n\n“It would be so much fun to watch!” he added. \n\nTrump wished Trudeau a “Merry Christmas” in another post while mockingly referring to the prime minister as “governor” again. \n\nThe president-elect argued that Canada should become a US state because the taxes of its citizens “are far too high, but if Canada was to become our 51st State, their Taxes would be cut by more than 60%.” \n\nTrump asserted that Canadian businesses also “would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World” if the Great White North was to join the US. \n\nTrudeau, 53, has served as prime minister of Canada since 2015. \n\nThe Liberal Party leader has faced mounting calls to resign, even from members of his own party, ahead of next year’s federal election. \n\nCanadians appear fed up with high prices and a housing crisis that has emerged under Trudeau’s more than nine years in office. \n\nThe latest polls show Canada’s Conservative Party has a commanding lead over the Liberals in the election, which is expected to take place before October 2025.\n\nTrudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago last month and dined with Trump amid the 45th president’s threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian imports – which Trudeau reportedly told the president-elect would “kill” Canada’s economy. \n\n“So your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion?” Trump reportedly replied, referencing the US trade deficit with Canada. \n\nThe president-elect then suggested Canada should join the US, becoming the 51st state, and gave Trudeau the nickname “Governor.” \n\nGretzky, 63, has previously endorsed the Conservative Party and former Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. \n\nHe is a four-time Stanley Cup winner and holds or shares 61 National Hockey League records.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday trolled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by promising to cut Canucks’ taxes if they agree to become “our 51st state,’’ while urging

The country woke up at 5:30 am (0330 GMT) to an air raid alarm, shortly followed by air force reports that Russia had launched Kalibr cruise missiles from the Black Sea.\n\n“Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack. What could be more inhumane? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than a hundred attack drones. The target is our energy system,” Zelensky said. This was the 13th large-scale strike on Ukraine’s energy system this year, the latest in Russia’s campaign targeting the power grid during winter.\n\nRussia meanwhile said five people had died in Ukrainian strikes and a falling drone in the border region of Kursk and in North Ossetia in the Caucasus. A woman was killed in a fire when the drone fell on a shopping mall in Russia’s North Ossetia region early Wednesday, local authorities said. The blaze at the four-storey Alania Mall in Vladikavkaz, the main city in the Caucasus region, was caused by the debris of a drone hit by an air defense system, Russia’s defense ministry said. Another drone came down Wednesday in the town of Malgobek in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia without causing damage or injuries, regional leader Makhmoud-Ali Kalimatov said.\n\nUkraine said its air force downed 58 out of 79 Russian-launched missiles. It did not, however, down the two Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles launched by Russia. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the strikes. “I pay tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people, and the leadership of President Zelensky, in the face of further drone and missile attacks from Putin’s bloody and brutal war machine with no respite even at Christmas,” Starmer said. Kyiv also said a Russian missile went through Moldovan and Romanian airspace, but Romania said it detected no such violation while Moldova said it launched investigations.\n\n‘Nothing sacred’\n\n“Unfortunately, there are some hits. As of now, there are blackouts in several regions,” Zelensky said. Ukraine’s DTEK energy company said the attack severely damaged equipment of thermal power plants. “Denying light and warmth to millions of peace-loving people as they celebrate Christmas is a depraved and evil act that must be answered,” DTEK CEO Maxim Timchenko said, urging allies to send more air defense.\n\nThe employee of a Ukrainian thermal power plant was killed in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, over which 42 missiles were shot down, governor Sergiy Lysak said. Lysak also said rescue operations had been completed on the site of a strike on Kryvyi Rig, which killed one person and wounded 17 others the day before. Engineers have restored power to consumers in the Ivano-Frankisvk region.\n\n“Christmas morning has once again shown that nothing is sacred for the aggressor country,” Svitlana Onyshchuk, the head of the Ivano-Frankivsk region, said earlier. Ukraine is officially celebrating Christmas on Dec 25 for the second time. The government last year changed the date from Jan 7, when most Orthodox believers celebrate, as a snub to Russia.\n\n‘Won’t ruin Christmas’\n\nThe Christmas Day attack also targeted Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, located near the Russian border. The missiles had targeted the city’s boiler houses, thermal power plants and electricity facilities, mayor Igor Terekhov said, temporarily cutting power to 500,000 people. One unexploded missile was found in a private yard in Kharkiv, Synegubov said. Kharkiv’s governor Oleg Synegubov also said authorities had evacuated 46 people from the area of Borivske and Kupiansk.\n\nMoscow’s forces are aiming to recapture the town of Kupiansk, which was occupied in the first year of the war. Ukraine recaptured it in Sept 2022 as part of a lightning offensive that saw its forces regain large swathes of the Kharkiv region. Outnumbered Ukrainian troops are on the back foot across the front line in the Kharkiv and Donetsk region further south, ceding ground to better-equipped Russian troops.\n\nRussia said it seized the small village of Vidrodzhennia, a few kilometers south of the vital rail and mining hub of Pokrovsk. Both sides are scrambling to gain an upper hand ahead of the inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump, who boasted he would quickly end the war, raising fears that Washington may force Kyiv into a deal on Moscow’s terms.\n\nUkraine has been urging allies to send more aid to fend off aerial strikes and push back troops on the ground. “I am grateful to everyone who is working for the country, who is on combat duty, who is protecting our sky,” Zelensky said. “Russian evil will not break Ukraine and will not ruin Christmas,” Zelensky said. – AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/22728/top-stories/ukraine-slams-russia-christmas-attack/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/12/25/196178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 22:50:24","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kw","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":276089936,"title":"Trump mocks opponents in Christmas message","text":"Court ruling could tip majority to Republicans in Minnesota HouseWestern New Mexico University president quits after audit of fundsGeorgia farmers reeling months after Hurricane Helene ravaged cropsAlaska governor asks Trump to end oil & gas drilling restrictions\n\n Trump mocks opponents in Christmas message The US president-elect has singled out China, Canada, Panama, Greenland and the Democrats US President-elect Donald Trump has posted a Christmas message taking potshots at China, Panama, Canada, Greenland, and his domestic political opponents.The Republican, who is slated to return to the White House in January, put up two posts on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, wishing \"Merry Christmas to all.\"The first on his list were \"the wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal.\" The US controlled the waterway between the Atlantic and the Pacific for almost a century before handing it back to Panama in 1999.

messages in US","text":"The outgoing and incoming United States presidents had different messages for the Christmas holiday, with Democrat Joe Biden urging Americans to reflect and unite, while Republican Donald Trump offered a holiday greeting and then took aim at his political opponents.\n\nBiden narrated a video tour of the White House Christmas decorations that was published on YouTube late on Christmas Eve on Tuesday, in which he urged Americans to set aside “all the noise and everything that divides us”.\n\n“We’re here on this Earth to care for one another, to love one another,” Biden said in a voiceover as a camera pans past adorned evergreen trees and bedecked fireplaces inside the White House. “Too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbours, not as fellow Americans,” he said.\n\nBiden urged Americans to find a moment of “quiet reflection” to remind themselves to treat each other with dignity and respect, to “live in the light” and remember there was more to unite than divide Americans. “We’re truly blessed to live in this nation,” he said.\n\nTrump published a mid-morning “Merry Christmas” message on Truth Social on Christmas Day on Wednesday with a photo of himself and his wife Melania, followed by more than two dozen re-posts of articles or other social media posts that backed his political positions on topics including defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and his pursuit of Greenland and the Panama Canal.\n\nLater, Trump published a more lengthy “Merry Christmas” message that claimed Chinese soldiers were operating the Panama Canal, and criticised Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Biden and Democrats.\n\n“Merry Christmas to the Radical Left Lunatics, who are constantly trying to obstruct our Court System and our Elections,” Trump wrote. “They know that their only chance of survival is getting pardons from a man who has absolutely no idea what he is doing.”\n\n“Also, to Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose Citizens’ Taxes are far too high, but if Canada was to become our 51st State, their Taxes would be cut by more than 60 percent,” Trump wrote.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 promising to “end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal,” and said he bowed out of the 2024 presidential race in July to unite the country.\n\nBiden’s Democrats lost every battleground state and both houses of Congress in the November election.\n\nBy some measures, polarisation in the country has increased, including during the 2024 campaign that saw Biden face Trump, again, before Kamala Harris took over the Democratic candidacy before she eventually lost the presidential election.\n\nTrump has called for the prosecution of perceived political enemies, the US takeover of the Panama Canal and pledged to restructure the federal government.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/biden-trump-send-different-christmas-messages-in-us/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AP24351632247103-1734377773-XMrBzl.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25

September","text":"ORLANDO, Fla. -- A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September 2025, a federal judge ruled this week.\n\nRyan Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, 2025 start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.\n\nRouth, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nRouth's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.\n\nRouth owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nIn her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \"unreasonable delay,\" she said.\n\nThe judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.\n\nProsecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.\n\nHe was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.\n\nRouth's charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami.\n\nRouth's arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFeatured video is from a previous report","summary":"A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September 2025.","url":"https://abc11.com/post/trial-man-accused-trump-assassination-attempt-florida-pushed-back-september/15707472/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15389043_100324-cc-ryan-routh-ap-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 22:40:14","author":"The Associated Press,WTVD-AP","authors":["The Associated Press","WTVD-AP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.693},{"id":276090518,"title":"Trump urges Wayne Gretzky to run for Canadian prime minister as Justin Trudeau could be on the brink of losing power","text":"In a Christmas Day message, past and future president Donald Trump said he urged Wayne Gretzky to run for prime minister of Canada.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he talked with the legendary hockey player and Canadian icon, telling Gretzky he could easily win a national election.He also said Gretzky could become \"Governor of Canada\" — an apparent reference to his joke that the northern neighbor could become the 51st state in the United States of America.\"I just left Wayne Gretzky, 'The Great One' as he is known in Ice Hockey circles,\" Trump wrote in a Wednesday afternoon Truth Social post. \"I said, 'Wayne, why don't you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada - You would win easily, you wouldn't even have to campaign.'\"Gretzky wasn't interested in running, Trump said.\"He had no interest, but I think the people of Canada should start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,\" Trump wrote. \"It would be so much fun to watch!\"A representative for Gretzky didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.In his next presidential term, Trump has said that he would impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada that would make American importers pay 25% more.Trump's account posted on Truth Social nearly 40 times on Wednesday, mostly articles from conservative media outlets supporting his policies. He also named Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Republican official in Florida who worked for Trump's 2020 campaign, as his choice for ambassador to Panama. Over the past week, Trump has threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal.The president-elect's support for Gretzky — a dual US-Canadian citizen — comes as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could be on the brink of losing power.Trudeau's Liberal Party remains in power through a coalition with the New Democratic Party in the country's parliament. Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party, said he would call for a \"no confidence\" vote in January, costing the Liberals their majority and triggering a new election. Canada is also scheduled to have a federal election in October 2025.Gretzky and his family visited Mar-a-Lago shortly after Trump's November electoral victory.

Of the four criminal cases brought against Trump, in which he pleaded not guilty to all charges, two were dismissed and the other two are in limbo. The president-elect has also been needling Panama, Canada and Greenland over ownership of their territories.What To KnowTrump posted a series of Christmas messages to his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. They started out lighthearted with merry wishes and a photo of the president-elect and his wife, incoming first lady Melania Trump, but then things took a turn.Trump's Christmas MessagesIn one post, Trump made another plea for the U.S. to take ownership of Canada, the Panama Canal and Greenland.\"Merry Christmas to all, including to the wonderful soldiers of China, who are lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal (where we lost 38,000 people in its building 110 years ago), always making certain that the United States puts in Billions of Dollars in 'repair' money, but will have absolutely nothing to say about 'anything,'\" Trump said.Over the weekend, Trump suggested that the U.S. could regain control of the Panama Canal from the Panamanian government if something is not done to curb the \"exorbitant\" shipping costs required for using the waterway.Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said in a statement on Sunday, \"Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent area belong to PANAMA, and will continue to be.\" Mulino has also said that China had no influence on the Panama Canal's administration.Trump's post continued: \"Also, to Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose Citizens' Taxes are far too high, but if Canada was to become our 51st State, their Taxes would be cut by more than 60%, their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other Country anywhere in the World. Likewise, to the people of Greenland, which is needed by the United States for National Security purposes and, who want the U.S. to be there, and we will!\"Trump has been calling Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, \"governor\" and suggesting that Canada join the U.S. as the 51st state.The president-elect on Sunday also said while naming PayPal cofounder Ken Howery as his choice for ambassador to Denmark, \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc thought Trump was just joking when he reportedly suggested Canada become the 51st U.S. state during a dinner with Trudeau late last month.\"The president was telling jokes. The president was teasing us. It was, of course, on that issue, in no way a serious comment,\" LeBlanc, who attended the dinner, told reporters earlier this month.Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede said on Monday, \"Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom.\"The president-elect also kept with his holiday tradition of thanking the \"Radical Left Lunatics\" in the U.S.\"Merry Christmas to the Radical Left Lunatics, who are constantly trying to obstruct our Court System and our Elections, and are always going after the Great Citizens and Patriots of the United States but, in particular, their Political Opponent, ME. They know that their only chance of survival is getting pardons from a man who has absolutely no idea what he is doing,\" Trump wrote in another post on Wednesday.He continued: \"Also, to the 37 most violent criminals, who killed, raped, and plundered like virtually no one before them, but were just given, incredibly, a pardon by Sleepy Joe Biden. I refuse to wish a Merry Christmas to those lucky 'souls' but, instead, will say, GO TO HELL! We had the Greatest Election in the History of our Country, a bright light is now shining over the U.S.A. and, in 26 days, we will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. MERRY CHRISTMAS!\"Biden on Monday announced that he is commuting the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. They will remain in prison for life and will not be given the possibility of parole.\"President Biden has dedicated his career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system,\" read a statement from the White House issued Monday. \"He believes that America must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level, except in cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder – which is why today's actions apply to all but those cases.\"The president also commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 people sentenced to home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic and pardoned 40 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, including his son Hunter Biden, this month.Biden's Christmas MessagesBiden on Tuesday shared a Christmas Eve message on his personal X account, highlighting the sacrifices of U.S. service members.\"Jill and I hold a special place in our hearts for the brave men and women in uniform who defend our nation, many of whom are away from their families this holiday season. Wishing you and your loved ones a safe Christmas Eve,\" Biden wrote alongside a photo of him and first lady Jill Biden.The president signed 50 bills into law on Christmas Eve. Among these bills are the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act, which protects youths living in residential treatment facilities; the Stop Campus Hazing Act, which requires colleges and universities to disclose reported hazing incidents in their annual security reports; and the No CORRUPTION Act, which bans members of Congress from collecting pensions if they are convicted of crimes related to public corruption.On Christmas Day, Biden posted to the presidential X account, \"Merry Christmas, America!\" along with a video of him and Jill at the Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C.\"Merry Christmas America. We're joining you from the Children's National Hospital where we've been spreading holiday cheer to children and families. And them to us as well,\" the president said.Jill then chimed in: \"For four years now, Joe and I have spent time with these families and the amazing doctors and nurses here. It's a tradition we look forward to every December. From the Biden family to yours, may your Christmas be full of kindness and love, peace and light.\"The video ended with the Bidens and a bunch of patients exclaiming, \"Merry Christmas!\"What People Are SayingTrump-supporting podcaster Alex Stone replied to Biden's Christmas Eve post on Wednesday with a photo of the president-elect and Melania Trump, writing: \"I can't wait until we get REAL CHRISTMAS back!\"Political commentator who goes by JoJo from Jerz commented on Biden's Christmas video on Wednesday: \"Merry Christmas @POTUS and @FLOTUS.\"Political strategist Dr. Basil A. Smikle on MSNBC Monday said of Trump's threatening language toward other countries: \"It's scary language because as many folks believe that this country is headed toward oligarchical rule and given the [Russian President Vladimir] Putin-esque sort of language that's being used here one wonders like really how far actually would he go?\"What Happens NextTrump will take office January 20. He has pledged to start mass deportations and secure the border on Day One. He has also promised to pardon some of those charged and convicted in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, expand oil drilling and negotiate the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.","summary":"Biden's messages focused on uplifting others while Trump's focused on threatening other nations and criticizing his opponents.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-joe-biden-christmas-messages-2006004","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2551476/trump-biden.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-25 22:31:01","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":276088010,"title":"Hostage families address recent negotiation reports","text":"Family members of hostages held by Hamas gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square Wednesday and called for a hostage deal, as reports and rumors surrounding progress on a possible deal continued to circulate.\"There have never been better conditions for a deal.
