Mr Ramaphosa’s trip would aim to “reset the strategic relationship between the two countries”, his office said.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the meeting, which would be Mr Trump’s first with the leader of a nation in Africa since he returned to office in January.\n\nMr Trump has criticised South Africa’s black-led government on multiple fronts and issued an executive order on February 7 cutting all US funding to the country as punishment for what he said were its anti-white policies at home and anti-American foreign policy.\n\nThe Republican president has singled out South Africa over what the US calls racist laws against whites and has accused the government of “fuelling” violence against white farmers.\n\nThe South African government says the relatively small number of killings of white farmers should be condemned but are part of the country’s problems with violent crime and are not racially motivated.\n\nMr Trump said on Monday — the same day that the first batch of Afrikaner refugees arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia — that there was “a genocide taking place” against white farmers that was being ignored by international media.\n\nThe US criticism of what it calls South Africa’s racist, anti-white laws appears to refer to South Africa’s affirmative action laws that advance opportunities for black people, and a new land expropriation law that gives the government power to take private land without compensation.\n\nAlthough the government says the land law is not a confiscation tool and refers to unused land that can be redistributed for the public good, some Afrikaner groups say it could allow their land to be seized and redistributed to some of the country’s black majority.\n\nSince returning to office in January, Mr Trump has issued orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes across the federal government.\n\nThe administration has also threatened nongovernmental institutions like colleges and universities with the loss of financial aid unless they do the same.\n\nMr Trump also required government contractors and other recipients of federal funds to certify, under threat of severe financial penalties, that they do not operate DEI programmes that violate anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAfrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch, French and German colonial settlers who first came to South Africa in the 17th century.\n\nThey were the leaders of the country’s previous apartheid system of racial segregation. There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners among South Africa’s population of 62 million, which is more than 80% black.\n\nThere are also nearly 2 million other whites of British and other descent.\n\nMr Trump has also accused South Africa of taking “aggressive positions towards the US and its allies” in its foreign policy and of being a supporter of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, and Iran.\n\nMr Trump’s executive order cited South Africa’s decision to accuse US ally Israel of genocide in Gaza in an ongoing case at the International Court of Justice as an example of its anti-American stance.\n\nIsrael opened a military offensive in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in an October 2023 intrusion into southern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli operation has killed more than 52,928 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Almost 3,000 have been killed since Israel broke a ceasefire on March 18, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael has resumed blocking food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for weeks, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians\n\nMr Ramaphosa has spoken repeatedly of his desire to engage with Mr Trump diplomatically and improve the relationship. He says Mr Trump’s criticism is based on false information he is being given about South Africa’s laws and the attacks on farmers.","summary":"President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are scheduled to meet at the White House next week following allegations by Mr Trump — and denied by South Africa — that “genocide” is being committed against white farmers in the majority black country.

Biden may be gone, but the Oversight Project continues to push for answers to this fundamental question of the Biden era: Who was really in charge? \n\nRecent revelations about the former president’s use of an auto-pen machine—brought to light by the Oversight Project—paired with Biden’s limited knowledge of the documents he signed, suggests the answer was not Joe Biden. Yet, some Republicans on Capitol Hill, because of their victory in the 2024 elections, are no longer as interested in that question and would rather act as if the last four years didn’t happen.\n\nMike Howell, president of the Oversight Project, joined “The Signal Sitdown” to discuss how to hold Biden and his ilk accountable for the damage they’ve done to the country.\n\n“Going into the Trump administration [in 2016], the Left did tremendous amounts of damage to advancing policy in the first half of the Trump administration when he had unified control by just creating scandal, litigation, propaganda, everything,” Howell said, reflecting on the system that was weaponized against President Donald Trump. \n\n”What Obama and his ilk were able to do to all sectors of government and society was really well thought out in an evil way,” Howell explained. “They basically took the 9/11-era tools that were supposed to be pointed at Islamic terrorists and pointed them at domestic enemies.”\n\n“There was this asymmetrical fight going on. The Left dominates here. The Right just thinks that they’re congressmen that send letters, they like their heroes and the calvary coming across the ridge, and that just wasn’t the case at all,” he continued. “The Left, through the Russia hoax and everything else, stopped President Trump’s first administration, when it had unified control of the House and Senate, from getting much done.”\n\n“That’s the power structure that Trump, in ‘16, was going against,” Howell told The Daily Signal. “They tried to take him out a million different ways before he even got there. And it happened through his first presidency.”\n\nEven worse, he added, “It’s still happening today. There’s people on the Right who are doing it to him, too.”\n\nBiden became the beneficiary of this power structure in 2020, and his administration put it to great use in an attempt to fundamentally change the country. Race, LGBTQ, feminism, all have roles to play in the scheme, but the biggest is unfettered illegal immigration. \n\n“[The Left is] not reproducing, they’re not focusing on family,” Howell explained. “They’re not educating. So they’re importing instead, and they’re doing so illegally, and that was the fundamental idea behind the border crisis.”\n\n“This is a compounding problem that needs to be addressed,” he added. “The demographic change that Biden ushered in was for purely political purposes. It’s a new voter base.”\n\nFor Democrats, “to do anything that could be perceived as anti-illegal would be a disaster for them with their base. They worship at the altar of the illegal alien,” Howell said. “They have a hierarchy of people they think are most important. It appears that the illegal alien male, particularly, is rising to the top.”\n\n“Republicans… they just don’t take it seriously enough,” Howell said. To undo the damage Biden did, Howell claimed annual deportations need to be in the millions, but the current deportation system “doesn’t have the capacity for mass deportations.”\n\n”There’s no way that I believe they’re going to do this stuff,” Howell said of Republicans on Capitol Hill tasked with providing the resources to increase deportations and investigations into left-wing corruption of the American system.\n\n“Stop putting your faith in Congress,” he concluded.","summary":"No other organization was a bigger thorn in the side of former President Joe Biden’s administration than the Oversight Project.

In a video posted to her YouTube channel on Tuesday, titled \"Stephen Colbert made me cry!\", the comedian recalled her December 2018 \"The Late Show\" appearnce, which took place roughly 18 months after the Trump photo controversy. Griffin said that when booking the interview she requested that Colbert not bring up the Trump photo as she was tired of talking about it and a producer agreed. However, shortly before she was set to go on stage, she says the same person told her Colbert was going to ask her about it. Griffin said she wasn’t happy about it but decided she would try to distract Colbert in order to change the subject. But she said she was shocked by how he kept pressing her on the Trump photo, comparing the experience to being grilled on \"60 Minutes.\" COLBERT CALLS OUT CBS PARENT COMPANY PRESSURING '60 MINUTES' \"It was a line of questioning where I remember thinking, ‘Wow, he has way more of a bias against me and my right to take that photo than I imagined in my worst-case scenario, that I had imagined when I couldn’t sleep the night before because I was half scared and half excited,'\" she said. Griffin said she fought back tears during the interview in order to hide her distress from the audience. \"What was really happening was a bulls-- ambush\" that was \"laced with misogyny,\" she said, claiming Colbert wouldn’t have grilled a male comic in the same way. She accused Colbert of using his platform to punch down against a \"D-list\" celebrity. JIMMY KIMMEL BLAMES LIBERALS 'VICIOUSLY ATTACKING COMEDIANS' FOR TRUMP'S RISE TO POWER While she said she used to have high respect for Colbert, the experience soured her on the comedian. \"For him to be coming at me that way and to see me almost lose it…I have such a low opinion of Stephen Colbert right now,\" Griffin added. \"What a d---,\" she said.

KATHY GRIFFIN TELLS FANS TO SEE HER BEFORE SHE'S PLACED IN TRUMP'S 'INTERNMENT CAMPS' In the 2018 interview, Colbert spent roughly 10 minutes asking Griffin about the photo and the backlash she experienced from it. \"60 million Americans thought I was a member of ISIS,\" Griffin said during the interview. She explained how her professional career suffered and she was allegedly put under federal investigation for conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States. She also defended her right to take the photo under the First Amendment, which Colbert pushed back on. \"There are limits, though, to what you can say about the President of the United States, having specifically to do with harm against the President of the United States,\" Colbert said.

The UK has had to swallow strict national security measures as part of the landmark UK-US trade pact. Although the deal has slashed tariffs on British steel and car exports , a clause was also agreed to stop the UK becoming a \"backdoor\" for Chinese goods entering the American market. It means any drugs exported from Britain to America must now be free from Chinese-made chemicals and components, it is thought. A Government source said: \"We are going to work with the pharmaceutical industry to secure the supply chain.\" The US President has long accused the Communist giant of rigging trade, stealing IP and flooding Western markets with cheap state-backed goods. However, the UK is heavily dependent on Chinese drug factories as around 80 per cent of the chemicals used in global medicine production are sourced from China . Medicines for British patients can still include ingredients from China as the restriction applies only to exports. However, according to The Sun , insiders fear Mr Trump's clause could fuel wider pressure to cut ties with Beijing across the board. China's foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, told the Financial Times : \"Co-operation between states should not be conducted against or to the detriment of the interests of third parties.\" When Mr Trump last week suggested avoiding trade with China would result in substantial savings for the country , critics challenged his logic, questioning the accuracy of his mathematical claims. And campaigners say this clause highlights both the US and the UK must diversify to stop relying on industries in China. Luke de Pulford, of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: “The UK cosplays as tough on China to placate the US, but when it comes to the actual policy, we don’t deliver. The UK is too dependent on Beijing for pharmaceuticals and, like the US, needs to diversify. If US consumers need to be protected from dependency on totalitarian Xi for medicines, so do we.\" UK officials say further talks are ongoing and the government claims Britain will receive “preferential treatment” if Washington imposes new tariffs on drug imports. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson told The Sun: \"We signed a deal with the US in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future. We will discuss supply chains with the US as part of the next phase of negotiations in the weeks and months ahead.\"","summary":"The landmark UK-US trade pact slashed tariffs on British steel and car exports but at a cost it seems - and this include some strict national security measures","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-pressures-britain-cutting-35227828","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35227844.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Keir-StarmerDonald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 00:28:03","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":321420100,"title":"US begins lifting sanctions on Syria, Treasury chief confirms","text":"WASHINGTON, May 15. /TASS/.

Previous winners of the award include Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, actor Michael J. Fox, and NBA great Dwyane Wade.\n\n“They haven’t just entertained generations – they’ve educated, advocated and inspired real change,” Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcia Jayaram, said as she presented the award to The Sesame Workshop at the foundation’s Make Good Famous Summit in Miami Beach, Florida. “And their work hasn’t just been confined to the screen. Through their nonprofit, they’ve expanded their mission globally. They’ve created real world programs that bring education, health and hope to millions of children in over 150 countries.”\n\nSal Perez, the show’s executive producer and a Sesame Workshop vice president, said the organization planned to use the award to let more people know that its nonprofit work extends beyond the TV show.\n\n“We do a lot of work around the world with direct services, trying to provide content for families that talks about some of those harder to talk about subjects, whether it’s trauma, whether it’s homelessness and things of that nature. So this is an opportunity to highlight that kind of work.”\n\nPerez told The Associated Press in an interview before the ceremony that there would be news about Sesame Workshop’s future released “in the coming days.” Last year, Warner Bros. Discovery decided not to renew its deal for new episodes that air on HBO and Max, though episodes will remain on the streaming service until 2027.\n\n“’Sesame Street’ is not going to go away,” Perez said. “It will never go away. It’s obviously been a beloved show for so long.”\n\nHowever, there are changes coming to the new season, which currently has no distribution deal. Perez said the segments on the new season will be longer and “really focused on character,” while also focusing on its audience's emotional well-being and development.\n\n“The more kids want to hang out with our characters on ‘Sesame Street,’ the more they’re going to take in those lessons,” said Perez, adding that there would also be updates to the show's look and feel. The new season will also feature more exploration of the “Sesame Street” neighborhood and a look inside the legendary two-story brownstone at 123 Sesame Street.\n\nThough Sesame Workshop does not currently receive any government funding, Perez urged viewers to support public media, especially following President Donald Trump's recent executive order to cut funding to PBS and NPR. \n\n“We believe in the power that public funding has for children’s media,\" he said. \"I think people should support their local PBS affiliates and support children’s media because it is an entry point for children to really start to see the world outside of their homes.”\n\nJayaram said she felt the time was right to for the Elevate Prize Foundation to stand with The Sesame Workshop and its work.\n\n“This is a foundation that’s about social impact,\" she said. \"So the symbolism of us joining forces with a children’s program is to say that even though our leaders are grown adults, it’s the child in all of us that we need to revive and remember our essential values as humans.”\n\nFamed roommates Bert and Ernie were on hand to receive the award alongside Perez with their trademark banter. “We are so proud to make the Catalyst,” joked Ernie. “One day we'd also like to make the Dog-alist.”\n\nIn a video acceptance, Abby and Elmo took their own swing at explaining the award.\n\n“It’s like a spark that makes good change happen – kinda like magic,” explained Abby.\n\n“Elmo really likes being a catalyst,” said Elmo.\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), initially a backer, is one of dozens of House Democrats who flipped their vote. Doggett, as Sophie Hurwitz reported for Mother Jones, was less concerned about the bill’s text than the way Donald Trump was likely to use it: \n\nOne of the organizations whose nonprofit status Trump wants to terminate, Doggett said, “has protested one of my speeches.”\n\n“Protests are inconvenient,” he said. “The one I had was inconvenient. [But] America is stronger when we protect dissent in all its forms, as long as it is done in a proper way.”\n\n“There has been much made in this debate of the fact that some of us have been switching positions,” he said. “Well, we listen to our constituents.”\n\nKia Hamadanchy, the ACLU’s senior policy counsel, says the measure grants the Secretary of the Treasury “broad and unilateral discretion” to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status “without any due process”—or any evidence beyond the “accusation that they support terrorism.”\n\nHamadanchy calls that an authority that no administration of any party should have, one that “could be weaponized against people across the political spectrum,” particularly by the Trump administration. “They’ve already shown,” Hamadanchy says, “that they want to weaponize things like nonprofit status.”\n\nNonprofits are taking note, too.\n\nDom Kelly, who heads the disability rights group New Disabled South, characterized the legislation as “a continued attempt to silence those who work in opposition to the Trump administration and the right’s extreme agenda.” The bill’s vague, expansive language, Kelly explains, “means that this administration can go after organizations for any reason they want.”\n\nStill, Kelly isn’t backing down: “If they come for us,” they said, “we will fight them with everything we’ve got.”\n\nFor most nonprofits, especially smaller ones, that fight won’t be easy. “Even having to litigate is a huge mess, takes time, causes all sorts of headaches,” Hamadanchy says, offering the example of universities targeted by the Trump administration over student protests.\n\n“A lot of people in Congress conflated student protesters with Hamas, without really any evidence,” he says. “You can imagine a world where the Trump administration tells a university: ‘You let these people protest on your campus? You are providing material support to Hamas.'”\n\nIndeed, the Trump administration has already stripped Columbia’s research funding to the tune of $400 million, ostensibly motivated by allegations of antisemitism following pro-Palestine protests last year. Harvard University has lost more than $2.5 billion in federal support since April, when it balked at Trump’s demands—again largely citing antisemitism claims—for sweeping power over its campus, curriculum, and personnel.\n\nHamadanchy doesn’t think every application of the bill will survive legal challenges, but harm would be done simply by its becoming law: “It basically serves a larger purpose,” he says, “of chilling speech.”","summary":"The &#8220;nonprofit killer&#8221; is back—this time tucked into congressional Republicans&#8217; aggressive new tax proposal, which they&#8217;ve dubbed the &#8220;One, Big, Beautiful Bill.&#8221; For those who forgot: In November, the House of Representatives passed HR 9495, or the “Stop Terror Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act,” which would give the Secretary of the Treasury [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/house-nonprofit-killer-tax-terrorism-support/","image":"https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ProtestSign.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 00:10:12","author":"Henry Carnell,Sophie Hurwitz","authors":["Henry Carnell","Sophie Hurwitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":321415498,"title":"NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani endorsed by ex-‘Squad’ member Jamaal Bowman in move bashed by Jewish activists: ‘Very on brand’","text":"Former US Rep.

Andrew Cuomo, the frontrunner in the crowded Democratic Party primary for mayor, with polls showing the democratic socialist trailing at No. 2.\n\n“With Bowman’s help we not only reach more voters in the Bronx, but expose Cuomo’s record of failure and corruption,” Mamdani said in a statement.\n\nBowman — who represented the 16th Congressional district before he was replaced by moderate Democrat George Latimer — had been aligned with the left-wing “Squad” that includes Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx, Queens) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n\nHe called Mamdani the candidate of the working people and slammed Cuomo as a corporate Democrat.\n\n“Andrew Cuomo is taking money from the same billionaires who support Donald Trump,” said Bowman, a former Bronx educator before running for public office. “We got people like Donald Trump because of people like Andrew Cuomo.”\n\nAlthough Bowman was trounced by Latimer in a Democratic primary in 2024, the ex-“Squad” member handily carried the Bronx portion of the 16th district, including heavy black precincts in the massive Co-Op City housing complex. The complex was the setting for a press conference announcing the endorsement.\n\nMamdani, who is now a Queens assemblyman, called Bowman’s endorsement “historic” and praised him as a “fighter for not only the Bronx but the entirety of New York City.”\n\nBut pro-Israel Jewish activists who claim Bowman is antisemitic said the endorsement will discourage voters from supporting Mamdani.\n\n“Antisemites of a feather flock together,” said Brooklyn Assemblyman Kalman Yeger. “It says something about a candidate when every Jew hater who endorses chooses him.”\n\nIn a statement on X, former Brooklyn Councilman David Greenfield said Mamdani “found the most anti-Israel FORMER elected official in America, who conveniently blamed the Jews for losing his race, and got him to endorse Zohran for Mayor of NYC.\n\n“Very on brand for Zohran,” he said.\n\nBowman’s House tenure was brief but rife with controversy.\n\nHe was censured by the Republican-led House in December 2023 after the fire alarm fiasco in a Capitol Hill office building Sept. 30.\n\nHe later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of raising a false fire alarm and agreed to pay a $1,000 fine and wrote an apology letter to the chief of the US Capitol Police.\n\nMamdani’s campaign declined to comment on Bowman’s criminal conviction.\n\nJewish voters turned on Bowman over his bashing of Israel, which insiders said fueled his landslide primary defeat.\n\nBowman called Israel an “apartheid state” and claimed at a rally that the rapes and child murders reported during Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack on the Jewish state were a “lie” — remarks he later walked back.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had once peddled conspiracy theories related to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks on his personal blog.\n\nBut the ex-congressman is staying politically active.\n\nEarlier this year, he created a “Built to Win” Super PAC aimed at helping elect fellow lefty candidates and defeat pro-Israel candidates.\n\nA Marist Institute College Institute for Public Opinion released Wednesday showed Cuomo with support from 37% of Democrats to 18% for Mamdani.\n\nMamdani led among voters under the age of 45, but Cuomo was the favorite of older voters and black and Latinos, the poll showed.","summary":"Ex-\"Squad\" Rep.

The assessment undermined the rationale for Trump invoking a rarely used 1798 law, the Alien Enemies Act, to allow suspected Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members in the U.S. to be summarily deported without standard due process. Gabbard dismissed Michael Collins, the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council, and council vice chair Maria Langan-Riekhof, both career officials with decades of experience in intelligence analysis, two officials said. “She dismissed these individuals because they were unable to provide unbiased intelligence,” one of the officials said, without elaborating. Gabbard’s deputy chief of staff, Alexa Henning, said in a social media post that they were dismissed “because they politicized intelligence.” A spokesperson for Gabbard, Olivia Coleman, said in an email: “The Director is working alongside President Trump to end the weaponization and politicization of the Intelligence Community.” Last month, the National Intelligence Council, which oversees analyses based on information from the country’s intelligence agencies, produced a memo on the relationship between TdA and the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Citing a consensus from all other intelligence agencies except the FBI, it concluded that the gang does not take orders from or operate in close coordination with the Maduro government. Trump and other administration officials have asserted that the regime directs TdAand cited that as a basis for invoking the Alien Enemies Act, declaring the gang an invading force. The law previously had only been used in wartime. The assessment’s conclusion first became public in a Washington Post report. It’s not known if Collins and Langan-Riekhof personally worked on the assessment, but the leaders of the council usually sign off on significant analyses, a former intelligence official said. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has lobbied Trump to fire some top national security officials, singled out Collins and the National Intelligence Council in a social media post last month. “Why would leakers in the NIC try to undermine President Trump’s efforts to deport Tren De Aragua gang members? . . . The NIC senior officials should be fired.” Loomer took credit for the recent dismissal of the four-star general overseeing the National Security Agency, Gen. Timothy Haugh. Democratic lawmakers condemned the firings, as did former senior intelligence officials, one of whom accused Gabbard of punishing seasoned analysts for providing an assessment that did not back up the president’s agenda. John Brennan, former director of the CIA, said the dismissals are “going to have real reverberations” for employees in the intelligence community. “It’s clearly a signal to tell analysts throughout the intelligence community: ‘you tell the truth, you provide objective analysis, as you’re supposed to be doing, you are running the risk of getting fired,’” Brennan told MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace. He added that Collins and Langan-Riekhof “are two of the most experienced, accomplished, and talented analysts in the entire U.S. intelligence community” who have worked for successive presidents from both parties since the 1990s. The episode suggests that intelligence professionals “have to get in line, that there’s a sense that there needs to be fealty to Donald Trump,” he said. Jonathan Panikoff, who worked as an analyst at the National Intelligence Council, said in a social media post that the organization “is the heartbeat of apolitical US all-source analysis,” drawing on the best intelligence analysts. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an email that Gabbard “is purging intelligence officials over a report that the Trump administration finds politically inconvenient.” Warner added: “Whatever the administration is trying to protect, it’s not our national security.” Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has written a letter to Gabbard demanding she provide information to Congress within a week explaining the firing of the two senior officials. Citing media reports that the officials were sacked due to purported political bias, Himes wrote that it was “an exceptionally serious allegation to make against career intelligence officers” that should be supported by evidence. “I ask that you provide such evidence to the Committee no later than May 21,” he wrote. Himes added that the decision to dismiss the officials from such an important body in the intelligence community should have been communicated to congressional intelligence committees in accordance with statutory requirements.","summary":"The officials fired by Tulsi Gabbard oversaw an assessment contradicting President Trump’s rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/gabbard-fires-intel-officials-oversaw-memo-contradicting-white-house-c-rcna206918","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-tulsi-gabbard-ac-732p-9e770d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 00:05:59","author":"Dan De Luce","authors":["Dan De Luce"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":321415338,"title":"Harvard president taking voluntary pay cut amid Trump funding freezes","text":"Harvard University President Alan Garber plans to take a voluntary pay cut as the school faces nearly $3 billion in slashed federal funding from President Donald Trump’s administration. \n\nGarber will take a 25 percent cut to his salary for the fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, a Harvard spokesperson confirmed.

Duty-free shops on the Canadian side report sales are down by 50 to 80% since Trump returned to the White House. \n\n\"’We're 100% reliant on the travel across the border,’ Barbara Barett, the executive director of Frontier Duty Free Association, says of those stores. ‘Our stores are often pillars of these communities - communities depend on them,’\" she told the BBC.\n\nAnd yet the locals refuse to connect the dots. \n\n“I hope people in Washington will start to understand what they're doing to the people,\" the mayor of Port Huron told the BBC. \"We are not responsible for this, the [federal] government put us in this position and now we have to deal with it respectfully.\"\n\nActually, Port Huron is responsible. St. Clair County voted for Trump 67-32%, for failed GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers 63-33%, and for Republican Rep. Lisa McClain 67-28%. Down the ballot, it is a Republican stronghold. This isn’t an accidental result—it’s the outcome Port Huron voted for. \n\nRelated | West Virginians love Trump—and he's screwing them anyway\n\nFunny how when a Democrat is in the White House, it’s endless investigations into the “Biden Crime Family” and chants of “Let’s Go Brandon.” But when it’s Trump? Suddenly “the government” is some faceless villain. No names, no accountability. Just vague vibes.\n\nHis name is Donald J. Trump—and the very communities he is now hurting happily put him back in power. And it’s the same story in small towns all across that vast border, whether in Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Maine, or elsewhere.\n\nNow, Republican lawmakers—desperate to appease their hurting American constituents—are rushing to fix things with a Band-Aid that doesn’t even acknowledge the wound.\n\n“U.S. lawmakers are proposing a bill that would allow some Canadian snowbirds to stay in the United States longer, in hopes of rebuilding cross-border tourism and supporting local economies,” reported Canadian outlet CTV. “The Canadian Snowbird Visa Act proposes to extend the length of time eligible Canadian citizens aged 50 and over could visit the U.S. without a visa to 240 days, up from the current 182 days that are permitted each year.”\n\nAmong the legislation’s cosponsors are Republican Reps. Elise Stefanik (whose New York district borders Canada), Ken Calvert (whose California district includes Palm Springs—a major Canadian tourist destination), and Laurel Lee (whose Tampa district is a major draw for Canadian snowbirds).\n\nStefanik claims that “providing Canadians who own homes and property in the United States with extra time to visit and boost our economy will help revive Canadian tourism.”\n\nAs if the issue is that Canadians just wish they could spend more time here. No. The problem is they don’t want to come here at all. Not to Disney World. Not to Palm Desert for some golf. Not even for a short jaunt across the border to buy cheap booze.\n\nAllowing them to stay here for two extra months is a meaningless gesture that insults Canadians while ignoring the real problem: Trump.","summary":"Canadians have had enough of Donald Trump’s America, and they’re showing it by selling their U.S. property, vacationing elsewhere, and severely punishing their own country’s homegrown conservatives.

In the years since Floyd’s murder, the organization put $33.2 million “directly into freeing people from cages and resourcing organizations in the fight for racial justice.”\n\nThe organization has also come under criticism from conservative media and others over instances where it has posted bond for someone who went on to reoffend.\n\nLast year, while campaigning for president, Donald Trump told a crowd at a rally in North Carolina that his opponent Kamala Harris had advocated for the fund and mentioned the St. Paul case of convicted murderer Shawn Michael Tillman.\n\nTillman was arrested in April 2022 for indecent exposure stemming from an alleged incident at the Capitol/Rice Street light-rail platform in St. Paul.

Its post-release team attempted to contact Tillman, “as they do all our clients upon release, to offer resources and support,” according to the statement.\n\nDarris said in his Wednesday email that the organization will reevaluate its impact and sustainability after one year.\n\n“We’re proud of the impact our organization has had, and we want to ensure that we’re positioned to support our community until we end pretrial and immigration detention,” he wrote.","summary":"The nonprofit's executive director announced a new focus Wednesday, saying it will move toward “achieving long-term, systemic impact.”","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/05/14/minnesota-freedom-fund-to-stop-bailing-out-jailed-defendants/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20140624__jail_prison_skybox.jpg?w=650&h=433","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:49:50","author":"Nick Ferraro","authors":["Nick Ferraro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":321410802,"title":"Iran willing to sign nuclear deal with Trump if sanctions are lifted","text":"A top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the country is open to a nuclear deal with President Donald Trump if he agrees to drop certain economic sanctions.\n\n Ali Shamkhani told NBC News Wednesday that if the demands of the Iranian regime were met, Iran would be willing to end all nuclear weapons programs and dispose of its stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium.\n\n 'It’s still possible.

You worked for President Biden. Do you think it’s helpful for him to be speaking out right now?” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asked, referring to Biden’s interview on The View last week.\n\n“No. Nada. Never,” Emanuel responded. “I grew up under Bill Clinton’s politics — never stop thinking about tomorrow. That’s backward, not forward.”\n\nEmanuel argued that the Democratic Party should prioritize everyday concerns that resonate with voters — like healthcare, education, and the rising cost of living — rather than internal debates or revisiting the 2024 election.\n\n“I want the focus to be on the 10 million kids whose parents work full-time but still can’t afford healthcare,” he said. “This shouldn’t be about what Joe Biden did or didn’t do—that’s in the past. We need to talk about what matters to the American people: healthcare, the cost of groceries, and their children’s future. I understand the president’s desire to speak out, but that’s not where the party needs to be right now, given the challenges we face.”\n\nThe former Chicago mayor also addressed broader concerns about Democratic messaging and policy direction. \n\nIn a March appearance on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, Emanuel criticized the permissiveness and cultural drift within Democratic politics.\n\n“We’ve gone through five years where people became way too permissive as a culture,” Emanuel said. “Which is why everything is locked up at CVS and Walgreens—that’s a disaster.

In seventh grade, if I had known I could have said ‘they’ and got in the girls’ bathroom, I would have done it.”\n\nEmanuel’s blunt response reflected growing frustrations with Democratic leadership and echoed his ongoing call for the party to refocus on core kitchen-table issues.\n\nDuring The View segment Wednesday, Emanuel candidly responded to reports about Biden failing to recognize actor George Clooney at a 2024 fundraising event. He reiterated that he had privately advised against Biden seeking reelection in 2024.\n\n“How was it received when you said he shouldn’t run?” Griffin asked.\n\n“Does this look subtle or shocked?” he replied dryly. “I’ve told them [both Presidents Clinton and Obama] things they didn’t want to hear. At the end of the day, it’s a decision one person makes. … It has caused real consequences.”\n\nEmanuel ended with a pointed contrast between Democrats and President Donald Trump, whom he accused of using public office for personal gain.\n\n“I’m not interested in the price of Greenland. I’m interested in the price of groceries,” Emanuel said. “We have a person [Trump] using his time in the White House to line his pockets.”","summary":"Former Obama White House chief of staff and U.S. Ambassador Rahm Emanuel sharply criticized former President Joe Biden’s recent public remarks, saying they do more harm than good for Democrats.

At the end of the day, all we've got is each other.”\n\nAnd prior to his song “City of Ruin”, Springsteen referenced Elon Musk and DOGE’s decision to cut funds for USAID and ICE deportations when he said: “There's some very weird, strange, and dangerous s*** going on out there right now. In America they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. This is happening now. In America the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now. \n\n“In my country they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that has led to a more just and plural society. They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. They are defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. \n\n“They are removing residents off American streets and without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now. A majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. \n\n“They have no concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American. The America l've sung to you about for 50 years is real and regardless of its faults is a great country with a great people. So we'll survive this moment. Now, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said, he said ‘in this world there isn't as much humanity as one would like, but there's enough.’ Let’s pray.”\n\nSpringsteen has consistently and vocally opposed Trump. Before last year’s election, he endorsed Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking last October in a video posted to his Instagram account, Springsteen said: “Hi, I’m Bruce Springsteen. Friends, fans and the press have asked me who I’m supporting in this most important of elections.\n\n“And with full knowledge that my opinion is no more or less important than those of any of my fellow citizens, here’s my answer: I’m supporting Kamala Harris for president, and Tim Walz for vice-president, and opposing Donald Trump and JD Vance.”\n\nHe went on to describe Trump at the time as “the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.”\n\nSpringsteen added: “His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again.\n\n“He doesn’t understand the meaning of this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American.”","summary":"The musician told a crowd in Manchester, England that we are living in ‘dangerous times’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bruce-springsteen-donald-trump-corrupt-manchester-b2751268.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/14/23/47/MixCollage-14-May-2025-04-17-PM-1563.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PagkZx8L-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:42:36","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.065},{"id":321410738,"title":"Woke Gavin Newsom TURNS on illegal migrants as bizarre Democrat policy threatens to bankrupt deep blue state","text":"Gavin Newsom is putting new conditions on a program offering healthcare to illegal migrants as the state continues to face a budget crisis - though Newsom claims its all Donald Trump's fault. \n\nCalifornia is facing a $12 billion deficit thanks in part to the progressive liberal - who may have presidential ambitions - policies, including a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. \n\nThe deep blue state was among one of the first states to extend free health care benefits to all poor adults regardless of their immigration status last year, an ambitious plan touted by Newsom to help the nation´s most populous state inch closer to a goal of universal health care. \n\nBut the cost ran $2.7 billion more than the administration had anticipated. The state has more than 1.6 million people without legal status enrolled in its health care program this fiscal year, according to the budget. \n\nUnder Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. \n\nThose who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans, and the changes won't impact children. Newsom didn't say how long the freeze would last.\n\nA spokesman for Newsom told DailyMail.com that these are 'new rules to curtail costs' before laying the blame at the feet of President Trump.\n\n'To be very clear, these proposals are the results of a $16 billion Trump Slump and higher-than-expected health care utilization,' Izzy Gardon said. \n\n'Because of these outside factors, the state must take difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the long-term viability of Medi-Cal for all Californians.' \n\nNewsom in March suggested he was not considering rolling back health benefits for immigrants as the state was grappling with a $6.2 billion Medicaid shortfall. \n\nHe also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. \n\nThe program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.\n\nUnder Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. \n\nThose who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans, and the changes won't impact children. \n\nNewsom didn't say how long the freeze would last.\n\nStarting in 2027, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' on Medi-Cal will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. \n\nThe governor's office said that is in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California's own marketplace. \n\nThere is no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.\n\n'We believe that people should have some skin in the game as it relates to contributions,' Newsom said.\n\nNewsom's office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-2029. \n\nThe Medi-Cal expansion, combined with other factors such as rising pharmacy costs and larger enrollment by older people, has forced California to borrow and authorize new funding to plug the multibillion hole earlier this year. \n\nCalifornia provides free health care to more than a third of its 39 million people.\n\nThe removal of illegal migrants has been one of the key parts of the second term Trump agenda, headlined by 'Border Czar' Tom Homan and 'ICE Barbie' Kristi Noem.\n\nRaids in major cities like Los Angeles come as reports suggest President Trump was underwhelmed by the number of illegal immigrants who have been rounded up and deported in his first months back in office. \n\nNewsom, 57, was among the Democrats' most articulate surrogates last year, even as he brushed off speculation he was seeking the White House and made the case to reelect President Biden. \n\n'I'd love him to run for president on the other side,' Trump said of Newsom last week. \n\nNewsom has clashed with a number of Trump policies but recently offered to work with the president on a $7.5 billion film production tax credit after Trump's stunning proposal to slap a 100 percent tariff on films 'produced in foreign lands.' \n\nHe brought up Newsom in a backhanded way, once again turning his name into an insult by calling him 'Gavin New-scum' while seated alongside new Canadian PM Mark Carney, at an event where Trump softened his push to make Canada the 51st state by saying it 'takes two to tango.'\n\nTrump, 78, started tearing into a high-speed rail project that California voters approved back in 2008, with costs ballooning to an estimated $100 billion. \n\nAs Trump described it in the Oval Office, it is a 'little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin New-scum, the governor of California.' \n\n'He has got that train is the worst cost overrun I've ever seen. It's like totally out of control,' Trump said. \n\nHe complained that it's 'hundreds of billions of dollars for this stupid project that should have never been built.'\n\nPart of the problem includes both the surges of illegal migrants combined with homeless encampments in the state's major cities. \n\nDowntown Los Angeles has been described as 'third world' after shocking footage revealed a homeless encampment with open fires in the street and trash-covered sidewalks in late March.\n\nLA is currently home to more than 46,000 unhoused people, a 10 percent increase on the previous year, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. \n\nHomelessness in downtown LA in particular has exploded since the pandemic, with more than 10,000 more unhoused people on the streets since 2019. \n\nSince 2015 homelessness in the city has increased 70 percent. \n\nServices such as the Midnights Mission, whose main center stands just meters from the shocking video circulated online, have been pushed to the limits of their resources. \n\nThe Mission serves three meals a day to those living on the streets, as well as providing services such as temporary accommodation, a barbershop, and a women's crisis center. \n\nIn just three years female homelessness in LA has increased 55 percent, according to the organization.","summary":"A woke progressive governor of a deep blue state is turning his back on one of his lefty policies and blaming it all on Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713185/woke-gavin-newsom-illegal-migrants-democrat-policy-bankrupt-California.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/15/00/98388441-0-image-m-12_1747265406349.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:41:05","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Outgoing Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin, in a going-away email to his staff, complained about the actions of Disciplinary Counsel Hamilton P. “Phil” Fox III, who serves as chief prosecutor for disciplinary matters for attorneys who are members of the D.C. Bar. “Please know that I will continue to fight against the systemic abuse of our prosecutors by [Public Defender Service], the Judges, and especially the DC Disciplinary Counsel,” Martin wrote in the email to staff. “It is an outrage how they treat us and I will continue the fight against the weaponization of our law licenses against us. Please see the attached — I am taking on Mr. Fox head on. His conduct is personally insulting and professionally unacceptable.” Several outside organizations and members of Congress have sought investigations into Martin over his actions while he was U.S. attorney, and Fox had previously declined to take further steps on at least one of the requests. Most requests sent to Fox's office are turned away, but Martin's letter indicted that at least one probe was moving forward, which has been given a disciplinary docket number: 2025-D047. The investigation is in a non-public stage, and will only become a matter of public record if the office makes a decision to move forward with a disciplinary case against Martin. Fox declined to comment. News of the investigation was first reported by Reuters. Martin's goodbye email was accompanied by a copy of a letter to Judge Anna Blackburne-Rigsby of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in which he complains that Fox sent “signature required paid postage” to his home and office which “prompted questions from my family and work colleagues who had to sign.\" Martin called it an “annoyance” and saying it “pushed the envelope of confidentiality.” He also writes that Fox sent the letter to the intake email box for the U.S Attorney's Office's Civil Division. “To be clear, Mr. Fox is weaponizing his role, responsibilities, and his office against me and this office. He is using a recent bar complaint as his weapon,” Martin wrote in the letter. “I ask that you not only suspend Mr. Fox immediately to investigate his conduct, but also to dismiss this case against me because of his prejudicial conduct.\" The Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group, of which Martin is taking charge, was formed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump and is charged with looking into several issues, including the work of former Special Counsel Jack Smith and the Justice Department’s handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Martin's letter came the same day that former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro took over the role of interim U.S. attorney, after the Senate didn't move forward with confirming Martin to serve on a permanent basis. In a press conference on Tuesday, Martin said that he planned to \"shame\" individuals he said \"did some really bad things to the American people\" even if the Justice Department did not pursue criminal charges. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that posted on Wednesday, Martin said that he doesn't think that prosecuting individuals for criminal wrongdoing is enough, continuing to suggest that he'll use the bully pulpit of the Justice Department to communicate information about uncharged parties. “One of the reasons I say information is so key, you can’t, we can’t win the Article III battle fast enough,” Martin said, referring to courts. “You can’t win it fast enough to get the progress we need.” “So you’re in the courts fighting to get the truth out, fighting to make these things, prosecutions and all, but they take a longer time than just getting the word out, right, getting the information out,” Martin said. “I feel like it’s a different moment in history.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — The incoming director of the Justice Department's \"Weaponization Working Group\" revealed Wednesday he was under investigation by D.C.'s Office of Disciplinary Counsel, accusing the official in charge of investigating bar complaints of \"weaponizing\" his role, according to an letter viewed by NBC News.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trumps-weaponization-chief-accuses-dc-disciplinary-counsel-investigati-rcna206881","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-Ed-Martin-ch-1437-44b2d4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:39:03","author":"Ryan J.

The Russian side will be headed by Vladimir Medinsky, a hardline aide to Putin and ex-culture minister who was involved in 2022 negotiations.\nPutin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov – who had all been rumoured as top negotiators after leading previous talks with the United States – were not named in the delegation.\nZelensky said this week that Putin’s absence would be a clear signal that he was not genuinely interested in peace.\n“I am waiting to see who will arrive from Russia.

If we could end the war, I’d be thinking about that,” he said.\nTrump said he had a packed schedule but added: “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it to save a lot of lives.”\n\nZelensky said this week that Putin skipping the talks would signal an unwillingness to seek peace and should be met with massive Western sanctions and more military aid for Kyiv.\n“This is his war,” Zelensky said on Tuesday. “Therefore, the negotiations should be with him.”\nTrump took office vowing to quickly end the conflict, but has voiced frustration with both Ukraine and Russia over the lack of progress.\nMoscow has in recent weeks snubbed several calls, backed by Ukraine, for an initial 30-day ceasefire.\nDespite the prospect of talks, the two sides’ positions on how the fighting should end remain far apart and there have been few signs either is willing to make concessions.\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who in the past criticised the level of Western support for Ukraine, urged Putin to attend in person in a phone call on Wednesday, his office said.\n“It costs me nothing to say, ‘hey, comrade Putin, go to Istanbul and negotiate, dammit,’” Lula said ahead of the call.\nEuropean leaders also pressed Putin to travel to Turkey.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday that there must not be any settlement in Ukraine in the form of a “dictated peace” from Moscow.\nAddressing parliament, Merz warned of “militarily created facts against Ukraine’s will”, telling lawmakers it was “of paramount importance that the political West does not allow itself to be divided”.\nAmid preparations for the talks, fighting continued to rage.

The ongoing fight has not only pitted Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, against a determined bloc of House Republicans from high-tax blue states; it has also created divisions between the pro-SALT Republicans, undercutting their negotiating leverage and complicating the path to a deal. While some of them are willing to accept an offer from Smith to raise the cap to $30,000, another faction flatly rejects that figure as insufficient. And they’ve grown increasingly frustrated with some of their colleagues for, in their view, settling for a low-ball offer. Those tensions came to a boiling point Tuesday when pro-SALT Republicans met in Speaker Mike Johnson's office to discuss strategy, and asked Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y. — a member of the Ways and Means panel who's supportive of the $30,000 cap — to leave, according to two sources in the room. “She wasn’t invited and is not part of our negotiation. That’s why she was asked to leave,” said one of the sources in the room, who described the moment on condition of anonymity. “Jason Smith said yesterday it wasn’t his job to negotiate with us, so no one understands why he sent her there.” It was a jarring moment of distrust within the faction — a suggestion that Malliotakis was there not to advance their cause but to be a mole for Smith as they were staring him down in a high-stakes negotiation. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., another SALT supporter who sits on the Ways and Means committee, remarked on social media that she also wasn’t invited to the meeting. Hours later, Malliotakis voted in the committee for the bill with the $30,000 cap, saying in a statement that it will “provide much-needed relief for the middle-class and cover 98% of the families in my district.” Tenney also backed the bill. Top House Republicans have highlighted their support for the $30,000 level to suggest that a quartet of other New York Republicans who want a bigger deduction — Reps. Elise Stefanik, Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino — are being unreasonable. But taxes vary by district, which explains why each member has a different level they are willing to stomach for the deduction. The 2017 tax law Republicans are now seeking to extend imposed a $10,000 cap for state and local tax deductions. Those four New York Republicans are so far sticking together and have the power to sink the entire bill in the narrow House majority, where Johnson has just three votes to spare. Stefanik, a member of Johnson’s leadership team who has had an icy relationship with the speaker as of late, has taken a lead role in the talks. Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., who represents one of the highest-taxed districts in the country, has also been aligning closely with the group of New York Republicans. Now it’s up to Johnson to cut a deal and appease the holdouts — many of them from swing districts that will decide which party controls the chamber in the 2026 midterm elections — on the House floor. Asked about the incident at the meeting Tuesday, Malliotakis told NBC News in a statement: “As the only SALT Caucus member on Ways and Means, all I know is they can sit and negotiate with themselves all they want but there will be no changes unless I and the committee agree.” Malliotakis said that while everyone needs to advocate for their districts, her goal is to reach a resolution and “deliver the one, big, beautiful bill for America.” Later, the Staten Island Republican said she huddled with Johnson, Smith and other Ways and Means Committee members “for hours” Tuesday night to try to find a path forward on SALT. “I think there’s room for some better deal, but the window is closing,” Malliotakis told reporters. “The longer this takes and the closer to Memorial Day we get, the low-sodium diets of many of my colleagues on Ways and Means is growing.” Smith’s office and Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment. But the speaker has publicly insisted that they will reach a deal on SALT, although he acknowledged it may take the weekend to get there. Johnson said he is hosting a meeting Thursday morning between pro-SALT Republicans and some members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who don’t want to raise the SALT cap any further unless they get steeper cuts to Medicaid in return. Tensions flare As a deal has remained elusive, members of the SALT Caucus have been publicly aiming their fire at Smith, who they believe was trying to jam them by plowing ahead with the committee's markup of its portion of the broader package, although it’s not unusual for hot-button issues to be punted to leadership. Still, some pro-SALT Republicans wanted Smith to delay this week's markup to give them more time to work out a solution, and the speaker asked if Smith could accommodate that request, according to two Republican members and another GOP source familiar with the matter. But the markup proceeded as planned. There was also another tense moment prior to the markup, when Smith briefed pro-SALT Republicans on his plan to move ahead with the $30,000 cap. During a Monday video meeting, Smith told his colleagues it wasn’t his job to negotiate with the SALT Caucus Republicans, but the speaker’s job, as NBC News previously reported. Smith explained that his bill reflects the will of his committee, not of the SALT Caucus, the sources said. “Someone should go ask the speaker how he would classify this as a negotiation when his own chair says: ‘I don’t have to negotiate with anybody, I just have to negotiate with my committee,’” Lawler told reporters. “His chair should be reminded that he wouldn’t have a f---ing gavel without the members of the SALT Caucus.” The group is declining to publicly state its demands, other than wanting to raise the cap higher than the current proposal. Behind the scenes, though, multiple GOP sources said the group is pushing for a $40,000 cap for individuals and $80,000 cap for couples. But that would be expensive and steer funds away from tax policies with broader GOP support, both in the House and the Senate. As negotiations drag on, SALT members have tried to draw more attention to their pet issue by handing out packets of salt outside the speaker’s office and wearing salt shaker pins that say: “Feelin’ Salty.” “We’re going to continue to talk with the speaker, especially,” LaLota said. “Unfortunately, the Ways and Means Committee has refused to really negotiate with us in good faith. We’re discussing these matters with the speaker.” It’s an uncomfortable situation for just about all Republicans involved. None of them wants to be seen as standing in the way of Trump’s agenda. But SALT is such a defining issue in their districts — a reason some of their predecessors lost re-election after imposing the $10,000 cap — that they could pay a political price if voters think they accepted a half-baked deal. Stefanik and Lawler are also eyeing runs for governor in New York, making it even more politically imperative to act. LaLota said he isn’t concerned about the pushback outside Long Island. “I’m here to make my constituents happy,” he said just off the House floor. “That’s my priority.” In another sign that GOP leaders are peeling off key votes, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who also represents a high-tax area, said he supports the $30,000 offer — and encouraged colleagues to be willing to compromise. “They’re fighting for their constituents. I understand they have some very high taxes. So do we in New Jersey. I’m trying to be mindful of actually getting this big, beautiful bill done, and one of the ways is we’re all going to have to give in a little bit,” he said. “So we have folks from red states that don’t want to do a penny, don’t even want to do the $10,000 that was there. We’ve got folks from other states that want $100,000 or $200,000. Neither extreme, in my mind, is where we’re going to go,” he added. “It’s going to be somewhere in between. The SALT fight has also created tensions between more moderate Republicans and the far right of the conference. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., complained about the SALT push from her colleagues and singled out Lawler on social media, saying he “usually isn’t the guy in the conference with the best ideas.” Lawler hit back at Greene on X, saying “shockingly, the ‘Jewish Space Laser’ lady once again doesn’t have a clue what she is talking about.” He later told reporters he is not going to change his mind just “because Marjorie Taylor Greene throws a hissy fit.”","summary":"House Republicans are locked in a tense standoff over how to tackle SALT, a sticky issue that could make or break the party's big bill for Trump’s agenda.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-tensions-escalate-boiling-point-salt-tax-fight-trumps-big-b-rcna206768","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-elise-stefanik-Nicole-Malliotakis-seamless-2-up-split-3x2-ac-719p-d13c1c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:28:05","author":"Melanie Zanona,Sahil Kapur","authors":["Melanie Zanona","Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":321416124,"title":"US suspends preparations for G20 summit – WaPo","text":"The White House National Security Council has instructed US federal agencies to suspend preparations for the G20 summit in Johannesburg, as President Donald Trump continues to accuse South Africa of “genocide,” The Washington Post reported on Wednesday.\n\nCiting two people familiar with the matter, the Post said the move aligns with Trump’s earlier threat to boycott the November meeting over what he called a campaign of prosecution against South Africa’s white minority.\n\nPretoria has drawn international attention since passing a law in January permitting the expropriation of land without compensation – most of which is currently owned by white farmers.

The designated national defense areas are overseen by U.S. Army commands out of Fort Bliss in the El Paso area in Texas and Fort Huachuca in Arizona.\n\nThe novel national security charges against immigrants who enter through those militarized zones carry a potential sentence of 18 months in prison on top of a possible six-month sentence for illegal entry. The full implications are unclear for migrants who pursue legal status through separate proceedings in federal immigration court.\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking to accelerate mass removals of immigrants in the country illegally and third-country deportations, including Venezuelans sent to an El Salvador prison amid accusations of gang affiliation. The administration has deployed thousands of troops to the border, while arrests have plunged to the lowest levels since the mid-1960s.\n\nThe federal public defender’s office in Las Cruces indicates that roughly 400 cases had been filed in criminal court there as of Tuesday as it seeks dismissal of the misdemeanor and petty misdemeanor charges for violating security regulations and entering restricted military property. Court records show that federal prosecutors in Texas — where a National Defense Area extends about 60 miles from El Paso to Fort Hancock — last week began filing the military security charges as well.\n\nLas Cruces-based federal Magistrate Judge Gregory Wormuth is asking for input from federal prosecutors and public defense attorneys on the standard of proof for the trespassing charges “given the unprecedented nature of prosecuting such offenses in this factual context.”\n\nPublic defenders say there needs to be proof that immigrants knew of the military restrictions and acted “in defiance of that regulation for some nefarious or bad purpose.”\n\nNew Mexico-based U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison, appointed in April, says hundreds of “restricted area” signs have been posted in Spanish and English to warn that entry is prohibited by the Department of Defense along New Mexico’s nearly 180-mile stretch of border.\n\nIn court filings, Ellison has said there’s no danger of ensnaring innocent people when it comes to immigrants who avoid ports of entry to cross the border in willful violation of federal law — and now military regulations.\n\nACLU attorney Rebecca Sheff said basic freedoms are at risk as the government flexes its power at the border and restricts civilian access.\n\n“The extension of military bases … it’s a serious restriction, it’s a serious impact on families that live in the border area,” she said.\n\nThe Department of Justice has warned Wormuth against issuing an advisory opinion on legal standards for trespassing in the military area.\n\n“The New Mexico National Defense Area is a crucial installation necessary to strengthen the authority of service members to help secure our borders and safeguard the country,” Ellison said in a court briefing.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico expressed concern Wednesday in a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that anyone may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for entering a 170-square-mile area along the border previously overseen by the Department of Interior and frequently used for recreation and livestock ranching.\n\nHegseth has emphasized a hard-line approach to enforcement.\n\n“Let me be clear: if you cross into the National Defense Area, you will be charged to the FULLEST extent of the law,” he said in a post on the social platform X.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas, contributed.","summary":"Several hundred immigrants have been charged with unauthorized access to a newly designated militarized zone along the southern U.S. border.","url":"https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/05/14/military-border-zone-spurs-charges-against-hundreds-of-migrants/","image":"https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/K37Y2FLGAZDFBFVPOQZQE23KWE.jpg?width=1200&auth=1667b2167177565bc6192af3ac7d0aa2efe80d3a3da5a4cfbe025c9eb19e96e3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:24:00","author":"Morgan Lee","authors":["Morgan Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":321415500,"title":"Gov.

Tim Walz and other Dem leaders are fanning the flames of speculation that President Trump is planning to pardon Derek Chauvin — the cop convicted of killing George Floyd — despite the president previously saying he hadn’t heard of efforts to grant a reprieve. \n\nSources close to the Department of Justice told The Post Wednesday that they had also heard nothing about a Chauvin pardon.\n\nThat didn’t stop Walz, Kamala Harris’ 2024 running-mate, from weighing in on online rumors. \n\nHe told reporters this week the Trump administration hasn’t signaled granting clemency to Chauvin, but argued, “With this presidency, it seems like that might be something they would do.”\n\n“If Donald Trump exercises his constitutional right to do so, whether I agree — and I strongly disagree with him — if he issues that pardon we will simply transfer Derek Chauvin to serve out his 22-and-a-half years in prison in Minnesota,” Walz said, per the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nMinneapolis Community Safety Commissioner Toddrick Barnette also made clear the city was ready for anything.\n\n“Since 2020, we’ve overhauled our emergency management plans and out of an abundance of caution are planning for any eventuality,” he said.\n\nHowever, even if Trump does pardon Chauvin, the ex Minneapolis officer would not be freed. \n\nHe was convicted of Floyd’s 2020 killing — which sparked protests and riots across the country — in both state and federal courts, so he would merely be transferred from federal custody to a Minnesota state prison.\n\nWhen Trump was asked by reporters at the White House about letting Chauvin off in March, he replied “No, I haven’t even heard about it.”\n\nUnrest over the murder of Floyd, who was black, resulted in weeks of protests and billions of dollars of property destruction. In Minneapolis, the local police precinct was burned down by rioters.\n\nChauvin pleaded guilty to federal charges tied to Floyd’s death in 2021 and was also convicted on state murder and manslaughter charges.\n\n“I really don’t know why you did what you did,” a federal judge told Chauvin during his sentencing in 2022.\n\n“To put your knee on a person’s neck until they expired is simply wrong. … Your conduct is wrong and it is offensive.”\n\nUnder Trump’s first term, his Justice Department opened the civil rights probe into Chauvin.\n\nSome MAGA figures have pushed for Trump to grant Chauvin a pardon.\n\n“I strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison,” Georgia Rep.

He is serving 28 years for voluntary manslaughter.\n\n'I don't think he's worried because he's gonna be federal, and if he gets convicted, Trump's gonna pardon him.\n\n'I think he's got some favors with the government. I think they're gonna show him a little leeway.'\n\nThe shock claim sparked an incredulous reaction from host Chris Cuomo, who asked: 'You think the President of the United States would pardon Sean Combs for sex trafficking?'\n\nKnight argued that Trump 'pardoned Michael Harris' in 2021 - a music executive who was imprisoned for crack dealing, kidnapping, and attempted murder. Trump granted Harris clemency during his first presidential term.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs longtime rival Suge Knight sensationally warned President Donald Trump would pardon the disgraced music executive if he's convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering\n\nKnight, 59, was the CEO of Death Row Records while Diddy, 54, was the CEO of rival company Bad Boy Entertainment\n\n'They don't care about that. It's all about what's in it... what the power of the people want. Trump's not scared.'\n\nDiddy is facing life behind bars if he's convicted, and has been awaiting trial in the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn since his arrest in September.\n\nTrump and Diddy have been pictured together on several occasions over the past two decades, largely owing to the fact they both ran in elite New York City circles. \n\n'Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he works very hard,' Diddy said of Trump in October 2015. By 2020, Diddy's loyalties had shifted and he endorsed Joe Biden.\n\nSo far, jurors have heard harrowing testimony from the music mogul's ex, Cassie, as well as a male escort.\n\nIn humiliating detail, she recounted a turbulent 10-year relationship with Combs that she said was consumed by violence and his obsession with a form of voyeurism where 'he was controlling the whole situation.'\n\nDiddy's defense says he is guilty of domestic violence, but not of sex-trafficking or racketeering, and that the government is targeting him for his sexual preferences. \n\nBut Knight warned Diddy is a powerful man with friends in high places, stating: 'I'm sure somebody's going to talk to one or two of those jurors, and all you need is one of them.'\n\nDiddy is facing five charges relating to allegations he coerced women into drugged-up group sexual encounters he called 'freak-offs,' and kept them in line with physical violence\n\nTrump and Diddy have been pictured together on several occasions over the past two decades, largely owing to the fact they both ran in elite New York City circles\n\n'Puffy's not a dummy,' Knight said in a phone call from prison.

Sean drove over there.... I cried, said don't do something stupid,' Cassie said.\n\n'It was like I wasn't even there. They put on a bunch of black clothes, went in the safe, grabbed guns.\n\n'Next thing I knew they were in the SUV just whipping down there. I saw them get dressed and leave the house.'\nThe tension between Knight and Combs escalated when two of their star rappers, Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., were killed in separate drive-by shootings; Knight was in the same car and shot at during Sharkur's assassination, and allegations that Diddy had ordered a $1 million hit on Shakur have surfaced in the last year.\n\nCassie VenturaDiddy\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRap mogul's bizarre prediction that Trump will pardon Diddy if he's convicted\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The imprisoned co-founder of Death Row Records made the bombshell allegations on Wednesday, hours after Diddy's ex Cassie Ventura addressed the duo's feud in court.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14713179/suge-knight-diddy-pardoned-trump-theory.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/14/23/98388559-0-image-a-28_1747263295397.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:22:00","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":321414572,"title":"Trump’s Middle East trip formalizes his rebuke of the Republican Party’s ‘neocons’","text":"Donald Trump touched down in Qatar on Wednesday as he began the second leg of his Middle East tour, the first official foreign trip of his second presidency.\n\nBut it was his remarks on Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that resonated across the US foreign policy sphere as the Republican president blasted “interventionalists” on both sides of the American political spectrum — a message that was at once a rebuke of three living former presidents and much of the traditional Washington establishment.\n\nIn a speech to a US-Saudi investment forum, the president delivered the clearest vision yet of what his Middle East policy will look like in a second term — the departure from a status quo that governed how the US does business and forges partnerships in the region. His remarks rejected any notion of giving credit to past US or European leaders who’d left their successive stamps on the region in a condemnation that was reminiscent of the screeds he delivered against the Iraq War during his first run for the presidency in 2015-2016.\n\n“This great transformation [of the Middle East] has not come from Western interventionists … giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs,” Trump declared. “The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called ‘nation-builders,’ ‘neocons,’ or ‘liberal non-profits,’ like those who spent trillions failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad, so many other cities.”\n\nHe went further: “In the end, the so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more nations than they built — and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.” \n\nWith those jabs, the US president capped off a dynamic that has emerged through his first 100 days in office, a time span defined so far by the rapid-fire DOGE-ification of the federal government and turmoil that has eaten away at the unity of Donald Trump’s White House team from within. At the beginning of May, the president announced a personnel shift long speculated to be in the making: he ousted Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, moving the former congressman to a new posting as United Nations ambassador.\n\nSeen as the most neoconservative foreign policy hawk in the White House, Waltz’s ouster as national security adviser and departure from conversations that administration principles have about military action was thought at the time to be part of a broader shakeup marginalizing those voices within the second Trump White House. That now seems to be verifiably the case, as Waltz’s deputies were caught up in a hunt for disloyal staffers undertaken by activist Laura Loomer and they appear to be on the back foot in every regard.\n\nThe president’s condemnation of “neocons” in his party comes as his administration conducts the first direct talks with Iran held by American officials dating back to his first term, when (at the urging of those same “neocons”) Trump tore up the JCPOA deal hashed out by his predecessor, Barack Obama, intending to constrain Iran’s nuclear program. Trump is now pursuing a deal along those lines, with talks having proceeded through multiple rounds. The US president has praised Iran as “acting very intelligently” and being “reasonable” during negotiations, causing headaches for Washington hawks supportive of his first-term “maximum pressure” policy.\n\nHis team also ended US military strikes targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen, where the militant group controls the capital and much of the surrounding territory. Houthi attacks on U.S. ships broke out again earlier this year with the breakdown of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but the US president now says that his administration received assurances that strikes on shipping lanes would end if American bombing ceased. \n\nTrump has even bucked Israel as he has for months resisted calls from Jerusalem to support Israeli military action against Iranian nuclear sites and declined to retaliate against the Houthis for an attack on Ben Gurion airport. On Tuesday, he announced the end of sanctions on Syria, a development Israel’s government opposed.\n\nAll of this is to say, Trump’s break from the Washington foreign policy consensus that has engulfed every living president is producing a real environment for change. \n\nIn Ukraine, a ceasefire is potentially on the horizon as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a team of Russian officials prepare to meet Thursday in Turkey for peace talks. Trump and his party have railed against the billions in U.S. munitions sent to aid Ukraine, while the president himself vowed that he could reach an agreement to end the conflict that broke out in 2022 and has since killed hundreds of thousands. The actual process has taken longer, but has reached the first real potential for a resolution since fighting began three years ago.\n\nWith Trump bleeding some support at home thanks to the chaos of his tariff policies and cost-cutting at the federal government, politicking across Ukraine and the Middle East seems to be areas where the president sees an opportunity for significant wins tied to his trademark dealmaking brand.\n\nHow those deals turn out could end up defining much of the legacy of his second presidency.","summary":"Republican president blasted ‘interventionalists’ on both sides of the American political spectrum during Riyadh speech","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-saudi-arabia-waltz-iran-b2751258.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/14/23/29/GettyImages-2214285364.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:19:22","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":321411676,"title":"Trump move to end Syria sanctions catches his own administration by surprise","text":"When US President Donald Trump announced in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that he would lift all sanctions on Syria, the decision – which will boost a country devastated by 13 years of war – took many in the region by surprise.\nIt also caught some in his own administration off guard.\nIn Washington, senior officials at the US State Department and Treasury Department scrambled to understand how to cancel the sanctions, many of which have been in place for decades, according to four American officials familiar with the matter.\nThe White House had issued no memorandum or directive to State or Treasury sanctions officials to prepare for the unwinding and did not alert them that the president’s announcement was imminent, one senior US official told Reuters.\nThe sudden removal of the sanctions appeared to be a classic Trump move – a sudden decision, a dramatic announcement and a shock not just for allies but also some of the very officials who implement the policy change.\nAfter the announcement, officials were confused about exactly how the administration would unwind the layers of sanctions, which ones were being eased and when the White House wanted to begin the process.\n\nBy the time Trump met interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, officials at State and Treasury were still unsure how to proceed, the senior official said.\n“Everyone is trying to figure out how to implement it,” said one US official in reference to the president’s announcement.\nFollowing the ousting of former president Bashar al-Assad late last year, officials from both State and Treasury had drafted memos and options papers to help guide the government on lifting Syria sanctions if and when the administration chose to do so.\nBut senior White House and national security officials, as well as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have for months debated whether to ease sanctions, given Sharaa’s former ties with al-Qaeda. The Syrian leader severed ties with the group in 2016.\nBefore Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia, there was no clear indication – at least to the officials inside State and Treasury working on sanctions – that the president had made a decision, the senior US official said.\nThe State Department and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA White House official said that Turkey and Saudi Arabia had asked Trump to lift the sanctions and to meet with Sharaa. In his announcement, Trump said that he did so to give Syria a chance at a better future.\nThe easing of sanctions on Syria does not appear to be imminent.\nA White House readout of Trump’s meeting with the Syrian leader said the president asked Syria to adhere to several conditions in exchange for sanctions relief, including telling all foreign terrorists to leave Syria, deporting “Palestinian terrorists” and helping the US prevent the resurgence of Isis.\n\nRemoving sanctions is rarely straightforward, often requiring close coordination between multiple different agencies and Congress.\nBut it is particularly challenging in Syria’s case, given the layers of measures cutting it off from the international banking system and barring many international imports.\nThe US first put the country on its state sponsor of terror list in 1979 and since then has added additional sets of sanctions, including several rounds following the country’s 2011 uprising against Assad.\nEdward Fishman, a former US official and the author of the book Chokepoints, said the unwinding of Syria sanctions, which were imposed under a mix of executive orders and statutes, could take months to ease. He noted, however, that the Treasury Department has practice from sanctions relief provided to Iran as part of the nuclear deal in 2015.\nComplicating the task are sanctions imposed under the “Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act”, also known as the “Caesar Act”, which was passed in 2019 and extended late last year just after Syria’s government fell. The act imposed stiff sanctions not just on Assad’s government but also secondary sanctions on outside companies or governments that worked with it.\nOverturning the bill would require congressional action, but it includes a provision allowing the president to suspend the sanctions for national security reasons. Trump could also issue a general licence suspending some or all of the sanctions.\nFishman said he would be surprised if every single sanction was lifted as part of Trump’s order, adding that some specific people or entities in Syria sanctioned for specific behaviour-based reasons, such as support for a terrorist group, may not be removed from the sanctions list.","summary":"The very officials who’d be responsible for implementing the policy change were not warned before the US president made his announcement.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3310383/trump-move-end-syria-sanctions-catches-his-own-administration-surprise","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/15/072a5ed4-7bcc-43e0-a973-ebbbb94c75c1_cde94d2e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:18:10","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":321412926,"title":"RFK Jr. is making Republicans anxious again: From the Politics Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.

RFK Jr. and his ‘MAHA’ agenda are making some Republicans nervous By Allan Smith During the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump said he would allow Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “go wild” on health, food and medicine. But now, three months into Kennedy’s tenure as health and human services secretary, some Republicans want Trump to rein him and his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda in. They’re concerned Kennedy's efforts could hurt them in the midterm elections by raising costs for farmers and consumers as voters say prices remain their top concern. Here’s how one Republican strategist working on 2026 races put it: “It’s time to start to give RFK some handcuffs.” MAGA split: There’s a divide between conservatives excited about Trump’s deregulatory and tax-cut agenda versus a new right that favors protectionism, tax increases on the rich and price limits on prescription drugs, which Trump unveiled Monday in an executive order. Kennedy’s mission is at the forefront of this split. The Cabinet secretary — who declared “sugar is poison” — has launched a war against the food industry, moving to phase out synthetic food dyes and artificial food additives and prevent food stamps from being used on soda and candy. As part of his “MAHA commission” to investigate chronic disease, he pledged to probe any connection with processed foods or pesticides. And Kennedy has gone on a nationwide tour to promote state legislation he sees as critical in getting food companies to negotiate with him. Concern on Capitol Hill: Some Republican lawmakers on Wednesday expressed concern with Kennedy’s efforts at a House hearing. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., pushed back against banning synthetic dyes, saying they have “been deemed safe for many years,” to which Kennedy responded “good science” has linked them to neurological injury and cancer. At the same hearing, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a former dentist, questioned Kennedy’s anti-fluoride push. New poll: An internal poll conducted last month by the Tyson Group, a GOP-aligned data firm, and Plymouth Union Public Research of 813 likely Republican primary voters found nearly 60% would be less likely to support a candidate for governor or state legislator if they “sided with RFK jr. on food regulation, knowing it could undermine” Trump “and make food more expensive.” But the survey also showed some of Kennedy’s and MAHA’s strengths with Republicans. Notably, more than 40% of likely Republican primary voters said siding with RFK Jr. even at Trump’s expense would make them more likely to vote for a candidate. An Economist/YouGov poll last month found that 42% of U.S. adults view Kennedy favorably — virtually in-line with Trump and higher than Vice President JD Vance and fellow Cabinet secretaries Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick and Kristi Noem. Read more from Allan → More on RFK Jr.: During his appearance before a House committee, Kennedy sidestepped a question about vaccines and whether he would choose to vaccinate his children today against a number of diseases, saying, “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.” Read the full story from Berkeley Lovelace Jr. and Megan Lebowitz. Trump's Persian Gulf odyssey Analysis by Andrea Mitchell President Donald Trump’s tour of the Persian Gulf this week has proved to be more consequential in reshaping the region’s U.S. foreign policy than anyone could have imagined. When Trump made Saudi Arabia the first stop on his first official foreign trip of his second term, it was thought that he would also visit Israel, as he did in his first term. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to Trump’s willingness to hold direct talks with Iran — and Israel’s determination to oppose a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip — are at cross-purposes with the president’s evolving vision for the region. The visit also produced a commitment for hundreds of billions of dollars of business investment by the Saudis in the U.S. And the trip came against the backdrop of Trump family’s ongoing real estate, crypto and golf business ventures in the region. What is more surprising this week is Trump’s lifting of sanctions on Syria and meeting with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the new leader of the post-Bashar al-Assad Assad regime. The Biden administration, ever cautious, waited until European diplomats had flocked to Damascus before sending a mid-level diplomat to meet with al-Sharaa, a former leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is linked to both the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. But Trump was pressed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Saudi de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to bolster the fledgling Syrian regime, whose country has come under repeated military attack from Israel and internal domestic factions. As Trump said, “Oh, what I do for the crown prince.” His lavish arrival in Riyadh — greeted by the crown prince and his limousine escorted by American flag-carrying riders on Arabian horses — was a far cry from the muted reception for then-President Joe Biden in 2022. But Biden had told me during a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2019 he would make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” state over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. In contrast, when the CIA concluded that Khashoggi’s death was most likely ordered by the crown prince, Trump repeatedly questioned the intelligence and suggested we might never really know the truth. This week, Trump has shown both a proclivity for royal welcomes and an ability to pivot toward unexpected diplomatic initiatives with a foreign policy that’s both high-wire and deeply personal.

that Qatar is giving the Trump administration a luxury Boeing 747 jet free of charge, to temporarily replace Air Force One.\n\n“No one gives someone a $400 million dollar jet for free without expecting anything in return,” Clinton wrote in a post on X. “Be serious.”\n\nClinton’s post comes after “sources familiar with the proposed arrangement” told ABC News that the Trump administration reportedly is in talks “to accept” the luxury jet, which will “initially be transferred to the United States Air Force.”\n\nPrior to Trump leaving office in 2029, ownership of the luxury jet, which has been described as “a flying palace,” will be transferred over to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation:\n\nThe plane will initially be transferred to the United States Air Force, which will modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet the U.S. military specifications required for any aircraft used to transport the president of the United States, multiple sources familiar with the proposed arrangement said.\nThe plane will then be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation no later than Jan. 1, 2029, and any costs relating to its transfer will be paid for by the U.S. Air Force, the sources told ABC News.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump previously suggested that the Trump administration is preparing to accept the luxury Boeing jet from Qatar as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE,” adding that the “very public and transparent transaction” bothers Democrats.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, in his book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, Peter Schweizer detailed “explosive revelations about Clinton’s tenure as Sec. of State and the influx of hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation”:\n\nYet as media outlets across the ideological spectrum have confirmed and verified the book’s explosive revelations about Clinton’s tenure as Sec. of State and the influx of hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation, the nation has learned much it did not know. Subsequent reporting by national news outlets has expanded on the book’s findings using its investigative methodology.\n\nSeveral outlets such as the New York Times, Huffington Post, and New York Magazine released “Clinton Cash-related revelations” since Schweizer’s book was released, such as: how the Clinton’s had “Bagged at Least $3.4 Million for 18 Speeches Funded by Keystone Pipeline Banks” or how the “Clinton Foundation ‘Strong-Armed’ Charity Watchdog Group.”\n\nIn response to Clinton’s post, several people took to social media to point out that the Clinton Foundation had accepted millions of dollars in donations from countries such as Qatar.\n\n“Cry me a river @HillaryClinton,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) wrote in a post on X. “Tell that to the mega-donors, including Qatar, who gave hundreds of millions of $$ to the Clinton Foundation. Didn’t seem to bother you then.”\n\n“What did Qatar want from you?” Jerry Dunleavy, a chief investigative correspondent with Just The News, wrote in a post showing a screenshot from a Reuters article in which it was revealed that the Clinton Foundation had confirmed that it “accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar” while Clinton had served as Secretary of State.\n\n“Oh you would know how it works wouldn’t you?” Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle wrote in a post.\n\n“Nobody donates millions to the Clinton Foundation without expecting something in return,” another person wrote. “Be serious.”\n\nWhile reports have surfaced regarding the Trump administration in talks to accept the luxury jet from Qatar, Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s Media Attaché to the U.S., issued a statement claiming that the reports were “inaccurate” and added that the “possible transfer” of a jet to the U.S. was “under consideration.”\n\n“Reports that a jet is being gift by Qatar to the United States government during the upcoming visit of President Trump are inaccurate,” Al-Ansari said in his statement. “The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.”","summary":"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was criticized over comments she made accusing President Donald Trump of pay-for-play regarding reports that Qatar is giving the Trump administration a luxury Boeing 747 jet free of charge, to temporarily replace Air Force One.\n\n\nThe post Hillary Clinton Slammed for Accusing Trump of Pay-for-Play over Qatar&#8217;s Luxury Jet Gift appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/14/hillary-clinton-slammed-for-accusing-trump-of-pay-for-play-over-qatars-luxury-jet-gift/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/Hillary-and-Bill-Clinton-Foundation-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:13:48","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":321411008,"title":"Trump's deals in the Middle East are ‘welcome news’ for the US economy, says Brit Hume","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report May 14, 2025 06:35 \n\n Trump's deals in the Middle East are ‘welcome news’ for the US economy, says Brit Hume \n ‘All-Star’ panelists Brit Hume, Hugh Hewitt and Susan Page discuss President Donald Trump’s economic deals in the Middle East on ‘Special Report.’\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORT","summary":"‘All-Star’ panelists Brit Hume, Hugh Hewitt and Susan Page discuss President Donald Trump’s economic deals in the Middle East on ‘Special Report.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372817282112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/dac4c711-7f29-47a5-b204-5b14be3924b6/8235172a-4a1f-4bcb-983e-5f00ad011fb9/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:13:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":321406426,"title":"‘Deeply creepy’: Enormous brooding banner of Trump  now hangs next to Lincoln outside Department of Agriculture","text":"There’s a new addition to the streetscape outside the Department of Agriculture building in Washington, D.C., causing a stir online.\n\nLooming down from the pillared front of the neo-classical facade is an enormous, brooding picture of President Donald Trump, adapted from his official presidential portrait.\n\nAnother banner further along the front of the building depicts President Abraham Lincoln.

sidang kemuncak bersama Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump di ibu negara Arab Saudi, Riyadh pada Rabu, lapor Anadolu Ajansi.\n\nSidang Kemuncak Gabungan Negara Teluk (GCC)-AS itu diadakan semasa lawatan serantau Trump ketika ini, yang merupakan lawatan pertamanya ke luar negara sejak memegang jawatan pada Januari lepas.\n\nDalam ucapannya pada sidang berkenaan, Putera Mahkota Arab Saudi, Putera Mohammed bin Salman menyifatkan hubungan dengan Washington sebagai 'strategik'.\n\n\"Kami bekerjasama dengan AS untuk meredakan situasi di Gaza, menamatkan konflik dan mencari penyelesaian menyeluruh kepada isu Palestin,\" titah baginda.\n\nTentera Israel terus melancarkan serangan kejam di Semenanjung Gaza sejak Oktober 2023, yang telah meragut lebih 52,900 nyawa rakyat Palestin, kebanyakannya wanita dan kanak-kanak.\n\n\"Kami menegaskan penghormatan kami terhadap kedaulatan Syria dan menyokong usaha kerajaan untuk mencapai keselamatan. \n\n\"Kami memuji keputusan Presiden Trump untuk menarik balik sekatan terhadap Syria yang akan meringankan penderitaan rakyat negara itu,\" titah baginda lagi.\n\nAmir Kuwait Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah pula menyeru usaha masyarakat antarabangsa dipertingkat bagi memastikan keselamatan dan kestabilan Syria.\n\nKatanya, pendekatan itu penting bagi memelihara kedaulatan dan integriti wilayahnya, menamatkan penderitaan rakyat, serta menghentikan campur tangan asing dalam hal ehwal negara itu.\n\nBaginda turut memuji pengumuman Trump mengenai pemansuhan sekatan terhadap Syria.\n\nPada Selasa, Trump dalam ucapannya di Forum Pelaburan Arab Saudi-AS 2025 di Riyadh berkata beliau akan mengarahkan pemansuhan sekatan 'zalim dan melumpuhkan' terhadap Syria bagi memberi peluang kepada Syria 'meraih kegemilangan'.\n\nRaja Bahrain Raja Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa turut memuji usaha diplomatik berkesan Trump dalam mencapai keamanan dan kestabilan di Asia Barat serta dunia amnya.\n\n\"Kami menghargai keputusan Trump menarik balik sekatan ekonomi ke atas Syria dan berharap dapat memperluaskan kerjasama untuk mewujudkan rantau yang selamat, stabil dan makmur melibatkan semua negara.\n\n\"Dasar yang bijak ini merupakan peluang unik untuk bergerak bersama ke arah keamanan yang adil dan berkekalan, menjamin hak rakyat Palestin menerusi penyelesaian dua negara, memelihara keselamatan dan kestabilan serantau,\" titah baginda.\n\nTimbalan Perdana Menteri Oman Asa'ad bin Tarik Al-Said pula menyuarakan kebimbangan mendalam terhadap krisis kemanusiaan di Gaza akibat pendudukan Israel selama beberapa dekad ke atas wilayah Palestin.\n\n\"Ketidakadilan yang berterusan ini di samping kegagalan masyarakat antarabangsa untuk mencapai keamanan yang adil adalah punca utama pelbagai cabaran di rantau ini,\" katanya pada sidang kemuncak berkenaan.\n\nSelepas sidang kemuncak itu, Trump dijadual meneruskan lawatan ke Doha, Qatar dan ke Abu Dhabi, UAE.","summary":"ANKARA: Pemimpin negara-negara Teluk menggesa

American energy sector is on the cusp of a tectonic transformation.\n\nThis week, members of the House Committee on Natural Resources heard testimony on the vast potential of geothermal energy as “a new era of American energy — built with American innovation, American technology and American workers,” as one witness put it.\n\nChris Wright, President Donald Trump’s new energy secretary, has fervently endorsed geothermal as a way to “energize our country,” and a March study found that geothermal could meet roughly two-thirds of the voracious energy demands of AI data centers by the early 2030s.\n\nEven right here in New York City, new residential and office developments underway in Greenpoint, Coney Island and Manhattan are being built to rely significantly on this power source. \n\nGeothermal has the potential to be the Holy Grail of energy: unlimited and right under our feet.\n\nBut there’s a problem. Geothermal is expensive because it’s difficult to access . . . until now.\n\nToday, American innovators are supercharging the geothermal energy revolution with directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the same technologies that delivered the miracle of American shale. \n\n“This isn’t a concept or a pilot, it’s a full-scale energy project in motion,” Tim Latimer of Fervo Energy told the House committee Monday, as he described the 500-megawatt plant his company is building in Utah.\n\n“We’ve unlocked geothermal energy in places where it was previously impossible.”\n\nHere’s how it works. The interior of the Earth is an inferno of hot rock and molten metal, and heat — whether from natural gas, nuclear or something else — is what we need to spin generator turbines to create electricity.\n\nShallow geothermal wells for small residential systems can access sufficient heat anywhere from a couple feet to several hundred feet below ground — the city-block-long Greenpoint project, for example, will use a geo-exchange system of 300 bored holes going down nearly 500 feet.\n\nBut the energy output needed for a power plant demands much deeper wells, sometimes reaching two miles below the surface.\n\nSuccessfully drilling that deep to access this ever-present subterranean heat source has, until now, been extremely difficult.\n\nBut just like directional drilling opened up the extraction of previously unreachable oil and gas deposits in shale rock formations, the same technologies can unlock geothermal energy — and can do so almost anywhere in the country.\n\nDrilling sideways into hot rocks far beneath the earth’s surface, then injecting high-pressure fluids, creates energy that turns turbines to generate electricity and power our factories, heat our homes, turn on our lights and fuel our vehicles.\n\nAnd geothermal has a 90% capacity factor, meaning it can run at nearly full capacity continually without breaks, meeting round-the-clock energy demands and ensuring grid stability. \n\nNew York state has made some small-scale geothermal investments, including tax credits for home geothermal systems.\n\nBut it will take the power of directional drilling to scale this domestic, reliable, carbon-free energy source for broader use.\n\nIf we seize the chance, the United States will dominate this massive emerging market, pioneering the geothermal tech used not only here but throughout the world.\n\nIf we don’t, we could lose out once again to China. \n\nOver recent decades, China has cornered the critical-mineral market — and with it, the renewable-energy technologies that depend on these resources.\n\nNow, the United States is struggling to catch up in manufacturing products like solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nWe can’t afford to stumble at the starting block when it comes to geothermal energy. \n\nIf we exploit our oil and gas know-how to win the geothermal race, we can keep the world running on American tech in this vital sector — while keeping our nation from relying on the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nUS-made directional drilling has done this once before.\n\nDirectional drilling drove down shale access costs enough to transform energy markets.\n\nAfter it began to be implemented at scale in the early 2000s, US natural-gas production more than doubled. By 2016, this approach accounted for almost 70% of all oil and natural-gas wells.\n\nToday, nobody can come close to America’s shale dominance.\n\nIf this method can do for geothermal what it did for shale, the costs of this energy source could plummet 80% by 2035, the International Energy Agency estimates.\n\nDelivering geothermal at such a cost-value will make the United States the undisputed leader in the world’s next big energy market — yet again.\n\nNo wonder Trump called geothermal heat one of our country’s “amazing national assets” when he established his National Energy Dominance Council.\n\nDirectional drilling launched the shale revolution, altering history and strengthening our nation.\n\nIt’s time to unleash these same tools so America can lead the geothermal revolution, too.\n\nNeil Chatterjee served as chairman and a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","summary":"Geothermal could be the Holy Grail of energy: unlimited and right under our feet — and the same technologies that delivered the miracle of American shale can now tap it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/opinion/drill-baby-drill-in-brooklyn-for-energy-right-underfoot/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/2010-geothermal-energy-developers-plan-32492270.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3hSnMoNA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:05:20","author":"Neil Chatterjee","authors":["Neil Chatterjee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026}]}
