The move is the most dramatic example yet of Trump's new push toward relaxing restrictions on sales of advanced American AI technology to China, as he seeks expanded overseas markets for U.S. companies. He also faces Beijing's imposition of export controls on rare earth minerals, key ingredients for manufacturing a vast array of technology in the U.S. and abroad. It marks a dramatic reversal from his first term, when Trump drew international attention by cracking down on Chinese access to U.S. technology, citing claims that Beijing steals American intellectual property and harnesses commercially obtained technology to bolster its military, which Beijing denies. But the administration, led by White House AI czar David Sacks, now argues that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia and AMD's most advanced chip designs. If, in five years, AI chips made by sanctioned Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei were everywhere, \"that means we lost ... We can't let that happen,\" Sacks said at an event in January.But many in Washington disagree. Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security and National Security Agency official, said the notion that the U.S. can keep China dependent on U.S. chips by letting it have the H200 is “a delusion.”“There’s no world in which they are not going to continue to press as hard as possible to have a domestic industry that will ultimately have as its goal the bankruptcy of Nvidia and the dependence of the United States on Chinese AI,” Baker said.Democratic lawmakers echoed those views. Senator Ron Wyden accused Trump of getting \"taken to the cleaners by China yet again,\" arguing that \"every American will be less safe because of his terrible deal on AI technology.\" Meanwhile, U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi described the move as a \"profound national security mistake and a gift to our top strategic competitor.\" But some China hawks see the impact as more limited, including James Mulvenon, a Chinese military expert who authored a report that helped convince the first Trump administration to sanction Chinese chip manufacturer SMIC in 2020.\"Regardless of this decision, the Chinese government has made it clear that it is not their long-term strategic goal to be dependent on Nvidia or any other Western technology, so these gains will likely be transitory,” he said.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to

is a significant barrier to development \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) – President of the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Daniel Best, on Tuesday said corruption represents one of the most significant barriers to sustainable development.\n\nIn a statement marking International Anti-Corruption Day, Best said that the region’s premier financial institution is using the occasion to renew its commitment to the principles that underpin effective development: transparency, integrity, and accountability.\n\nHe quoted the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, as saying that one trillion US dollars are paid in bribes annually, while another US2.6 trillion are stolen through corruption.\n\n“These staggering losses drain resources that could transform lives and build prosperous societies,” Best said, adding that for Caribbean countries operating with constrained fiscal space, substantial debt obligations.\n\n“Any resources lost due to corrupt practices translate directly into lost essential infrastructure, curtailed education and health services, and missed opportunities for economic advancement,” he continued.\n\nBest said consequently, CDB views anti-corruption not as an ancillary concern but as central to fulfilling our development mandate.\n\n“As a development finance institution serving some of the world’s most vulnerable small island states, maintaining the highest standards of integrity is essential to securing continued access to the resources our Borrowing Member Countries (BMCs) require,” he said.\n\n“Strong governance frameworks and robust anti-corruption mechanisms directly enable the Bank to achieve its core objectives: advancing economic growth, reducing poverty, and building sustainable, resilient societies across the region,” Best added.\n\nBest said for the last decade, CDB’s Office of Integrity, Compliance, and Accountability has served as the institutional anchor for our governance framework, encompassing institutional integrity, ethics, accountability, and compliance.\n\nHe said through this office, the CDB has demonstrated regional leadership through sustained capacity-building initiatives for its BMCs, including training and knowledge-sharing on anti-corruption practices, compliance frameworks, and good governance standards.\n\nThis year’s International Anti-Corruption Day theme is “Uniting with Youth Against Corruption: Shaping Tomorrow’s Integrity”.\n\nBest said it aligns directly with CDB’s institutional priorities and our vision for the region’s future.\n\n“As an institution with youth development embedded in its operational strategy, CDB recognizes that empowering the next generation requires equipping young people with the values, knowledge, and tools to champion integrity in all spheres. The region’s young people bring fresh perspectives, technological fluency, and a determination to challenge outdated practices that have impeded progress. By investing in youth-led initiatives and creating platforms for young voices in governance discussions, the bank supports the emergence of a generation that will demand and deliver higher standards of institutional integrity,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Caribbean Development Bank Daniel Best \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Members of Parliament to receive training on filing statutory declarations \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n The House of Representatives will hold a compulsory training session for Members of Parliament (MPs) on Tuesday, December 16, to provide them with fur... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kenyan troops arrive in Haiti \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti (CMC) – Haitian President pro tempore and Coordinator of the Transition Council, Laurent Saint-Cyr, has welcomed the latest batc... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cabinet approves additional $42 million to restore small businesses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Cabinet has approved an additional $42 million to restore small businesses in parishes that were severely impacted during the pass... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Official funeral for Jimmy Cliff to held on December 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The official funeral of late reggae icon Jimmy Cliff will be held on Wednesday, December 17, at the National Indoor Sports Centre be... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWMA expresses condolences after nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica —The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) has expressed condolences to the family of nine-year-old Amoya Moore who wa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica—Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says he is saddened to learn of the death of nine-year-old... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s Zolotarova wins bronze at 2025 Bolivarian Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican martial arts athlete Valentyna Zolotarova recently won a bronze medal in the 55kg kumite division at the 2025 Bolivarian Games in Lima, Peru.... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico president confident of deal with US on water dispute \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AFP)—Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday she was confident of reaching an agreement with US President Donald Trump i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The declarations are due on December 31, and failure to file may have legal and political consequences, including referral to the commission.\n\n“This session will guide us through the proper completion of statutory declarations, which [are] due on December 31, 2025. This initiative is designed to support transparency, strengthen compliance and ensure that every member is fully equipped to meet the requirements set before us,” Holness said.\n\nAlthough statutory declarations are an annual requirement, many MPs — particularly first-time parliamentarians — have never participated in formal training. The Speaker noted that the Integrity Commission initiated the courtesy call and that the session would benefit everyone, regardless of experience.\n\n“I would like to remind us that we have a lot of new members seated in the House who will benefit from the training and from the information that helps with their ability to comply. Some persons are more experienced than others but even the experienced members of the House will find benefit from having a lot more sense of certainty in respect of how we complete these declarations and do our reporting,” Holness said.\n\nStatutory declarations, which are intended to disclose assets, income, liabilities and other financial interests, are an important tool for preventing corruption and maintaining trust in public institutions. Over recent years, the Integrity Commission has repeatedly urged stricter compliance and clearer reporting from government officials.\n\nThe Speaker stressed that Parliament must lead by example and that next week’s session is an opportunity to improve the quality and accuracy of submitted documents.\n\nThe training comes at a time when the role of the Integrity Commission has been the subject of national debate. Public calls for stronger scrutiny of political officeholders have intensified, particularly following recent corruption allegations across the region. \n\n— Jerome Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: House of Representatives Integrity Commission Juliet Holness Members of Parliament MP statutory declarations \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kenyan troops arrive in Haiti \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti (CMC) – Haitian President pro tempore and Coordinator of the Transition Council, Laurent Saint-Cyr, has welcomed the latest batc... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cabinet approves additional $42 million to restore small businesses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Cabinet has approved an additional $42 million to restore small businesses in parishes that were severely impacted during the pass... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Official funeral for Jimmy Cliff to held on December 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The official funeral of late reggae icon Jimmy Cliff will be held on Wednesday, December 17, at the National Indoor Sports Centre be... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWMA expresses condolences after nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica —The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) has expressed condolences to the family of nine-year-old Amoya Moore who wa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica—Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says he is saddened to learn of the death of nine-year-old... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s Zolotarova wins bronze at 2025 Bolivarian Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican martial arts athlete Valentyna Zolotarova recently won a bronze medal in the 55kg kumite division at the 2025 Bolivarian Games in Lima, Peru.... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico president confident of deal with US on water dispute \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AFP)—Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday she was confident of reaching an agreement with US President Donald Trump i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The new force aims to dismantle gangs, secure humanitarian access, and build Haitian capacity, with a mandate for arrests and intelligence-led operations, signalling renewed international commitment to stabilising the country, where criminal gangs have been seeking to overthrow the interim government since the July 7, 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.\n\nThe arrival of the new troops from Kenya coincided with the departure of 100 Kenyan police officers, at the end of their mission, and President Saint-Cyr commended the departing officers for their service, assuring the remaining troops of harmonious collaboration between the Haitian authorities, the Armed Forces of Haiti and the PNH.\n\nThe GSF Commander also sought to assure that the Gang Suppression Force will work in Haiti’s best interests, adding that they had learned from the experience of the MSS to make the new force more effective.\n\nFor his part, Boinett conveyed the greetings of Kenyan President William Ruto to the Haitian leaders and people, reaffirming that “Kenya will stand with the Haitian people to guarantee peace and stability during this transitional phase”.\n\nAs the new troops joined their counterparts from Guatemala, El Salvador, the Bahamas, and Jamaica, Commander Otunge welcomed them to their missions, emphasising that their arrival comes at a critical time, following the expansion of the GSF’s mandate.\n\nHe said they will play a vital role in strengthening, consolidating, and accelerating the progress already achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Gang Suppression Force Haiti Kenya \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cabinet approves additional $42 million to restore small businesses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Cabinet has approved an additional $42 million to restore small businesses in parishes that were severely impacted during the pass... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Official funeral for Jimmy Cliff to held on December 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The official funeral of late reggae icon Jimmy Cliff will be held on Wednesday, December 17, at the National Indoor Sports Centre be... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWMA expresses condolences after nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica —The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) has expressed condolences to the family of nine-year-old Amoya Moore who wa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica—Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says he is saddened to learn of the death of nine-year-old... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s Zolotarova wins bronze at 2025 Bolivarian Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican martial arts athlete Valentyna Zolotarova recently won a bronze medal in the 55kg kumite division at the 2025 Bolivarian Games in Lima, Peru.... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico president confident of deal with US on water dispute \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AFP)—Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday she was confident of reaching an agreement with US President Donald Trump i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11 events to look forward to this Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n It’s December, and that means tis’ the season to unlock your inner party animal.

They can’t buy chicken because they have no refrigeration, no freezer; they can’t sell cold drinks. We provided them with generators until the Jamaica Public Service (JPs) power returns so that the communities can begin to do business,” he pointed out.\n\nHill informed that a total of 1,293 businesses were assessed during the period November 10 to December 1, 2025.\n\nDamage assessment was done at the Accompong Maroon village in St Elizabeth, where 25 business were deemed to be in need of repair.\n\nThe minister informed that several wooden structures in the community were completely destroyed during the hurricane, while concrete buildings suffered extensive roof damage.\n\nHe noted that while some shops are partially operational, continuous power is required, and the ministry plans to assist by installing generators at these businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa Relief small businesses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Official funeral for Jimmy Cliff to held on December 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—The official funeral of late reggae icon Jimmy Cliff will be held on Wednesday, December 17, at the National Indoor Sports Centre be... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWMA expresses condolences after nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica —The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) has expressed condolences to the family of nine-year-old Amoya Moore who wa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica—Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says he is saddened to learn of the death of nine-year-old... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s Zolotarova wins bronze at 2025 Bolivarian Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican martial arts athlete Valentyna Zolotarova recently won a bronze medal in the 55kg kumite division at the 2025 Bolivarian Games in Lima, Peru.... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico president confident of deal with US on water dispute \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AFP)—Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday she was confident of reaching an agreement with US President Donald Trump i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11 events to look forward to this Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n It’s December, and that means tis’ the season to unlock your inner party animal.

Jasmine Crockett, a progressive firebrand who currently represents Texas' 30th congressional district, launched a bid for the U.S. Senate on Monday -- setting up a contested primary against a rising Democratic star and jolting a political scene already scrambled by the Lone Star state's recent redrawing of its congressional map.\n\nCrockett, speaking at an event on Monday in Dallas, emphasized being confident in being able to win a statewide race in Texas as a Democrat and wanting to take on President Donald Trump as a U.S. Senator. \n\n\"There's a responsibility that lies with all of us, especially in this moment. There are a lot of people that said, 'You got to stay in the house. We need our voice. We need you there,'\" Crockett told the crowd. \n\n\"I understand, but what we need is for me to have a bigger voice. What we need is not only a voice, but we need to make sure that we are going to stop all the hell that is raining down on all of our people,\" Crockett said.\n\nCrockett did not mention her primary opponent, state Rep. James Talarico, by name. The state representative rose to national acclaim for his embrace of Christianity with Democratic politics and was outspoken this past summer when Democratic state legislators in Texas left the state to try to prevent a vote on the new congressional map.\n\nTalarico said he \"welcomes\" Crockett into the race. \n\n\"We're building a movement in Texas ... Our movement is rooted in unity over division -- so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race,\" Talarico said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhile talking about the uphill battle to win statewide on Monday, Crockett referenced a need for unity and that her run was focused on Texans, seemingly trying to preempt claims she was splitting the Democratic vote or going for her Senate run for the sake of her own ambition. \n\n\"Many people have asked, and all of us wonder, can we win this race in November? I'm here to say, yes, we can. I'm also here to say it's not if we can, but if we will, if we will get out and knock the doors ... will we come together as one? This isn't about me or them. It's about you and us,\" she said.\n\n\"This is not about ambition. It's not about my ambition. It's about yours, your hopes and your dreams, and a government that has your back,\" Crockett said.\n\nBut Crockett did not shy away from naming one of her possible general election opponents -- incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn, with whom she used to have a good relationship. Crockett framed Cornyn as \"business as usual\" and said that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCrockett and Cornyn have collaborated on legislation in the past, but during her remarks, Crockett criticized him for supporting Trump and framed him as \"business as usual\", saying that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCornyn, asked during an appearance on \"America Reports\" on Fox News on Tuesday to respond to some of Crockett’s comments about him, said that he thinks Crockett won’t be able to get more than the 42% of the vote that Vice President Kamala Harris got in the 2024 presidential race. \n\nShe had harsh words for President Donald Trump, telling supporters, \"I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring.\" \n\nAnother area she hit Trump on was his push to have Texas redraw its congressional map mid-decade to favor the GOP, which Republicans delivered on this past summer. Analysts say Republicans may be able to flip three to five seats in the new map.\n\nCrockett told supporters that the mid-decade redistricting in Texas that Trump had promoted drew her out of her home district, but was not enough to stop her. \n\n\"I'm here to tell you, Donald Trump, you won't get rid of me that easily. I'm not going away. I'm not giving up. I still believe in this country. I still believe that we are in the land of opportunity,\" she said. \n\nCrockett made her announcement on the last day to file for the 2026 primaries -- which have been jolted by the redistricting. Current Democratic members of Texas' congressional delegation had been making decisions over whether and where to run ahead of Monday's deadline.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, for instance, said Friday he will retire at the end of the 119th Congress; some other members are running in new districts.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who had been running for Senate, wrote Monday that what was expected to be \"a bruising Senate Democratic primary\" would divide the party ahead of the general election. He said he was now launching a bid for the newly redrawn 33rd congressional district instead -- drawing the ire of incumbent U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, who is also running there.\n\nJohnson wrote in a statement Monday, without naming Allred, \"This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans running for the Senate seat pounced on reports midday Monday that Crockett had filed to run as proof that the Democrats will not be able to field a candidate who can win statewide. \n\nThe GOP faces an acrimonious primary itself, as incumbent Sen. John Cornyn -- supported by the party establishment -- faces primary challenges from state Attorney General Ken Paxton, and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt. Cornyn, Paxton and Hunt have each alleged that they are the best choice for Texas and the strongest supporter of Trump in the race. \n\n\"AOC has a new ally in Congress. She found one from Texas. Jasmine Crockett stands with this squad,\" the campaign team for Cornyn wrote in a post on X on Monday. \n\nPaxton, meanwhile, used Crockett's entry as a chance to hit back at Cornyn, writing on X, \"I'm sure John Cornyn is deeply upset his 'dance partner' Crazy Crockett is running, but that won't stop him from trying to force the national GOP to light $100 million on fire to save his failing campaign. He's willing to risk the Senate Majority to protect his fragile ego.\"\n\nHunt wrote on X on Tuesday, \"Welcome to the show, Jasmine Crockett. The next Senator from Texas must be able to stand on their record, their resume, and their accomplishments. I'm ready to have that debate every single day.\"\n\nABC News' John Parkinson and Brittany Shepherd contributed to this report.","summary":"Rep.

González conceded Tuesday night, his campaign confirmed. While the Miami mayoral race is technically nonpartisan, the Republican-affiliated candidate has won every election since 2008, and an independent candidate won before then, locking Democrats out of the office since their last win in 1997. But while Miami-Dade has moved dramatically toward Republicans in the last few elections, former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly carried the city itself last year. Both candidates centered their campaigns on breaking from the previous mayoral administrations in Miami and addressing voters’ economic concerns, while pitching different solutions, but the race became nationalized in the final weeks. And it hinged on familiar themes that will play a big role in deciding the 2026 elections: affordability, Trump’s weakened political standing and how the president’s controversial deportation agenda is playing in a city with a significant Hispanic population. Higgins leaned on her role on the county commission to frame herself as focused on quality of life issues like affordable housing, infrastructure and streamlining city processes in a way she said would help save the city, and residents, money. “There are many approaches to affordability that local governments have in their own hands even though we aren’t in control of tariffs — which by the way is creating a huge affordability crisis,” she told NBC News the day before the election, in a reference to Trump’s broad tariff policy. She was also deeply critical of Trump — and González by proxy, given the president’s endorsement — over his deportation agenda, telling NBC News that Hispanic and Haitian voters have been telling her they are “afraid of their government.” Despite Higgins’ messaging, González didn’t run as a Trump acolyte. Instead, he argued he was the candidate focused on local issues like fighting overdevelopment, and he aligned himself with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ plan to end homestead property taxes to ease the cost of living. González deflected criticism of the president’s immigration policies by arguing that’s a national issue over which he has no say. The race received increased national attention in the final weeks, particularly after Democrats made gains, but still lost, in a Tennessee special election for a vacant congressional district earlier this month. The Democratic National Committee took an active interest in the mayoral race, sending organizational support to boost Higgins, and prominent Democrats with potential aspirations for higher office — Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel — sent their support too. Republicans zeroed in on the race as well, hoping to hold the seat and push back on a string of GOP candidates underperforming their 2024 marks in special House elections, the recent gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, and in other downballot races.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrat-wins-miamis-mayoral-race-first-time-almost-30-years-rcna248168","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251209-Eileen-Higgins-rs-e8546a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 01:14:33","author":"Ben Kamisar","authors":["Ben Kamisar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":386611608,"title":"McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister of Local Government and Rural Development Desmond McKenzie.(Photo: JIS) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n McKenzie saddened by death of nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANCHESTER, Jamaica—Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says he is saddened to learn of the death of nine-year-old Amoya Moore, who was killed in a tragic motor vehicle accident involving a garbage truck in her community in Mandeville Tuesday morning.\n\n“It is very difficult for me to adequately express my feelings about this. It is, simply put, a tragedy all round. From all indications, garbage collection was in progress when the accident occurred. While the incident is still being investigated, and the vehicle has been impounded for the necessary inspection as part of the investigative process, I feel the shock, the disbelief and the grief that is radiating around Bonitto Crescent, and at Villa Road Primary School, at the unexpected and tragic loss of one of the community’s youngest members,” McKenzie said in a media statement.\n\nThe Grade 4 student was reportedly on her way to school when the accident occurred.\n\nMcKenzie said he feels the grief of Amara’s relatives and friends as they try to somehow accept that she will not be walking back home today or ever again.\n\n“I have seen some of the images of family members, community members, members of the NSWMA team and persons who have just passed by the accident scene and the trauma is evident. I want to join the many persons who have expressed great regret at this occurrence, and invoke every comfort and sense of strength upon Amara’s family especially, as they endure this period of painful loss,” McKenzie continued.\n\nREAD: Nine-year-old mowed down in Mandeville by garbage truck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Local Government Minister Desmond McKenzie Manchester mowed down \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NSWMA expresses condolences after nine-year-old mowed down by garbage truck \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica —The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) has expressed condolences to the family of nine-year-old Amoya Moore who wa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s Zolotarova wins bronze at 2025 Bolivarian Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican martial arts athlete Valentyna Zolotarova recently won a bronze medal in the 55kg kumite division at the 2025 Bolivarian Games in Lima, Peru.... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico president confident of deal with US on water dispute \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AFP)—Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday she was confident of reaching an agreement with US President Donald Trump i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11 events to look forward to this Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 9, 2025 \n\n\n It’s December, and that means tis’ the season to unlock your inner party animal.

Un funcionario de defensa de Estados Unidos confirmó que un par de aviones realizaron un “vuelo de entrenamiento rutinario” en la zona.\n\nEl funcionario, que habló bajo condición de anonimato para poder informar de operaciones militares sensibles, no pudo decir si los aviones estaban armados, pero señaló que permanecieron en el espacio aéreo internacional durante su vuelo.\n\nEl funcionario comparó el vuelo de entrenamiento con ejercicios anteriores que tenían como objetivo mostrar el alcance de los aviones estadounidenses y dijo que la maniobra no tenía la intención de ser provocativa.\n\nEl ejército ha enviado previamente bombarderos B-52 Stratofortress y B-1 Lancer a la región, pero esos volaron hasta la costa de Venezuela y a lo largo de ella. No hubo indicios de que esos aviones volaran tan cerca del territorio del país como los aviones de combate F/A-18 del martes.\n\nLos vuelos son la acción más reciente del ejército de Estados Unidos mientras construye su mayor presencia en la región en décadas y ha lanzado una serie de ataques mortales contra presuntas embarcaciones de contrabando de drogas en el mar Caribe y el océano Pacífico oriental. El presidente Donald Trump dice que los ataques terrestres llegarán pronto, pero no ha ofrecido detalles sobre la ubicación.\n\nEl presidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro asegura en que el verdadero propósito de las operaciones militares de Estados Unidos es forzarlo a dejar el cargo.\n\nLa administración Trump enfrenta un creciente escrutinio por parte de los legisladores estadounidenses sobre la campaña de ataques a barcos que ha matado al menos a 87 personas en 22 bombardeos conocidos desde principios de septiembre, incluyendo un ataque de seguimiento que mató a dos sobrevivientes que se aferraban a los restos de una lancha después del primer impacto.\n\nLos legisladores quieren ver los videos sin editar de los ataques, pero el secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth, dijo a los líderes del Congreso el martes que aún estaba evaluándolo. Hegseth proporcionó una sesión informativa clasificada para los líderes del Congreso, junto al secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, y otros altos funcionarios de seguridad nacional.\n\nEl mismo día por separado, el almirante Alvin Holsey, quien estaba al mando de la campaña para destruir lanchas que supuestamente transportan drogas y se retirará del Comando Sur de Estados Unidos esta semana, habló con los principales líderes republicano y demócrata en la Comisión de Servicios Armados del Senado.\n\nTrump ha justificado los ataques como una escalada necesaria para detener el flujo de drogas hacia Estados Unidos y afirma que el país está involucrado en un “conflicto armado” con los cárteles.\n\nFlightradar24, uno de los sitios web que permite ver públicamente los aviones volando en tiempo real, dijo que las aeronaves militares fueron las más seguidas en su sitio en ese momento.\n\nVenezuela afirma que el cuerpo de agua es parte del territorio nacional, pero esas afirmaciones han sido desafiadas por académicos legales de Estados Unidos y el ejército durante décadas.\n\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.","summary":"Por KONSTANTIN TOROPIN WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; El ej&#233;rcito de Estados Unidos vol&#243; un par de aviones de combate sobre el Golfo de Venezuela en lo que parece ser la aproximaci&#243;n m&#225;s cercana de aeronaves de guerra estadounidenses al espacio a&#233;reo del pa&#237;s sudamericano desde el inicio de la campa&#241;a de presi&#243;n de la administraci&#243;n Trump.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said via email that they made no arrests in the neighborhood Tuesday, but provided no further details.\n\nOsman said armed ICE agents went to East African restaurants in the neighborhood Tuesday, closed the doors and demanded people’s IDs. They found only US citizens and made no arrests, Osman said.\n\n“Luckily everyone had their passport, because I’ve been telling them to have their passport with them,” Osman said.\n\nAfter checking the IDs of some people stopped at random on the street and temporarily detaining at least one US citizen, Osman said, the agents went in seven to 10 vehicles to a nearby city-owned senior housing complex. There, he said, a group of mostly white young people he called “heroes” blew whistles to sound the alarm and confronted the agents, who responded with pepper spray.\n\n“Thank God so many people showed up there,” Osman said. “(The agents) couldn’t get out of there because people showed up with their cars and whistles.”\n\nOsman said he saw people suffering from the effects of pepper spray. He also said he spoke with one young Somali American who was dragged to a vehicle, detained and taken to an ICE detention center. There, officials finally looked at his US passport, fingerprinted him, and released him but told him to find his own way home, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away in snowy weather.\n\n“I just don’t know what they accomplished today other than the chaos,” Osman said.\n\nTrump further stoked tensions last week when he called Somalis “garbage” and said he does not want them in the country. At the same time, federal agents launched the crackdown targeting Minnesota Somalis.\n\nThe president’s moves have drawn denunciations from leaders of the Somali community and Democrats including Gov. Tim Walz, amid relative silence from top state Republicans.\n\nAbout 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the country live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the overwhelming majority of them US citizens. Almost 58% were born in the US, and 87% of those born elsewhere are naturalized citizens.\n\nA new website launched by the Department of Homeland Security lists at least six Somalis arrested in Minnesota in recent weeks. The site says it is “highlighting the worst of worst criminal aliens” arrested by ICE to show how agents are “fulfilling President Trump’s promise and carrying out mass deportations.”\n\nICE released a statement Friday listing three other arrested Somalis who did not appear on the website, along with people of other nationalities who it said were arrested in Minneapolis as part of Operation Metro Surge. ICE said they had all been convicted of crimes including sexual abuse minors, robbery and domestic assault.\n\n“Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey protected these criminals at the expense of the safety of Americans,” the statement said. “President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message for criminal illegal aliens: LEAVE NOW. If you don’t, we will find you, arrest you, and deport you.”","summary":"Federal agents used pepper spray to push through an angry crowd that blocked their vehicles as they checked identifications in a heavily Somali neighborhood of Minneapolis on Tuesday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/us-news/feds-pepper-spray-crowd-in-somali-neighborhood-of-minneapolis-following-1b-minnesota-scammer-scandal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-sbrvq1b6c-1765328008239.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765310014&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Z0R4AIjl-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-10 01:04:04","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":386648840,"title":"Tariff rescue: Trump gives Band-Aids to the farmers he hurt","text":"This week Donald Trump announced an $18 billion bailout of US farmers, saying that it wouldn’t have been possible without the revenue from his tariffs.

The trade representative’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Thank you for highlighting that,\" Greer said to Fischer. \"We’ve heard from a couple of farmers — they want to know about that discrepancy. And it is a discrepancy.” Greer's \"discrepancy\" is between the timeline he gave and what the White House announced in a news release Nov. 1, shortly after Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump met. “China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025,\" read the statement, which was still posted on the White House website late Tuesday. Beijing will “also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028,” said the fact sheet, which was titled “President Donald J. Trump Strikes Deal on Economic and Trade Relations with China.” On Monday, Trump announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers, which included $11 billion in direct payments. The same day, the Agriculture Department announced that a fresh batch of U.S. soybeans was destined for China. During the depths of the U.S.-China trade war, farmers across the country said their businesses were pushed to the brink of bankruptcy when China halted all purchases of American soybeans. Since Trump and Xi met in late October, China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans, with at least 10 waves of purchases in varying amounts. As of Tuesday, China had purchased a total of around 2.85 million metric tons since October, according to data compiled by NBC News. The Agriculture Department said Monday that private exporters had informed it that 132,000 more metric tons of soybeans were booked for delivery to China. In recent comments, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also referred to the \"growing season\" as China's buying deadline. Bessent said last Wednesday that China was \"in a perfect cadence to complete\" purchasing the goal of 12 million metric tons. As for the timeline to completion, “I think that’ll be Feb. 28,” he said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-china-soybeans-timeline-rcna248323","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251209-jamieson-greer-lr-ec61b2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:53:18","author":"Steve Kopack","authors":["Steve Kopack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":386648804,"title":"Democrats Flip Miami Mayor&#039;s Office for First Time in Nearly 30 Years","text":"Miami has a new mayor, with former County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, a Democrat, beating Republican Emilio González, a former city manager endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe run-off election result upsets the status quo in the South Florida city, which had not elected a Democratic mayor in nearly three decades.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nFlorida has largely swung red in recent decades, but Miami has been seen as bluer, being home to many immigrant communities.

Tonight’s result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs for working families across the country.”\n\nWhat Did the Polls Show? \n\nAhead of Tuesday’s vote, betting platform Polymarket had Higgins, who campaigned on providing affordable housing, with a 94 percent chance of winning the election while González, who worked as a director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under former President George W. Bush, had a 6 percent chance.\n\nAn APL Consulting poll of 307 voters found that Higgins had 34 percent of the vote and Gonzalez had 31 percent. This poll, conducted between November 21 and 24 on behalf of Mission Miami, a political committee backing Gonzalez’s campaign, had a margin of error of +/- 5.9 percentage points.\n\nAccording to an MDW Communications poll of 307 likely voters, 49.84 percent said they would vote for Higgins while 23.78 percent planned to vote for González. However, this poll was conducted between October 14 and 18, before the November 4 election. It was also commissioned by Higgins’ political committee. The margin of error was 6 percentage points.\n\nHow the Race Could Impact the 2026 Midterms\n\nAs with any election between general and midterm elections, both parties will be taking note of the result in Miami and adjusting plans accordingly.\n\nWith the midterms looming, Republicans will be looking to continue the momentum seen in 2024 and maintain a hold on both chambers in Congress, while Democrats will be looking for any signs they could upset that majority.\n\nMiami will likely remain a hotly contested area, with the city having been won by former Vice President Kamala Harris by one point in 2024, while Miami-Dade County flipped red for Trump.\n\nAs the second-largest city in Florida, and one which is extremely diverse, the party’s likely cannot write off the mayoral race as they might in other parts of the country, especially with Trump’s endorsement of Gonzalez.\n\nThis is a breaking news story that will be updated.","summary":"Higgins won the race Tuesday night, after the two candidates beat 11 others on election day on November 4.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/miami-mayor-election-results-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez-11182942","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250973044.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:51:31","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.05},{"id":386644846,"title":"US fighter jets fly over Gulf of Venezuela in closest approach since Trump’s pressure campaign","text":"U.S. military fighter jets conducted a flight over the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday, marking what appears to be the closest American warplanes have approached the South American nation's airspace since the Trump administration initiated its pressure campaign.\n\nPublic flight tracking websites observed a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets traversing the Gulf – a body of water bordered by Venezuela and approximately 150 miles at its widest point – for over 30 minutes.\n\nA U.S. defense official, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of military operations, confirmed the “routine training flight.” The official stated the jets remained in international airspace throughout, though could not confirm if they were armed. \n\nThey likened the exercise to previous demonstrations of U.S. aerial reach, emphasizing the maneuver was not meant to be provocative.\n\nThe military has previously sent B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers to the region, but those planes flew up to and along the coast of Venezuela. There was no indication that those aircraft ever flew as close to the country’s territory as the F/A-18 fighter jets on Tuesday.\n\nThe flights are the latest action the U.S. military has taken as it has built up its largest presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. President Donald Trump says land attacks are coming soon but has not offered any details on location. \n\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nThe Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 87 people in 22 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit.\n\nLawmakers are demanding to get unedited video from the strikes, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders Tuesday he was still weighing whether to release it. Hegseth provided a classified briefing for congressional leaders alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top national security officials. \n\nThe same day, Adm. Alvin Holsey, who will be retiring from U.S. Southern Command in this week, spoke separately with the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nTrump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted the U.S. is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels.\n\nFlightradar24, one of the websites that allowed the public to see the jets flying in real time, said the planes were the most tracked flights on its site at the time.\n\nVenezuela has claimed that the body of water is part of the country's national territory, but those claims have been challenged by U.S. legal scholars and the military for decades.","summary":"An official confirmed the “routine training flight”","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-gulf-venezuela-fighter-jets-trump-b2881441.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/08/08/14/F18fighterjet.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HFp96Feq-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:45:49","author":"Konstantin Toropin","authors":["Konstantin Toropin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.111},{"id":386650482,"title":"Quebec tables fast-tracking law, mirroring Ottawa and other provinces","text":"The legislation indicates that the government can \"amend the application of any provision\" of a series of laws to complete a project, including acts that cover forest development, environment, preserving agricultural lands, mining, and parks among others.\n\nGirard noted that preparatory work could be greenlighted before a project gets a final approval.

Anika Wells gave birth to twins in office. We went through, in NSW, 83 years of electing a male — usually an Anglo-Celtic male — for every seat in every electorate for every party.”\n\nBarr acknowledged the change was “fantastic” but was quick to hit Albanese with messages from unimpressed viewers.\n\n“I’m a nurse with NSW Health. That (Anika Wells) Comcar bill for $1,000 to wait eight, ten hours. That’s my weekly wage that I take home,” one said.\n\n“I’m a pensioner. I can’t afford heating and cooling. And I’m looking at these politicians and it’s disgusting,” said another.\n\nAnother questioned why the Defence Force was not receiving the same treatment when they also spend months on end away from their family.\n\n“Politicians are not special,” a third commented.\n\nEmployment Minister Amanda Rishworth also defended the system on Sunrise, saying the rules were set independently by the IPEA following major reforms in 2014-15.\n\n“Politicians do spend a long time away from their family. We all have a responsibility to use taxpayers’ money sensibly and responsibly,” Rishworth said.\n\nBarr grilled Rishworth on this comment, questioning whether Commonwealth cars waiting for eight to 12 hours and costing over $1,000, three business-class return airfares each year for every family member of an MP and trips coinciding with personal celebrations and children’s sporting events were reasonable.\n\n“It is important everyone abides by the rules. It is important we all are very conscious that the funding that we use is taxpayers’ funding,” Rishworth said.\n\nAt a time when many families are struggling to make ends meet, Barr questioned whether Rishworth thinks the rules should be changed.\n\nRishworth was reluctant to respond to the matter, saying she thinks it is “right” the rules are set independently.\n\nWhen asked whether $35,000 for a business-class return airfare, with two of her staff paying the same, was reasonable, Rishworth said the matter has been referred to IPEA.\n\nNationals Senate Leader Bridget McKenzie also acknowledged that while family reunion entitlements help keep political families connected, particularly for young women with children, MPs should not abuse the system.\n\nMcKenzie called for Wells to stand aside from her ministerial duties while investigations are conducted.\n\n“This all started with a very arrogant minister charging the taxpayer $190,000 for a six-minute speech in New York,” McKenzie said.\n\nWith the social media ban now in place, McKenzie said “we need a minister that’s focused on getting that right, not on going through her travel records”.\n\nWhen pressed about whether the rules should be changed given cost-of-living pressures, both ministers insisted the independent authority should remain at arm’s length from political interference.\n\nAlbanese admitted the government was always reviewing policies such as parliamentary spending and that approach would not change.\n\nWells has referred her spending to IPEA for review, with all expenses appearing to fall within current rules.","url":"https://7news.com.au/sunrise/on-the-show/sunrises-nat-barr-grills-anthony-albanese-over-anika-wells-taxpayer-spending-c-20951035","image":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-20951035/b3d01d13a85e71d7000f4e6dec0c9a31279e41f1-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:33:29","author":"Aimee Edwards","authors":["Aimee Edwards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":386645206,"title":"Democrat wins Miami mayor’s race for the first time in nearly 30 years","text":"MIAMI (AP) — Democrat Eileen Higgins won the Miami mayor’s race on Tuesday, defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump to end her party’s nearly three-decade losing streak and give Democrats a boost in one of the last electoral battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nHiggins, 61, campaigned as a Democrat despite the race being officially nonpartisan. She spoke frequently in the Hispanic-majority city about Trump’s immigration crackdown, saying she has heard of many people in Miami who were worried about family members being detained. She beat Trump-backed candidate Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager. \n\n“I’ve never been prouder to be a Democrat,” Higgins told The Associated Press. “We’re living in the state of Florida, where we have people that are building cages for our residents rather than affordable housing for them.”\n\nThe local race is not predictive of what may happen at the polls next year. But it drew attention from the two major national political parties and their leaders. The victory provides Democrats with some momentum heading into a high-stakes midterm election when the GOP is looking to keep its grip in Florida, including in a Hispanic-majority district in Miami-Dade County. The area has shifted increasingly rightward politically in recent years, and the city may become the home of Trump’s presidential library.\n\nSome nationally recognized Democrats supported Higgins, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel traveled to Miami on Sunday and Monday to rally voters for the Democrat who served as a Miami-Dade county commissioner for seven years. \n\nHiggins, who speaks Spanish, represented a district that leans conservative and includes the Cuban neighborhood of Little Havana. When she first entered politics in 2018, she chose to present herself to voters as “La Gringa,” a term Spanish speakers use for white Americans, because many people did not known how to pronounce her name. \n\n“It just helps people understand who I am, and you know what? I am a ‘gringa,’ so, what am I going to do, deny it?” she told the AP. \n\nRepublicans’ anxiety grows\n\nRepublicans in Florida have found strong support from voters with heritage from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, because they likened some members of the Democratic party’s progressive wing with politicians from the governments they fled. Trump and other GOP members have tapped into those sentiments over the past eight years.\n\nHowever, some local Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated since November’s elections when Democrats scored wins in New Jersey and Virginia, where both winning gubernatorial candidates performed strongly with nonwhite voters. \n\nThe results from those races were perceived as a reflection of concerns over rising prices and the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies.\n\nU.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican whose district is being targeted by Democrats and includes the city of Miami, called the elections elsewhere a “wake-up call.” She said Hispanics also want a secure border and a healthy economy but some relief for “those who have been here for years and do not have a criminal record.”\n\n“The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed,” Salazar said in a video posted on X. “Hispanics married President Trump, but they are only dating the GOP.”\n\nMiami mayor-elect gains national platform\n\nHiggins will also be the first woman to lead the city of Miami, a position that is more ceremonial, but which she promised to execute like a full-time job.\n\nThe city is part of Miami-Dade County, which Trump flipped last year, a dramatic improvement from his 30 percentage point loss to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAs Florida’s second-largest city, Miami is considered the gateway to Latin America and attracts millions of tourists. Its global prominence gives Higgins a significant stage asmayor.\n\nHer pitch to voters included finding city-owned land that could be turned into affordable housing and cutting unnecessary spending. \n\nAdriana Gomez Licon, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/democrat-wins-miami-mayors-race-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-30-years-11602835","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/12/0073e9413ffe85c609df562b1ab82e0f859e793f1184473c2d409baeb29b1f8b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:33:28","author":"President Donald Trump","authors":["President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.05},{"id":386646552,"title":"Abhilash Thapliyal on his journey, being a mountain lover and association with Ajay Devgn","text":"Abhilash Thapliyal on his journey, being a mountain lover and association with Ajay Devgn Lifestyle \n 19 min ago\n\n This is an AI assisted summary.\n\n Abhilash Thapliyal, a former radio jockey, has had a successful career working with established names in the industry.

The official, speaking anonymously, would not say whether the jets were armed, but insisted the flight was not meant to be provocative, according to the Associated Press..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}The US has earlier sent B-52 and B-1 bombers to the region, but those aircraft stayed farther offshore. Tuesday’s flight brought American military planes closer to Venezuelan territory than at any point in recent years.The move comes as the US builds its largest regional military presence in decades and continues a controversial campaign of lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats across the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since early September, at least 87 people have been killed in 22 strikes, including two survivors hit by a follow-up strike — an incident now drawing scrutiny from lawmakers.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefed congressional leaders on Tuesday alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as lawmakers demanded unedited footage of the boat attacks. Hegseth said he had not yet decided whether to release the videos.Trump has defended the military actions as essential to combating cartels, saying the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug traffickers and warning that land attacks are coming soon, though he has offered no specifics.Flightradar24 said the FA-18s were the most-tracked aircraft on its platform Tuesday as users watched the jets fly near Venezuelan waters in real time.TRUMP SIGNALS TOUGHER VENEZUELA LINE Meanwhile, Donald Trump signaled an even harder edge toward Caracas in an interview with Politico released on Tuesday, declaring that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s “days are numbered” and refusing to rule out the use of American ground troops.Pressed on whether the US could deploy forces, Trump would not elaborate. “I don’t comment on that I wouldn’t say that one way or the other,” he said, adding that he had no intention of spelling out military strategy.When asked directly how far he was willing to go to remove Maduro, Trump again declined. “I don’t want to say that,” he told reporter Dasha Burns. But when she followed up — “But you want to see him out?” — Trump answered: “His days are numbered.”The comments come as tensions between Washington and Caracas continue to escalate. The administration has carried out a string of lethal strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, and Trump has hinted a land operation could come “very soon.”- EndsWith inputs from Associated PressPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Dec 10, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/us-military-flies-2-fighter-jets-over-gulf-of-venezuela-amid-rising-scrutiny-glbs-2833539-2025-12-10","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/us-labels-venezuelas-cartel-de-los-soles-a-terrorist-organisation--links-it-to-presidentnicolasma-24595599-16x9.png?VersionId=xdnuOuYsrAnL8VejrfApA0RR1Toe6spw?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:29:03","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":386650710,"title":"DOJ ends monitoring of illegal dumping in Houston in retreat from environmental justice","text":"By JIM MUSTIAN and JUAN A.

A huge arachnid bearing the Donald's face was razed to the ground in one such event, while elsewhere a decapitated Trump head was placed in the hands of an enormous devil before being set alight. The burnings were part of an annual tradition in which Guatemalans set fire to papier-mâché devils and piñatas ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Taking place every year on December 7 at 6pm, it a centuries-old tradition that marks the beginning of the Christmas festivities, and has also become an expression of social criticism. As one newsreader put it while reporting on the event for WION, it's \"part of an annual tradition to put all bad things behind them before Christmas\". In the clip, which can be seen on YouTube , an easily recognisable likeness of Trump's bonce, complete with blonde barnet, is placed into the hands of a giant, sinister-looking devil. Families with young children are then seen having their pictures taken with the monstrosity, before the effigy is set alight, and crowds pack the town square to watch. In another clip that posted on X (Twitter) , a huge red arachnid with Trump's face (and hair) is similarly set ablaze to whoops and cheers from a gathered crowd. The video then shows the obliterated figure's remains still burning on the street as cars and motorcycles drive past. Festival reveller Aldahgir Gonzalez told Global News: “It’s to represent the triumph of good over evil and all bad things and to let go of bad things. All this represents the burning of evil.” A member of a festival organising committee said there is always a demonised figure who gets burned with the devil - and this year it was Trump's turn. “There is always a character who attracts all the attention and comments,” they said, quoted by The Independent . “This year it happened to a figure already plagued with so much controversy, not only in this country but around the world. “Namely the ‘little tyrant’ of the United States who has done a lot to harm our Latin people and especially our Guatemalan brothers.\" Many Guatemalan children and adults have been targeted in deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration’s new border policy. In September this year, ICE tried to remove Guatemalan children who had travelled to the US alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families. The policy has been criticised by human rights groups and advocates for migrant rights, while Homeland Security officials have insisted that deported parents have the option to either leave with their children or place them with a guardian in the United States.

She ordered the state to keep providing hormones to inmates who had been receiving therapy and to allow others medically diagnosed as needing hormone therapy to begin receiving treatment.\n\n“The court finds that there is no genuine dispute of fact that gender dysphoria is a serious medical need,” Calvert wrote in her order. “Plaintiffs, through their experts, have presented evidence that a blanket ban on hormone therapy constitutes grossly inadequate care for gender dysphoria and risks imminent injury.”\n\nCalvert had already issued a preliminary order in September blocking the law before finalizing it.\n\nIt is the latest turn in legal battles over federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors. President Donald Trump’s administration in April sued Maine for not complying with the government’s push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports.\n\nThe Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. And the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue.\n\nThe Georgia case was brought on behalf of transgender inmates by the Center for Constitutional Rights after Georgia enacted a law in May banning the use of state money to pay for hormone therapy, gender-transition surgery or other methods to change the appearance of sexual characteristics.\n\n“It is not a health care issue that should be the responsibility of the taxpayers,” said Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula Republican who sponsored Senate Bill 185.\n\nLawyers for the state have already filed a notice of appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney General Chris Carr, an elected Republican running for governor, has vowed to fight the lawsuit “all the way to the Supreme Court,” calling it ”absurd.”\n\nThe measure roiled the 2025 Georgia legislative session, with most House Democrats walking out of their chamber to boycott the final vote on the bill. But Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law in May, and prison medical officials began making plans to gradually reduce and then end hormone therapy to inmates who were receiving it by October.\n\nGeorgia had begun providing hormone therapy in 2016 after a lawsuit by another inmate represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights. Prison officials counted more than 340 inmates who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria in custody in mid-August, and said 107 inmates were receiving hormone therapy as of June 30.\n\nThe state presented studies to argue that denying or removing people from hormone therapy doesn’t meet the legal standard of “deliberate indifference,” but Calvert rejected their consideration. Calvert also rejected testimony from physicians in the prison system, saying they weren’t deciding that inmates had no medical need for hormone therapy but instead were just following the law’s directives. She said the counseling and monitoring promised by the state was inadequate.\n\n“Defendants cannot deny medical care and then defeat an injunction by saying nothing bad has happened yet,” Calvert wrote.\n\nLawyers for the state argued Calvert was ignoring recent court decisions, including the Tennessee ban, as well as a recent 11th Circuit decision deciding that a Georgia county didn’t have to pay for a sheriff deputy’s gender-transition surgery.\n\n“It is crystal clear the state legislatures have wide deference to enact laws regulating sex-change procedures like the cross-sex hormonal interventions at issue in this case,” lawyers for the state wrote in November.","summary":"The judge ruled the new state law violated their protection against cruel and unusual punishment.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/09/transgender-health-care-georgia/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Transgender_Health_Care_Georgia_77545.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:11:14","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":386649396,"title":"Trump sets new deadline for Zelenskyy to respond to US peace plan: Report","text":"US President Donald Trump’s envoys have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a fresh deadline to respond to Washington’s proposed peace plan, unnamed officials told the Financial Times. The officials said Zelenskyy has only “days” to reply, even as the Ukrainian leader insists he will not accept any deal that redraws Ukraine’s borders.The FT reported that Trump had hoped to finalize an agreement by Christmas, a timeline that now appears increasingly unrealistic.In a post on X following meetings with European and NATO leaders, Zelenskyy signaled he would send the White House a revised Ukrainian-led proposal instead. “We are committed to a real peace,” he wrote, adding that Kyiv would present refined documents in the near future..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Zelenskyy made his position clear Monday night. “Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories. We, clearly, don’t want to give up anything. That’s what we are fighting for,” he told reporters, adding that Ukraine has no legal or moral right to relinquish land.But Trump, in a separate interview with Politico, urged Zelenskyy to accept Washington’s terms. He argued Moscow now holds the advantage. “You know, a lot of people are dying,” Trump said. “At some point, size will win, generally.” He also claimed that some of Zelenskyy’s “lieutenants” privately agree.Russia, Trump said, is too powerful for Ukraine to continue fighting.“I give the people of Ukraine and the military of Ukraine tremendous credit for the, you know, bravery and for the fighting and all of that,” he said. “But you know, at some point, size will win, generally.”Trump also repeated his call for Ukraine to hold a presidential election even though martial law doesn’t allow it and Zelenskyy, elected in 2019, had his five-year term extended because of the war. Trump’s position on Ukraine’s failure to hold an election mirrors frequent statements on the subject by Putin.A central point of contention is the US suggestion that Ukraine cede control of the eastern Donbas region, much of which remains under Russian occupation. Kyiv and its European allies remain firmly opposed.The standoff leaves the US and Ukraine at a sensitive crossroads: Washington is pressing for concessions it says could end the war, while Kyiv insists no peace is possible without full territorial integrity — and a willing Russia. As Zelenskyy put it, “Everything depends on whether Russia is ready to take effective steps to stop the bloodshed.”- EndsPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Dec 10, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/donald-trump-sets-new-deadline-for-zelenskyy-to-respond-to-us-peace-plan-report-glbs-2833537-2025-12-10","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-jacket-stylish-meeting-white-house-ukraine-russia-war-184940850-16x9.jpg?VersionId=tPT2X22_a8qvlk1iK7nl6sfswDnRU8Ad?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:09:50","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":386650752,"title":"Embajadora de Canadá en EEUU renunciará antes de la revisión del acuerdo de libre comercio","text":"Por ROB GILLIES\n\nTORONTO (AP) — La embajadora de Canadá en Estados Unidos durante los últimos seis años, Kirsten Hillman, anunció el martes que renunciará a su cargo el próximo año mientras ambas naciones se disponen a revisar su tratado de libre comercio.\n\nHillman afirmó en una carta que es el momento adecuado para nombrar a alguien que supervise las conversaciones sobre el Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá (T-MEC), el cual está programado para revisión en 2026.\n\nEl primer ministro canadiense, Mark Carney, señaló que Hillman “preparó las bases para Canadá en la próxima revisión” del acuerdo.\n\nCarney destacó que Hillman es una de las embajadoras con más años de servicio en Estados Unidos en la historia de Canadá.\n\nEl ex primer ministro canadiense Justin Trudeau nombró a Hillman en 2017.

He later held talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, following meetings in London with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\n“Ukraine deeply appreciates all the support of His Holiness Pope Leo XIV and the Holy See – the ongoing humanitarian assistance and the readiness to expand humanitarian missions,” Zelenskyy wrote on X after the audience at the Vatican.\n\nHe said he thanked the pontiff “for his constant prayers for Ukraine” and for calls “for a just peace”, adding that he briefed him on mediation efforts “to return our children abducted by Russia”.\n\n“I invited the Pope to visit Ukraine. This would be a powerful signal of support for our people,” he said.\n\nThe meeting took place at St Peter’s Basilica, the same setting where Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump were pictured sitting face-to-face at the funeral of Pope Francis in April, after a period of public criticism between the two leaders in Washington.\n\nKyiv is seeking to shore up international backing at a crucial moment, with attempts to broker a settlement advancing and the war, soon entering its fourth year.\n\nUkraine has resisted pressure from Washington to quickly accept a ceasefire proposal that officials in Kyiv view as favouring Moscow. Zelenskyy said a revised peace plan now contained 20 points, though there was still no agreement on Russia’s demand that Ukraine surrender occupied territory, which has become the major sticking point in negotiations.\n\nHe said Ukraine would share the updated proposals with the US this week, and remained in constant contact with officials in Washington.\n\nBut Trump earlier on Tuesday warned that Kyiv must make concessions, saying Ukraine is “losing” the war.\n\n“He is going to have to get on the ball and start accepting things,” the US president told Politico.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said via email that they made no arrests in the neighborhood Tuesday, but provided no further details.\n\nOsman said armed ICE agents went to East African restaurants in the neighborhood Tuesday, closed the doors and demanded people’s IDs. They found only U.S. citizens and made no arrests, Osman said.\n\n“Luckily everyone had their passport, because I’ve been telling them to have their passport with them,” Osman said.\n\nAfter checking the IDs of some people stopped at random on the street and temporarily detaining at least one U.S. citizen, Osman said, the agents went in seven to 10 vehicles to a nearby city-owned senior housing complex. There, he said, a group of mostly white young people he called “heroes” blew whistles to sound the alarm and confronted the agents, who responded with pepper spray.\n\n“Thank God so many people showed up there,” Osman said. “(The agents) couldn’t get out of there because people showed up with their cars and whistles.”\n\nOsman said he saw people suffering from the effects of pepper spray. He also said he spoke with one young Somali American who was dragged to a vehicle, detained and taken to an ICE detention center. There, officials finally looked at his U.S. passport, fingerprinted him, and released him but told him to find his own way home, about 6 miles away in snowy weather.\n\n“I just don’t know what they accomplished today other than the chaos,” Osman said.\n\nTrump further stoked tensions last week when he called Somalis “garbage” and said he does not want them in the country. At the same time, federal agents launched the crackdown targeting Minnesota Somalis.\n\nThe president’s moves have drawn denunciations from leaders of the Somali community and Democrats including Gov. Tim Walz, amid relative silence from top state Republicans.\n\nAbout 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the country live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the overwhelming majority of them U.S. citizens. Almost 58% were born in the U.S., and 87% of those born elsewhere are naturalized citizens.\n\nA new website launched by the Department of Homeland Security lists at least six Somalis arrested in Minnesota in recent weeks. The site says it is “highlighting the worst of worst criminal aliens” arrested by ICE to show how agents are “fulfilling President Trump’s promise and carrying out mass deportations.”\n\nICE released a statement Friday listing three other arrested Somalis who did not appear on the website, along with people of other nationalities who it said were arrested in Minneapolis as part of Operation Metro Surge. ICE said they had all been convicted of crimes including sexual abuse minors, robbery and domestic assault.\n\n“Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey protected these criminals at the expense of the safety of Americans,” the statement said. “President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message for criminal illegal aliens: LEAVE NOW. If you don’t, we will find you, arrest you, and deport you.”","summary":"This happened Tuesday during identification checks amid the Trump administration's crackdown on the community.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/09/federal-enforcement-minnesota/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ice_Confrontation_Minneapolis_66834-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:04:30","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":386648774,"title":"Govs. Spencer Cox and Josh Shapiro to discuss political violence in a bipartisan conversation","text":"Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Spencer Cox of Utah are sitting for a wide-ranging interview with \"Today\" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday, as the Democratic and Republican leaders have been at the forefront of handling political violence in their states.

His attorneys had previously argued that he didn't get a fair trial and the jury became biased against him after seeing gruesome crime-scene photos.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the execution and the case, including Geralds' escape from jail with four other inmates while he awaited trial.\n\nExecution deepens Florida's record-setting year\n\nGeralds became the 18th inmate executed in Florida so far this year, blowing past the previous annual high for executions in the state: eight, set in 1984 and matched in 2014.\n\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis has been signing more death warrants than any other governor in state history, saying in May that he wants to bring closure to families who've been waiting sometimes decades for their loved one's killer to be executed.\n\nThe state has another execution scheduled next week, serial killer Frank Athen Walls, for the double murder of a Florida couple in 1987.\n\nMeanwhile, Geralds became the 45th inmate executed in the U.S. this year, a number that hasn't been reached since 2010. Death penalty experts attribute the uptick in executions to the political climate under pro-death penalty President Donald Trump and a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWhat was Mark Allen Geralds convicted of?\n\nOn Feb. 1, 1989, 8-year-old Bart Pettibone came home from school and found the unthinkable: his mother's bloodied body on the kitchen floor. Tressa Lynn Pettibone, 33, had been beaten, tied up, gagged and fatally stabbed twice in the neck and once in the side. A medical examiner determined her wrists had been bound with a plastic tie for at least 20 minutes before she was killed.\n\nThe home had been robbed of designer sunglasses and jewelry, and Tressa's Mercedes was gone.\n\nBart and his older sister, then-14-year-old Blythe, became pivotal in the subsequent investigation, according to court records. They told police that about a week before their mother's murder, they were with her at the mall and ran into Mark Geralds, a 22-year-old carpenter who had worked on remodeling the family's home.\n\nDuring their chat, the kids recalled their mother mentioning that her husband, Kevin, was out of town on business. Soon after, Bart recalled how Geralds walked up to him at the mall's video arcade and asked when his dad would be back and when the kids were normally at school.\n\nPolice later found that Geralds had pawned a gold herringbone necklace that matched one missing from the Pettibone home and had given the pair of sunglasses to a friend. A plastic tie matching the one used on Tressa matched the ties found in Geralds' car, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors told jurors that Geralds was at the home looking for $7,000 in cash that he knew about and beat Pettibone to find out where it was.\n\n\"For 20 minutes, Tressa Pettibone suffered an agonizing beating and torture,\" they said. \"She bled to death in her own home. A woman who was a caring person ... And in her own home, she took the last gasps of breath that she could and sucked blood into her lungs.\"\n\nThe jury found Geralds guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death.\n\nWho was Tressa Lynn Pettibone?\n\nTressa Lynn Pettibone was a 33-year-old married mother who originally came from Ohio before she and her husband settled in a charming, upscale waterfront neighborhood of Panama City, located in northwest Florida between Pensacola and Tallahassee.\n\nTressa's children went on to have their own kids. She would have been a grandmother of at least five and one of her granddaughters bears her name.\n\nPettibone's daughter Blythe posts a tribute to her mom every Mother's Day, saying in a 2024 post that she cherishes each one of the few photos she has of her and her mother.\n\n\"Happy Mother’s Day in heaven, Mom!\" she wrote. \"Thank you for setting the bar so high. You taught me how to be a Mom, and I am so grateful for your example.\"\n\nIn May 2020, she wrote that there's never a time she doesn't wish her mom was with her, \"just to talk to me.\"\n\n\"There have been many times over the years that I would have loved to have asked for her advice, and boy, do I sure miss having her in my corner when life gets rough,\" she wrote. \"She believed in family and fought like a caged lion if you messed with her kids! She was the great protector and defender, and she loved her family with every fiber of her being.\"\n\nThe family was hit with another shocking tragedy in 2022, when Tressa's son Bart Pettibone died suddenly and left behind a wife and three children at the age of 41. His obituary said he \"went home to be with his beloved mother and Jesus.\"\n\nWho was Mark Allen Geralds?\n\nMark Allen Geralds was a 22-year-old with eight prior convictions when he robbed the Pettibones after doing a construction job for them.\n\nDuring the sentencing portion of his trial, Geralds' attorneys argued that he should be spared from the death penalty because of his young age, his \"love and concern\" for his daughter and wife, his bipolar manic personality disorder and because \"he came from a divorced family and was unloved by his mother,\" according to court records.\n\nIn 1990, Geralds made headlines when he escaped from jail while awaiting trial.\n\nAccording to archived news reports, Geralds' was behind bars at the Bay County Jail, Florida's first privately run jail in state history. His wife was accused of slipping saw blades to Geralds during a visit.\n\nHe and four other maximum-security inmates used the blades to cut through a metal frame and punch out a sixth-floor window. They then climbed down a rope made of bedsheets and blankets. Geralds and most of the other inmates were recaptured within hours of the escape.\n\nWhen is the next execution?\n\nThe next execution in the U.S. is set for this week in Tennessee. The state is scheduled to execute serial rapist Harold Wayne Nichols on Thursday, Dec. 11, for the 1988 rape and murder of 20-year-old Karen Pulley.\n\nTwo more executions are scheduled this year, one in Georgia and another in Florida. That puts the U.S. on pace to put 48 men to death in 2025.\n\nAmanda Lee Myers is a senior crime reporter who covers cold case investigations and the death penalty for USA TODAY.

The plaintiffs are utilising the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain a classified memorandum prepared by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding the strikes that occurred in September 2025.Inside the government, the OLC acts as the final word on what the President can and cannot do. Its opinions provide a legal shield, allowing the administration to sideline standard regulations if the office decides a specific military action is constitutional. Keeping this analysis classified effectively creates a shadow legal code, one where drug trafficking suspects can be treated as enemy combatants without public scrutiny.The ACLU argues that the release of the information is 'critically important to ensuring informed public debate about the US military's unprecedented strikes', which the group asserts were carried out 'in clear violation of domestic and international law'.'The US military may not summarily kill civilians who are merely suspected of smuggling drugs,' the union added, noting that it is imperative that the government take 'non-lethal measures' before resorting to a more drastic action.Boat Strike in the Caribbean SeaOn 2 September, the US launched airstrikes on a small Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean Sea suspected of trafficking drugs. There were 11 people aboard, but two individuals survived the first strike.Surveillance footage reviewed by lawmakers reportedly depicts the aftermath. The two men were seen trying to stay afloat, appearing confused and distressed. Despite their incapacitated state, US forces launched a second strike approximately an hour later, killing both survivors.This specific action has drawn accusations of war crimes. Under the Geneva Conventions, combatants who are hors de combat (out of the fight) due to injury or shipwreck are protected from attack.Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who viewed the footage, condemned the decision. 'You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel,' he stated. '[They] were not in the position to continue their mission in any way.'A Shift in Rules of EngagementWhile US military assets routinely patrol the region, the September strikes represent a paradigm shift. Historically, counter-narcotics operations involve naval forces stopping and boarding vessels to seize contraband and detain suspects for trial.The decision to destroy the vessels from the air, rather than interdict them, suggests the administration has reclassified drug trafficking as an act of war rather than a criminal enterprise. This aggressive posture bypasses the judicial process entirely, replacing arrest warrants with Hellfire missiles.Trump's Statement & Involvement in the OperationPresident Donald Trump has offered conflicting accounts of his involvement. While Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson confirmed that 'the President and the Secretary are the ones directing these strikes', Trump appeared to distance himself during a recent interview.When asked by Politico whether the second strike on the survivors was necessary, the President replied: 'Uh, well, it looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don't get involved in that. That's up to them.'However, he defended the broader strategy using a utilitarian argument. Trump praised Admiral Frank Mitchell, who oversaw the operation, and justified the lethal force by citing the potential harm caused by narcotics.'We save 25,000 people every time we knock out a boat,' Turmp claimed. This statement implies a policy where the potential future harm of the drugs is used to legally justify the immediate use of lethal force against the smugglers, a novel and controversial legal theory that the ACLU is determined to expose.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/aclu-sues-pentagon-says-caribbean-drug-boat-strikes-violated-us-international-law-1761739","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1774697/boat-caribbean.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3ca00a59cdeec1b669df620c5af01f48","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:00:34","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.137},{"id":386647472,"title":"Airports got you down?

According to the press release, they will also push for family TSA lines, children’s play areas, sensory rooms for “children with special needs,” and nursing areas. \n\nHowever nice that sentiment may be, the Trump administration’s plan conveniently—once again—shifts the attention away from the billionaire airline owners making delays, canceled flights, and long layovers a part of travel. Instead, the former MTV star has been putting that hard-earned taxpayer-funded salary to work by telling people that, maybe, the travel experience would be better if everyone dressed nicer. \n\n“I would encourage people to maybe dress a little better, which encourages us to maybe behave a little better,” Duffy said to reporters last month. “Let’s try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.”\n\nRelated | Sean Duffy faces pajama protest after playing fashion police\n\nBut just past the thinly veiled victim-blaming is the Trump administration’s attempt to protect airlines and keep the more than 5,000 daily delays a status quo.\n\nIn November, the administration rescinded a Biden-era bill requiring airlines to compensate travelers for delays of three or more hours and to pay back customers for money spent on food and housing during long delays. A new bill has since been introduced by Democrats proposing similar requirements.\n\nBut given Duffy and President Donald Trump’s track record, the outlook is dim. After all, the administration just waived Southwest Airlines’ $11 million fine, which it was supposed to pay after leaving 2 million customers stranded during a 2022 operational meltdown.\n\nOn the bright side, as airlines are getting pats on the back while not being held accountable, travelers can get nice and sweaty at one of Duffy’s airport gyms—while wearing a suit, of course—before boarding their 10-hour, tightly cramped flight.","summary":"As everyone knows, the worst part of air travel these days is that there’s nowhere to do pull-ups.

Premier Li Qiang made the remarks at a forum of top international organisations held in Beijing while top Chinese leaders are attending an annual economic planning meeting.\n\n“Starting from the beginning of this year, we’ve seen the stick of tariffs being wielded around the world with growing restrictive measures on the economy and trade, which have dealt a severe blow to the global economy,” Li said, without mentioning US President Donald Trump and his tariff hikes specifically.\n\n“As the situation has unfolded, the damaging consequences of tariffs hurting both others and oneself have become increasingly evident, and calls from all sides to uphold free trade have grown ever stronger,” Li told the gathering of top representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation. Trump’s sharply higher tariffs on imports from China and other countries have dented Chinese exports to the US, but that has been offset by higher shipments to other global markets. Chinese customs figures reported Monday showed exports to the United States plunged 29 per cent in November from a year earlier in the eighth straight month of declines.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s trade surplus in dollar terms for 2025 had already exceeded $1 trillion as of November, while exports rose 5.9 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nTrade friction between Beijing and Washington has eased somewhat after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in late October during a regional economic summit in South Korea. The two sides agreed to dial back earlier steps and extend a truce in retaliatory measures for a year. With investments in technology rising, outpacing overall investments, Li called for “collaborative innovation,” saying “we need to embrace an open mind and work hand in hand to pursue openness and cooperation.” The Central Economic Work Conference, the annual planning meeting held this week, follows a top-level meeting in October to draft China’s plan for 2026-2030.\n\nIt focused on China’s aim to remain a global manufacturing power and build a stronger domestic economy that is more reliant on consumer spending and technological advances. China’s economy grew at a 4.8 per cent annual pace in the last quarter, the slowest pace in a year. However, economists expect growth to hit the official 2025 target of about 5 per cent, thanks partly to strong exports.","url":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/2025/business/china-s-surplus-surpasses--1-trillion.html","image":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2025/story/images/big/china---s-surplus-surpasses--1-trillion-2025-12-10.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:00:00","author":"Daily Pioneer","authors":["Daily Pioneer"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.09},{"id":386644850,"title":"Federal agents use pepper spray on crowd in Somali neighborhood of Minneapolis amid Trump crackdown","text":"Federal agents used pepper spray to push through an angry crowd that blocked their vehicles as they checked identifications in a heavily Somali neighborhood of Minneapolis on Tuesday, amid the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown targeting the community.\n\nCity Council Member Jamal Osman, a Somali American who represents the neighborhood, witnessed the confrontation, as did an Associated Press videographer. \n\nMinnesota’s Somali community — the largest in the U.S. — has been on edge the past couple of weeks since President Donald Trump said in a social media post Thanksgiving night that he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for them.\n\nIt is not clear how many Somali community members have been arrested, temporarily detained or asked to show documents as part of the crackdown, which has also netted people of other nationalities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said via email that they made no arrests in the neighborhood Tuesday, but provided no further details.\n\nOsman said armed ICE agents went to East African restaurants in the neighborhood Tuesday, closed the doors and demanded people's IDs. They found only U.S. citizens and made no arrests, Osman said.\n\n“Luckily everyone had their passport, because I've been telling them to have their passport with them,” Osman said.\n\nAfter checking the IDs of some people stopped at random on the street and temporarily detaining at least one U.S. citizen, Osman said, the agents went in seven to 10 vehicles to a nearby city-owned senior housing complex. There, he said, a group of mostly white young people he called “heroes” blew whistles to sound the alarm and confronted the agents, who responded with pepper spray.\n\n“Thank God so many people showed up there,” Osman said. “(The agents) couldn't get out of there because people showed up with their cars and whistles.”\n\nOsman said he saw people suffering from the effects of pepper spray. He also said he spoke with one young Somali American who was dragged to a vehicle, detained and taken to an ICE detention center. There, officials finally looked at his U.S. passport, fingerprinted him, and released him but told him to find his own way home, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away in snowy weather.\n\n“I just don’t know what they accomplished today other than the chaos,\" Osman said.\n\nTrump further stoked tensions last week when he called Somalis “garbage” and said he does not want them in the country. At the same time, federal agents launched the crackdown targeting Minnesota Somalis.\n\nThe president's moves have drawn denunciations from leaders of the Somali community and Democrats including Gov. Tim Walz, amid relative silence from top state Republicans.\n\nAbout 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the country live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the overwhelming majority of them U.S. citizens. Almost 58% were born in the U.S., and 87% of those born elsewhere are naturalized citizens.\n\nA new website launched by the Department of Homeland Security lists at least six Somalis arrested in Minnesota in recent weeks. The site says it is “highlighting the worst of worst criminal aliens” arrested by ICE to show how agents are “fulfilling President Trump’s promise and carrying out mass deportations.”\n\nICE released a statement Friday listing three other arrested Somalis who did not appear on the website, along with people of other nationalities who it said were arrested in Minneapolis as part of Operation Metro Surge. ICE said they had all been convicted of crimes including sexual abuse minors, robbery and domestic assault.\n\n“Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey protected these criminals at the expense of the safety of Americans,” the statement said. “President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message for criminal illegal aliens: LEAVE NOW. If you don’t, we will find you, arrest you, and deport you.”","summary":"Federal agents have used pepper spray to disperse a crowd in a heavily Somali neighborhood in Minneapolis","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-minneapolis-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-minnesota-tim-walz-b2881433.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/00/Ice_Confrontation_Minneapolis_66834.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 23:56:14","author":"Mark Vancleave","authors":["Mark Vancleave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.455},{"id":386644852,"title":"The EPA erases mentions of human-fueled climate change from its web pages","text":"The Environmental Protection Agency, under the direction of the Trump administration, has removed some of its language noting that climate change is driven by human burning of fossil fuels.\n\nInformation noting that humans are the drivers of climate change has been deleted from one of the agency's webpages titled “Causes of Climate Change” and from another tracking the impact of global warming in the U.S., according to a New York Times report.\n\nThe deletions come amid the Trump administration's efforts to boost oil, gas, and coal in energy production. The burning of those fuel sources is the primary driver of climate change.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been consistently dismissive of climate change, calling it a “hoax” and working to kill fossil fuel regulations while making renewable energy initiatives more difficult. Earlier this year, the president ended a tax credit that incentivized car buyers to purchase electric vehicles.\n\nRachel Cleetus, the senior policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Times that the EPA is “trying to bury the evidence on human-caused climate change” and called the deletions “part of an ongoing attack on science” by the Trump administration.\n\nCurrently, the EPA's website discussing the causes of climate change only includes natural phenomena—like the Earth's orbital changes and solar activity—as drivers of climate change.\n\nTwo previous sections of the site, “Climate Change Indicators” and “Climate Change Impacts and Analysis,” have been removed completely, according to E&E News.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the EPA. \n\nAn archived version of the EPA's website from October was clear in its messaging about humans and climate change.\n\n“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land,” the website said in October.\n\nThe current website acknowledges that “recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone,” but does not describe the other contributing factors.\n\nWhen questioned about the changes by E&E News, an EPA spokesperson gave a Trump-like response referencing the “climate cult.”\n\n“Unlike the previous administration, the Trump EPA is focused on protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback, not left-wing political agendas,” the spokesperson told the outlet. “As such, this agency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult.”\n\nNot all of the references to human-induced climate change have been removed, however.\n\nIn one section of the agency's site explaining the “basics of climate science,” there remains information noting that climate change since 1950 has largely been driven by human activity.\n\n“Greenhouse gases come from a variety of human activities, including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products,” the webpage said as of Monday.","summary":"A spokesperson for the EPA said the agency ‘no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/epa-human-climate-change-removed-website-b2881425.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/09/23/25/GettyImages-2243069330.jpeg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hI4ZVjY0-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-09 23:56:13","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.102}]}
