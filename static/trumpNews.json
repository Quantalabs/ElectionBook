But this time, it’s the Iranians, not the Russians, making the first significant move. On Friday, Microsoft released a report declaring that a hacking group run by the intelligence unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had successfully breached the account of a “former senior adviser” to a presidential campaign. From that account, Microsoft said, the group sent fake email messages, known as “spear phishing,” to “a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign” in an effort to break into the campaign’s own accounts and databases. By Saturday night, former President Donald J. Trump was declaring that Microsoft had informed his campaign “that one of our many websites was hacked by the Iranian Government — Never a nice thing to do!” but that the hackers had obtained only “publicly available information.” He attributed it all to what he called, in his signature selective capitalization, a “Weak and Ineffective” Biden administration. The facts were murkier, and it is unclear what, if anything, the Iranian group, which Microsoft called Mint Sandstorm, was able to achieve.","summary":"Donald J.

Raja Krishnamoorthi","text":"There’s going to be a lot more going on at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago besides the official speeches each night at the United Center — culminating with presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., agreed to give us an insider tour. Delegates start arriving next weekend for the convention kicking off August 19. There are hundreds of events adjacent to the convention — fundraisers — for federal, state and local Democrats; policy panels and symposiums; breakfasts, luncheons, receptions, reunions and after-parties, as well as meetings of Democratic constituent groups. This was true for the Republicans at their convention in Milwaukee last month. I did a column with Rep. Darin LaHood R-Ill., taking us behind the scenes; this is the Democratic version with Krishnamoorthi, who is a delegate, as our guide. Since at least May, Krishnamoorthi’s convention schedule has been filling up. “The number one reason for the convention is to come together and unify and make sure that we can learn from each other and implement strategies to defeat Donald Trump,” Krishnamoorthi said. “I think that is kind of the most important principle underlying all the activities of the convention. In terms of the actual, you know, events that I participate in, I would say they fall into four buckets.” Krishnamoorthi has emerged as a major national fundraiser. His first bucket is filled with fundraising events. He is a member of the Harris Victory Fund National Finance Committee, and he is also a member of the Harris for President AAPI Leadership Council. Krishnamoorthi was born in India, and he came to the U.S. as a youth. His second bucket is around Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders events and fundraising. Turning out the AAPI voters in the swing states will be critical for Harris, whose father is from Jamaica and mother from India. Krishnamoorthi’s third convention bucket will deal with events pivoting off his being the ranking member of the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. Krishnamoorthi is the first South Asian American to be leader of a congressional committee. As for the fourth bucket, “there’s just a lot of different parties to celebrate Chicago and causes and people important to Chicago.” Starting Saturday, Krishnamoorthi will be making the rounds of various welcome receptions. He will also take part in what is a donor perk — the Harris Victory Fund Podium Preview at the United Center. The VIP donors and fundraisers— that is those who gave or raised above $89,200, according to a document I saw — will be invited to a guided tour of the stage. There’s more to it than what you can see on TV. He will also go to an evening event to support Cook County Board Member Monica Gordon’s campaign for Cook County clerk. On Monday, Krishnamoorthi will be speaking in the morning at the Democratic National Committee’s AAPI Caucus event. During the convention days, the McCormick Place complex will be the home to a variety of DNC councils focused on issues relating to climate, small business, labor, poverty, faith, veterans and military families, rural voters and youth. There are caucus group meetings for Native Americans, AAPI, Hispanics, Blacks, LGBTQ+ and people from the disability and women’s communities. Later, in connection with his China work, Krishnamoorthi will be hosting a roundtable with Chicago-area businesses to discuss American competitiveness and specifically the strategic competition with China. After that he will be speaking at an event to benefit South Asians for America, a group focusing on increasing the political clout of the AAPI community by mobilizing their vote. On Tuesday afternoon, Krishnamoorthi is hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House political organization with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other House Democrats. Krishnamoorthi then goes on to be a co-host of a “Reception with AAPI Leaders” with Sen. Tammy Duckworth and the AAPI Victory Fund, a major political action committee. On Wednesday, there is a speech to the Alliance for American Manufacturing Policy Forum; a stop by a Planned Parenthood event and then a watch party and reception that the Cook County Democratic Party is throwing for people who don’t have credentials to get into the United Center. I’m not sure how Krishnamoorthi will end Thursday, the convention’s last day. He’s starting in the morning by ringing the bell at a ceremony at what’s known as the CBOE, the derivatives and exchange network that got its start as the Chicago Board Options Exchange.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/11/dnc-2024-insiders-guide-raja-krishnamoorthi-united-center-aapi-labor-voter-election-china-politics","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e290b83/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5315x3034+0+254/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F44%2Fd3%2Fed9f00b3420a9cf26afb6a542397%2Fkris","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 00:30:08","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.287},{"id":253898696,"title":"In Trump vs. Harris, It’s Reality-TV Ringleading vs. the TikTok Ticket","text":"The defining moment of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate to date — the one that birthed all the others — was a ride down an escalator in a tower he developed during a TV appearance he stage-managed to build on an empire of wish-fulfillment he created. The defining moment of Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate to date — the one birthing all the others — was a British pop star she’s never met referencing an album she hadn’t heard in a post she didn’t control using a term she didn’t know. The presidential contest now unfolding is about a lot of things — globalism vs. nativism, feminism vs. machismo, wokeness vs. Muskism, positivity vs. anxiety and, oh yeah, competing visions on climate, abortion and immigration. But it is also about something else: radically different communication philosophies. In Trump, Republicans have a classic form of showmanship: Narratives are scripted for maximum entertainment, directed by one auteur and released to the masses with a targeted set of goals. In Harris, Democrats have a sharply of-the-moment style in which an army of people far from politics shape messages that are then channeled by the campaign, which often serves more as the story’s reactive subject than its shepherd. Call it reality-TV ringleaders vs. the TikTok Ticket. “What we see in front of us is practically a laboratory experiment in two different approaches to media,” said Bob Thompson, the longtime Syracuse University professor and observer of our communication culture, when reached about the subject last week. That’s even true down-ticket. J.D. Vance got where he is thanks to a literary best-seller, the ur-form of top-down messaging. Tim Walz happened because groups of online users decided to lift him up after watching several of his videos. (Though he did partly engineer his rise; he is still a politician.) Meme culture as applied to campaigning has a kind of feedback-loop dynamic. Fans spontaneously run with a message; the campaign then gets a hold of it and guides them. Take Swifties for Kamala, a group started by Gen Z fans with connections to neither the star nor the candidate. In just a few weeks the group amassed 34,000 followers on Instagram, generated a slew of TikTok remixes (if you’ve always wanted to hear political speeches sampled into “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me,” this is your chance) and generated at least two calls with the campaign — which then dispatched the Swifties to go out and spread the message further. There was also the now-famous Charli XCX “kamala IS brat” post three weeks ago, an “I Like Ike” for the great-grandkids. While the post wasn’t ordered by Harris, the campaign quickly jumped on it by changing its social backgrounds to reflect the new speed-drive reality. Why order a campaign bus when you can ride hot through the streets on a different frequency? Characters in this scheme are less crafted than crowd-sourced. Harris’ most famous line, “I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” is tellingly a throwaway from a 2023 speech in which she was quoting someone else. And yet it has become one of the best-known pronouncements of any presidential candidate in recent memory thanks to a slew of people anointing it so — then deputizing themselves to spread the word via a wave of dance remixes, lime-green t-shirts and coconut emojis. The idea of an online army of pop-stan operatives stands in stark contrast to Harris’ opponent. Trump was, it’s true, once a novel deployer of social media in his own right, defining his candidacy (and later his presidency) by Tweets sent at all hours of the night. But even those had a decidedly old-school vibe, scripted episodes in a drama one man programmed like an impulsive network executive. Even his own people often didn’t know what was coming. The centrality of this approach to his electoral success was underscored Friday when a new paper from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center and Columbia University concluded that Trump’s appearance on The Apprentice enabled his win in 2016. His depiction as “‘America’s Boss’ – a successful businessman; a savvy negotiator; a tough but supportive mentor; adept at reaching profitable deals in high-pressure situations” was what “increased Donald Trump’s electoral performance in the 2016 Republican primary,” the American Political Science Review wrote. Trump’s M.O. was to craft a persona he then firmly controlled. As the former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt wrote in a chock-full tell-all on Slate in May, what the series did was nothing less than invent and introduce a franchise character. “In the show, he appeared to demonstrate impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth, even though his businesses had barely survived multiple bankruptcies,” Pruitt wrote. Having been given the role of a lifetime, Trump went on to hone and perform it on the world’s largest stages. Trump’s lurch to newer media has proved less smooth. Last week at Mar-a-Lago, he sat for a livestream interview with right-wing gamer Adin Ross on the videogame platform Kick that featured cringey moments like Ross showing him how the chat feature worked. Far from making him seem young, the contrast with a 23-year-old influencer actually made Trump seem even older and resulted in some laughing commentary from the gaming community. “Trump is in a way trying to punch up with these appearances. It’s really hard to do, and I’m not sure he should do it,” said Liz Stahl, the founder of the Los Angeles-based social-media consultancy In Haus, when asked in an interview how she thought such efforts were going. In fact, the most successful viral moment to hit the Trump-Vance campaign was of the unwanted kind, when a slew of mocking memes erupted several weeks ago about the Ohio senator allegedly admitting in his book he had achieved a different kind of congress with his couch. He hadn’t. But like the pre-internet virality that dented earlier candidates — from Lyndon B Johnson’s infamous “daisy” 1964 ad insinuating Barry Goldwater would bring nuclear war to the U.S. to George H.W. Bush’s notorious “Willie Horton” spot in 1988 claiming Michael Dukakis was freeing scores of rapists and murderers — the truth of the claim mattered less than the stickiness of the message. The same story was playing out this weekend when Trump used Celine Dion’s theme song from Titanic at a campaign rally in Montana, prompting many online jokes about how the candidate’s arc was paralleling the movie’s. The Harris campaign was quick to leap in. Mudslinging circa 2024 doesn’t require a candidate hurling the dirt; they just have to show up without a towel when someone else does. However, experts say it would be folly to assume a fully bottom-up approach from the Democratic candidate. “There’s no doubt that there’s a big upswell in organic interest in Kamala Karris,” said Samuel Woolley, a University of Pittsburgh researcher and longtime project director for propaganda research at the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas, which is one of the leading experts on the origins and implications of influencer content. “But there’s also certainly inorganic content being pushed,” he said when reached this weekend, using the term for content that is being dictated by someone other than the poster. This is enabled by a slew of high-end, close-to-the-vest consultancies hired by campaigns, such as the liberal-skewing People First, which pay for or simply coordinate content from influencers without disclosing their involvement. “Employing influencers has become a pretty normal practice in political campaigns, and Harris is doing it very shrewdly,” Woolley said. Actually discerning what is paid content, let alone stopping it, is extremely hard; social media companies have shown little interest in disclosing or preventing these arrangements, while the FEC has been unmoved to regulate them like traditional political ads. Even straight-up organic content can be hard to trace, with every origin moment leading to something that came before (you could even say it didn’t fall out of a coconut tree). In fact, Charli XCX’s post itself was not the start but a response to a host of organic memes that had already existed on TikTok, setting Harris’ speeches to Charli tracks. (That all this is unspooling against the legislative to-and-fro of a TikTok ban, incidentally, is its own form of viral deliciousness.) All this meme content harks back to ancient 20th-century forms of media momentum-builders. But it also differs from them. If “I Like Ike” propelled Eisenhower all the way to the presidency with a Roy O. Disney jingle and an everyone’s-doing-it vibe, “kamala IS brat” has yet to prove it can last until the voting starts, let alone influence behavior then. “Social media virality usually only works for a political campaign if there’s a bridge to the issues — to something substantive,” said social media consultant Stahl. “Otherwise, it’s just a lot of momentum to nowhere.” (Some of the first polls to come after the viral groundswell show marked bumps for Harris, but causality is difficult to prove.) It would be tempting to see a Harris win in November as a new day, the baton-pass from a single controlled spectacle to the unruly shards of a thousand dance remixes — a meme’s lime-green cool overtaking the can’t-look-away orange of a showman’s sun. Conversely, a Trump win would prove the durability of the reality form. Voting is more complicated than that, of course, and such conclusions would be facile. Still, American media culture only rarely brings such a full transition to a new era, let alone offers up a national election with two candidates standing on such opposite sides of its boundary. Whatever happens in November — or next week — a new set of media colors has emerged. And now that it has, politics may never be seen the same way again.","summary":"The defining moment of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate to date — the one that birthed all the others — was a ride down an escalator in a tower he developed during a TV appearance he stage-managed to build on an empire of wish-fulfillment he created.

At issue is an image that emerged from a Harris-Walz rally at the Detroit Metro Airport on Wednesday that shows a large crowd standing in front of Air Force Two – the official airplane of the vice president. Right-wingers have wrongfully alleged that inconsistencies in the news photo reveal that it was digitally manipulated – pointing to a lack of a reflection on the plane’s turbine. But the size of the crowd could easily be proven by videos of the event. Still, Trump seized on the issue on Sunday, claiming on his Truth Social platform that Harris ‘AI’d it.’ ‘Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?’ he wrote. ‘There was nobody at the plane, and she “AI’d” it, and showed a massive “crowd” of so-caled followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!’ ‘She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting and the “crowd” looks like 10,000 people!’ he continued. ‘Same thing is happening with her fake “crowds at her speeches.’ ‘This is the way Democrats win Elections,’ Trump argued. ‘She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. ‘Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!’ Other Republicans have made similar claims, with commentator Dinesh D’Souza telling his followers to ‘check the reflection in the plane. ‘Does this look like a real picture to you?’ he asked on Saturday. Another X user also claimed that ‘if you look closely at the paint job of the airplane, you’ll notice that the crowd does not reflect in the paint. ‘Her crowd is fake. Her voters are fake. Her marriage is fake. Her political career is fake,’ the X user wrote. But the size of the crowd at the Harris rally could easily be proven by videos of the event. Fact check website Snopes also said that the Winston AI Detector determined the image was ’96 percent human’ – meaning that it was ‘likely photographed by someone and not created using an AI-generation tool.’ If anything, Snopes’ findings indicate that ‘it’s possible that [the photograph’s] lighting, shadows or filtering was digitally manipulated’ but not the photo as a whole. Spectrum News has also determined ‘the crowd did in fact exist, and the rally was attended by thousands of people, many of whom posted their own pictures and videos of the event, which was also livestreamed by dozens of news channels and attended by a slew of prominent politicians.’ It went on to quote Michigan outlet MLive, which said ‘About 15,000 people filled the hangar, the crowd spilling out onto the tarmac.’ The Harris campaign has now hit back at the former president for spreading the baseless accusation. ‘1) This is an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan,’ the campaign posted on X. ‘2) Trump has still not campaigned in a swing state in over a week… Low energy?’ Trump’s claims that Harris was inflating the size of her rallies came amid a bad week for the former president as he begins to lose his advantage on base fervor and crowd size. Democratic enthusiasm skyrocketed after Harris took over her 81-year-old boss’ campaign. A new New York Times and Siena College poll shows Harris up by four points among likely voters in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Cook Political Report has reset its ratings to ‘toss-up’ for Georgia, Arizona and Nevada – after earlier rating them as ‘lean Republican,’ Another shock poll shows that more Americans trust Harris than the former president on the economy. Trump’s standing on economic issues remained unchanged from July to August, with 41 percent approving of his handling, the Financial Times/University of Michigan Ross School of Business poll found. Meanwhile, Harris has a 1-point advantage, which is well within the August 1-5 survey’s 3.1 percent margin of error. But Harris’ 42 percent approval among 1,001 registered voters is a huge 7-point jump from Biden’s results last month where he stood at just 35 percent. Trump’s advisors are now pleading with him to adopt a new ‘hard-hitting’ stump speech that would define Harris as liberal and weak – and forego his improvising. The advisors say the vice president will only grow her lead in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention, especially if they do not attack her first, according to Axios. Republicans close to the former president say now needs to bring new focus to his messages, which they admitted could often be self-indulgent and meandering. ‘President Trump knows he’s the only one who can end the media’s honeymoon with Kamala Harris, and he sees a significant opening to do so with Harris’ inability to defend her record on inflation and the border,’ one source told Axios. ‘To get past the media force field protecting Harris, however, he needs to be very specific with his policy contrasts and is planning on debuting a hard-hitting stump speech very soon.’ DailyMail.com has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has claimed his opponent Kamala Harris is faking&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump suggests that Kamala Harris rally attendance is not real by sharing an AI-manipulated photo &#8211; the situation is more complicated than it appears. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-suggests-that-kamala-harris-rally-attendance-is-not-real-by-sharing-an-ai-manipulated-photo-the-situation-is-more-complicated-than-it-appears/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-claims-Kamala-Harris-rally-crowd-is.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 00:14:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.645},{"id":253898542,"title":"Paris passes on hosting the Olympics in 2028 to Los Angeles with support from Tom Cruise and Mayor Karen Bass","text":"SAINT-DENIS, France — Paris closed out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show in France’s national stadium on Sunday, handing over hosting duties for the Summer Games to the next city in line: Los Angeles in 2028. In a display of Hollywood showmanship, Tom Cruise descended from the top of the French stadium to the “Mission Impossible” theme song, shaking hands with athletes, before taking the Olympic flag from star gymnast Simone Biles, putting it on the back of a motorcycle and driving out of the stadium. In a prerecorded ride past the Eiffel Tower, Cruise drove his bike onto a plane and then skydived out of it over the Hollywood Hills. Three rings were added to the O’s of the famed Hollywood sign to create five interlaced Olympic rings. It was just one of the highlights of the closing ceremony that put a final flourish to Paris’ first Games in a century, with an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg – plus longtime collaborator Dr. Dre – performed at Venice Beach as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. At the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron – powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels – had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories – a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.” With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes – many wearing their shiny medals – and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach – who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show – said the Games “can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,” noting that the athletes “respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.” The national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals – 16 of them gold – marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals – each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women – the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday. The women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of the city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Jolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ.Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France &#8212; Paris closed out two and a half extraordinary weeks&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Paris passes on hosting the Olympics in 2028 to Los Angeles with support from Tom Cruise and Mayor Karen Bass first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/paris-passes-on-hosting-the-olympics-in-2028-to-los-angeles-with-support-from-tom-cruise-and-mayor-karen-bass/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 00:06:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.626},{"id":253898728,"title":"2024 Paris Olympic games close with a final star-studded show","text":"SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) — Paris is closing out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show in France’s national stadium, handing over hosting duties for the Summer Games to the next city in line: Los Angeles in 2028.

Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach — who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show — said the Games “can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,” noting that the athletes “respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.” The national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals — 16 of them gold — marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals — each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women — the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday. The women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Jolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ. Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them.","summary":"Paris is closing out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show.","url":"https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/08/11/paris-olympics-closing-ceremony/","image":"https://toronto.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2024/08/11/CP215320599-2-scaled-e1723420377186.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 00:04:00","author":"Denio Lourenco,John Leicester","authors":["Denio Lourenco","John Leicester"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.634},{"id":253898630,"title":"Biden to campaign for Harris in battleground state Pennsylvania","text":"President Joe Biden said in comments broadcast on Sunday that he would campaign for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in November’s presidential election. Biden made his remarks in an interview with CBS, his first since announcing in late July that he would pull out of the race against Republican candidate Donald Trump over concerns about the future of U.S. democracy. Harris leads Trump by four points in Pennsylvania and two other key swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan, according to polls by the New York Times and Siena College released on Saturday. Asked whether he would be campaigning for Harris, Biden replied: “Yes.” Biden said he and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro “are putting together a campaign tour in Pennsylvania. I’m going to be campaigning in other states as well and I’m going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most.” Harris announced last week that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz would be her vice presidential running mate. “He’s my kind of guy, he’s real, he’s smart, I’ve known him for several decades. I think it’s a hell of a team,” said Biden. The president, who decided to step down in the wake of a disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27, said internal polls showed the race would have been very close. “But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races and I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you’d be interviewing me about,” he said. In an initial excerpt of the interview released last Wednesday, Biden said he was not confident about a peaceful transfer of power in the United States if Trump lost.","summary":"President Joe Biden said in comments broadcast on Sunday that he would campaign for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in November&#8217;s presidential election.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/11/breaking-news/biden-to-campaign-for-harris-in-battleground-state-pennsylvania/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-11T141859Z_1_LYNXMPEK7A05M_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:52:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.029},{"id":253898176,"title":"Major Union Endorses Harris’s Promise to End Taxes on Tips After Criticizing Trump for Same Plan","text":"The Culinary Workers Union in Nevada endorsed a plan by Vice President Kamala Harris to end taxes on tips for service workers after criticizing former President Donald Trump for proposing the same plan two months prior. During a rally in Las Vegas on Aug. 10, Harris said that she would back ending taxes on tips if elected president, mirroring a policy proposal put forward by Trump at the beginning of June. “It is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers,” Harris said during an Aug. 10 rally in Las Vegas. The Culinary Workers Union, which oversees a crucial voting bloc in the battleground state of Nevada, was quick to endorse the plan. The Culinary Union urged other elected leaders to support efforts by Harris toward these goals. Neither the union nor Harris mentioned that Trump had proposed part of the same plan. “For those hotel workers and people who get tips, you’re going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,” Trump said in Las Vegas. The former president said he would do this “right away, first thing in office.” “For decades, the Culinary Union has fought for tipped workers’ rights and against unfair taxation,” Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said on June 9, immediately following Trump’s reveal of the proposal. “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” the statement added. The Culinary Union did not immediately return a request for comment. Securing an end to taxes on tips would be a tall order for either candidate. Doing so would require the passage of a tax legislation including provisions to alter how the IRS classifies tips. During Trump’s first term in office, the Republican-controlled House and Senate passed a significant revamping of the tax code that cut both corporate and individual rates. Under that bill, corporate rate cuts were made permanent, while cuts to the individual tax rate are temporary and will expire next year. Trump has said that passing a comprehensive new tax bill would be a key focus for him during the first year of his second term in office. Democrats have also expressed interest in passing new tax legislation. Many of their proposals focus on weighting the tax code more heavily against the very wealthy.","summary":"The Culinary Workers Union, which oversees a crucial voting bloc in the battleground state of Nevada, was quick to endorse Harris's plan.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/major-union-endorses-harriss-promise-to-end-taxes-on-tips-after-criticizing-trump-for-same-plan-5703838","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/10/id5703251-Harris-Trump--300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:44:50","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":253897532,"title":"What the papers say – August 12","text":"The funeral of one of the young victims of the Southport stabbing attack features heavily on Monday’s front pages, which report on hundreds of mourners lining the streets.

Paris closed its record-breakingly successful Olympic Games on Sunday night with a stunt-filled final ceremony that began with a mysterious, golden intergalactic traveller wandering through a gloomy, barren futuristic landscape, tasked with resurrecting the Olympic spirit. Ghostly dancers and acrobats – some of whom were fire-service gymnasts – descended from the Stade de France stadium roof and leaped on to giant Olympic rings while the Swiss musician Alain Roche performed Hymn to Apollo floating in the air playing a vertically suspended piano. The French singer Yseult gave a breathtaking performance of My Way, a nod to French-US relations as a French song that was rearranged in English for Frank Sinatra. Paris said goodbye to its Olympics with a message about the importance of protecting the spirit of the games in an uncertain world riven by conflict. The dramatic, pyrotechnic show was a fitting riposte to the epic, Technicolor riverside opening ceremony that broke with tradition by taking place along the Seine two weeks earlier. From that moment, the Paris Games had seen record ticket sales and TV viewing figures, and even a historic number of marriage proposals among athletes. “Humanity is beautiful when it comes together,” said the theatre and opera director Thomas Jolly of his stadium show about celebrating “respect and tolerance” in a fragile world. He called the Games and the closing performance “a unique opportunity to share, reconcile and repair”. The ceremony began before dusk beneath Paris’s groundbreaking Olympic cauldron suspended from a balloon, a dramatic ring of fire made up of electricity and LED spotlights to give the appearance of being ablaze. The balloon-cauldron has become the city’s newest star attraction as thousands have gathered near the Louvre to watch it rise into the sky each night at sundown, and politicians are arguing that it should be kept in Paris permanently as a new landmark. Beneath it, the award-winning young singer Zaho de Sagazan, whose voice and lyrics have transformed chanson française over the past two years, sang the classic 1950s ode to Paris Sous le Ciel de Paris, made famous by Édith Piaf. Suddenly, France’s star swimmer and gold-medal winner Léon Marchand, hailed in France as Le Roi Léon, appeared to whisk away the flame and the cauldron went out. At that moment, more than 70,000 spectators in France’s biggest stadium began roaring and cheering as the action began. The Stade de France, which only days before had seen the high drama of the athletics relays and successes such as Armand Duplantis, the Swedish pole vaulter who broke his own world record, had now been transformed into a futuristic, glittering, undulating stage set. Thousands of volunteers and athletes filled the stadium in a flag-waving moment of togetherness, not seen on this scale in these Games until now because the athletes had appeared in the opening ceremony in separate boats along the Seine. Dancing, athletes, volunteers and spectators joined for one last time in belting out the dance anthem Freed from Desire, which had become an unofficial anthem at venues, followed by We are the Champions. Paris had wanted its Games to be a giant open-air party, and the athletes’ final stadium appearance, dancing on the pitch, was no exception. The ghostly gold traveller figure who landed from the sky was played by the French breakdancer Arthur Cadre, surrounded by hundreds of dancers and acrobats, as athletes stood around the stage looking on. Flanked by athletes who had rushed on to the stage, the French electro-pop band Phoenix kicked off a music set that included the Belgian singer Angèle and the Cambodian rapper VannDa. The Mission: Impossible star Cruise, abseiling in and then making off with the flag on a motorbike, set a Hollywood tone for the transfer to Los Angeles, the next host of the games in 2028. Appearing on the Paris stage with the US gold-medallist gymnast Simone Biles, the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, was the first black female mayor to receive the Olympic flag. She had acknowledged before the closing ceremony that the French capital had set a high bar, but said her city was a worthy successor. “It will be a challenge, but it will be a challenge we can step up to,” Bass had told reporters this week. “I think our Games will really show the diversity and the international character of our city.” Every detail of the more than two weeks of Olympic events in Paris had been conceived as a visual extravaganza. Even the athletics track had been painted an unprecedented purple for athletic events – a break with tradition aimed at dazzling spectators and TV audiences. Venues such as the beach volleyball under the Eiffel Tower and equestrian events at the Chateau of Versailles were chosen for their picturesque backdrops. Paris had sought to reinvent the Games, aiming to breathe new life into the world’s biggest sporting event to attract a younger audience and inspire more cities to apply to host the games. With the motto Games Wide Open, Paris brought sport out of the stadium and into the city centre. It was aimed at drawing a line under the last Games in Tokyo, which were held largely without spectators during the Covid pandemic. In a celebration of women in sport, the women’s marathon winners were awarded their medals at the closing ceremony – the Netherlands’s Sifan Hassan took gold – as thousands of athletes cheered. It was unprecedented for the women’s, rather than the men’s marathons, to close the Olympics. The marathon course had deliberately retraced the route of a French revolutionary march in 1789 led by women from Paris to Versailles to take grievances to the king. The Stade de France closing ceremony was also a feat of logistics – rehearsals had taken place between 1am and 5am between athletics sessions at the stadium. Some in the ceremony’s creative team, including the director Jolly, were under special protection because of online death threats after the opening ceremony. That opening extravaganza, which featured Celine Dion singing Piaf from the Eiffel Tower, was overwhelmingly loved in France; one poll showed 86% of French people deemed it a success. But its displays of LGBTQ+ pride and French humour were too much for some. Donald Trump and French bishops were among those who took offence at one of the ceremony’s tableaux, titled Festivity, featured a cast of drag queens and, playing Dionysus, a semi-naked singer sitting in a bowl of fruit. Some Christian and conservative critics interpreted the scene as a parody of the Last Supper. The committee later apologised for any offence caused by parts of the ceremony. At the closing ceremony, some of the loudest cheers came when Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, spoke of the importance of sport bringing peace in times of conflict.","summary":"Tom Cruise was the headline act on an evening proudly declaring a message about protecting the spirit of the Games\n\nIt was a dreamlike, science fiction-inspired light-show spectacular that closed with Tom Cruise flying through the air from the stadium roof and whisking the Olympic flag off to Los Angeles.\n\nParis closed its record-breakingly successful Olympic Games on Sunday night with a stunt-filled final ceremony that began with a mysterious, golden intergalactic traveller wandering through a gloomy, barren futuristic landscape, tasked with resurrecting the Olympic spirit.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/12/paris-says-goodbye-to-the-olympics-with-a-golden-closing-ceremony","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acab0870ad67b37e0601fa7761dbefa212e5618f/0_358_7324_4393/master/7324.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:30:22","author":"Angelique Chrisafis","authors":["Angelique Chrisafis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.203},{"id":253897400,"title":"Nancy Pelosi admits why she criticized Biden: “That letter didn’t sound like Joe”","text":"Nancy Pelosi has admitted that she pressured Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race because she feared he was no longer making his own decisions. Pelosi, in an interview with the New York Times on Friday, stated that she intervened after a July 8 letter purportedly from Biden to Congress in which he re-affirmed his commitment to remaining in the election contest. ‘I didn’t accept the letter as anything but a letter,’ she said. ‘It didn’t sound like Joe Biden to me. It really didn’t.’ In the letter, Biden stated that he was ‘firmly committed’ to remaining in the race against Donald Trump as he sought to head-off calls to step aside following his disastrous debate performance and increasingly dismal polling. Pelosi’s admission comes as Biden finally revealed this weekend that the ex-speaker had been at the forefront of his mind when he made the decision to handover to Kamala Harris. In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Biden said that he was ‘concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic – you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction.’ Pelosi and Biden, who have worked together in DC since the late eighties, have not spoken since he dropped out of the race. Pelosi said that the timing of the letter grated on her because the president was preparing to host the NATO summit in DC. Two days after the letter’s publication she appeared on Morning Joe and said: ‘It’s up to the President to decide if he is going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.’ Her suggestion that Biden had not made his decision, despite the letter two days prior, was seen as a clear indication that she wanted the president to drop out. In her interview with the New York Times, Pelosi suggested that Biden had no hand in the letter, rather it was staff around him that were attempting to shore up support. She said of her TV intervention: ‘My main purpose, though, was to say, “Stop saying things.” Because the president has NATO here. If you have something to say, save it for later, until they’re gone. Because this is a big deal – the summit of ATO, which he has strengthened, grown, and now is hosting. And they’re doing great things, and he’s the center of it all. Save your comments for later.’ Biden issued the letter just as lawmakers are coming back from a July 4th recess where he has faced growing calls to quit the race. In it, Biden, 81, took shots at the press, donors and party operatives who have said the party’s only chance is to throw him over the side. ‘Let me say it differently. Some said that some people were unhappy with the letter. I’ll put it in somebody else’s mouth,’ Pelosi added. Biden spoke Sunday about how Pelosi was among those building pressure on Biden to step aside, along with other top Party Leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Adam Schiff. ‘A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,’ Biden said in his first interview since ending his reelection campaign. ‘And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic — you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction,’ he said in the interview with CBS News Sunday Morning host Robert Costa. Biden’s decision to invoke Pelosi comes after reports of a lingering strain. Senior advisor Anita Dunn, who is leaving the White House to join a pro-Harris super PAC, also spoke to the pressure campaign in recent comments. ‘You know, clearly there were leaders of the party who decided to go ahead and go very public. And that gave permission to other people to go public,’ she said. Asked about rumors Biden was furious, Pelosi told the New Yorker magazine, ‘He knows that I love him very much. I pray so. I cry so.’ A growing list of Democrats were calling for Biden to drop out of the race after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June. Biden said that had he remained in, the race would have been razor close – although polls before he dropped out showed him behind in all the battleground states and in a tight but inferior position nationally. ‘The polls we had showed that it was a neck and neck race, woulda been down to the wire. But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic,’ he said. Biden’s struggles were on display during his debate disaster with Trump and Democrats who were for years downplaying concerns about the president’s fitness were forced to confront it, with many suddenly demanding he exit the race. In the weeks after the debate, Biden was on clean-up duty – but his efforts just led to more gaffes and fumbles that increased worries that the president could hurt the chances of other Democratic politicians in their elections.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNancy Pelosi has admitted that she pressured Joe Biden to drop out of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nancy Pelosi admits why she criticized Biden: &#8220;That letter didn&#8217;t sound like Joe&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nancy-pelosi-admits-why-she-criticized-biden-that-letter-didnt-sound-like-joe/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/11/23/88418997-13733567-image-a-9_1723416042817.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:24:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":253898962,"title":"Opinion: Trump’s Questioning of Harris’ Race Shows His Ignorance of America’s Racial History","text":"Once again, Donald Trump exposed his ignorance of American history when he questioned whether Vice President Kamala Harris could consider herself Black. Asking whether Harris is Black or Indian manifests a deep ignorance of how most U.S. states regrettably defined race by law for generations after the Civil War. Louisiana, for example, wrote into law that anyone who was one-sixteenth Black was legally 100% Black. Skin color and DNA had nothing to do with it. It was called the “one drop” rule. After the Civil War, racists opposed to the end of slavery treated Black citizens despicably for nearly a century. But this wasn’t something new. A federal law dating to 1790 denied naturalized American citizenship to any group not “free white persons.” And in 1857, the Supreme Court ruled that Africans could never become citizens in the infamous Dredd Scott decision. And it wasn’t just Blacks. In 1882 Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibiting immigration from China for ten years. It was extended and made permanent until World War II, when China was a war ally. The Japanese were dealt with by President Teddy Roosevelt in 1908 in a “gentlemen’s agreement” that limited immigration to the U.S. Then the door was slammed shut by the ultra-racist Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 that ended immigration of Jews and others from Eastern Europe. Mexicans were always a special case. The “free white persons” law was used by devious Americans who plotted to steal California land from the Mexican citizens who were in California prior to 1848. The Mexican-American War, after all, was instigated by President James Polk to expand slavery into new territory. Polk lied to Congress about Mexican troops attacking Texas and demanded a declaration of war. Illinois congressman Abraham Lincoln exposed Polk’s lies by introducing “spot resolutions” demanding that Polk show Congress exactly where American troops were attacked. Polk couldn’t do it. But Polk got his war. It ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which included a clause that any Mexican citizens inside ceded Mexican territory were automatically American citizens by staying put for a year after the treaty was ratified. Fast forward 50 years. Through normal channels a Mexican named Rodriguez applied for citizenship in Texas in 1897. A group of white men contested the application, citing the 1790 “free white persons” law. They claimed that the Indian-heritage Rodriguez didn’t look white. A Federal district court ruled that as thousands of Mexicans had been decreed citizens by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the “free white persons” limitation was no longer valid. Likewise, Trump’s questioning of Vice President Harris’ racial composition isn’t legitimate. The question itself isn’t legitimate — it’s racist. In today’s America, race is how an individual defines it. Trump should know that.

In a display of Hollywood showmanship, Tom Cruise descended from the top of the French stadium to the \"Mission Impossible\" theme song, shaking hands with athletes, before taking the Olympic flag from star gymnast Simone Biles, putting it on the back of a motorcycle and driving out of the stadium. In a prerecorded ride past the Eiffel Tower, Cruise drove his bike onto a plane and then skydived out of it over the Hollywood Hills. Three rings were added to the O's of the famed Hollywood sign to create five interlaced Olympic rings. It was just one of the highlights of the closing ceremony that put a final flourish to Paris' first Games in a century, with an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg - plus longtime collaborator Dr. Dre - performed at Venice Beach as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. At the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron - powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels - had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories - a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, \"Together, united for peace.\" With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes - many wearing their shiny medals - and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen's anthem \"We Are the Champions\" blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach - who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show - said the Games \"can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,\" noting that the athletes \"respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.\" The national stadium, France's largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals - 16 of them gold - marked a major watershed in the city's recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals - each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women - the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women's marathon earlier Sunday. The women's marathon took the spot of the men's race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris' rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of the city, the closing ceremony's artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Jolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show's performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied \"The Last Supper,\" Leonardo Da Vinci's painting showing Jesus Christ.Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as \"outraged and sad\" by the backlash against them.","summary":"In a display of Hollywood showmanship, Tom Cruise helped Paris close out the 2024 Olympics and make the official handoff to Los Angeles for 2028.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/help-tom-cruise-mayor-karen-bass-paris-hands-olympics-los-angeles-2028/15174448/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15174408_081124-kabc-ap-olympics-tom-cruise.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/kabc/081124-kabc-5am-la28-presser-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:21:09","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.626},{"id":253897704,"title":"Tom Cruise, Mayor Bass help Paris hand over Olympics to Los Angeles for 2028","text":"SAINT-DENIS, France -- Paris closed out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show in France's national stadium on Sunday, handing over hosting duties for the Summer Games to the next city in line: Los Angeles in 2028. In a display of Hollywood showmanship, Tom Cruise descended from the top of the French stadium to the \"Mission Impossible\" theme song, shaking hands with athletes, before taking the Olympic flag from star gymnast Simone Biles, putting it on the back of a motorcycle and driving out of the stadium. In a prerecorded ride past the Eiffel Tower, Cruise drove his bike onto a plane and then skydived out of it over the Hollywood Hills. Three rings were added to the O's of the famed Hollywood sign to create five interlaced Olympic rings. It was just one of the highlights of the closing ceremony that put a final flourish to Paris' first Games in a century, with an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg - plus longtime collaborator Dr. Dre - performed at Venice Beach as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. At the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron - powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels - had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories - a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, \"Together, united for peace.\" With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes - many wearing their shiny medals - and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen's anthem \"We Are the Champions\" blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach - who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show - said the Games \"can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,\" noting that the athletes \"respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.\" The national stadium, France's largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals - 16 of them gold - marked a major watershed in the city's recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals - each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower.

Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and California governor Gavin Newsom attended the event in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, where nearly 700 people had purchased tickets that cost at least $3,300 and as much as $500,000. “This is a good day when we welcome Kamala Harris back home to California,” Pelosi said of the former US senator, attorney general and district attorney from the state. “She makes us all so proud. She brings us so much joy. She gives us so much hope,” Pelosi said at the fundraiser. She went on to describe Harris as a person of “great strength” and someone who is “politically very astute”. Harris and Walz, the Minnesota governor, have just finished a tour of multiple political swing states, packing rallies with thousands of people and building on the momentum that has propelled her since she took over at the top of the Democratic ticket. Pelosi, the longtime lawmaker and Washington power broker, is credited with helping usher Joe Biden out of the presidential race. The president, 81, stepped aside last month after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump sparked turmoil within the Democratic party and concerns that he could not beat the former president nor complete a second four-year term. Pelosi’s comments in a television interview suggesting that Biden had not yet decided whether to step aside were viewed as giving an opening to worried Democratic lawmakers to urge him to leave even as Biden said he was staying. Pelosi has praised Biden’s achievements while criticizing his former campaign. On Sunday she connected Harris, 59, to the accomplishments of Biden’s administration. “She knows the issues. She knows the strategy. She has gotten an enormous amount done working with Joe Biden,” Pelosi said. Harris acknowledged the enthusiasm but cautioned against getting caught up in it. “We can take nothing for granted in this critical moment,” she said, after thanking Pelosi for her friendship and support. “There is so much about the future of our country that has relied on leaders like Nancy Pelosi that have the grit, the determination, the brilliance to know what’s possible and to make it so,” Harris said. “The energy is undeniable,” Harris said of her campaign. “Yes, the crowds are large.” Her campaign hauled in $36m in the 24 hours following Walz’s selection as running mate and raised $310m in July, according to a campaign spokesperson. Harris, making her own case against Trump, said that if Trump got back into office, he would sign a national ban on abortion into law and warned that California would not be immune. Trump has sought to distance himself from Republican efforts to ban abortion, saying it should be up to individual states. Harris noted that some states’ laws don’t include exceptions for rape and incest, and said it’s “immoral”. “When this issue has been on the ballot, the American people have voted for freedom,” Harris said.","summary":"Vice-president returns to San Francisco for event attended by ex-House speaker Pelosi and governor Gavin Newsom\n\nKamala Harris returned home to the San Francisco Bay area for a Sunday fundraiser that drew top California Democrats and captured more than $12m for the conclusion of a swing state tour by the vice-president and her running mate, Tim Walz.\n\nFormer House speaker Nancy Pelosi and California governor Gavin Newsom attended the event in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, where nearly 700 people had purchased tickets that cost at least $3,300 and as much as $500,000.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/11/kamala-harris-san-francisco-fundraiser-nancy-pelosi","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ec729184000b2affa22605182d4292dab24e2fb/0_73_3282_1969/master/3282.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:15:32","author":"Diana Ramirez-Simon","authors":["Diana Ramirez-Simon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":253898012,"title":"JD Vance backs $5,000 child tax credit and reiterates support for FTC’s Lina Khan","text":"“I don’t think that you want this massive cutoff for lower-income families, which you have right now,” the Ohio senator and Donald Trump’s running mate said on CBS’s Face the Nation. He didn’t offer specifics on who would quality if the tax credit were expanded from its existing maximum of $2,000 per child. “It’s called the child tax credit, and we should expand the child tax credit,” Vance said. Vance went on three network political talk shows Sunday after a shaky start on the GOP ticket, damaged in part by resurfaced comments in which he belittled Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, as “childless cat ladies.” Vance, 40, a father of three, has also suggested a lower tax rate for parents than for people without children. His comments drew criticism from both parties. Tomi Lahren, the conservative commentator, blasted the senator on social media in response to the cat lady remarks. “I like JD Vance, but I’m not sure the calculation as VP pick checks out,” Lahren said in a post on X on July 25. Asked Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union about how he would appeal to swing-state voters put off by those remarks, Vance accused the Harris campaign of lying about what he said. “I criticized Kamala Harris for being part of a set of ideas that exist in American leadership that is anti-family,” he said. “I never criticize people for not having kids.” Trump defended Vance at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday. “He’s really stepped up,” Trump said. “I said, you got your sea legs, you know, because the first day they were hitting him with a lot of nonsense.” Pressure on Trump and Vance has heightened since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid in July. Harris’ emergence at the top of the Democratic ticket and her pick of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as running mate have shaken up the campaign, largely erasing Trump’s lead in many polls. A New York Times and Siena College poll conducted Aug. 5-9 showed Harris with 50% support among likely voters in battleground states Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, compared with Trump’s 46% in each state. Vance skipped a Senate vote on a bipartisan tax plan in early August, prompting attacks from Democrats who accused him of ditching his job to campaign. The $78 billion package would have allowed more of the $2,000 tax credit to be paid to those whose income is too low to qualify for the entire credit. Senators weren’t able to reach the 60 votes required to overcome a Republican filibuster. Vance dismissed the recent tax package vote as a messaging ploy. “It was a show vote,” Vance said. “And if I had been there, it would have failed.” Big Business Vance reiterated his support of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a Biden appointee who has focused antitrust efforts on big tech companies. “I don’t agree with Lina Khan on every issue, to be clear, but I think that she’s been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies that monopolize what we’re allowed to say in our own country,” Vance said on CBS. The comments signal that major tech companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google could continue to face legal challenges under a Trump-Vance administration. The Justice Department already has two pending antitrust cases against the company.","summary":"\"I don’t agree with Lina Khan on every issue, to be clear, but I think that she’s been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies that monopolize what we’re allowed to say in our own country.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/11/jd-vance-5000-child-tax-credit-support-ftc-lina-khan-tech-regulation/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165071369-e1723417702475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 23:15:20","author":"Alicia Diaz,Bloomberg","authors":["Alicia Diaz","Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":253897258,"title":"Pelosi says Biden’s letter insisting he was staying in race ‘didn’t sound like Joe to me’","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argued President Joe Biden’s pre-withdrawal letter reiterating his intention to stay in the 2024 presidential race “didn’t sound like” him.

Less than two weeks later, on July 21, Biden announced he was dropping his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place. “I didn’t accept the letter as anything but a letter,” Pelosi told The Ezra Klein Show. “I mean, there are some people who are unhappy with the letter. Let me say it differently: some said that some people were unhappy with the letter. I’ll put it in somebody else’s mouth because it was a… I don’t even, it didn’t sound like Joe Biden to me. It really didn’t.” Pelosi appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on July 10 to say that it was up to Biden “to decide if he is going to run,” stressing the need for him to make it as “time is running short.” When reflecting on her comments this weekend, Pelosi explained she wanted people to stop questioning Biden’s ability to run because he was in the middle of hosting the NATO Summit, and she encouraged his doubters to stop discussing his electability until after the summit ended. “And they’re doing great things, and he’s the center of it all,” Pelosi said. “Save your comments for later.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Like Biden and many other Democrats, Pelosi endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential nominee after the president bowed out.

Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice president, “misspoke” in a 2018 video about “weapons of war that I carried in war,” a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson said over the weekend. Republicans, including the vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, began questioning Walz’s military record after Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, named the governor as her running mate on Tuesday. Some of the criticism centers on comments by Walz in a 2018 video circulated on social media by the Harris campaign in which he speaks out against gun violence and says, “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” The comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone. Walz served 24 years in various Army National Guard units but he was never in a combat zone. Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said Saturday in a statement that Walz misspoke in the 2018 video. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way,” Hitt said. “In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,” Hitt added. “He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children.” Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, similar to a military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

The French leader said that unlike Fallon’s sketches, modern France brought more than “just baguette and Camembert” to the Olympics, expressing pride in how the French people brought their own traditions and enthusiasm to show the world what a great nation it can be. The French leader joked that Fallon “is a roommate” at the Élysée Palace in a nod to the late night host’s lighthearted request to stay there after he learned of his role closing out the Games. Speaking with NBC News at the presidential palace in Paris on Sunday, Macron expressed optimism about the potential for the global community to “do great things” together. He said he even appreciated the jokes about French clichés because the European nation was able to show its unique landscapes, heritage and culture over the last two weeks. “And for me, what’s very important is that our people, our athletes and more than that, our capacity to organize and the French public’s capacity of enthusiasm did provide to the rest of the world,” Macron said. “The fact that we are a great nation able to welcome the rest of the world, being in fraternity with the rest of the world and engaging all together and delivering such a positive message.” The ever-present displays of heritage and national pride make it difficult for him to pick just one favorite moment from the 2024 Paris Games. Macron did mention a few standouts such as the opening ceremony on the Seine and the 22-year-old French swimmer Léon Marchand’s haul of gold medals. “But more than that, this is an atmosphere,” Macron said. “Yes, the fact that we delivered something great for the world and … we make it iconic all together.” He said he didn’t have any advice for the American organizers who are working to host the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Macron said simply to “be yourself” and that anything is possible. Macron revealed behind-the-scenes moments of desperation on the first day when the French railways were hit by an unprecedented attack and rain poured down on the opening ceremony. “Some people were desperate and saying it will be a nightmare,” he said. But in a moment of inspiration for him, he said, the performers carried on with even more energy because of the rain. “And this is exactly the message: With audacity and tenacity, nothing will stop us,” Macron said. “We will make it.” Paris hosted the Games just weeks after the nation was plunged into deep political tensions, with Macron calling for a national vote in the wake of far-right leaders gaining ground in the wider European elections. The country now has a divided Parliament as the left fought against Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally while failing to gain its own majority. The U.S. is approaching its own major national election as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump fight for the White House. Asked how important the American vote is to the rest of the world, Macron noted that the U.S. leadership sets a tone for many other countries. “I speak from the country which had a lot of crisis, a lot of doubt,” he said. “And all our democracies are going through a unique period of our lives and our societies.” But using U.S. athletes as an example, he praised them for not just their impressive medal count and sportsmanship, but also for the values they displayed on the world stage. “I would never dare to give advice to somebody in your country, but I think it should clearly send a message that big things with fraternity and joy are still possible in our world.” Keir Simmons reported from Paris.

They offer an unprecedented look into the preparations being made by conservative groups to rapidly implement far-reaching policy changes should a Republican candidate win in this year's election.\"Want to know what's in PROJECT 2025's never-before-published training videos to make future Trump appointees 'ready on Day One'? We got 'em. 23 different videos. 14 hours of tape,\" ProPublica reporter Andy Kroll wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday morning.Project 2025 has faced intensifying scrutiny in recent weeks following the resignation of its director Paul Dans and attempts by Trump to disavow any connection to the initiative.In a previous statement to Newsweek, Trump's campaign expressed that they would \"greatly welcome\" reports of Project 2025's demise, emphasizing that the project has nothing to do with the campaign and should not be associated with the former president in any way.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Sunday for additional comment.Despite these public distancing efforts, the newly revealed videos suggest that preparations to train a cadre of conservative political appointees remain underway. The recordings coach potential appointees on a wide range of topics, from basic governance procedures to more controversial strategies for advancing conservative policies and battling perceived resistance from career civil servants.Climate Change Skepticism and Policy RollbacksIn one video, Bethany Kozma, a former Trump administration official, downplays the severity of climate change and characterizes efforts to combat it as a means of population control. The same video features Katie Sullivan, who served as an acting assistant attorney general under Trump, calling for the elimination of gender adviser positions created by the Biden administration across federal agencies.These statements align with broader policy goals outlined in Project 2025's extensive \"Mandate for Leadership\" document, which proposes sweeping changes such as eliminating the Department of Education, cutting Medicaid, and making it easier to fire and replace career civil servants.The plan also calls for reversing many of the Biden administration's climate policies, rolling back abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, and bringing about changes to education standards.Trump Administration Alumni Feature ProminentlyDespite Trump's recent attempts to create distance between himself and Project 2025, the training videos heavily feature individuals with ties to his administration.Of the 36 speakers appearing in the recordings, 29 have worked for Trump in some capacity – either on his transition team, in his administration, or on his current reelection campaign.Lessons Learned and Strategies SharedMany speakers in the videos acknowledge stumbles during the early days of the Trump administration, particularly regarding staffing and the inexperience of some political appointees. They frame Project 2025's efforts as crucial preparation to avoid similar pitfalls in a future conservative administration.Rick Dearborn, who helped lead Trump's 2016 transition team, emphasizes the importance of having a database of potential appointees ready, reportedly calling it \"a luxury that we didn't have\" during the previous transition.Some of the advice offered in the videos appears to diverge from traditional conservative positions. David Burton, an economic policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, advocates for expanding staffing at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to better scrutinize and potentially limit regulations from other federal agencies.Navigating a Perceived Hostile EnvironmentA recurring theme throughout the videos is the notion that conservative appointees should expect to face hostility within the federal government and from mainstream media outlets. Speakers frequently characterize Washington, D.C., as an environment hostile to conservative values and warn of potential persecution.To counter this perceived hostility, speakers offer various strategies. These include empowering political staff over career civil servants, scrubbing personal social media accounts of potentially controversial content, and focusing media engagement efforts on conservative outlets rather than mainstream news organizations.Public Opinion and Project FutureAccording to a Navigator Research poll, Project 2025 has proven to be extremely unpopular with voters, with only 11 percent of those surveyed viewing it favorably.Following Dans' resignation, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts will now lead Project 2025's efforts. Roberts reportedly stated that the project had accomplished its goals of bringing together conservative organizations to create a unified vision.

This potential shift has even garnered acknowledgment from some Democratic politicians. The increase in Jewish support for Republicans is attributed to a sense of outrage among voters concerning the escalating anti-Semitism and the perceived anti-Israel stance of some hard-left Democrats. This sentiment is being capitalized on by Trump’s campaign and certain political figures supporting the GOP. “President Trump has a chance to get the largest share of the Jewish vote ever,” Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin told The Post. “Antisemitism is a real issue.” Historically, Democrats running for the White House receive roughly 70% or more of the Jewish vote and Republicans 30% or less. In the past, Republican former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower were the most successful in winning over Jewish voters, each receiving approximately 40% of the vote. This historical context provides perspective on the significance of any potential increase in Jewish support for the GOP in the upcoming election. McLaughlin predicted an increase in Jewish support for Trump this year in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia. He said the boost also would help candidates in down-ballot races — as well House contests in six swing seats in New York suburbs that are home to some of the largest Jewish neighborhoods in the country. Even a small shift in the votes could influence the Electoral College, since President Biden won those states over Trump by 3% or less in 2020. Jewish voters have taken notice that some Democrats have gone soft on Israel-bashing, said former Long Island Rep. Lee Zeldin, who is Jewish and was the 2022 Republican candidate for governor in New York. “There’s so much hedging and equivocating about Israel in the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party has allowed its pro-Hamas wing to metastasize,” said Zeldin, a Trump surrogate. The fury of Jewish voters and activists already proved pivotal in Democratic primary elections in recent months — helping to oust New York anti-Israel “Squad” Rep. Jamaal Bowman in the 16th House district taking in leafy Westchester and parts of The Bronx, as well as fellow lefty Rep. Cori Bush last week in Missouri. A recent poll conducted for the Teach Coalition found that Jews are more motivated to vote in Pennsylvania and six New York battleground House districts because of rising antisemitism and the raging Israel-Hamas war. Trump was pulling support from 43% of Jewish voters in the Keystone State in the fresh Teach Coalition survey. There are more than 300,000 potential Jewish voters in both Pennsylvania and the six swing House districts in New York combined. The up-in-the-air New York districts are 1 and 4 on Long Island, 17, 18, 19 in Westchester and Rockland counties and the Hudson Valley and 22 in the Syracuse region. Trump won the support of 37% of Jewish voters in those New York districts compared to 61% for Dem foe Vice President Kamala Harris, the Teach Coalition survey said. Still, sources say polling Jewish voters is tricky. Many ultra-orthodox Jewish voters don’t consent to phone interviews, and some seek guidance from their rabbi before voting. But lawmakers from both parties predicted Jewish voters in southern Brooklyn — home to ultra-orthodox and refugees from the former Soviet Union — will flock to the GOP in even greater numbers than before. “I believe the Jewish vote is going to shift to the right in astronomical numbers in this election,” said Republican city Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, a Jewish native of Ukraine who represents Gravesend , Coney Islande, Brighton Beach, Midwood, Sheepshead Bay, Manhattan Beach and Gerritsen Beach. “The deeply rooted antisemitic rot in the Democratic party is obvious, Jewish Dems feel betrayed, and they’re going to soundly reject it at the ballot box,” she said. State Sen. Simcha Felder — a conservative Democrat who represents the heavily orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of Borough Park and Midwood — said Trump will rout Harris in his district by better than 2 to 1 because of rampant antisemitism, the migrant crisis and inflation. “They are going to take it out on who is in power, and the Democrats are in power,” Felder said of Jewish voters. “The free-for-all antisemitism acts affect Jewish people in a very bad way. But it’s not just that. Large Jewish families, like other families, are feeling the impact of inflation when they go to the grocery store,” Felder said. Jews are disturbed with lefty progressives and protesters — particularly the Democratic Socialists of America — for backing Hamas terrorists over Israel in the war in Gaza. “Some of the comments and actions taken by the Democratic Socialists of America are not only anti-Israel but antisemitic. There are Jewish voters nervous about the DSA,” Litwack said. The Harris team dismissed claims Jewish voters will defect to Trump rump and the GOP. “There is one candidate in this race who consistently denigrates American Jews, elevates Neo-Nazis and trafficks in antisemitic tropes, and it is Donald Trump,” said Harris campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. “And our campaign is uniting voters who reject his rhetoric of hate and will defeat him at the ballot box in November.” Trump last week said Jews who don’t vote for him should “have their head examined.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAccording to Trump&#8217;s strategists, there is a possibility for Donald Trump and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump and the GOP aim for a historic increase in the Jewish vote amidst concern over anti-Semitism: &#8216;A significant concern&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-and-the-gop-aim-for-a-historic-increase-in-the-jewish-vote-amidst-concern-over-anti-semitism-a-significant-concern/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trump-GOP-eye-record-share-of-Jewish-vote-over-antisemitism.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:54:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.114},{"id":253896156,"title":"Trump, GOP eye record share of Jewish vote over antisemitism: ‘A real issue’","text":"Former President Donald Trump and the rest of the GOP ticket could win a record share of Jewish voters in November, his strategists say — and even some Democratic pols agree.

He didn’t listen to her","text":"Growing up in a Florida suburb, it seemed to his family that Murthy could succeed at just about anything. But when a middle school world history teacher suggested he might one day make a good secretary of state, his mom staged an intervention. “She got really worried,” Murthy said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press last month, while his mom giggled at his retelling of the story. “She called my dad. She said, ‘You need to come home and talk to him because he’s thinking about going into politics.’” Now, in his second term as the “Nation’s Doctor,” Murthy hasn’t run from the political, as his mother hoped. He’s charged toward it. He has taken on powerful tech companies, accusing their addictive algorithms and dangerous content of negatively affecting children’s mental health. Earlier this year, he went as far as asking Congress to approve a surgeon general’s warning label on social media, on platforms such as Instagram or TikTok. In June, Murthy released his most politically charged report yet, declaring that gun deaths and injuries in America had reached such critical mass that they have created a public health crisis. A focus on guns Republicans had long feared Murthy harbored plans to state that gun violence a public health crisis, speculation that almost derailed his first appointment to the job by Democratic President Barack Obama a decade ago. Murthy attracted Obama’s attention while Murthy was working as an internist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, when he corralled thousands of doctors to lobby for passage of the Affordable Care Act. The political organizing also led him to his wife, Alice Chen, who signed onto his letters from Los Angeles, where she was working as a doctor. The two bonded over text messages and phone calls across time zones. But Murthy’s social media comments describing guns as a “health care issue” sparked a delay of his confirmation and left the country without a surgeon general for more than a year, with even some Democrats refusing to approve him. Republican President Donald Trump promptly fired Murthy. Murthy was reconfirmed under the Biden administration in 2021, with support from every Democratic senator and a handful of Republicans. He has an annual salary of $191,900. As surgeon general, Murthy had largely stayed quiet on gun violence, until now. He points out that the numbers changed after he became surgeon general for the second time: Gun violence became the leading killer of U.S. children, surpassing car crashes and cancer in 2021. More than 4,752 children died from firearm injuries that year, a study from the American Academy of Pediatrics says. The stories too awful to ignore that he heard while traversing the country on listening tours have helped shape what issues he decides to weigh in on, he said. There was the grandmother who told him she does not send her grandson to school in light-up sneakers just in case they might attract the attention of a school shooter. And the mom who, after surviving a mass shooting, always reconsidered leaving the house in flip-flop sandals in case she had to flee another one. “When you hear these stories again and again from middle school students, from high school students and college students, those stories stick with you,” Murthy said. “It was inescapable to me that we had to do something about this.” Murthy’s report is full of statistics that show gun deaths, suicides and injuries are worsening. He concludes by saying Congress should act — with laws that ban large-capacity magazines for civilian use, require universal background checks for gun purchases, restrict their use in public spaces and penalize people who fail to safely store their weapons. The reaction was predictable. Doctors and Democrats praised it. Republicans jeered. The National Rifle Association called Murthy’s report a “war on law-abiding citizens.” Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., accused him of “flip-flopping,” noting that Murthy had told him gun violence would not be a focus of his term. Murthy believes his report, which has no teeth, might move the conversation, even a little. He sat down with the AP just four days after Trump had been nicked in the ear with a bullet from a would-be assassin during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. There was little call to take up gun measures after the latest shooting to shock the nation. “My hope is that we can shift looking at it as a polarizing and political issue and see it for what it is, which is a public health issue that affects all of us from people in small communities in America to people … running for high office in our land,” Murthy said. The surgeon general is also emphasizing a different side effect of gun violence: the mental health toll. He dedicates an entire chapter and four pages of his 40-page report to the issue, noting that half of U.S. teenagers 14 to 17 worry about school shootings. Americans’ declining mental health The demise of Americans’ mental health, a topic that seems to have bipartisan interest in Congress but little consensus on how to deal with it, has been a theme in nearly every report released during Murthy’s second term. Past surgeon generals have rarely weighed in on mental health in such a robust way. Many focused on physical health: alcohol and drug abuse, smoking, breastfeeding, exercise and healthy bones, for example. Murthy, in his reports, has spent the past three years delving into social media’s impact on youth, loneliness, health care worker burnout and misinformation. Those are matters he did not expect to tackle when he was first appointed to the job more than a decade ago. But Murthy sees them as problems that are straining Americans’ overall health. Loneliness skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people culled their friend groups and cut back on the time they spent in person with those friends –- down to a historic low of just 20 minutes every day. The state of loneliness, Murthy concluded in his 2023 findings, can increase the risk of premature death by 30%. Murthy spent his time during the pandemic and in between terms consulting and giving speeches. He raked in $2 million working with companies such as Netflix, Airbnb and Carnival Cruises, and wrote a book, “Together,” focused on loneliness. He shares in that book how he felt unprepared to handle the impact loneliness had on his patients’ health and happiness. His reports could change that for future doctors. “The response has been overwhelmingly positive, not just from the public but from the medical and public health profession” Murthy said. “And I have a theory as to why, which is that doctors are actually seeing loneliness and mental health challenges on the front lines themselves in exam rooms, in hospitals each and every day.” After his term ends in March, Murthy does not know what is next. But he said he still wants to focus on mental health and loneliness. ‘People are everything’ Murthy traces his interest in eradicating loneliness back to the Miami suburbs, where he retreated last month with his wife and two young children to spend a few summer days under the palm trees of his childhood home alongside his parents, sister and grandmother. It was here where he says he learned the most about the power of relationships. First, from watching his parents, immigrants from India, work hard to carve out a community of their own in a city where they knew no one when they arrived decades ago. The pair launched a weekend school for the children of other Indian immigrants to learn about the culture and music of their homeland. As he grew older, he helped his mother in the front office of his dad’s family medical practice. When tragedy struck, he went with them to visit patients’ homes, including a trip to visit a grieving widow in the middle of the night. “They taught me from the youngest of ages that people are everything,” Murthy said of his parents, Myetraie and Hallegere. “Whenever they had a patient who was in need, a friend who lost a job or lost a loved one, they would be there on the phone or in person, bringing food or just sitting by the bedside and holding their hand.” Even in the July humidity and heat, his family crowds the kitchen to fry dosas, an Indian crepe, and kesari bath, a sweet raisin wheat mix, over the hot oven. His mother stuffs plastic bags full of food, insisting any visitors in the house take one home. Murthy’s 7-year-old son wraps himself around his father -– and won’t let go -– as dinner is served up in the kitchen. It’s a long-standing tradition for the Murthys. Decades ago, after homework was finished, the family ate dinner together every night, said Hallegere Murthy. He still tells his own patients to treat family dinners as a “therapeutic session” and recommends they put away cellphones while catching up at the dinner table. “I always tell my patients family unity and family interaction is very important, especially if the only time you all can be interacting is during the dinner time,” Hallegere Murthy said.","summary":"As surgeon general, Vivek Murthy had largely stayed quiet on gun violence, until now.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/11/surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-politics-gun-violence-mental-health/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24222702242592-e1723415228457.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:34:53","author":"Amanda Seitz,The Associated Press","authors":["Amanda Seitz","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":253895666,"title":"2024 Paris Olympics Closing Ceremony review: Tom Cruise takes flight in show that’s less high art, more pop concert","text":"“This is not the time for high art,” BBC presenter Hazel Irvine announced, as coverage of the Olympic closing ceremony began. “It’s time for a singsong.” After an opening ceremony marred by the weather (“Damp and extraordinary,” in the words of Irvine’s commentary partner, Andrew Cotter) and subject to a series of confected rows (Donald Trump called it a “disgrace” prompting artistic director Thomas Jolly to revise his script for the closer), this Parisian finale played it far safer. Less high art, more pop concert. Opening in the Tuileries, where the Olympic flame has spent the past fortnight, French singer Zaho de Sagazan stomped around in Doc Martens, while a choir warbled along with her to “Sous le Ciel de Paris” (meaning “Under the Sky of Paris”). She proved only the first of the many performers on a night when music replaced sport, at the centre of attention. French indie rockers Phoenix, inside the Stade de France, were joined by acts from around the world: compatriots Kaminsky and Air, as well as Cambodia rapper VannDa, Belgian singer Angèle, and Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig. Thomas Jolly’s direction – of both the opening and closing ceremonies – has, at times, resembled the frustrations of French New Wave cinema. Some of the action has been ponderously introspective (a shot of star swimmer Léon Marchand carrying the last flicker of the Olympic flame was pure Truffaut), preferring to remain utterly unrushed. Perhaps, as a consequence, the BBC allotted an extra 25 minutes, after the scheduled end of the event, before the 10 O’clock News began (it still overran). With runtimes of four hours and two-and-a-half hours respectively, Jolly’s ceremonies would have Jacques Rivette checking his watch. But the dominant mood in the Stade de France was one of relief. A successful Olympics – phew. Jacked up on two weeks of – if the rumours are to be believed – chocolate muffin-fuelled marathon sex sessions, the Olympians paraded out into the Stade de France, bopping along to Joe Dassin’s “Les Champs-Élysées” and Queen’s “We Are the Champions” before the live music began. It set the tone for an evening that had nothing of the artistry of Beijing or the carnival of Rio, but plenty of danceable music. When the artistic elements finally took centre stage, Jolly took viewers on a journey into, in the words of the BBC’s comms team, “the past, present and future”. A trippy light show proved only a backdrop to the arrival of a dancer in a gold-plumed gimp suit (symbolising, perhaps, the watching public’s relentless horniness for medals). What followed was a maximalist reimagining of the Olympics’ origins. Cotter and Irvine were on hand, as ever, to provide live translation of the rather oblique narrative unfolding on-stage, a pungent mixture of Kabuki, fetish-wear and Tron. Closing ceremonies don’t carry the same weight of expectation as their opening counterparts. Clare Balding, speaking during the buildup on BBC One, described it as “the fun bit”. All the same, Jolly’s portentous evocation of the importance of the Olympic fraternity didn’t quite hit the same “fun” heights as, say, the women’s breakdancing. For the reported tens of millions of Euro it cost to stage the ceremony, couldn’t they have tempted Australian viral sensation Rachel Gunn – aka Raygun – to reprise her performance? “This is what everyone really comes for: the speeches,” quipped Cotter (who does a good line in snark), as the shambling music festival vibes gave way to the bureaucratic segment. But if you survived that tedium you were rewarded with the handover to 2028 hosts, Los Angeles. Mayor of LA Karen Bass took the flag and began the American invasion (LA ran significantly over the normal 12-minute rule). A wobbly rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” was followed by the much-hyped sight of a 62-year-old Tom Cruise (looking increasingly like his Madame Tussauds doppelganger) floating down from the stadium’s rafters. LA native acts Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, played us out, live from a sun-soaked Venice Beach. A stark warning, if it were needed, of what the US is willing to invest in maintaining its soft power hegemony. This closing ceremony has thrown into stark relief the issues with the games’ curtain-raiser. The Stade de France – an 80,000-seater stadium – proved a sufficiently large canvas for the theatrical elements of proceedings. And unlike the rain-smudged camera shots across the Seine, the joy and excitement was plain to see on individual athlete’s faces. Broadcasters the world over, meanwhile, must’ve been relieved. The show was rehearsed; the elucidation from the commentary box clearly pre-prepared. The dancers and cameras, within the stadium, moved in perfect sync. After two weeks of seamlessly delivered sporting action, the high-class pantomime of an Olympic ceremony always feels a bit anticlimactic. But at least Jolly and Co checked the impulse to be avant garde. After all, thousands of people might gather on the streets of Paris, but millions more are watching around the world. This closing ceremony, at the very least, felt like something designed with television audiences in mind.","summary":"The passing of the torch to LA featured the Top Gun star, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, and the dominant mood in the Stade de France was one of relief","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/paris-olympics-closing-ceremony-review-b2594820.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/11/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4LkOLBok-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:29:17","author":"Nick Hilton","authors":["Nick Hilton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.264},{"id":253897434,"title":"Vance hails Trump’s Fed idea and pushes back against criticism over past words on American families","text":"ATLANTA (AP) — Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance used a round of Sunday news show appearances to disparage the Democratic ticket and promote Donald Trump’s record and second-term plans and defend himself from criticism over past remarks that have become a campaign issue. The Ohio senator, in a series of taped interviews, said there was merit to Trump’s suggestion that presidents have more control of U.S. monetary policy and kept up the GOP line that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate, had exaggerated his military record. Vance, who shadowed Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz during their visits to several battleground states last week, was quizzed about abortion and his past comments about American family life, among other topics. Some highlights from his appearances: Trump is right on Fed independence, Vance says Trump recently suggested that presidents “should have at least a say” on monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve. He did not offer specific proposals. Curtailing the Fed’s independence from political interference as it determines interest rates would be a fundamental change. Even as he tried to argue that Trump said nothing about taking “direct” control of rates, Vance endorsed Trump’s general idea. “President Trump is saying I think something that’s really important and actually profound, which is that the political leadership of this country should have more say over the monetary policy of this country,” Vance said. “I agree with him. That should fundamentally be a political decision. Agree or disagree, we should have America’s elected leaders having input about the most important decisions confronting our country.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan questioned the wisdom of such a major change. “I think if you look around the world’s economies and you see where Fed central banks are independent and operate freely,” he said, “they tend to fare better than the ones that don’t.” Mining Walz’s military record Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard and was once deployed to Europe, though never to an active war zone. In a video from 2018, he referred to carrying weapons “in war.” The Harris campaign said last week that Walz misspoke. “Scandalous behavior,” said Vance, a military veteran. When it was noted that Trump avoided Vietnam with dubious claims of bone spurs, Vance said that “obviously a lot of people have reasons for not serving. I criticize somebody for embellishing their record, for lying, saying, ‘I went to war.’” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a combat veteran and a top Harris ally, said Republicans are circulating “the one time” that a long-serving veteran “slipped up” talking about his military service. Medical abortion and Florida’s referendum Vance dodged when asked about his position on an upcoming Florida referendum that would repeal Republican-passed abortion restrictions and ensure more access to abortion services. Speaking broadly about states and reproductive rights, Vance said Trump “has said explicitly they’re going to make this decision on a state-by-state level.” Vance struggled to clarify Trump’s position on whether he would support federal limits on the medical abortion drug mifepristone. Trump said in his June debate with Biden that he would not block it. At his Florida news conference last week, he offered a disjointed answer and said, “You also have to give a vote” on the matter. Vance suggested that “maybe” Trump had difficulty hearing and understanding a reporter’s question. Walz responded in a statement through the Harris campaign that Trump and Vance “are going to ban medication abortion. … Vice President Harris and I will make sure that you make your health care decisions because we have a rule, whether you’d make the same decision as someone else: Just mind your own damn business.” Vance and Buttigieg’s back-and-forth on family During Vance’s Senate campaign in 2021, he said in a Fox News interview that “we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats,” and referred to them as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He said that included Harris, who has two adult children, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay and a married father of twins but had no children at the time of Vance’s comment. The senator said a “sarcastic remark I made three years ago” has obscured a serious debate about “pro-family” policies, explaining that “I criticize people for being anti-child” in their policy pursuits. Vance also in the past has suggested giving extra votes for people with children. “It’s not a policy proposal. It’s a thought experiment, right?” he said in a Sunday interview, arguing he was reacting to others’ ideas to lower the voting age. “Anybody who disagrees with him is anti-child?” Buttigieg countered in a news show appearance. “He seems incapable of talking about a vision for this country in terms of lifting people up. … It’s always about disparagement.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The hosting baton for the Summer Games was officially passed on to the next designated city: Los Angeles in 2028. In a spectacular nod to Hollywood flair, Tom Cruise made a dramatic entrance descending from the top of the stadium in France to the iconic “Mission Impossible” theme song. He interacted with athletes, received the Olympic flag from renowned gymnast Simone Biles, placed it on the back of a motorcycle, and exited the stadium in style. The festivities continued with a pre-recorded segment featuring Cruise riding past the Eiffel Tower on his motorcycle, seamlessly transitioning onto a plane, and then performing a skydiving stunt over the Hollywood Hills upon exiting the aircraft. The iconic Hollywood sign was creatively enhanced with three additional rings to symbolize the five interconnected Olympic rings. It was just one of the highlights of the closing ceremony that put a final flourish to Paris’ first Games in a century, with an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg — plus longtime collaborator Dr. Dre — performed at Venice Beach as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. At the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron — powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels — had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories — a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.” With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes — many wearing their shiny medals — and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach — who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show — said the Games “can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,” noting that the athletes “respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.” The national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals — 16 of them gold — marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals — each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women — the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday. The women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Jolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ. Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them. ___ AP Summer Olympics","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAINT-DENIS – The splendid conclusion of two and a half weeks of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Final star-studded show marks the end of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/final-star-studded-show-marks-the-end-of-the-2024-olympics-in-paris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Paris-closes-out-the-2024-Olympics-with-a-final-star-studded.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:20:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.818},{"id":253895642,"title":"Vance: Presidents Should Have Role in Deciding Monetary Policy","text":"Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) on Aug. 11 reiterated former President Donald Trump’s calls for the president to have a role in federal monetary policy. During an Aug. 11 appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Vance was asked by host Dana Bash about his running mate’s comments earlier this week. Asked about Trump’s comment, Vance made clear he “absolutely” agrees with the former president, framing the issue in terms of giving elected officials some say over the actions of those who run the Federal Reserve. “President Trump is saying, I think, something that’s really important and actually profound, which is that the political leadership of this country should have more say over the monetary policy of this country. I agree with him. “That should fundamentally be a political decision. Agree or disagree, we should have America’s elected leaders having input about the most important decisions confronting our country,” Vance said. Right now, the president has no authority over the Federal Reserve’s decisions, which are left primarily to the chairman and board of the central bank. However, the chairman, vice chairs, and members of the board are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Pushed by Bash, Vance acknowledged that giving the president input over Fed policy would represent a “huge change,” but he again framed it as a more democratic approach to monetary policy in the United States. “Whether the country goes to war, what our interest rates are—these are important questions that American democracy should have important answers for,” Vance said. “I think all President Trump is saying is, ‘Look, it’s kind of weird that you have so many bureaucrats making so many important decisions,’” Vance added. “If the American people don’t like our interest rate policy, they should elect somebody different to change the policy. Nothing should be above democratic debate in this country when it comes to the big questions confronting the United States.” Trump made his remarks on the Fed two days before Vance’s interview aired. During the same remarks, Trump opined that the Fed has “sort of gotten it wrong a lot.” “I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,” he said. “I used to have it out with [Powell]. I had it out with him a couple times very strongly. I fought him very hard.” A change in Fed policy to give the president more direct control over monetary policy would likely require new legislation, which could be difficult for Republicans to pass through the Senate if it faced substantial opposition from Democrats. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which established the bank, the Federal Reserve exists in a state of limbo between public and private operation. Though it handles decisions related to the U.S. dollar, the Federal Reserve exists as an entity largely independent of the U.S. government.","summary":"Sen.

This time, the target is former President Trump's campaign. And we go in-depth with Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.Vice President Kamala Harris picked a coach for her running mate, Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz. But, last night in Las Vegas, she lifted a campaign play from the Trump playbook and raised him one.(Begin VT)KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate): That we will continue our fight for working families of America…(CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: … including to raise the minimum wage…(CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: … and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.(CHEERING)(APPLAUSE)(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a proposal that will go over well in the battleground state of Nevada.But can Democrats score in the heartland? We will talk with Kansas Democrat Governor Laura Kelly.Plus: V.P. hopeful J.D. Vance has been on the offensive on the campaign trail.(Begin VT)SENATOR J.D. VANCE (R-Ohio) (Vice Presidential Candidate): Everything that Kamala Harris touches has been a disaster.MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump has said you are outstanding, but when you look at what decides elections, the vice presidential pick rarely matters. How are you going to prove him wrong?(LAUGHTER)SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, I think President Trump's right about that, actually.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with him about campaign policy and how GOP proposals will impact Americans.We will check in on two other big stories, the state of the economy with Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan. And retired General Frank McKenzie will give us an update on tensions in the Middle East.It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.Last night, former President Trump said that his campaign had been informed that one of his top advisers was hacked by the Iranian government. We have got a lot more on that ahead, but we begin with our interview with Mr. Trump's running mate J.D. Vance.We sat down with him in Cincinnati Saturday morning, before the news broke about the hack.(Begin VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: You supported the Supreme Court ruling recently on mifepristone, the – the so-called abortion pill, that ruled opponents lacked the legal right to sue over the FDA approval.SENATOR J.D. VANCE (R-Ohio) (Vice Presidential Candidate): That's right.MARGARET BRENNAN: This drug is used in like 60 percent of all abortions in the United States. In a Trump/Vance administration, would you use the FDA to block access to this drug?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, no.What the president has said very clearly is that abortion policy should be made by the states, right? You, of course, want to make sure that any medicine is safe, that it's prescribed in the right way, and so forth, but the president wants individual states to make these decisions, because, look, Margaret, California is going to have a different abortion policy from Ohio, which is going to have a different abortion policy from Alabama.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that was actually different, because, after Dobbs, the Supreme Court took up this case, right.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes, but – but, like you said, on…MARGARET BRENNAN: They viewed it as different.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure, but, like you said, on a matter of legal standing.But I think that what we really want is, when states and voters in those states make decisions, we of course want the states and the federal government to respect those decisions, and that's what President Trump has said is, consistently, we need to get out of the culture war side of the abortion issue.We need to let the states decide their specific abortion policy. And, look, what President Trump and I want to do on family policy is make it easier for families to start in the first place.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, at his presser this past week, Donald Trump seemed to indicate he was open to restrictions on mifepristone.He was asked by a reporter about this, and he said: \"There are many things on a humane basis that you can do, but also give a vote.\"So he did seem to be indicating he's open to restrictions on this particular drug.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: First of all, even some of the reporters who were in the room at that press conference said it wasn't clear what the reporter was asking. Maybe he couldn't hear that person super clearly.So I don't want to put words in President Trump's mouth. What he said very clearly in the debate is that he agrees with the Supreme Court decision, but, more importantly, he wants these decisions to be made by the states.MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, signed on as a senator to a letter to the DOJ demanding it shut down all mail-order abortion operations under the Comstock Act.So, would you seek to enforce that law differently?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, what we said in that letter, Margaret, is that we want doctors to prescribe this stuff to ensure that it's safe. I mean, we do this with antibiotics. We do this with a lot of antidepressants.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the FDA says it is.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And we – we just want the FDA to make sure that doctors are prescribing this in a safe way. That's all that we ever said, and I – I believe that that is how President Trump feels about this is, again, you want the states to make these determinations.You also want to make sure the FDA is ensuring that these medications are safe for anybody who's taking them.MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been on the market for decades, and the FDA does say it is safe, but would – where a doctor…(CROSSTALK)SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, antibiotic – Margaret, antibiotics are safe, but we want to make sure they're prescribed by doctors, and the doctors are properly monitoring this stuff so that people don't get hurt.MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, of course. But…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And, Margaret, we've – we've talked now, I think, for six questions about abortion.MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still trying to get a clear answer.So, for an FDA…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And I gave you one.MARGARET BRENNAN: … commissioner…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: … that you would be part of choosing, where that Commissioner stands on this drug, would that determine whether or not they are chosen to be put in this key role?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I think President Trump has clearly said there are no litmus tests on this particular issue.He just wants to make sure that drugs are safe and effective before they're out there in the market, and, of course, that doctors are properly controlling this stuff, so that people don't get hurt. And, again, Margaret, I mean, we talk about abortion. I think President Trump's views on abortion are extremely clear.MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been talking about the concern about the low birth rate in the United States of America, which is well-documented.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: You said people without children should pay higher tax rates than those who have children, and the U.S. should look at lowering income tax rates on women who have multiple children. And you pointed to Hungary as a model for that.How do you plan to implement that policy?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, it's called the child tax credit, and we should expand the child tax credit.If you think about what the child tax credit does…MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you and the Biden administration agree on the childcare tax credit?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, we think it should be bigger. I think President Trump and I believe in an expanded child tax credit.But we also, importantly, want to actually get this thing done.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: The child tax credit has languished thanks to the Biden administration, because Harris has failed to show fundamental leadership. Chuck Schumer has been unable to get it through the United States Senate, and we want to have a more pro-family policy.Now, you asked about…(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: There was just a vote on this. You know that.And you weren't there.(CROSSTALK)SENATOR J.D. VANCE: But, Margaret…MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a messaging bill. I will give you that.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: It was a show vote.MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm – I'm with you on that. But…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And if I had been there, it would have failed. And I was – and I was…MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me specifically what you want to do to expand the childcare tax credit, because it's like two grand per kid right now.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, I think one of the things you can do is make it bigger per child. I think we'd love to see it at a higher dollar value –MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a number in mind?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I mean, look, I would love to see a child tax credit that's $5,000 per child. But you, of course, have to work with Congress to see how possible and viable that is.We've also proposed legislation, Margaret, to end this practice of parents getting these surprise medical bills where they go to the hospital, they have a baby, they chose an out-of-network provider, and they come home with unexpected bills. I have actually sponsored legislation to end that practice.So we have a whole host of pro-family policies that are out there. And – and, again, on the Harris administration, I have to push back against something a little bit, Margaret, because when these comments where I said parents should pay lower taxes via the child tax credit came out, the Harris administration immediately jumped and said, we disagree with this.The Harris campaign said, we disagree with this. So do they want the elimination of the child tax credit? Or were they just being careless in responding to remarks that I made three years ago? I don't know.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: They should clarify it, maybe in an interview with you. But, of course, Kamala Harris refuses to do interviews with anybody.MARGARET BRENNAN: We hope to have on and ask her about that.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Me too.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the childcare tax credit, you said $5,000 per child is what you'd like to get to. Where would that kick in?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I would like to have a broad-based family policy and a broad-based child tax credit, Margaret.Again, we've talked about doing this for a long time. President Trump has been on the record for a long time supporting a bigger child tax credit.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And I think you want it to apply to all American families. I don't think that you want this – this – this massive cutoff for lower-income families, which you have right now. You don't want a different policy for higher-income families.You just want to have a pro-family child tax credit.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have personally opposed universal childcare. How do you solve the childcare crisis in America?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, what I have opposed is one model of childcare.We, of course, want to give everybody access to childcare. But, look, in my family, I grew up in a poor family where the childcare was my grandparents.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And a lot of these childcare proposals do nothing for grandparents. If you look at some of these proposals, they do nothing for stay-at-home moms or stay-at-home dads.I want us to have a childcare policy that's good for all families, not just a particular model of family, and that's what I have said.MARGARET BRENNAN: So what do you mean by that? There would be like a credit per kid if it's a stay-at-home mom, a credit per kid if it's grandma?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes, exactly.MARGARET BRENNAN: Like they would get a check to take care of their…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: No, that – that – that – that's exactly what I propose.I'm just saying that I don't want us to favor one family model over another. If you've got grandparents who are at home taking care of the kids, I think they deserve to be treated the same as – the same way as other family models by their government.MARGARET BRENNAN: Gay families, they'd be included? All families?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: All families would be included, of course.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: All families would be included.MARGARET BRENNAN: What about really young kids? Should 3- and 4-year-old kids have access to preschool?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, look, I think that certainly some families are going to choose that, but again, some families are going to choose grandparents and so forth. I think our view…MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's childcare. That's different than a preschool.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, our – our view – well, very often preschool is childcare. It's at least a form of childcare. I know that, when I went to preschool…MARGARET BRENNAN: Your kids went to preschool.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes, and we use it as childcare, right? You're hoping your kids get a good education, but you're also doing it because you want to provide childcare for your kids. I don't think there's anything incongruous or inconsistent about that.And I think, look, we believe that we want to make it easier for American families, Margaret, to make their own choices on this stuff. We talk about school choice, of course, school choice would apply to all families, it would apply to all parents, and we would just want parents to have choices. And I think…MARGARET BRENNAN: Including for preschool, because, in many public school systems, there is no preschool. That's why I'm asking.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I think that we want parents to have choices, Margaret. Like I just said, we want them to be able to make the choices that make the most sense for their family. For some, it's going to be preschool. For some, it's going to be day care. For some, it's going to be having the kids stay at home a little bit longer.We just want the government to treat everybody equally, regardless of whatever education or family model you have.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have a very young family.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I do.MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a very accomplished wife, Usha, who she went to…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I'm very proud of her.MARGARET BRENNAN: … yes, Yale, Cambridge. She clerked at the Supreme Court. We heard her on stage at the RNC.You gave a recent interview to Megyn Kelly.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: And you spoke about white supremacists attacking your family…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: … because she's not a white person.How concerned are you that this kind of hate would follow you to the White House?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, look, it's going to follow us wherever we go, because that's the nature of public life in America, and it's disgraceful.Look, I love my wife. I'm very proud of her. I'm extremely lucky to have met her and to have gotten the chance to build a life with her. And my attitude on this is, people want to attack me, attack my policy views, they're welcome to. I signed up for it. My wife didn't sign up for it.And, by the way, she's out of the – she's way out of their league, the people who are attacking her. So I wish they would just keep their mouths shut, or at least focus on me. But, look, it's the nature of public life in this country. My wife's pretty tough, and she knows what we signed up for.MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine it's hard to keep your temper when you hear things like that.(LAUGHTER)SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes, I get pissed off sometimes, certainly…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: …when people attack your family, and certainly attack your family for something that no person can control.And I do think that there's been this thing in America…MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: … where we've said that we should judge people based on their skin color, based on their immutable characteristics, based on things that they can't control.I, frankly, think that, unfortunately, a lot of people on the left have leaned into this by trying to categorize people by skin color and then give special benefits or special amounts of discrimination. The Harris administration, for example, handed out farm benefits to people based on skin color. I think that's disgraceful.I don't – I don't think we should say, you get farm benefits if you're a black farmer, you don't get farm benefits if you're a white farmer. All farmers, we want to thrive, and that's certainly the President Trump and J.D. Vance view of the situation.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: But I do think, unfortunately, when our leaders divide us by race, you're going to have hate on the left side of the political spectrum. You're going to have hate on the right side of the political spectrum.We should just judge people based on individual characteristics and based on merit, and that's certainly what President Trump and I want to do.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But that wasn't born in the last four years, I mean, one of the…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: No, no, not at all, but I think that President Biden and Harris have certainly accelerated it.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I don't think you've seen any – anything like what we've seen from Kamala Harris when it comes to handing out government benefits based on people's immutable characteristics.The actual legal enshrinement of discrimination in this country, we haven't seen anything like it in the last 30 or 40 years. Certainly, back in the '60s and '50s, we all look at that as a period that we wanted to get away from, and, in some ways, the Harris administration has reimplemented it.I think it's pretty disgraceful.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in your own movement – that's what I want to ask about, because one of the supremacists who was saying things like this about your family…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: … Nick Fuentes, an avowed antisemite…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: … went after your wife. He had previously dined at Mar-a-Lago with Donald Trump.Does this have any room in your movement, in the MAGA movement?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Of course it doesn't have any room in the MAGA movement. And, of course…MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you disavow him and – and this?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And, of course – and, of course, Donald Trump has criticized this person.Look, I think the guy's a total loser. Certainly, I disavow him. But if you ask me what I care more about, is it a person attacking me personally, or is it government policy that discriminates based on race, that's what I really worry about.MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to mark this year the three-year anniversary of the U.S. – the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump negotiated that withdrawal.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: The execution, you've been very critical of as very chaotic, under President Biden.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's look at what you could do if you're in office.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: There are about 80,000 or so Afghans who were left behind, many of whom worked for the United States. Does America owe them? Should you bring them here?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, I think that we should bring people here who helped us and have been properly vetted. And that's very, very important, because a lot of the people the Biden administration has brought in have not been properly vetted. And I think…MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about Afghan vets?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And I think the most important – certainly, the Biden administration has let in Afghan nationals who say that they supported Americans, but actually did not.We also need to remember, Margaret, there was a lot, when we were in Afghanistan, a lot of so-called blue-on-green, or green-on-blue violence, where people who are allegedly supposed to help us killed American troops. Do I want them in our country? Of course I don't. In fact, I wish they weren't on this Earth anymore. So we have to be careful about who we let into this country. But I think the…MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm talking about people who worked alongside United States servicepeople…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And if they're…MARGARET BRENNAN: … on the ground in Afghanistan.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: And if they're properly vetted, I think that we should help them. Some of them don't want to come here, by the way, Margaret. Some of them would like us to give them safety in another country.MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you that because President Trump said a few days ago he'll suspend refugee admissions to the United States…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Exactly, because we're not properly…MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're saying not in this case?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: No, absolutely, I'm saying in this case, Margaret, because we're not properly vetting the people that are being let in through these refugee programs.What President Trump said is very important. You cannot show up at an American consulate and say, I helped the Americans. Go let me into America because I'm a refugee.MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not how the process works. You know that.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: It very often is how the process works, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: It is not.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: The Biden administration has been scandalous in not properly vetting these people. Donald Trump is exactly right.And, again, just because they helped us, allegedly, doesn't mean you have to let them come to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Maybe some of them should go to other countries. Maybe we should help some of them in their own country. And President Trump is exactly right about this.In fact, we know, we know beyond a shadow of doubt that some of the people who have been let into this country are on the terrorist watch list. That is disgraceful. And Trump is right that we should stop it.MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're conflating a few different things. You are now talking about people who have come in through the southern border, versus people who were vetted and worked with U.S. intelligence.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Oh, no, we – we – we've certainly let in people through refugee resettlement who should not be in this country. Absolutely, we have. We have not properly vetted everybody who's come in.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have something that you've been briefed on?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Certainly, if you look at…MARGARET BRENNAN: A specific example you're worried about?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, I have been – I have been briefed privately, but there's also been public reports of people who have come in through the refugee resettlement process who are actually on some kind of terrorism watch list who – or who, importantly, were not actually helping Americans, even though they claimed – we got to be careful, Margaret.We have a country to protect, and we have – I mean, I have three young children. I don't want people walking around the streets of this country who said they served the United States, but because the Biden Administration doesn't believe in immigration enforcement, they didn't properly vet them.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you view China as a competitor or an adversary?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I think they're both, right?And I think that what we want to do here is build the kind of international order where we can check China. We don't want to go to war with China, but, certainly, they're an adversary.I mean, they know – for example, the Chinese know that they're manufacturing tons of fentanyl they're letting come – come into our country. Kamala Harris has done nothing about this. She should apply diplomatic and economic leverage over the Chinese to stop manufacturing this fentanyl, which then comes into the Mexican drug cartels, which they then ship into our country.MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States has…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: This – this – this – this is a…MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States has designated some of these groups…SENATOR J.D. VANCE: This is a scandal.MARGARET BRENNAN: … and pressed the Chinese government.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Oh, we could do so much more.MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Fentanyl is not easy to manufacture, Margaret.And if Harris was applying proper leverage to the Chinese and to the Mexican drug cartels, we would not have so many people dying of fentanyl overdoses.MARGARET BRENNAN: Like, what? How – how do you do that? What's your vision of do – how you do that?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Well, I think you walk into – to – to Beijing, you talk to Xi Jinping, and you say, your entire economy is going to collapse unless you get access to American markets. You need to take this fentanyl seriously or we are going to impose serious tariffs and economic penalties for not following our laws and not helping us stem the flow of this deadly poison.MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wouldn't be worried about blowback on the U.S. economy?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I think that we have a powerful economy, Margaret, with the best workers in the entire world.If we need to fight a trade war with the Chinese, we will fight it and we will win it, but we cannot do what Kamala Harris has done, which is be so terrified of using the economic power that we have…MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: … that she's not even willing to stop the flow of this deadly poison coming into our country.MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi were lovely individuals when he was speaking in Montana last night. You agree with that characterization?SENATOR J.D. VANCE: I think that President Trump gets along with world leaders, and there's nothing wrong with him complimenting them as people, if it makes him more effective diplomatically. And there's an irony here.MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different than walking in and laying down the law to Xi Jinping.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: There's an – oh, no, it's not actually, because you're better able to lay down the law, like President Trump did, if you actually have a good relationship with people and they trust you to follow your word.We have to remember that Democrats, including Kamala Harris, attacked Donald Trump for having a good relationship with Vladimir Putin. Well, when Donald Trump was president, Vladimir Putin didn't invade another country. When Kamala Harris was vice president, he did. So maybe they should take a lesson from Trump's play – playbook about diplomatic legitimacy, because I think Donald Trump got a lot done because world leaders respected him.MARGARET BRENNAN: J.D. Vance, always good to talk to you.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Thanks, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for making time for us.SENATOR J.D. VANCE: Good to see you.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: The full interview is available on our YouTube channel and on our Web site.We will be back in one minute, so stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, the Trump campaign said it was hacked and suggested Iranian actors had stolen documents.E-mails obtained from that hack were reportedly sent to Politico and \"The Washington Post,\" but both organizations declined to publish them. The claim came a day after Microsoft revealed that Iran and other foreign actors are interfering in the campaign.We go now to CBS News intelligence and national security reporter Olivia Gazis and CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs. He was also the head of CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, during the Trump administration.So, Olivia, does U.S. intelligence assess that this was indeed Iran?OLIVIA GAZIS: So, far the U.S. intelligence community hasn't said either way.They have deferred instead to the Justice Department, as has the White House. They haven't weighed in on this alleged hack. Microsoft, likewise, is declining to comment beyond the original report that it already issued this week, which didn't specify which campaign was at issue.Both of them, however, thus far have said things about Iranian activity that lends credence to some of what the campaign has said. The intelligence community in its last update on election security in late July indicated that Iran was moving beyond being a chaos agent to actively intervening in order to affect the outcome of the presidential race.And while intelligence officials didn't specify explicitly which campaign Iran was trying to denigrate, officials said that they were opposing the candidate that they believe would exacerbate tensions. So, it looks right now like it's a reprisal of what happened in 2020, when U.S. intelligence concluded with high confidence that Iranian-linked actors had worked to undermine Mr. Trump's campaign at the direction of the supreme leader.I think it's worth noting that Microsoft's analysis did link the spearfishing attempt to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, which has a direct line…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.OLIVIA GAZIS: … to the supreme leader, and also notable that they weren't clear on the intentions.Iranians target senior political officials all of the time for intelligence-gathering purposes. Whether that was the purpose here, to gather intelligence, or to fuel an election interference campaign, or both, is still a question.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.CHRIS KREBS: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Chris, you were in office in 2020 when Iran tried to intervene then.CHRIS KREBS: That's right.MARGARET BRENNAN: How difference is – different is this?CHRIS KREBS: Well, that was a much more public effort.So if you recall, in late October, the Iranians sent a bunch of e-mails out to voters. They were able to collect e-mails through hacking into voter registration databases. And they threatened them. They posed as the Proud Boys. They said: We're going to come after you if you don't register to vote as a Republican and go out and vote for President Trump.Subsequent to that, they released a video. Immediately, the intelligence community was on top of it. There was a public press conference Wednesday evening with the director of national intelligence, the director of the FBI. I was there alongside the Department of Justice.And that was a – a stark difference from 2016, when it took about eight, nine months to make a public attribution.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.CHRIS KREBS: This was done in the order of 36 hours or something to that effect.MARGARET BRENNAN: Should we expect that now?CHRIS KREBS: I think it – based on the intelligence community's rapid declassification in advance of the Russian attack on Ukraine, it seems to be that that is the pattern for rapid declassification.So I – I would not be surprised to see something soon.MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break and come back and complete this conversation on the other side of it, so stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: In our next half-hour, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and the latest on the threat of attack from Iran and Hezbollah on Israel.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to our conversation on cyber security with Olivia Gazis and Chris Krebs.Chris, the Trump campaign is calling on reporters not to publish anything they might receive as a result of this alleged criminal behavior. The model I think of is what happened in 2016 when the DNC was hacked and e-mails ended up hurting Hillary Clinton's campaign. Is that what Iran is replicating now?CHRIS KREBS: It sure seems so. If you go back and you look at the Microsoft statement from Friday that talks about three prongs of an Iranian effort right now. One is to go after campaigns, another is this broader disinformation effort to stoke the fires among society. And the third element is they went after a county election official. That is the exact replicate - replication of the 2016 Russian playbook that was outlined in the 2017 intelligence community assessment. So, what I think we're seeing is the russification of Iranian information operations.Now, what is different is who is receiving the information and what they do. So, what are - what is the - the - what is \"Politico\" doing? What is \"The Washington Post\" doing? They are showing some discretion right now. I think that is an evolution in a response.What will also be interesting to see in what social media platforms do. They do have a mixed track record of - of allowing some of this information to get out there. In other cases they have suppressed or taken it off-line. And that is yet to be seen what's going to happen.MARGARET BRENNAN: A hack and dump, and does this information show up somewhere.CHRIS KREBS: This is a critical point here. This is hack and leak. This is mal information we've been told for over half a decade that hacking leak's not a real thing. Now that, in this case, the shoe's on the other foot, we are finding that, yes, in fact, hacking leak is a real thing. We should expect more of that.Keep in mind, it is August. We have a long way to go in this election. Iran specifically seems to have advanced their efforts, moved them to the left perhaps a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised to see Russia enter the fray soon. I mean Microsoft talks about Russian disinformation efforts. A group that we track, Senolabs (ph), known as \"Doppelganger,\" they are active. Others are going to be out there moving as well as the Chinese.MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Olivia, we know that national - the director of national intelligence has made clear it is Russia, it is also China, trying to have some influence here. What are they seeing in terms of preferred candidates? If Iran is trying to hurt Donald Trump, who are the others trying to help or hurt?OLIVIA GAZIS: Right. There's definitely an interesting dynamic this time around because as much as the focus today is on Iran, intelligence officials have actually said that Russia continues to pose the preeminent threat in 2024. They are active, they are aggressive, they are increasingly reaching for tools that boost the efficacy and sophistication of the campaigns that they're launching.And as with the case in Iran, intelligence officials aren't explicit about whose campaign they're intervene to undermine or boost, but said that their preferences haven't changed, which in 2016 and 2020 we know that at President Putin's direction there was a broad campaign led by Russian actors in order to denigrate the Democratic candidates and support Mr. Trump.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.OLIVIA GAZIS: What makes things interesting this year is, Iran and Russia being at cross purposes, all while deepening their strategic partnership in Ukraine, right?MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a great point.OLIVIA GAZIS: Exchanging missile and technologies there.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.OLIVIA GAZIS: But again, they're probably both happy for the byproduct of as much disinformation and discord it - sowing as much of that as they can over the course of the election season.MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know we're going to be talking about this unfortunately through the election, as you just said, Chris Krebs.CHRIS KREBS: And that - that is a key point, chaos is the point here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, chaos is the point. And we need to sort out fact from fiction.Thank you both for helping us do that.We want to go now to Kansas Democratic Governor Laura Kelly.Good morning to you, Governor.GOV. LAURA Kelly (D-KS): Good morning to you.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, you are in a pretty unique position here. You are a twice elected Democratic governor of a pretty red state. Democrats have been bleeding support in rural America for years. How do Democrats woo back rural America?LAURA KELLY: Well, you just have to get out there and listen and then produce. You know, it - when you - when you do that, you will see that, you know, while we label everybody red or blue, the fact of the matter is, here in Kansas, we're Kansans. And so, you know, if you are a Democrat, but you share the values of most Kansans, you just need to get out there, talk with them, get them to know you, you to know them, and then they'll develop that trust and put it in you to run the state.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tim Walz is the first sitting governor to join a Democratic presidential ticket since Bill Clinton. He runs a pretty blue state, but there seems to be a bet that he can speak to the heartland, that he can speak to rural America. Do you think that's overstated?LAURA KELLY: No, not at all. I mean Tim Walz is the epitome of the midwestern dad. You know, you could put him at any state fair, on any main street, and certainly in a Friday night football game in rural Kansas, and he would fit right in.I think we also need to remember that while Minnesota is a blue state, he represented in Congress for 12 years a very red section of Minnesota. So, he understand rural Minnesota. He understand rural America. And I think that's one of the reasons that he is a huge asset to the Harris-Walz team.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of the first to put the issue of abortion on a state ballot to leave it to the voters to decide. And those voters overwhelmingly rejected restrictions. So, Democrats often push - point to your state as proof of concept that this is a galvanizing issue across party lines. But I found it interesting in interviews that you've said, you try not to talk about abortion. Are Democrats miscalculating by putting it front and center?LAURA KELLY: No, I don't think so. I think - I didn't put it front and center because it wasn't an issue that I could really deal with. It was a ballot issue. Those issues go right around me and on to the ballot and to the people. So, I decided that it was better for me to let the people decide what they wanted to do with that and for me to continue to focus on the other issues where I actually could have an impact, you know, on our infrastructure, on our economic development, on our schools.So - but we can see in other states where governors have come out very aggressively supporting women's reproductive rights. Michigan, for instance, comes to mind. And it has worked. You know, they have moved the needle in Michigan and other states because they have focused on that issue. And whether we want it to be an issue or not, it is. And I think it will be an issue in the presidential race this year, too.MARGARET BRENNAN: But I read that you said one of the reasons you personally tried not to talk about it was not just procedural, but also because you said Democrats are getting drawn in to hot button culture war issues. And you said you don't want to get dragged into conversations that you don't want to have. What do you mean by that?LAURA KELLY: Well, I don't want to get distracted by issues that take us away from the core issues of run - that a governor is responsible for. And - and that is just what I said before. You've got - you've got to make sure your schools are funded. You've got to make sure your roads are built. You've got to make sure you're building in your economy. You've got to make sure you're fixing your child welfare system. We've got all sort of other things that we need to be focused on. And what I found, particularly during my campaigns, is that the - my opponents wanted to use cultural socially divisive issues to distract from the real issues because they didn't have answers for that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Governor, it will be interesting to see if you can replicate your success. And we will track what is happening, not just in Kansas, but in some of these other gubernatorial races around the country.We'll be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan.Good to have you here.BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): It's great to be here again, Margaret. Good to see you.MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to see you.And this is a week where we had a lot of turbulence in the financial markets and some jitters here. We know that both presidential campaigns in the coming days will outline their vision for the economy. So, I'm hoping you can kind of level-set for us. What is the reality of what you are seeing with American consumers right now?BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, in our consumer base of 60 million customers spending every week, what you're seeing is they're spending at a rate of growth of - this year over last year for July and August so far about 3 percent. That is half the rate it was last year at this time. And so the consumer has slowed down. They have money in their accounts, but they're depleting a little bit. They're employed. They're earning money. And it - but if you look at it, they've really slowed down. So, the Fed is in a position, they have to be careful that they don't slow down too much.Right now where they are spending at is consistent where they've spent in '17, '18, '19, the low inflation, more normal growth economy.MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw, in one of your Bank of America reports, that - and you just alluded to this, more price sensitivity, and that savings accounts are being diminished.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: That would suggest people really are not bringing in enough, that they have to go into their - into their savings. Like, is this all just inflation that's pressuring?BRIAN MOYNIHAN: If you look across different segments of earnings power, those answers are somewhat different.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But if you look at it overall, there's been a lot of money moved to instruments that pay higher interest rates out of checking accounts, they cleaned up because it went from zero percent interest to five percent interest. And so if you remove that, basically the people who had an account with us in January 2020, before the pandemic, you look at them now, they're still sitting with much more - even inflation adjusted, much more in their account. The problem is, it's started drifting down, which indicates that they're using that money now to maintain their lifestyle. That's not that unusual in the summer months, frankly, because of travel and vacations and everything.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And where the money is being spent by our consumers is on those type of experiences. But if you look within it, they're still going to restaurants and they're taking travel. But on the other hand, they're spending a little bit less - they're going to the food store the same number of times, but spending a little bit less, which means they're basically finding bargains and things like that. And you're seeing corporations cut price to respond to that. And so it's the way the economy works in those - it's slowing down. And that's where we have to be careful because we've won the war on inflation. It's come down. It's not where people want it yet. But we've got to be careful that we don't try to get so perfect that we actually put us in recession.But our team is a great team at Bank of America research, does not have any recession predicament anymore. Last year this time it was a recession. This year we talked about, now there's no recession. And basically they say we go to 2 percent growth to 1.5 percent growth over the next six quarters and kind of bump along at that growth rate plus or minus 2 (ph) percent (ph).MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're betting that in September the Federal Reserve does go ahead with an interest rate cut.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and I think that's the - that's the market consensus is actually more cuts than our team is. Ours is two this year, September, December, four next year, and a couple next year. But I think one of the concepts out hear out there a lot, Margaret, is this concept of higher for longer. The reality is, our team, and most people think we'll set (ph) them with 3, 3.5 percent Fed Funds Rate, which is much different than the last 15, 17 years people have lived it. So, people who came into the business world, you know, in 2007, 2008 have not seen this kind of interest rate environment.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And so we're getting back to normal. And that's going to take a while for people to adjust to, both on the corporate side, commercial side, and on the consumer side.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm not asking you a political question here. The Federal Reserve is set up by Congress as politically neutral.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: It, you know, has to deal with employment and stabilizing prices. This past week Donald Trump was asked if, as president, he could manage a soft landing of the economy with the current Federal Reserve leadership in place. Here is how he responded.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I feel a president should have at least say in there. Yes, I feel that strongly. I think that in my case I've made a lot of money. I was very successful. And I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.(END VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman was appointed by Donald Trump, Jerome Powell, and continues to serve.But what he's talking about now is political leaders influencing or overriding economists in setting the Fed Funds Rate, in setting interest rates.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I think it would be -MARGARET BRENNAN: What would be the implication of that?BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I think, if you look around the world's economies and you see where fed central banks are independent and operate freely, they tend to fair better than ones that don't. And so I think that that's kind of the - the American way. It's been that way.Does that stop people from giving the - Chair Powell advice or other people? No. I give him advice, you know. So, we all give him advice. And so I think you - we've got to be careful. You know, when he goes up and does the Humphrey Hawkins, he gets lots of advice about where rates should go. So, there's a lot of people that have a view of it. But their job is to sort through it all and say what's best for the U.S. economy on those two dimensions you talked about and be consistent.I think right now Brian Moynihan giving advice has got to be more careful of the downside of not starting moving down rates, to restore a feeling that, you know, there's light at the end of the tunnel. They've told people rates probably aren't going to go up, but if they don't start taking them down relatively soon, you could dispirit the American consumer.Once the American consumer really starts going very negative, then it's hard to get them back. And on the commercial side, the high rate environment is slowing down commercial progress. So, the corporations aren't using their lines of credit. Middle markets, small businesses, they're - they 've gone backwards in their use of lines of credit. So, why don't they use a line of credit? Either there is an opportunity or the cost is high or both. And right now that's a little bit they're worried about the future.So, I think right now it's time for them to start to take the – become a little more accommodative and take off the restrictions and let the thing (INAUDIBLE). So, I'm giving them advice, everybody does, and I think the strong central bank has to take all that advice and process it.MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not unusual during a political campaign to hear some of the populist ideas, but one thing I've heard from Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, I've heard from you at Bank of America, is this concern of when you send checks to people, as we've discussed with J.D. Vance, when you talk about now taxing tips as now both campaigns are doing, that there is still that hard question of, how does America deal with the debts and deficits it already has.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: Those conversations just aren't happening. What does that cost?BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think right now the cost is not that high. I mean there's a mathematical cost to it as interest rates go up, the debt carry cost goes up for the federal government, just like it goes up for the consumer or companies. And so that's a hurt to the economy because that money could have been used for something else had they not borrowed so much.The second question is, was there more stimulus applied to the Covid issues than needed.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And the answer is yes by most economists. Multiples. And so that - we've got to let that work its way out of the system. That's what helped inflation. And it happened on both administration's watch.Now, the third question really is this question of handling the debt. And at the end of the day, you know, 15 years or so ago, the Bowles-Simpson commission came out with ways to do it.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There was an idea it will raise taxes. The response to the business community is, if you're going to raise taxes, for what?MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: If you're going to do it to pay down debt, you know, individuals and companies would probably say, I got that. We've - we've had to wage a war on Covid. We won the war and now we've got to move it. But we can't just raise taxes and stuff that doesn't really provide for productivity or frankly help manage the debt.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And that's a concern people have. That will be a political food fight of high order here for the next few months.MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will definitely be talking about that as we go into 2025 and the expiration of some of those tax policies.Brian Moynihan, it's great to have you here.BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's always good to be here, Margaret. Thank you.MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Tensions are high in the Middle East where fears of an expanding regional war are growing a week after Israel killed a top Hamas leader in Iran and two Hezbollah commanders.For more we go to retired General Frank McKenzie, who was the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East.Good to have you back.GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE (Retired Former Commander United States Central Command): Good to be here, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: General, we've talked a number of times in recent months and the scenario you have flagged is the most concerning is one it seems we are on the brink of, and that is Lebanese-Hezbollah entering this conflict potentially in a significant way. How do you characterize where we are right now?FRANK MCKENZIE: Margaret, I think we are hours, maybe days, not weeks away from Lebanese-Hezbollah entering this fight. And that's always been the big variable. They are the largest nonstate military entity in the world. You know, a parasite on Lebanon. But they have tens and tens of thousands of highly accurate rockets and missiles and they can challenge Israel in a way that Iran, and the Houthis for that matter, are unable to do so because of their geographic proximity, because of the number of weapons that they have. And that's - that's very concerning. I've thought all along the most dangerous turn in events would be if they chose to enter its scale.Now, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanese Hezbollah, has got to make a very strategic decision on this because he will be open to a withering Israeli counter attack should he choose to enter at great scale. And what would great scale be? Don't know. I would say if he chooses to attack Israeli population centers, I would say if he - if significant casualties are caused by a Hezbollah attack, that will bring the IDF in, back in, with great force. And he recognizes that.And the last point I'd just make is, Hassan Nasrallah and Lebanese Hezbollah are perhaps weaker in Lebanon now than they've been in many years because of the destruction of the economy, the fact that the country is in governmental gridlock, lots of problems in Lebanon that he has to think about before he chooses to fight Israel toe to toe.MARGARET BRENNAN: And that certainly is something the diplomats who are trying to cool things off are very aware of.Your successor, CENTCOM Command General Kurilla, was twice in Israel this past week. We know the United States has sent F-22 jets to the region. What do you expect the scope of U.S. involvement to be?FRANK MCKENZIE: I think we saw a taste of that last April in Iran's 13 April attack on Israel, which was not a successful attack and it was not successful for several reasons, one of which was Israeli competence (ph). The second was U.S. assistance and some assistance from other nations in the region. All of those things militated to blunt and really turn aside the Iranian attack.I think that General Kurilla will probably strive to reproduce those same capabilities, that same approach this time. It will be a significantly harder task, though, again, if Lebanese-Hezbollah chooses to enter because now you face a multi-axis attack. Iranian from the east, Lebanese-Hezbollah from the north. I'm sure Hamas will chime in to the limits of their ability. And the Houthis will come in. So, what will be a significant test for Israel, we are committed to their defense. I think that Central Command has done a great job of assisting them as they prepare for this attack, which I believe is imminent.MARGARET BRENNAN: Is imminent. You would expect to see U.S. jets in the air there intercepting as they did last time?FRANK MCKENZIE: I think we would see the same model that was used last time. Now, here's the thing. The Iranians and Lebanese-Hezbollah have had the opportunity to study that template. I'm sure they'll try to make some adjustments that will make it more difficult. On the other hand, we too are an adaptive learning organization. So, we'll be looking at our tactics. And we've got very good commanders that can fight an air battle and it will be an air battle that's going to be fought and I think - I think we can be very successful here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the U.S. strategy of trying to focus in on August 15th and a cease-fire in Gaza should still be the centerpiece for lowering tensions throughout the region?FRANK MCKENZIE: Certainly, we should try to get to some post-conflict state in Gaza. That's an - that's an objective that needs to be there regardless of whatever else is going on in the region.I'm not certain, though, that the current Iranian efforts against Israel are directly related to what's going on in Gaza. You know, the Iranians, fundamental to Iranian philosophy of life is destruction of the state of Israel. We should take them at their word on this. They're not actually going to attack or come into conflict with Israel because of what's going on in Gaza. Their reasons are the existence of Israel itself. And those transcend anything going on in Gaza.MARGARET BRENNAN: Sir, before I let you go, August 15th is the anniversary of the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan a few years ago. I wonder what you think about U.S. security currently.FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I think about it a lot, Margaret. And three years on, our ability to see inside Afghanistan is quite limited. The violent extremist organizations characterized by ISIS-K and other groups, we believe they're actually expanding. They carried out a successful attack in Russia a few months ago. I am concerned about the growth of those organizations, and I'm concerned about their relative lack of our ability to see what they're doing and act against them should it prove necessary to do so. So, I think we're in a weaker state now than we were a year ago or two years ago, and I - I am concerned about the future.MARGARET BRENNAN: General, always good to talk to you. And we'll all be on edge, as you said, for the coming days.Thank you.And thanks to all of us - all of you out there for watching us.

The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Democratic presidential candidate Harris leading her Republican rival Trump by an identical 50 per cent to 46 per cent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Under the United States electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party. Harris’ apparent lead is within the polls’ average margin of error of 4.5 points. Nevertheless, the polls show a shift compared to previous surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden. Biden dropped out of the White House race last month and endorsed Harris instead. The Trump campaign pushed back against the new polls, questioning their methodology and suggesting they were released “with the clear intent and purpose of depressing support for President Trump”. Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris’ candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside. Her announcement on Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energised Democrats. The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans’ successful national convention last month. But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favourability – up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found. Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Trump, his running mate JD Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris – with Trump even questioning her racial identity. But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states. Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found. Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction. The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/new-polls-give-harris-a-lead-over-trump-in-three-key-states/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PAGE-28-A_12082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:02:35","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":253894892,"title":"Trump campaign says hit by hackers","text":"WASHINGTON (AFP) – Donald Trump’s campaign said on Saturday it had been hacked, blaming “foreign sources” for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate JD Vance.

We've been through a lot together. I want to thank everyone in here for your love and longstanding support and friendship and for your dedication to this country.\" The mood at the fundraiser was warm and optimistic — one woman in the front row waved a sign that said \"Make America Joyful Again.\" But Harris turned serious when she argued that fundamental rights such as healthcare, same-sex marriage and abortion are at stake in the race against former President Trump. \"We know what we need to do — we need to knock on doors, we need to register folks to vote, we need to get people to the polls. And every day matters,\" she said. \"That's why we're going to win, but let's not take anything for granted.\" The event, which drew House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, Rep. Barbara Lee, San Francisco Giants Chief Executive Larry Baer and a slew of other elected officials and donors, raised more than $12 million in the city that laid the foundation for Harris’ political career. Tickets cost between $3,300 and $500,000. Harris worked as a prosecutor and a City Hall attorney in San Francisco before being elected district attorney in 2002, which served as a springboard to her later roles as state attorney general and then U.S. senator. \"This is a good day when we welcome Kamala Harris back home to California,\" said Pelosi, who introduced the vice president. \"She makes us all so proud, she brings us so much joy, she gives us so much hope.\" The event had the feel of a family reunion. Harris' niece's young children posed for pictures in front of a large Harris/Walz campaign sign on the stage. She called out several attendees from the stage, showering the most attention on Newsom. She reminisced about the day in 2004 when they took their oath of office in San Francisco, she as district attorney and he as mayor, and also their work marrying gay couples that year. \"I have known Gavin as a friend and colleague for so, so many years,\" she said. \"I want to thank you in front of all of our friends who are here for being an extraordinary leader of California and the nation.\" The event capped a whirlwind three weeks in the presidential campaign, with President Biden announcing he would not seek reelection, Democrats quickly coalescing around the vice president as their nominee and Harris selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. In Biden's first interview since he announced he would not seek another term, he said his decision was driven by the importance of beating Trump, the concerns among some members of the House and the Senate that he could harm their chances and that his candidacy could \"be a real distraction.\" \"The critical issue for me still, it's not a joke, maintaining this democracy,\" he said on an interview that aired on CBS on Sunday. While \"it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I — the most important thing you can do — and that is, we must — we must — we must defeat Trump.” Harris and Walz spent last week barnstorming battleground states — events that have drawn large crowds. \"Folks are coming to these events and they're bringing with them so much joy. People are singing and they're dancing in the aisles long before we get there,\" Harris said. \"They're showing up not only because we must beat Donald Trump, they're showing up because they believe in our country and our freedom.\" On Saturday, the Democrats collected the endorsement of the powerful Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas, and Harris announced she supported not taxing tips — an immensely popular proposal among service industry workers and one Trump backed in June. “Copy Cat Kamala directly plagiarized President Trump’s No Tax on Tips policy proposal to let hard-working service workers keep more of their own hard-earned money,” the Republican’s campaign said in a statement. Sunday's fundraiser also took place four years from the day Biden selected her to be his running mate, months after Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign sputtered out. “It’s been the best decision I've made,” Biden wrote in a fundraising appeal. “Kamala's sharp. She's tough. She's going to make one hell of a president.” California Republicans chose the location of Sunday's fundraiser to cast doubt on Democratic leadership and point out dysfunction in San Francisco. “For anyone unsure of what a Harris presidency would look like, take some time to tour her hometown where crime is running rampant, homelessness is visible on seemingly every street corner, and storefronts and office spaces sit empty as businesses close and people move away with no plans to return,” said state GOP chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson in a statement. Given California’s deep blue tilt, it will not be contested in November. But it is home to so many wealthy donors that it provides the most campaign cash to candidates on both sides of the aisle. The GOP's vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, recently headlined two fundraisers in the state. On Tuesday, Walz is expected to attend a fundraiser in Newport Beach, the same day Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff raises money at an event in Los Angeles. Attendee Susie Tompkins Buell, the co-founder of Esprit and The North Face who has known Harris since the 1990s, said she could not recall the last time she had seen this much energy among Democrats, which she attributed to Harris’ candidacy as well as the “danger to our country from within” posed by the prospect of Trump winning another term. “Kamala’s youth and positive energy is like a fresh gust of a cool breeze on a sweltering, humid day. So refreshing and hopeful,” said Tompkins Buell, whose husband served as Harris’ finance chair during her district attorney and attorney general campaigns. “She has been an important part of our community for years,” added. “I am so impressed by her consistency. She is very confident in who she is and her style has always been the same, just improved. It’s all impressive.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris returned to California on Sunday and reveled in being surrounded by supporters she has known for decades.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-08-11/kamala-harris-holds-san-francisco-fundraiser","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39ed1ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3984x2092+0+202/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F06%2F20d836394d0d98c62ef64c3bcb24%2F1470713-me-harris-wa","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:00:49","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.477},{"id":253895062,"title":"MSNBC host rebukes reporters 'whining' over Harris' press avoidance, wonders if she can win 'without them'","text":"MSNBC co-host Michael Steele chastised the media for \"whining\" about Vice President Kamala Harris’ limited engagement with the press, wondering Saturday if she can bypass reporters entirely and make her case to the public \"without them.\" During a Saturday interview on MSNBC’s \"The Weekend,\" Steele defended Harris for largely avoiding the media since ascending as the Democratic nominee and accused reporters of treating former President Trump with kid gloves during his press conference last week. \"What has struck me since Donald Trump’s press conference is the sort of highbrow nature of the press coming at Kamala Harris,\" Steele said. \"Saying, in my view, whining, that ‘she doesn’t talk to us. She hasn’t done a sit down with us. She hasn’t done interviews with us.’ And I watch that press conference and I go, ‘Well, you start actually asking real questions of Donald Trump, and pressing him, then that sort of creates a space of balance.'\" MSNBC'S MICHAEL STEELE ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘CONSPIRACY THEORIES’ AFTER QUESTIONING TRUMP'S EAR WOUND Harris is facing mounting pressure to answer questions from the media after spending just two minutes last Thursday engaging with reporters. Prior to that, Harris went 18 days without speaking to the press and continues to dodge formal media engagements. Pointing to polling that shows Harris currently leading in battleground states, Steele wondered whether it would even benefit the vice president to do any formal interviews from now until November. \"At what point do you say strategically, ‘Why do I need to talk to you right now? I’m talking to the American people and we’re having a conversation. You’re happy to follow it and to report on it,'\" Steele said. \"You know she’s going to sit down at some point. But right now, is there a real need for her to sort of get the imprimatur of the press on her campaign and her efforts when she’s having a very good conversation, seemingly, with the American people without them?\" he went on. Harris answered a handful of questions on the airport tarmac while campaigning in Michigan on Thursday, an informal press engagement that lasted roughly two minutes. When one reporter asked her to respond to criticism about her lack of interviews or formal press conferences since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Harris replied, \"I've talked to my team. I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\" KAMALA HARRIS FINALLY FIELDS QUESTIONS FROM PRESS AFTER DODGING MEDIA FOR 18 DAYS SINCE BECOMING DEM NOMINEE NOTUS reporter Jasmine Wright told MSNBC later Thursday that Harris' past \"damaging moments\" are on her team's mind as they deliberately keep her away from the press. \"We’ve seen some, kind of, damaging moments when speaking to the press, particularly that first interview she did in 2021 with Lester Holt about her work on immigration,\" Wright said of the infamous moment when Harris scrambled as she was pressed on visiting the southern border. Over the weekend, a major liberal media outlet published a piece calling on journalists to press Harris on questions about her policies so that voters know where she stands with November drawing near. The New Yorker staff writer Jay Caspian King wrote that Harris’ campaign strategy involves her staying away from the press and waiting for former President Trump to make a mistake. However, he argued that it is the media’s job not to let the Democratic candidate get away with hiding prior to potentially assuming the most powerful office in the world. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's the job of the press in a healthy democracy to make sure that voters know whom they’re supporting. An unexamined candidate can become anything, and can work under the influence of anyone, when they assume power,\" he wrote. Trump held a lengthy news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. His campaign branded the presser as a \"stark contrast\" to Harris' lack of media availability.","summary":"MSNBC analyst Michael Steele defended Vice President Kamala Harris amid mounting pressure to answer questions from the media after avoiding formal interviews or press briefings since becoming the Democratic nominee.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-steele-rebukes-reporters-whining-over-harris-press-avoidance-wonders-she-can-win-without-them","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/931/523/GettyImages-1527908871.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 22:00:32","author":"Yael Halon","authors":["Yael Halon"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":253897168,"title":"Trump spreads false conspiracy theory about Harris’ Detroit crowd size","text":"Donald Trump falsely claimed in a series of social media posts Sunday that “nobody” attended Vice President Kamala Harris’ Michigan rally last week — and said his Democratic rival should be “disqualified” over a “fake crowd picture.” The former president appeared to have fallen for a far-right conspiracy theory — one easily disproven by photos and videos captured by attendees and media showing thousands of supporters at the event at an airport hangar near Detroit. The false claims about attendance at Harris’ event come as Trump navigates the contours of a changed presidential race, with the vice president riding a wave of new Democratic enthusiasm after replacing President Joe Biden atop the ticket. The GOP nominee, who regularly draws large crowds of his own, has long been fixated on audience size, with his speeches often filled with exaggerated boasts about the turnout. Trump, on his social media website Truth Social, made the fabricated claim that Harris had been “turned in” by an airport maintenance worker who “noticed the fake crowd picture.” He then said Harris should be “disqualified” from the 2024 election “because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!” However, photos and videos of the event — including videos captured with CNN’s cameras — reflect a sizable audience for Harris’ Wednesday event. The crowd filled a large hangar and spilled onto the sprawling tarmac where Air Force Two had stopped. Two large risers and many rows of chairs were outside, as well as several giant screens for the outdoor crowd that couldn’t see the rally stage. David Plouffe, a Harris campaign senior adviser, wrote on X: “These are not conspiratorial rantings from the deepest recesses of the internet. The author could have the nuclear codes and be responsible for decisions that will affect us all for decades.” Trump on Sunday shared a screenshot of an X post that featured two photos: One shared on X by a Harris staffer that showed thousands of people greeting Harris’ plane; another zoomed in on the curved, reflective side of one of Air Force Two’s engines in which the crowd isn’t clear. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “She was turned in by a maintenance worker at the airport when he noticed the fake crowd picture, but there was nobody there, later confirmed by the reflection of the mirror like finish on the Vice Presidential Plane.” “She’s a CHEATER. She had NOBODY waiting, and the ‘crowd’ looked like 10,000 people! Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches,” added Trump. “She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!” Trump has twice been indicted over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He falsely claimed in another post, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!” In reaction to Trump’s false claims, rally attendees and Harris staffers were sharing their own photos from the event on social media Sunday afternoon. Lavora Barnes, the Michigan Democratic Party chairwoman, shared on X a photo from the event showing her speaking to a large crowd before Harris was introduced. Barnes joked that she was “honored that whoever made the AI image of 15,000 excited Democrats welcoming” Harris and running mate Tim Walz to Detroit “was kind enough to include me at the lectern.” “That AI crowd was really loud, my ears just stopped ringing from their imaginary cheering,” Barnes said.

With an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night, the closing ceremony put a final flourish to Paris’ first Games in a century. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage. More razzmatazz came: Hollywood star Tom Cruise descended from the top of the stadium to the “Mission Impossible” theme song, shaking hands with athletes, before taking the Olympic flag from star gymnast Simone Biles, putting it on the back of motorcycle and driving out of the stadium. In a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach — who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show — said the Games “can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,” noting that the athletes “respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.” For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are scheduled to perform Sunday as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels — made official as LA Mayor Karen Bass received the Olympic flag from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. At the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron — powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels — had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories — a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.” With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes — many wearing their shiny medals — and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. The national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals — 16 of them gold — marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals — each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women — the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday. The women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Jolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ. Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them.","summary":"Paris is closing out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show in France’s national stadium, handing over hosting duties for the Summer Games to the next city in line: Los Angeles in 2028.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/sports/olympics/2024-08-11/paris-olympics-closing-ceremony-stars-14835622.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/bvpmbj-ap24224744940728.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP24224744940728.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:51:37","author":"JOHN LEICESTER","authors":["JOHN LEICESTER"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.682},{"id":253894346,"title":"Trump Campaign Offers Potential Ride on Air Force 2 With JD Vance","text":"On Sunday afternoon, Donald Trump's campaign unveiled an opportunity for supporters to win a future ride on Air Force Two with Ohio Senator JD Vance who the campaign hopes will be in the White House after this year's presidential election.The fundraising campaign encourages supporters to enter to win \"this ALL-EXPENSES-PAID trip of a lifetime\" by contributing any amount to the Trump-Vance campaign.In a Sunday email blast, the campaign wrote, \"JD Vance didn't just ask anyone to join...He asked for YOU, a true MAGA Patriot!\" referring to the former president's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.The email links to an online donations page that shows a banner of who just donated and how much money was given.

Campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said that Harris raised more than $81 million within the first 24-hour period following Biden's announcement.The Harris campaign also stated that it began the month of August with $377 million cash on hand, which they noted was the most for a presidential candidate at this moment in the election cycle. In comparison, the Trump campaign reported having $327 million cash on-hand to begin the month of August.July was also an eventful month for the Trump campaign. During a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, a gunman on a nearby rooftop about 150 yards away opened fire, injuring the former president and two attendees, as well as killing 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore.Several days later, Trump appeared at the Republican National Convention (RNC) to accept his official nomination and announce Vance as his running mate.Trump's campaign said it raised $138.7 million in July. On Saturday, Trump attended a private fundraising dinner in Aspen, Colorado, which according to The Aspen Times featured various levels of participation, ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 per couple.Harris is set to appear at a fundraiser on Sunday evening in San Francisco alongside former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. Tickets for the \"Harris Victory Fund\" event ranged from $3,300 to $50,000, and according to NBC News, a campaign official said that the event has sold out, with nearly 700 RSVPs, generating over $12 million for the campaign.","summary":"In a Sunday email blast, the Trump-Vance campaign wrote that the Ohio senator \"didn't just ask anyone to join...He asked for YOU, a true MAGA Patriot!\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-campaign-offers-potential-ride-air-force-2-jd-vance-1937627","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2447594/vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:47:33","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":253894344,"title":"Stephen King Reacts to Trump's Rant About Kamala Harris Rally Crowd Size","text":"Horror novelist Stephen King wrote on social media on Sunday that Donald Trump \"has really lost it\" after the former president went on a rant claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, used artificial intelligence (AI) in a photo to bolster her rally crowd size in Detroit earlier this week.Harris has hit the ground running after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed her on July 21. She has brought in tens of thousands of attendees at her rallies in Philadelphia, Detroit and Glendale, Arizona, according to her campaign. Meanwhile, Harris' campaign has used the vice president's large crowd sizes to repeatedly mock Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, for having empty seats at his campaign events.Referencing Harris' rally in Detroit, Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday afternoon, \"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!\"The former president claimed that the large crowd at Harris' rally was also \"fake,\" adding, \"She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.

Trump? Empty seats even in MAGA country. Not a good look for Felony Boy,\" King wrote, referring to the 34 counts of falsifying business records that a New York jury handed down on the former president in late May. Trump has maintained his innocence, claimed the case was politically motivated and moved to dismiss the case, which involves a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.Harris' rally in Las Vegas on Saturday brought in over 12,000 people, according to the Harris campaign, and roughly 4,000 people were turned away due to concerns of overheating, the Nevada Current reported.Earlier this week, Trump claimed that the media has favored Harris when talking about big rally sizes.\"If Kamala has 1,000 people at a Rally, the Press goes 'crazy,' and talks about how 'big' it was - And she pays for her 'Crowd.'\" he wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday. \"When I have a Rally, and 100,000 people show up, the Fake News doesn't talk about it, THEY REFUSE TO MENTION CROWD SIZE. The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!\"Did Harris Use AI to 'Fake' Crowd Sizes?About an hour after Trump posted about Harris' rally crowd sizes, the Harris campaign shared two videos of Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, coming off of Air Force Two in Detroit on Wednesday to a sea of supporters on the tarmac and in a hangar where they were set to speak. According to Harris' campaign, over 15,000 people attended the Detroit rally.The first video was in response to another post from Trump claiming to show the \"fake\" crowd. \"In case you forgot @realdonaldtrump: This is what a rally in a swing state looks like,\" the Harris campaign wrote alongside the video.The photo Trump posted was analyzed by the fact-checking organization Snopes who used AI-detection tools and determined it was \"likely photographed by someone and not created using an AI-generation tool,\" but added that the image posted by the former president is \"possible it was digitally edited.\"In the second post, the Harris campaign wrote: \"Warning: The content of this video may upset @realDonaldTrump.\"On Thursday, MLive, an online Michigan newspaper, shared a photo of a crowd of Harris supporters in front of Air Force Two on the tarmac in Detroit on Wednesday.Meanwhile, throughout the election season and before, Trump has boasted about the size of his rallies, often relying on unsubstantiated evidence or guesswork.Newsweek has debunked a previous claim that the former president made about attracting 60,000 people to a rally in Dayton, Ohio, in March 2024 and another claim that he attracted 50,000 people to an event in Pickens, South Carolina, in July 2023 was unverified.","summary":"The former president claimed on Truth Social on Sunday that the large crowd seen in a photo at Harris' campaign rally in Detroit was \"fake.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/stephen-king-donald-trump-kamala-harris-plane-crowd-artificial-intelligence-1937624","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2447591/harris-plane.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:43:03","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":253897234,"title":"Trump falsely accuses Kamala Harris of using AI to show massive crowd at rally","text":"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday falsely accused rival Kamala Harris of using artificial intelligence to create the illusion of a larger crowd at her recent Wednesday campaign rally near Detroit, Michigan.— Shayan86 (@Shayan86) Earlier Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social: “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?

But her crowds and momentum keep growing","text":"Republicans continue to insist that Kamala Harris’s momentum out of the gate is merely a “honeymoon” phase that will slow or halt soon — but there’s no sign of it slowing down just yet. As GOP attacks focused on her running mate’s military record and work as governor of Minnesota, they have largely failed to resonate with voters thus far. Harris is charging into August with another $36 million in the bank after the successful rollout of Tim Walz as her vice presidential nominee last Tuesday. Her campaign is also surging in the polls as enthusiasm among Democrats and independents for the Democratic ticket has rebounded following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race. Republicans have dismissed her sudden shift in the race’s dynamics as nothing more than a temporary plateauing of support for Harris even though they have shown no signs of being able to blunt it. The vice president and her running mate will appear onstage in front of a major national audience later this month at the four-day Democratic National Convention, and given that party conventions are typically accompanied by boosts in popularity Harris could see her momentum continue through the end of the month. In the wake of Donald Trump’s rambling, nonsensical press conference this past week aimed recapturing the headlines, his party is attempting to make the argument that Harris is hiding from journalists. The vice president has responded to this saying she’ll do a full sitdown interview by the end of the month, and she sometimes takes reporters’ shouted questions while coming to and from events. “All this is a little bit of a honeymoon phase with Harris. She still hasn’t taken any questions from media. She’s done no interviews whatsoever, and she’s hiding from her record. You have to answer those questions at some point,” Senator Markwayne Mullin, a Republican, told NewsNation on Sunday in the latest attempt by a Republican to land that attack. Trump has also launched his own attacks on Harris’s honeymoon. On Sunday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Kamala Harris, whose ‘Honeymoon’ period is ENDING, and is starting to get hammered in the Polls, just copied my NO TAXES ON TIPS Policy. The difference is, she won’t do it, she just wants it for Political Purposes! This was a TRUMP idea - She has no ideas, she can only steal from me. Remember, Kamala has proposed the LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN HISTORY - It won’t happen. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Even Trump’s pollsters noted the shift in the polling since Harris took the Democrat’s top spot. Pollster Tony Fabrizio told campaign staff that polls would get worse before they got better, but stressed the race had not fundamentally changed, according to the New York Times. Fabrizio said voters will saddle Harris with Biden’s policies and her backing of a liberal approach to criminal justice. That will cause a dip in her polls, but not for three weeks, according to the Times. So far, there have been few signs of a dip. Just a few weeks ago, Democrats were widely reported to be privately inconsolable over their electoral prospects for the fall, fearing wipeouts not just at the top of the ticket but in the House and Senate as well. Now, that feeling has all but evaporated in Washington. Harris’s campaign heads into the Democratic convention suddenly very competitive — if not winning outright — in swing states where her former running mate Joe Biden had been struggling for months. Places such as Nevada and Arizona and even red-leaning purple states such as Florida and North Carolina have seen a resurgence in interest and enthusiasm for Democratic candidates. “It’s hard to even describe the excitement, the energy, momentum, and what we’ve solved over the last week,” the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, Nikki Fried, told The Independent in late July after the first week of Harris campaigning as the presumptive party nominee. A new Democrat-aligned poll of North Carolina, which was won by Donald Trump in both 2020 and 2016, released on Sunday found Harris tied with her opponent in the state. Even if Harris is unable to win states such as North Carolina, Ohio and Florida in November her newfound competitive edge in these Republican-leaning swing states could force her foes to play defense to the tune of millions of dollars in ad spending. A second poll released by the Financial Times showed the vice president leading Trump slightly on the issue of the economy, after he had led Biden on the issue for months. Trump on Sunday released a slew of posts on Truth Social claiming without any proof that Harris’s campaign had used artificial intelligence to inflate the size of the crowd at her most recent rally as reports continue to pick up steam on social media extolling the sizable crowds coming to see the vice president in Georgia, Arizona and other recent rallies. He has also lashed out at the media for supposedly not adequately covering the size of crowds at his own rallies.","summary":"Donald Trump seethes over Kamala Harris’s star treatment as Republicans try to blunt her momentum","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-campaign-republicans-honeymoon-polls-b2594799.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/11/22/SEI216791763.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6ne3qNkU-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:36:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":253894322,"title":"Cotton argues Harris’s handling of war in Gaza is reason she shouldn’t be president","text":"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) referenced Vice President Kamala Harris’s handling of the conflict in Gaza as why he believes she should not be president, arguing she has put more pressure on Israel than Hamas. Cotton said the vice president’s handling of the war in Gaza since Oct. 7 is just one “example” of why Harris should not become commander in chief. The Arkansas senator contended that Harris has taken claims from Hamas “at face value” about civilian casualties and that Hamas, not Israel, is ultimately responsible for any civilian casualties that occur. “Kamala Harris, like Joe Biden, has put more pressure on Israel than they put on Hamas in the very beginning,” Cotton said on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream. “Just look back a couple weeks ago when Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu was in town. She refused to preside over the joint session, her only constitutional duty as president of the Senate; she refused to have a meeting in public with them, and she came out and again blamed Israel for the civilian casualties in Gaza.” Cotton continued by alleging Harris was “only emboldening Iran and Iranian-backed terrorists, and what do you have? Two days later, Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed terrorist, shooting rockets to Israel, and blew up children playing ball at a playground. Kamala Harris is naive and she’s not prepared to be the commander in chief.” Harris and Biden have condemned Hamas since the Oct. 7 attack and expressed the need for the hostages still held by Hamas to be returned home to Israel. Cotton also focused his attention on Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s chosen running mate. Cotton suggested that Walz ought to answer questions about his time leaving the National Guard, though he stressed that he respects all U.S. veterans, as he is a veteran himself. He did say, however, that Walz needs to explain his relationship with the “Chinese-Communist Party.” Cotton also contended that the 2024 election has not changed much with Harris replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket with Republicans knowing from the beginning it would be a tough race. However, he predicted voters will be less likely to support Harris the more they learn about her.

With an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night, the closing ceremony put a final flourish to Paris’ first Games in a century. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during the ceremony’s artistic portion, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, as security and volunteers worked to clear the stage. And more razzmatazz could be to come: Speculation was rife that Hollywood star Tom Cruise — seen around town during the final weekend — would feature later in the night. Shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had taken their seats, the ceremony opened with a singer belting out “Under the skies of Paris” — sung in the past by Edith Piaf and others. The stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron — powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels — had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But Los Angeles was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are scheduled to perform Sunday as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who is expected to sing the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories — a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.” With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes — many wearing their shiny medals — and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets. The national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals — 16 of them gold — marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror. The closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals — each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women — the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday. The women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900. The U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021. Unlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes. A golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies. Portions of the opening ceremony were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity. Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers. Critics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ. Jolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The 2024 Olympics in Paris concludes with a star-studded closing ceremony first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/the-2024-olympics-in-paris-concludes-with-a-star-studded-closing-ceremony/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Paris-is-closing-out-the-2024-Olympics.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:24:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.671},{"id":253893564,"title":"TRUMP STIRS UP RACIST LEFT-PHOBIA","text":"By Arun Srivastava Left and Right politics do exist in America, but the divide has never been so pronounced as it is shaping up this time just ahead of the D-Day, when the Americans would be electing their next president in November this year. The blame for polarising this year’s presidential election on the left and right streak goes to the Republican candidate Donald Trump. Joe Biden making way for Kamala Harris has made Trump conscious of the tough challenge he would face in the incumbent vice-president. He obviously launched a vile campaign against her and started depicting her as a hardened leftist; using it as a metaphor of her being a hardened criminal. Rightist leaders have eccentric attitude of hitting their opponents below the belt and maligning them. Pursuing this tactics Trump made an obnoxious comment only on this Wednesday about Harris that is too at US’s largest annual gathering of Black journalists. Trump asked the journalists: “Is she Indian or is she Black? She was Indian all the way, and all of a sudden she made a turn and became a Black person.” This observation even made White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to say: “It’s insulting. What he just said is repulsive.” Since launching her campaign Harris has been facing a barrage of sexist from Republicans. Traumatic indeed, while Trump has made a point to inflict personal insults on her and in his pursuit he has even refused to abide by the advice that he should tone down his rhetoric in this campaign. “I’m not gonna be nice!” he told. His hatred for Harris and especially for her being black is so acute that he has turned his guns against the Association of Black Journalists. He called their organisation ABJ as a “fake network”. Trump has been actively trying to court Black voters and has even held events in cities with Black populations but it does not appear to work as his repulsive comments against Harris has further antagonised the blacks. Traditionally, the blacks have been loyal to Democratic Party. Ironically, the rightwing political leaders and journalists do not find anything wrong with Trump’s insinuation against Harris and are overtly extending their support. It is universally known that Trump playing safe does not like to openly identify with the rightist forces, but he has been close to the rightist political leaders and organisations. This time, he has preferred to openly identify with the rightist ideology for the sake of getting their votes as they are on the surge. As in several European countries, the rightists are striving hard, using all the available resources and machinations, to ensure the victory of Trump. In the victory of Trump, the rightists visualise a bright future ahead. Proud Boys, the ultra-rightist body of youths, has already announced their unconditional support to Trump. Besides, appeal has been made to rightist leaders of Germany and France to put a word with their supporters in US, to rally behind Trump. The most interesting development has been the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, the overseas branch of RSS, has flagged its members, obviously at the direction of its parent organisation to support Trump. Trump describing Kamala as a leftist has helped him to gain the support of the saffron ecosystem. In India, the public faces of saffron ecosystem, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and BJP leader Narendra Modi, have been sworn enemies of the leftist forces and have also coined the term “Urban Naxal” to insinuate them. Modi has put significant number of activists, academics and students in jail on false and fabricated cases for more than six years without any trial. These so-called “Urban Naxals” are highly qualified university faculty members and scholars with progressive, leftist political orientation. Significantly, in US the Indian diaspora is vertically split on the issue of supporting Modi. Nevertheless, the neo-migrants, especially belonging to OBC and EBC castes, from UP and Bihar and eastern Hindi speaking states, have been quite soft towards the Indian prime minister, who just secured a slightly diminished third term in May this year. During Lok Sabha elections, the neo-migrants went all out for seeking support for Modi. It is said that at least 20 cities in the US saw car rallies expressing support for Modi and urging diaspora Indians to travel to India and cast their vote. The strength of the Indian diaspora is estimated at 36 million, of whom 21 million are NRIs. The PIOs are soft towards RSS and especially Modi. This political allegiance primarily owes to their family’s ideological connect back home to Modi-magnified Hindutva. With US voting day merely 90 days away, Trump instead of offering a concrete economic package, is simply insinuating Kamala Harris is bad for the country. He nurses the belief that his jibes against Harris would impress the rightist forces and fetch votes. But it does not appear to be happening. In contrast, Harris is gaining ground with leftist forces deciding to support her. The Proud Boys is a neo-fascist rightist organization that engages in political violence. The group’s leaders have been convicted of violently opposing the US government, including the constitutionally prescribed transfer of presidential power. They are known for their opposition to left-wing and progressive groups. Sources maintain that they are preparing to emerge as a physical force for Trump, as Trump has promised to pardon convicted January 6 rioters if he is elected. Curiously, Trump has not ruled out the possibility of political violence if he loses in November. This has unnerved the Americans. Since the 2021 January 6 incident, around 29 incidents involving the Boys have been identified. Almost all the eight cases in 2023 involved clashes between Proud Boys and left-wing activists. The Proud Boys have become proactive in the campaign to ban immigration as they allege that migrants are altering American demography and are a threat to the culture of USA. Trump has been accusing Harris of being overly liberal on immigration and abortion and even called her a “bum” in a speech to a gathering of religious conservatives. He reminded the voters: “As a Senator, Harris was ranked number one most far-left Democrat in the entire Senate, and that includes Bernie Sanders.” Trump alleged that Harris would appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to “forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values” on Americans. He does not hide his resolve to defeat socialism, Marxism and communism. He accuses Harris of supporting free government healthcare for illegal aliens, abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, decriminalising illegal immigration, mass amnesty for illegals and outlaw private health insurance and defund the police. On the contrary, Harris has been quite pragmatic and instead of using jibes and insinuation, she has been aiming at the Trump’s failures. Harris, who has taken aim at Trump’s legal woes and stances on healthcare and abortion, challenged him to keep his commitment to debate her in September, after the Republican said he could “make a case” for skipping the event. “Well Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” she said. “Because as the saying goes, ‘If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.’” Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden’s high court pick. There is no denying that she ran to the left as progressive ideas dominated the last competitive Democratic primary. Though Republicans are digging up her old stances to scare the voters it does not appear to have any impact. Harris has come to realise that left forces are needed for the progress and development of the country. Leaving the country at the mercy of the rightists would ultimately prove to be disastrous for USA. Significantly, her stance has yielded dividends. A poll conducted online from July 24-28 shows Harris leading Trump in Michigan by 11 percentage points, while in Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, she has a 2-point advantage. She has been much ahead of Trump across America.

Tickets ranged between $3,300 and $50,000. Donors of $500,000 could be named as a chair of the event. In her speech, Harris took aim at her opponent, former President Donald Trump, and Project 2025, the vast set of policy proposals put together by conservative groups that would reshape the government and expand presidential powers if he were re-elected. “Can you believe they put that thing in writing?” she joked. Harris garnered raucous applause when she mentioned abortion rights, vowing to sign protections for Roe v. Wade into law as president and telling the crowd, “We trust women to know what is in their own best interest.” The speech focused exclusively on domestic policy, with no mention by Harris of the war in Gaza, even as some 120 protesters gathered on the streets outside of the Fairmont, demanding that she “stop the genocide.” Inside, many of California’s top Democrats were in attendance, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Harris thanked for being “an extraordinary leader for California,” as well as U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland, Attorney General Rob Bonta, and California Assemblymember and U.S. House of Representatives candidate Evan Low. Local San Francisco politicians, including Mayor London Breed and her challenger, Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, were also in the crowd. Harris was introduced to the stage by House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who worked behind the scenes to encourage Biden to step aside and cleared the path for the vice president’s ascension. Pelosi urged the crowd to “own the ground with our mobilization.” “We don’t want to have any regrets the day after the election that we could have done that much more,” she said. “Democracy is on the ballot.” Harris has been on a fundraising tear in recent weeks, bringing in $310 million in July, fueled by a surge of donations after President Joe Biden dropped his bid for re-election. On top of that, she also pulled in $36 million in the 24 hours after announcing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Polls show the vice president taking a small lead over former President Trump. A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted this week found Harris beating Trump 50% to 46% in the key swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — though those leads fall within the survey’s margin of error. Here in the Bay Area, Harris’s rapid rise to the candidacy has renewed energy among Democratic supporters and donors fatigued at the prospects of another Biden-Trump rematch. Earlier this week, a group of Silicon Valley investors called “VCs for Kamala” received pledges of nearly $150,000 for the Harris campaign. The call included donors like Reid Hoffman, co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn who also was at the Sunday fundraiser, and billionaire investor Ron Conway, the New York Times reported. With just 86 days to go before the November election, the Harris campaign has kicked its campaigning efforts into high gear. The night before her San Francisco fundraiser, Harris spoke to a crowd of more than 12,000 people in Las Vegas — her fifth rally in five days — where she pledged to end federal taxes on tips if elected. It followed a similar proposal by Trump made two months earlier — a fact he which he was quick to point out on social media, calling her “copy cat Kamala.” Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign schedule is relatively quieter. On Thursday, he said that he wouldn’t make an appearance at any rallies until after the Democratic National Convention, which ends Aug. 22. The convention will cap a whirlwind August campaign schedule for Harris and Walz. It remains to be seen, though, whether the candidates can sustain Democrats’ enthusiasm through November. In the Bay Area, another fundraiser is scheduled for Aug. 17 in Mill Valley, though neither Harris or Walz are expected to make an appearance.","summary":"House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Gov.

His campaign denies it. The New York Times cited two people who, on different occasions, heard Trump call Harris a “b——.” The people were granted anonymity to describe private discussions. In response, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “That is not language President Trump has used to describe Kamala and it’s not how the campaign would characterize her.” Trump, a Republican, has a history of making derogatory statements about women and his political opponents. He has called Harris, the Democrats’ presidential candidate, and other women, including 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, “nasty,” and he bragged about grabbing women’s genitalia in the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape. He called Carly Fiorina, one of his rivals for the Republican nomination in 2016, “horseface” during a campaign debate. Last month, Trump said falsely that Harris, who is Black and of Asian descent, has misled voters about her race. Trump has said that E. Jean Carroll, a writer who accused him of raping her, was a “nut job” who invented “a fraudulent and false story” to sell a memoir. A New York jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse, but not rape, in a civil case filed by Carroll. Trump has also directed disparaging comments toward men. He branded former rivals Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida “liddle Marco,” Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas “lyin’ Ted,” and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida “low energy Jeb.”","summary":"The New York Times cited two people who, on different occasions, heard former President Trump call Vice President Kamala Harris a “b——.” \n\n\nThe post Trump reportedly used a slur against Harris in private conversations appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/08/11/trump-reportedly-used-a-slur-against-harris-in-private-conversations/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FPBM6BRG4ZSHSMFQJ46SE3L7EA-66b927c4a2546-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:16:49","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":253893366,"title":"Paris closing out Olympics with final star-studded show","text":"Paris is closing out two and a half extraordinary weeks of Olympic sports and emotion with a boisterous, star-studded show in France’s national stadium, handing over hosting duties for the Summer Games to the next city in line: Los Angeles in 2028. With an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night, the closing ceremony put a final flourish to Paris' first Games in a century. In their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during the ceremony’s artistic portion, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, as security and volunteers worked to clear the stage. And more razzmatazz could be to come: Speculation was rife that Hollywood star Tom Cruise — seen around town during the final weekend — would feature later in the night. Shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had taken their seats, the ceremony opened with a singer belting out “Under the skies of Paris” — sung in the past by Edith Piaf and others. The stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. There, the Olympic cauldron — powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels — had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night. For Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions. But Los Angeles was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are scheduled to perform Sunday as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels. Each of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who is expected to sing the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people. As a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories — a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.” With the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes — many wearing their shiny medals — and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats. Unlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared.

The achievement announced by the GOP Sunday caps off a stunning transformation for a once quintessential battleground state where Democrats previously long held the advantage. “Our success goes beyond just numbers,” Florida state GOP Chairman Evan Power said in a statement. “It’s about a vision to make Florida the beacon of freedom for the rest of the country.” In just 2018, Democrats had more than 250,000 more registered voters than Republicans, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Registered Republicans eclipsed them in late 2021, amid the party’s growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. As recently as 2018, Republicans had 5.26 million registered voters to the Democrats’ 4.3 million, per the FDE. There are 13.4 million registered voters in Florida. Republicans across the state hailed the milestone Sunday. “Six years ago, registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans by almost 300,000 — and Florida had never had more registered Republicans than Democrats in its history,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote on X. “Now, Republicans outnumber Democrats by 1 million voters, which is a sea change that few thought possible (and contrary to the many predictions that FL would become a blue state). Leadership matters. Bold colors, not pale pastels.” DeSantis barely won the 2018 race for governor, 49.6% to 49.2%. Then during his 2022 reelection campaign, he easily cruised to victory 59.4% to 40%, outshining Republicans nationally that year who underperformed expectations of a red wave. The Florida GOP tied its voter registration feat to major Republicans in the state including DeSantis, Trump and Attorney General Ashley Moody. Despite the drubbing of 2022, Florida Democrats have put on an optimistic face about their chances of breaking through in the Sunshine State. They’ve poured resources into former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell’s (D-Fla.) challenge against Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). Prior to dropping out, President Biden suggested he could win in Florida. “Here in Florida, you’ve had a real dose of ‘Trump-ism,’” Biden said during a fundraiser back in January, per a White House transcript. “We have to organize, mobilize the vote. I think we can win Florida. I think the Democrats can win in Florida.” Biden, 81, lost Florida to former President Donald Trump 47.9% to 51.2% back in 2020. The last Democrat to carry the state was former President Barack Obama in 2012. One of the issues Democrats are hoping could be a boost in Florida is abortion, which is set to be on the ballot for a referendum in the Nov. 5 election. Voters in the state will decide whether they want to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and override the state’s ban on the procedure after six weeks of gestation, with a few carveouts in place. To succeed, the referendum needs 60% of the vote. Other red states such as Ohio and Kansas have seen voters turn out in droves to support abortion rights.","summary":"As recently as 2018, Democrats had more than 250,000 more registered voters than Republicans, according to the Florida Division of Elections.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/11/us-news/florida-republicans-tout-milestone-1-million-voter-edge-over-dems/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87631204.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:15:14","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":253893324,"title":"Iran’s president proposes an ex-nuclear negotiator as foreign minister","text":"Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday proposed former nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi as the country’s new foreign minister and also sought to appoint a woman as roads and housing minister. If approved, she would be Iran's first female minister in more than a decade. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf read out the list of proposed ministers to lawmakers. The hard-line-dominated chamber will have two weeks to review qualifications and give a vote of confidence to the proposed ministers. Araghchi, 61, a career diplomat, was a member of the Iranian negotiator team that reached a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015 that capped Tehran’s nuclear program in return for the lifting sanctions. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal and imposed more sanctions on Iran. Pezeshkian said during his presidential campaign that he would try to revive the nuclear deal. Pezeshkian named Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, an F-14 Tomcat pilot, as defense minister. He was chief of the Iranian Air Force in 2018-2021. This would be the first time that a member of Iran's air force headed the defense ministry. Pezeshkian proposed Farzaneh Sadegh as roads and housing minister. Sadegh, 47, is currently a director in the ministry. She would become only the second female minister in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It is unclear, however, whether she will be approved. The hard-line parliament seeks more cultural and social restrictions on women based on its interpretations of Islamic sharia. Many lawmakers voiced their opposition when her name was read by the speaker during Sunday's session. The only previous female minister to be approved by parliament since the revolution was in 2009, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad secured a post for Marzieh Vahid Dastgerdi as health minister. Iranian presidents have, however, appointed women to be vice presidents, a role that is not subject to parliamentary approval. Last week, Pezeshkian appointed Zahra Behrouz Azar as vice president in charge of women's and family affairs. The first female minister in Iran’s history was Farrokroo Parsa, who served as education minister in 1968-1971. Revolutionary authorities executed her after the 1979 revolution that ousted the pro-Western monarchy and brough Islamists to power. Pezeshkian proposed Eskandar Momeni, a relatively moderate police general, as interior minister. The ministry deals with enforcing the mandatory wearing of the Islamic veil on women. In 2022, the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody after she was arrested for improper wearing of the hijab led to nationwide protests. Pezeshkian, then a lawmaker, wrote at the time that it was “unacceptable in the Islamic Republic to arrest a girl for her hijab and then hand over her dead body to her family.” He in comments has suggested that he wants less enforcement of the hijab law, as well as better relations with the West and a return to the nuclear accord. The president is likely to face opposition in passing legislation that supports his stated program, however, as the chamber is dominated by hard-liners who mainly supported other candidates during the June- July presidential election. The president named Mohsen Paknejad as oil minister. Paknejad was formerly a deputy oil minister. Pezeshkian also proposed to retain current Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib and current Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi. Pezeshkian also named the current minister of industries, Abbas Aliabadi, as energy minister. On Saturday the president also reappointed Mohammad Eslami as chief of Iran’s civilian nuclear program and one of several vice presidents. They all held their posts under President Ebrahim Raisi, who died alongside Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahain in a May helicopter crash. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Explaining his shock exit in new detail, Biden said party colleagues standing for reelection feared he was damaging their chances as his age and mental abilities came to dominate the campaign. Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since ending his second-term bid on July 21 after his flailing debate performance against Trump triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him. In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week and broadcast on Sunday, the president appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has \"no serious problem.\" \"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races,\" he explained. \"I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about,\" he continued. He singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a party heavyweight whose refusal to explicitly back his campaign was seen by many as pivotal. \"You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say (something)... I thought it'd be a real distraction,\" Biden said. \"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy. \"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\" Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot. \"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,\" he said. Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since Biden's withdrawal, as Harris enjoys a surge in support that has left Trump and the Republicans struggling. The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to push for a second. \"I thought of myself as being a transition president -- I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth -- but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen,\" he told CBS's Robert Costa. As Harris holds huge rallies in swing states, Trump's light schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows. Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about child care, asylum seekers and abortion. In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked \"six questions about abortion.\" \"I'm still trying to get a clear answer,\" Brennan retorted. He also claimed that Harris was the one \"calling the shots\" in the Biden administration. \"If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?\" he told CNN's Dana Bash. Biden in his CBS interview warned that Trump was \"a genuine danger to American security.\" \"Mark my words, if he wins... watch what happens,\" he said. \"He's a genuine danger to American security. \"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key.\" He added that he was \"not confident at all\" of a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses a second time. © 2024 AFP","summary":"US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since withdrawing from the election, has said he acted under pressure from fellow Democrats and out of a determination…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/in-tv-interview-biden-explains-his-election-exit","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/3e/86/70084c0ba0b936d3b333a4689c32cc94a71e/3e8670084c0ba0b936d3b333a4689c32cc94a71e/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 21:12:56","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":253893338,"title":"Vance hails Trump's Fed idea and pushes back against criticism over past words on American families","text":"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance used a round of Sunday news show appearances to disparage the Democratic ticket and promote Donald Trump's record and second-term plans and defend himself from criticism over past remarks that have become a campaign issue. The Ohio senator, in a series of taped interviews, said there was merit to Trump’s suggestion that presidents have more control of U.S. monetary policy and kept up the GOP line that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' vice presidential candidate, had exaggerated his military record. Vance, who shadowed Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz during their visits to several battleground states last week, was quizzed about abortion and his past comments about American family life, among other topics. Some highlights from his appearances: Trump recently suggested that presidents “should have at least a say” on monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve. He did not offer specific proposals. Curtailing the Fed’s independence from political interference as it determines interest rates would be a fundamental change. Even as he tried to argue that Trump said nothing about taking “direct” control of rates, Vance endorsed Trump's general idea. “President Trump is saying I think something that’s really important and actually profound, which is that the political leadership of this country should have more say over the monetary policy of this country,” Vance said. “I agree with him. That should fundamentally be a political decision. Agree or disagree, we should have America’s elected leaders having input about the most important decisions confronting our country.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan questioned the wisdom of such a major change. “I think if you look around the world’s economies and you see where Fed central banks are independent and operate freely,” he said, “they tend to fare better than the ones that don’t.” Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard and was once deployed to Europe, though never to an active war zone. In a video from 2018, he referred to carrying weapons “in war.” The Harris campaign said last week that Walz misspoke. “Scandalous behavior,” said Vance, a military veteran. When it was noted that Trump avoided Vietnam with dubious claims of bone spurs, Vance said that \"obviously a lot of people have reasons for not serving. I criticize somebody for embellishing their record, for lying, saying, ‘I went to war.’” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a combat veteran and a top Harris ally, said Republicans are circulating “the one time” that a long-serving veteran “slipped up” talking about his military service. Vance dodged when asked about his position on an upcoming Florida referendum that would repeal Republican-passed abortion restrictions and ensure more access to abortion services. Speaking broadly about states and reproductive rights, Vance said Trump \"has said explicitly they’re going to make this decision on a state-by-state level.” Vance struggled to clarify Trump’s position on whether he would support federal limits on the medical abortion drug mifepristone. Trump said in his June debate with Biden that he would not block it. At his Florida news conference last week, he offered a disjointed answer and said, \"You also have to give a vote” on the matter. Vance suggested that “maybe” Trump had difficulty hearing and understanding a reporter’s question. Walz responded in a statement through the Harris campaign that Trump and Vance \"are going to ban medication abortion. ... Vice President Harris and I will make sure that you make your health care decisions because we have a rule, whether you’d make the same decision as someone else: Just mind your own damn business.” During Vance’s Senate campaign in 2021, he said in a Fox News interview that “we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats,” and referred to them as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He said that included Harris, who has two adult children, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay and a married father of twins but had no children at the time of Vance's comment. The senator said a “sarcastic remark I made three years ago” has obscured a serious debate about “pro-family” policies, explaining that “I criticize people for being anti-child” in their policy pursuits. Vance also in the past has suggested giving extra votes for people with children. “It's not a policy proposal. It's a thought experiment, right?” he said in a Sunday interview, arguing he was reacting to others' ideas to lower the voting age. “Anybody who disagrees with him is anti-child?” Buttigieg countered in a news show appearance. “He seems incapable of talking about a vision for this country in terms of lifting people up. ... It’s always about disparagement.” Vance appeared on CNN's “State of the Union,” ABC's “This Week” and CBS' “Face the Nation.\" Buttigieg was on CNN and Moynihan was on CBS. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
