Putin referenced the unsuccessful 2022 peace talks that took place in Istanbul in March, shortly after Moscow's full-scale invasion, and proposed \"restarting\" them without preconditions in remarks to reporters in the early hours of Sunday. “We are committed to serious negotiations with Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding that he doesn't rule out agreeing to a ceasefire later, in the course of direct talks with Ukraine. Putin's proposal came after leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure on Moscow if it does not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that they offered on Saturday in a strong show of unity with Kyiv. The leaders of France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland said their proposal for a ceasefire to start on Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. Trump has called for Ukraine and Russia to meet for “very high level talks,” saying they are “very close to a deal” on ending the bloody three-year war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously said he was ready for peace talks, but only after a ceasefire is in place. Moscow's proposals Putin said that Russia proposed several ceasefires in recent months — a halt on strikes on energy infrastructure, which Ukraine had agreed to, a unilateral 30-hour Easter truce and another unilateral ceasefire on May 8-10 that has since expired. Ukrainian officials said Russia repeatedly violated all of those. Putin on Sunday accused Ukraine of sabotaging “these initiatives time and time again\" and launching multiple attacks on Russia. In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking . Putin on Sunday once again said the Kremlin needs a truce that would lead to a “lasting peace\" instead of one that would allow Ukraine to rearm and mobilize more men into its armed forces. He said he would speak to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and ask him to facilitate the peace talks on May 15. Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Turkey hosted unsuccessful talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators aimed at ending the hostilities. The proposed deal reportedly included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and put limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks on the status of Russian-occupied areas. Moscow has blamed Kyiv and the West for the talks collapsing. Putin said that \"those who truly want peace cannot but support\" his proposal to restart the peace talks. ‘A very important signal’ Zelenskyy, speaking to reporters alongside the European leaders in Kyiv on Saturday, called their meeting \"a very important signal.” In a joint statement, as published on Zelenskyy's official website, the five leaders called for a ceasefire “lasting at least 30 days\" from Monday, to make room for a diplomatic push to end the war. “An unconditional ceasefire by definition cannot be subject to any conditions. If Russia calls for such conditions, this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy,” the statement read. French President Emmanuel Macron said that the U.S. would take the lead in monitoring the proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated, between Europeans and Americans,” should Russia violate the truce. Macron traveled to Kyiv with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. “This is Europe stepping up, showing our solidarity with Ukraine,” Starmer said. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, said Saturday that a “comprehensive” 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, “will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.” Meanwhile, Putin on Saturday held a series of bilateral talks with foreign officials who had attended Moscow's own celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, in an apparent attempt to underscore the West’s failure to isolate it on the global stage.

This historic elevation occurred after a swift conclave, the assembly of cardinals for electing a pope, reportedly concluding in just four ballots and placing the Chicago-born Prevost, 69, at the head of 1.4 billion Catholics.\n\nEntering the conclave, Cardinal Prevost was widely regarded as a “dark horse” candidate, with public speculation favouring other papabili — cardinals considered potential candidates for the papacy — underscoring the old Roman saying, “he who enters the conclave a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.” His subsequent election highlighted the unpredictable nature of papal elections, as the faithful gathered on Thursday in front of Saint Peter’s Basilica reportedly asked each other “who is he?”.\n\nAppearing on the central loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica, Pope Leo XIV, distinguished by wearing the traditional red mozzetta (a short cape) and stole (a liturgical vestment) that Pope Francis had set aside, addressed the assembled crowd for the first time. He initiated his message with the Italian greeting “Pace a voi“ (Peace be with you), subsequently switching to Spanish, and extended a specific greeting to his “beloved diocese of Chiclayo in Peru”, while his address emphasised themes of peace, dialogue, and a missionary church dedicated to those who suffer.\n\n‘Saint of the north’\n\nThe ascent of an American to the papacy inevitably draws comparisons to Pope John Paul II, whose pontificate is widely credited with inspiring Poland’s Solidarity movement and significantly contributing to the challenge against communist doctrine of state atheism in Eastern Europe. U.S. far-right figures like Laura Loomer labelled Pope Leo as “worse than Francis”, “anti-Trump”, and a “Marxist”. Reminiscent of the hostile reactions from Polish communist authorities, who viewed John Paul II as a destabilising ideological threat in the 1980s, underscore the perceived power of the papacy to influence socio-political landscapes.\n\nIn 2015, while serving as Bishop of Chiclayo, Robert Prevost acquired Peruvian citizenship, a status following nearly two decades of missionary work that earned him the local affection of “saint of the north.” Peruvian President Dina Boluarte subsequently lauded his election as a “historic moment for Peru”, underscoring the dual U.S.-Peruvian identity that now positions Pope Leo directly on the North-South ecclesiastical and economic fault line.\n\nPope Francis appointed Robert Prevost as Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops — head of the Vatican department responsible for advising on bishop appointments — in January 2023, playing an instrumental role in continuing Francis’s pastoral vision. However, as an Augustinian Order leader in 2012, Prevost had critiqued the “homosexual lifestyle” and “alternative families”, and later, as a Peruvian Bishop, he opposed government “gender ideology” in schools.\n\nPope Leo’s chosen papal name deliberately references Pope Leo XIII, whose 1891 open letter Rerum Novarum addressed workers’ rights, establishing a foundational text for modern Catholic social teaching. Robert Prevost earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Villanova University in 1977, later achieving a Doctorate in Canon Law from Rome’s Angelicum with a thesis on “The Role of the Local Prior in the Order of Saint Augustine”. He was praised for direct pastoral engagement, such as founding a new parish for St. Rita in a poor district of Trujillo, Peru, and personally delivering aid to flood victims in Chiclayo.\n\nWhile he was the Augustinian Provincial Prior in Chicago around 1999-2001, Robert Prevost approved James Ray, a priest accused of abuse, residing in a priory near a school, a decision later criticised by Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago. During his 2022 episcopacy in Chiclayo, Peru, complaints against priests led to accusations of mishandling by victim advocates group ‘SNAP’, despite diocesan assertions that protocols were followed and a subsequent Vatican official’s statement that no cover-up occurred.\n\nPope Leo ascends to the papacy as Donald Trump, who offered congratulations on his election, is well into his turbulent second U.S. presidential term, and as the Catholic Church, particularly in the U.S., experiences profound internal divisions.","summary":"The first U.S. pope now faces the monumental task of transcending his national origin to unify a divided Church and navigate a complex world","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-leo-xiv-the-bridge-building-pontiff/article69562019.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/e9do9l/article69562020.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/new%20Pope_%20Leo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 00:58:00","author":"Cardinal Blase Cupich","authors":["Cardinal Blase Cupich"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.235},{"id":320013532,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: May 11, 2025","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI - India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, they said Saturday, following a sharp escalation of the conflict between two nuclear-armed countries after last month's deadly shooting of tourists in the disputed territory of Kashmir.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump also said in a post that the two sides agreed to \"a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE\" after the United States brokered their ceasefire talks.\n\nGENEVA - The United States and China began high-level talks on Saturday in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions, according to Chinese media, in the first known in-person contact between the world's two largest economies since President Donald Trump placed steep tariffs on imports earlier this year.\n\nThe negotiations in Geneva were joined by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who oversees economic matters.\n\nU.S. mulls tariffs on commercial aircraft, jet engines, related parts\n\nWASHINGTON - The United States could impose import tariffs on commercial aircraft, jet engines and related parts, a Commerce Department notice showed Friday, a move that could significantly impact Japanese and other foreign manufacturers.\n\nThe department has initiated an investigation into imports of commercial planes, jet engines and their parts on national security grounds, according to the notice on the Federal Register.\n\nTOKYO - Japan's former Emperor Akihito was discharged from a Tokyo hospital on Saturday after undergoing medical tests for a heart condition.\n\nThe 91-year-old was diagnosed with myocardial ischemia -- reduced blood flow to the heart muscle -- though he showed no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency said after the tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital.\n\nNAGOYA - A 16-year-old boy was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder after his grandparents were found dead at their home in central Japan, police said.\n\nThe high school student in Tahara, Aichi Prefecture, is suspected of fatally stabbing his 75-year-old grandfather around 2 a.m. Friday, the prefectural police said.

Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!”\n\nBut he gave no further details, and officials at the White House also offered little information during and after the opening day of discussions. \n\nTrump’s post followed an official telling The Associated Press that talks had wrapped up for the day and would continue Sunday. The official requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff. The talks have been shrouded in secrecy, and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.\n\nSeveral convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place. \n\nThe opening day of negotiations were held in the sumptuous 18th-century “Villa Saladin” overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.\n\nTrump’s assessment aside, prospects for a major breakthrough appeared dim when the talks opened. Still, there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes tariffs they have slapped on each other’s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.\n\nTrump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries’ boycotting each other’s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.\n\nAnd even before talks got underway, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that “ 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\"\n\nSun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results. \n\n“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the … tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words.”\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.\n\nBut the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. \n\nThe remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump’s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.\n\nThose issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products.

And I have heard no one discuss it yet. Shocked me until I realized, yeah, of course not, because our obsession is division.”\n\nCuomo noted one such nitpick from the right – that Prevost showed compassion for migrants in old Tweets – was hardly some kind of gotcha: “What do you expect a Catholic priest to say, let alone a Pope? And it doesn’t matter what he trafficked in on Twitter before because like his predecessors, we can expect that the institution of the church will wind up influencing the pope more than the other way around.”\n\nCuomo went deep on a history lesson before he finally got into his revelation about Pope Leo’s moniker choice, calling it “very good news … even if you are a-religious. What should matter to all Americans in particular is that there is something about the Pope that matters very much to what’s happening in America right now. I would say the timing is almost divine.”\n\nThe last Pope Leo – Leo XIII, whose long papacy spanned from the late 1800s into the early 20th Century – wrote extensively on the relationship between workers and employers. Or as we call it today, income inequality.\n\n“Really surprised that I haven’t heard anything about this,” Cuomo continued. “He picked the namesake that suggests real implications about what he will think about what’s happening in this country in this moment. … More specifically, the rights and duties of capital and labor is what he laid out. And the church teaching was on the importance of balancing economic interest of the moneyed few with the dignity of the majority working class.”\n\nCuomo said no matter what you think of Donald Trump’s trade policies, their aim of getting better outcomes for more Americans is aligned with the writings of Pope Leo XIII – and the new Pope Leo would seem to agree.\n\n“If the corporate class is taking a beating in the markets, [Trump] doesn’t care if it means better outcomes and deals for workers in the majority,” Cuomo concluded. “So if you can criticize Trump’s apparent lack of strategy and blunt-force tactics with the tariffs, but — and we are yet to see whether they are helpful or hurtful — if you get a better deal because of them or despite them, whatever. The balance of economic benefits and burdens, and who gets access to the American consumer market on what terms, is huge. And it’s exactly what Leo XIII was talking about.”\n\nWatch the entire monologue in the video above.","summary":"The NewsNation anchor and lifelong Catholic says Pope Leo's namesake suggests his priorities will align with some of Donald Trump's\n\n\nThe post Chris Cuomo Interprets New Pope&#8217;s &#8216;Leo&#8217; Moniker Choice as a Significant Sign: &#8216;Very Good News&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/chris-cuomo-interpret-pope-leo-name-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cuomo.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 00:34:21","author":"Josh Dickey","authors":["Josh Dickey"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.159},{"id":320013424,"title":"Central Oregon businesses navigate Trump tariffs, trade war","text":"Businesses across the country are watching and waiting to see how President Donald Trump’s tariffs will impact their operations — and a number of them are Central Oregon born and bred. \n\nSeveral high profile companies based in the area — including Hydroflask, Les Schwab, RuffWear, BasX and Epic Aircraft — could feel the pinch of the 145% duty on imported goods from China. Tariffs on many other countries have been paused but could return if deals are not struck with the Trump administration.\n\nTrump’s trade war began as a cudgel to punish other countries for not doing enough to stop the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States. Although tariffs on Mexico, Canada and other nations were paused in early April, tariffs on China have only increased.\n\nHolding pattern\n\nCompanies contacted by The Bulletin routinely said they are in a holding pattern and watching the situation develop.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom and said he plans to work on a deal with the European Union. But the sky-high tariffs on goods from China remain on the table for now.\n\nBusinesses have responded by keeping their container shipments shelved — shipping traffic into the Port of Los Angeles is down around 40% currently. And as of Thursday, there were no container ships docked at the Port of Seattle.\n\nOne local business that could be impacted is Les Schwab, which employs around 2,600 people in Oregon. It does not make tires but it does sell tires made by companies with operations in China and elsewhere.\n\n“We will continue to do everything we can to mitigate impacts of tariffs on our customers,” Greg Waring, chief marketing officer for Les Schwab, said in a statement.\n\n“The dynamic nature of the current regulatory environment is a challenge for all businesses, and consistency and certainty around tariffs and other policies help ensure fair pricing and high levels of customer satisfaction,” Waring added.\n\nAnother local business, Lonza, is not based in Bend but does have significant operations here. The pharmaceutical developer said in a statement to the Bulletin that they are “following developments closely” and that Lonza “prioritizes domestic sourcing.” \n\nManaging costs \n\nJon Stark, chief economic officer of Economic Development of Central Oregon, said the tariffs are making companies more cautious with their cash flow to help them manage costs. The tariffs are also forcing local companies to think outside the box and figure out new supply chains.\n\n“There is some good coming out of this too. We are seeing some reshore activity on the rise,” said Stark.\n\nCompanies need to be nimble and be prepared to change their product line if their normal source of materials becomes unavailable, Stark said. Companies are also being pushed to outline strategies over different timeframes. \n\n“They’re positioning themselves for how much runway they have with cash flow and how much runway they have with their current inventory, and trying to project whether or not they can absorb that 145% in three months, six months, nine months,” said Stark. \n\nStark said he has spoken with different companies around Central Oregon that are running through various hypothetical situations to prepare for all kinds of outcomes. \n\n“The real message is there’re so many unknowns,” he said. “There are too many unknowns to predict the future.” \n\nOne of those unknowns is just how long the 145% tariff on goods imported from China will last. President Trump has already paused large tariffs on other countries and many believe the same could happen for China if talks between the two countries get on track. \n\nTo stockpile or not to stockpile \n\nMike Schindler, the co-owner of Sunnyside Sports in Bend, is one of those business owners who believes that the unpredictability of the tariffs mean people in his situation can’t do much right now. \n\nSchindler said he isn’t stockpiling overseas goods ahead of the higher tariffs, even though most bike manufacturing occurs in Asia. Some of his products are from China but his showroom includes bikes and parts from other countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan (each of which are also facing possible tariffs of 32-49%). \n\nFor now the price increases have been modest. Over the past few weeks most prices in the shop have risen by around 10%. If the tariffs do escalate he will cross the bridge when it arrives. “If it ends up being a big issue then I think we will just have to face it at that point,” he said. “There isn’t any point of completely stressing out about it until things become more clear.” \n\nPocketbook pressure \n\nProduct developers and importers aren’t the only ones that could be feeling economic pressure. Local food and beverage manufacturers source some of their packaging from overseas. And when their customers are feeling pocketbook pressure, it may mean fewer people entering restaurants and brewpubs. \n\n“Tariffs aren’t affecting our cost of goods significantly,” said Larry Sidor, the co-founder at Crux Fermentation Project. “Our biggest issue is consumer spending trends. Customers are going out less and spending less when they’re out.” \n\nSidor said he’s not certain why spending is down at his brew pub. He suspects it’s confidence in the economy or less discretionary income or a cultural shift. \n\n“Whatever it is, it’s affecting our keg and pub business significantly,” he said. \n\nAs local businesses ponder their options, the Trump administration is also plotting its next move. U.S. officials will meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland for the first major talks between the two countries since the recent round of tariff hikes. \n\nFor Stark and others impacted by the skyrocketing tariffs, that looks like an opportunity to turn back the clock. \n\n“We could write this (tariff) story today and tomorrow the Chinese tariffs could be pulled,” Stark said.\n\n--Michael Kohn, The Bulletin","summary":"\"There are too many unknowns to predict the future,\" said one economic development leader.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/05/central-oregon-businesses-navigate-trump-tariffs-trade-war.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/752N5WTGPNBZPMRVEXG24RSFDY.JPG?auth=e25b5a3e5f25f7cb49126865420d8cfbb9e55791de4d3834eb9f180c53cccd92&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 00:20:19","author":"Michael Kohn","authors":["Michael Kohn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":320012168,"title":"Keir Starmer looking to follow Swiss model of paying into the Brussels budget in return for access to the single market as PM prepares for EU 'surrender summit'","text":"British negotiators preparing for an EU ‘surrender summit’ are operating from a blueprint used by Switzerland – which has agreed to accept EU rules and pay into the Brussels budget in return for access to the single market.\n\nThe summit, in London on May 19, is the moment Sir Keir Starmer hopes to ‘reset’ the UK’s relationship with the EU, but Brexiteers fear the term is code for a capitulation to the bloc – despite Britain’s vote to leave in 2016.\n\nLabour ministers have confirmed that the Government is ready to sign up to permanent alignment with EU rules in areas such as agriculture in return for a closer trading relationship, but deny that this amounts to reversing Brexit.\n\nHowever, diplomatic sources point to the recent deal struck by the EU with Switzerland, which allows partial membership of the single market for goods alone.\n\nThe talks were deadlocked for years until the Swiss agreed to so-called ‘dynamic alignment’ – accepting EU rules – as well as signing up to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and making payments into the Brussels budget.\n\nAlso, the European Commission has made clear that no deal will be possible unless the UK starts negotiations on a ‘youth mobility scheme’ – freedom of movement for young adults, modelled on Britain’s arrangement with Canada. \n\nUnder this, young Canadians aged 18 to 35 can apply for a three-year UK visa – though there is an annual quota – allowing them to live and work in the UK.\n\nThe Prime Minister used an interview this weekend to prepare the ground for his ‘reset’ by arguing that the British public had moved on from Brexit.\n\nHe told The Guardian that people should ‘look forward, not back’, saying: ‘I’m ambitious about what we can achieve there.\n\n‘I want a closer relationship on security, defence, trade and on the economy.

He's not the first","text":"White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller says US President Donald Trump is looking for ways to expand the administration's legal power to deport migrants who are in the United States illegally. \n\nTo achieve that, he says the administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the constitutional right for people to legally challenge their detention by the government.\n\nSuch a move would be aimed at migrants as part of the Republican president's broader crackdown at the US-Mexico border.\n\n\"The constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,\" Mr Miller told reporters outside the White House on Friday.\n\n\"So, I would say that's an option we're actively looking at. \n\n\"Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\"\n\nWhat is habeas corpus?\n\nThe Latin term means \"that you have the body\". \n\nFederal courts use a writ of habeas corpus to bring a prisoner before a neutral judge to determine if imprisonment is legal.\n\nHabeas corpus was included in the constitution as an import from English common law. \n\nParliament enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, which was meant to ensure the king released prisoners when the law did not justify confining them.\n\nThe constitution's suspension clause, the second clause of section 9 of article I, states that habeas corpus \"shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it\".\n\nHas it been suspended previously?\n\nYes. The United States has suspended habeas corpus under four distinct circumstances during its history. \n\nThose usually involved authorisation from Congress, something that would be nearly impossible today — even at Trump's urging — given the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus multiple times amid the Civil War, beginning in 1861 to detain suspected spies and Confederate sympathisers. \n\nHe ignored a ruling from Roger Taney, who was the Supreme Court chief justice but was acting in the case as a circuit judge. Congress then authorised suspending it in 1863, which allowed Lincoln to do so again.\n\nCongress acted similarly under president Ulysses S Grant, suspending habeas corpus in parts of South Carolina under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. \n\nAlso known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, it was meant to counter violence and intimidation of groups opposing reconstruction in the South.\n\nHabeas corpus was suspended in two provinces of the Philippines in 1905, when it was a US territory and authorities were worried about the threat of an insurrection, and in Hawaii after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, but before it became a state in 1959.\n\nWriting before becoming a Supreme Court justice, Amy Coney Barrett co-authored a piece stating that the Suspension Clause \"does not specify which branch of government has the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ, but most agree that only Congress can do it.\"\n\nCould the Trump administration do it?\n\nIt can try. \n\nMiller suggested the US is facing \"an invasion\" of migrants. \n\nThat term was used deliberately, though any effort to suspend habeas corpus would spark legal challenges questioning whether the country was facing an invasion, let alone presenting extraordinary threats to public safety.\n\nFederal judges have so far been skeptical of the Trump administration's past efforts to use extraordinary powers to make deportations easier, and that could make suspending habeas corpus even tougher.\n\nTrump argued in March the US was facing an \"invasion\" of Venezuelan gang members and evoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime authority he has tried to use to speed up mass deportations.\n\nHis administration acted to swiftly deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua to a notorious prison in El Salvador, leading to a series of legal fights.\n\nFederal courts around the country, including in New York, Colorado, Texas and Pennsylvania, have since blocked the administration's uses of the Alien Enemies Act for many reasons, including amid questions about whether the country is truly facing an invasion.\n\nHow could habeas corpus be suspended?\n\nMiller, who has been fiercely critical of judges ruling against the administration, advanced the argument that the judicial branch may not get to decide.\n\n\"Congress passed a body of law known as the Immigration Nationality Act which stripped Article III courts, that's the judicial branch, of jurisdiction over immigration cases,\" he said on Friday.\n\nThat statute was approved by Congress in 1952 and there were important amendments in 1996 and 2005. \n\nLegal scholars note that it does contain language that could funnel certain cases to immigration courts, which are overseen by the executive branch.\n\nStill, most appeals in those cases would largely be handled by the judicial branch, and they could run into the same issues as Trump's attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nHave other administrations tried this?\n\nTechnically not since Pearl Harbor, though habeas corpus has been at the centre of some major legal challenges more recently than that.\n\nRepublican president George W Bush did not move to suspend habeas corpus after the September 11 attacks, but his administration subsequently sent detainees to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, drawing lawsuits from advocates who argued the administration was violating it and other legal constitutional protections.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that Guantanamo detainees had a constitutional right to habeas corpus, allowing them to challenge their detention before a judge. \n\nThat led to some detainees being released from US custody.","summary":"The Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending the constitutional right for people to legally challenge their detention by the government.

Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner,” Trump wrote. “We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!”\n\nThe meeting lasted over 10 hours and featured Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.\n\nThe official who spoke to the AP requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff. The talks have been shrouded in secrecy, and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out.\n\nSeveral convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place.\n\nSaturday’s talks were held in the sumptuous 18th-century “Villa Saladin” overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government.\n\nProspects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they have slapped on each other’s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.\n\nTrump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries’ boycotting each other’s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.\n\nEven before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that “ 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\"\n\nSun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.\n\n“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the … tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words.”\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.\n\nBut the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump’s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.\n\nThose issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China’s subsidies — were left for future negotiations.\n\nBut China didn’t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.\n\nThe fight over China’s tech policy now resumes.\n\nTrump is also agitated by America’s massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.\n\nTrump slaps hefty tariffs on Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.\n\nTrump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods — more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he has reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.\n\nThe government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.\n\n“An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland’s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,” the government said last week, adding that the executive branch “is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.”\n\nThe government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.\n\nThe United States is Switzerland’s second-biggest trading partner after the EU – the 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million.

The government has “betrayed working Britain” by giving Indian white-collar workers a 20 percent price advantage over similar Brits in jobs, he said.\n\nBut the deal is also bad news for American graduates because it may be similar to the still-secret trade deal that President Donald Trump is negotiating with Indian government officials.\n\n“Hopefully, @POTUS and JDVance will not be willing to screw American workers in a US trade deal with India,” said a May 7 tweet from the Immigration Accountability Project.\n\n“We’ve heard nothing out of this administration so far that would indicate to me they are serious about doing anything about employment visas that are displacing Americans,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. He added:\n\nWe’re not seeing anything coming out of India saying that they’re aghast that the U.S. is looking to curb these employment visa programs.\n\nIndian officials have been pressuring Trump to welcome many more mixed-skill Indian graduates into the U.S. white-collar jobs, many of which are already closed to Americans because of ethnic hiring networks created by Indian managers within the Fortune 500.\n\nAlso, U.S. lobbies welcome the Indian migrant workers because they provide India with billions of dollars in remittances needed to buy U.S. weapons, grain, energy, and technology that the U.S. hopes to sell via the trade deal. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. dramatically expanded visa awards to Indians, including the B-1 visitor visas used by Indians to get truck-driving jobs in the United States.\n\nSo far, U.S. officials have remained tight-lipped about the pending U.S.-India deal.\n\nTrump and his deputies — including Vice President JD Vance and top policy aide Stephen Miller — know the unpopularity of the Indian inflow of mixed-skilled, white-collar workers.\n\nIt is unpopular because millions of subservient foreign workers have been imported by companies to displace millions of American graduates in technology, engineering, management, finance, and increasingly in accounting. Top executives and investors import the workers via the multi-year H-1B, J-1, L-1, H4EAD, CPT, and OPT programs that dangle the promise of citizenship in front of desperate migrants.\n\nFor example, many young American graduates are being pushed out of career-starting jobs by the annual flood of roughly 300,000 foreign graduates who get work permits via the “F-1 Optional Practical Training” program. The program was created by President George W. Bush — without approval from Congress — and rewards companies that hire Indian graduates by exempting them from Social Security or Medicare taxes. It also allows foreign-born hiring managers to favor home-country job-seekers and to discriminate against American graduates.\n\nAt least 1.5 million white-collar jobs are now held by college-graduate migrants. In 2024, President Joe Biden’s deputies made it even easier for more Indian students to get white collars jobs.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many recent or pending American graduates are alarmed and despondent over their failure to get jobs or even internships.\n\nComputer professional Jim from Herndon told Breitbart that he has a nephew who graduated last year with a degree in engineering and computers, and a nephew who is about to graduate with a degree in Geographic Information Systems: “They found nothing, so they think they’ll be doing lifeguarding in the summer.”\n\nGraduates “only have two years after they graduate to get a pipeline [career-starting job, and then [recruiters] move on to the next new grads,” he said. In contrast, his two nieces with degrees in sociology and film studies landed administration and marketing jobs for roughly $100,000, he added.\n\n“Something strange, and potentially alarming, is happening to the job market for young, educated workers,” the Atlantic magazine reported in April:\n\nAccording to the New York Federal Reserve, labor conditions for recent college graduates have “deteriorated noticeably” in the past few months, and the unemployment rate now stands at an unusually high 5.8 percent. Even newly minted M.B.A.s from elite programs are struggling to find work. Meanwhile, law-school applications are surging—an ominous echo of when young people used graduate school to bunker down during the great financial crisis.\n\nThe NAFTA-like displacement has also wrecked professionalism, productivity, and innovation in many U.S. companies, so helping China’s workforce to close the once-huge technology gap with America.\n\nThe workplace problems caused by the mixed-skill migrants are so bad that some companies are trying to reduce their reliance on the counterproductive Indian visa workers.\n\nThe concerns about a white-collar NAFTA rose this week when Trump told reporters that India has agreed to drop tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. “They’ll drop it to nothing,” Trump said in a White House media interaction alongside Canada’s Mark Carney. “They’ve already agreed.”\n\nReuters reported on May 9:\n\nIndia has offered to slash its tariff gap with the U.S. to less than 4% from nearly 13% now, in exchange for an exemption from President Donald Trump’s “current and potential” tariff hikes, two sources said, as both nations move fast to clinch a deal.\n\nIndians are unlikely to remove their tariffs without a U.S. concession — such as more white-collar jobs for Indian graduates, said Lynn. The Indians are “dropping tariffs to zero on American products that they have no intention of buying, and if they do, they’ll be buying with salaries taken from American [professionals],” he said.\n\nIndia must demand more American jobs because its economic growth is built on its legal and illegal migrants who send remittances and outsourcing jobs back to India. The dependence on U.S. jobs was described in a May 5 article in Bloomberg:\n\n“Everyone goes to the US to make money, and most of that money comes back to India,” says Jayesh Patel, whose entire family left the country. Patel, who runs a water bottling plant in Gujarat’s capital, Ahmedabad, frequently visits his native village to watch over the family’s land. “Everything here—the roads, temples, schools—it all comes from dollars.”\n\nMahindra Vithal Das, 65, who lives in Gujarat’s Mehsana district, has … two sons. Both made harrowing and expensive journeys to reach the US, where they work [illegally] in convenience stores and send money home to support Das and his wife.\n\nHowever, in the talk with the Brits, the Indians dropped their demand for more migration because of pressure from Farage’s rising Reform UK party.\n\nBut their UK-India agreement also hides the tax-break gain that will likely allow more U.K. jobs to be taken from young British professionals and be given, at lower wages, to desperate Indian migrants delivered by multinational outsourcing companies.\n\nThe deal includes a huge “Double Contribution Convention” clause that allows Indian migrants to avoid paying a healthcare tax, dubbed the “National Insurance” tax. This tax giveaway ensures that British employers will hire low-tax Indians at less cost than Brits who must pay the tax as well as their higher college debts.\n\nBritish officials insist the tax break is fair because it also would apply to any British people who were hired for jobs in India’s low-wage economy, and it only covers workers who hold jobs with transnational Indian companies.\n\nYet Indian officials are describing the deal as a “huge” win for their white-collar outsourcing industry: “In an unprecedented achievement, India has secured an exemption for Indian workers who are temporarily in the UK and their employers from paying social security contributions in the UK for a period of three years under the Double Contribution Convention. This will make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK.”\n\nThe deal will also “greater global mobility for aspirational young Indians,” the pro-migration government declared, adding: “The FTA eases mobility for professionals including Contractual Service Suppliers; Business Visitors; Investors; Intra-Corporate Transferees; partners and dependent children of Intra-Corporate Transferees with right to work; and Independent Professionals like yoga instructors, musicians and chefs.”\n\nThe Indian officials say the deal will also help Indian companies sell services into the U.K. market: “India has secured significant commitments on digitally delivered services for Indian service suppliers, especially in professional services such as architecture and engineering, computer related services and telecommunication services.”\n\n“The mobility chapter of the deal [is] meant to smooth the way for more inter-company transfers,” the Indian press release said, without directly saying that more Indian graduates will be able to take jobs and salaries from U.K. graduates.\n\nIn. D.C., U.S. officials have given little indication that they would welcome more Indian white-collar workers, and are promising to raise Americans’ productivity and wages.\n\n“Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told Axios on May 7. “There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump’s executive order to modernize workforce training programs represents this Administration’s commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential,” he added.\n\nThe promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vance told investors at the American Dynamism Summit in March. He added:\n\nReal innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor.","summary":"India's government has just signed a deal with the United Kingdom that allows more Indian graduates to take more white-collar jobs from British graduates.\n\n\nThe post British-India Deal Spikes U.S. White Collar Worries About Trump H-1B Giveaway appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/05/10/british-india-deal-spikes-u-s-white-collar-worries-about-trump-h-1b-giveaway/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/Trump-Signing-Executive-Orders-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:58:46","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":320009602,"title":"World News | US-China Tariff Talks to Continue Sunday, an Official Tells AP, as Trump Touts 'great Progress Made'","text":"Geneva, May 11 (AP) Sensitive talks between US and Chinese delegations over tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, an official told The Associated Press. Hours after the talks concluded, US President Donald Trump posted on social media that a reset on trade between both countries was being discussed.

Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner,\" Trump wrote. \"We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\" The meeting lasted over 10 hours and featured Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.

The official who spoke to the AP requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, which could help stabilise world markets roiled by the US-China standoff. The talks have been shrouded in secrecy, and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out. Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the UN in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place. Saturday's talks were held in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government. Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they have slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on US-China trade. Trump last month raised US tariffs on China to a combined 145 per cent, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125 per cent levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped USD 660 billion. Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the US could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.? Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results. \"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\" Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favourite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10 per cent tax on imports from almost every country in the world. But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20 per cent charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125 per cent involve a dispute that dates back to Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145 per cent. During Trump's first term, the US alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing US and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidise domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies. Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The US agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China's subsidies — were left for future negotiations. But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced. The fight over China's tech policy now resumes. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to USD 263 billion last year. Trump slaps hefty tariffs on Switzerland In Switzerland Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31 per cent tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20 per cent levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he has reduced those taxes to 10 per cent but could raise them again. The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate. \"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against US tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time\". The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10 per cent tariff, and another 21 per cent beginning Wednesday.

She’ll be spending it with her husband and son, ‘barring any unforeseen events in the news cycle,’ she joked.\n\nWe spoke in her West Wing office, shortly after she finished the day’s press briefing, which she ended with a reminder to those watching: ‘Don’t forget to call your mom this Sunday.’\n\nLeavitt, the youngest person ever to hold the press secretary job, is winning accolades for her ability to balance the 24/7 needs of her high-profile position with the 24/7 demands of an infant.\n\nIn front of the press pack, she rarely appears frazzled – and, in her signature blazers and pristine dresses, often does it all without so much as a bright blonde hair out of place.\n\nHer young Republican female fans have dubbed her ‘Mom Boss’. \n\n‘Super mom,’ Margo Martin, special assistant to the president, agreed recently.\n\nAs for the boss, President Trump says she’s ‘a big star’, jokingly pleading with Leavitt this week: ‘Don’t ever leave us.’\n\nHe doesn’t have to worry. She says she’s not going anywhere. \n\n‘Absolutely not,’ she said.\n\nThough, she confesses that while she finds being political role model to other women is ‘humbling’, her ‘favorite job of all’ is being a mom.\n\n‘I’m very blessed to have this job, and I love my job as press secretary, but my favorite job of all, and my top priority is my job of being a mother, and I have learned quickly how to prioritize my time,’ she said.\n\nShe also leans on her ‘village’ of people: her own mother Erin, her father Bob, and her husband Nicholas, who is a real estate developer, among them.\n\n‘It’s challenging,’ she admits but advises other young women: ‘You can do it. Lean on your support system and prioritize your number one job, which is to be be the best mom you can be.’\n\nShe sounded cheerful but slightly tired when she spoke with the Mail on Friday, wrapping up another long week in the West Wing. \n\nAlso helping Leavitt are the moms who served as press secretary before her – particularly Kayleigh McEnany, 37, who had a young daughter while working in Trump’s first White House, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, 42, the mom-of-three who went on to become governor of Arkansas.\n\n‘I have really soaked up their wisdom like a sponge, particularly when it comes to learning how to balance this incredibly demanding job with being a mom, and I still don’t know how now-Governor Sanders managed to do it all with three children,’ Leavitt said.\n\nShe shares some of the advice both women gave her: ‘Prioritize time and make it home for bedtime… I try to do that as much as I possibly can, and make that a priority.’\n\nLeavitt will especially enjoy family time this Sunday for, on Monday, she leaves with the president on a trip to the Middle East, where they are due to make stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. \n\n‘I’m very much looking forward to joining the president on this historic trip to the Middle East, and again, very blessed to know my my beautiful baby will be safe and sound with his father. But of course, I will miss him dearly, and will be giving him lots of love this weekend before I depart.’\n\nLittle Niko has already enjoyed more experiences than he’d ever be able to remember in his mom’s 100 days on the job: he’s joined her at commission meetings and at the White House Easter Egg Roll. And of course, on that Air Force One ride. He was a happy, bouncing baby when the Daily Mail met him coming off the plane with Leavitt.\n\n‘He’s the happiest baby in the world. I’m very blessed, and I love him so much,’ Leavitt said.\n\n‘He’s at the age now where it’s very difficult to fly with him, because he wants to crawl around everywhere and move around. It was much easier when he was a newborn, and I was bringing him with me everywhere on the campaign trail. But he did have his first Air Force One plane ride, and he was a very active boy on that.’\n\nLeavitt credits Trump for help in being able to handle motherhood and the Washington press corps, which can be an equally demanding creature.\n\nShe points out that the president has a history of hiring strong, working mothers – including Susie Wiles, 67, his chief of staff and the first woman to serve in that position. She has two daughters.\n\n‘Being a working mother in this role would not be possible without President Trump and his encouragement,’ Leavitt said. ‘He has empowered so many working women.’\n\nIt runs in the family.\n\nTrump’s First Lady Melania managed her own business ventures while raising their son Barron. First Daughter Ivanka Trump was a highly successful businesswoman as she raised her three children. Lara Trump, wife of the president’s son Eric, has balanced a high-profile TV gig and two small kids. And youngest Trump daughter Tiffany, an attorney by trade, is about to become a first-time mom with husband Michael Boulos.\n\n‘I wish her the best, and we’ll be praying for her and Michael. They’re an amazing couple, and they’re gonna have a beautiful baby, and she’ll be a great mom,’ Leavitt said. \n\n‘You know, look at the other women in President Trump’s life, his daughters, his daughter, Ivanka, of course, is an amazing working woman. And Lara Trump is incredible. And of course, our beautiful First Lady, as the President said yesterday, has been a phenomenal mother to their son, Barron. And so great examples all around in the Trump family.’\n\nLeavitt hasn’t paused in her upward trajectory since she went from being an intern in the first Trump administration, to working on Capitol Hill and on her own close – but ultimately failed – congressional campaign.\n\nShe joined the Trump team again during the 2024 presidential race, helping him win her home state of New Hampshire before taking on the role of national press secretary.\n\nLeavitt traveled across the country while pregnant and returned to work four days after giving birth to her son. \n\nShe and Nicholas Riccio married a few days before Trump was inaugurated and set up their new home in Washington D.C.\n\nBut her roots and her family are never far from her mind.\n\nBecause one other thing she’ll be doing on Mother’s Day is calling her own mom ‘to tell her that I love her. In fact, I’ve been telling all of my staff today, as a mom, there’s nothing better than feeling love from your child.’\n\n‘So I told all of my staff that their weekend assignment is to call their moms and tell them how much they love them.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA first-time mom and President Trump&#8217;s redoubtable White House press secretary, 27-year-old Karoline Leavitt&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Karoline Leavitt discusses the Trump family sisterhood in a personal interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/karoline-leavitt-discusses-the-trump-family-sisterhood-in-a-personal-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Karoline-Leavitt-talks-Trump-family-sisterhood-in-intimate-interview.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:53:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.519},{"id":320007620,"title":"‘This is no ceasefire’: New horror in conflict","text":"Both sides have accused the other of breaking the agreement. \n\nIndia first accused Pakistan of violating the deal and declared it would be retaliating.

Pakistan has denied any connection to it.\n\nEarlier this week, the Prime Minister of Pakistan has promised to “avenge each drop of blood” spilt as a consequence of India’s air strikes, in a chilling indication that tensions between the two nuclear powers are likely to keep escalating.\n\nIndia said Wednesday’s missile strikes were launched in response to the terrorist attack and massacre of its people. \n\nThe total civilian death toll for both sides sits at 66 as of early this morning.\n\nFollow news.com.au’s live coverage below for updates.","summary":"Both sides have accused the other of breaching a surprise ceasefire deal reached overnight as the conflict gets bloodier and the death toll rises.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/india-pakistan-conflict-live-updates-both-sides-accuse-the-other-of-breaching-ceasefire-deal/live-coverage/6889e82b08acdb737f504f2ab3758898?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7e14c23a8d65713c56dc4b9058aa0cde","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:51:46","author":"Alex Turner-Cohen","authors":["Alex Turner-Cohen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":320015400,"title":"India, Pakistan saling tuduh langgar gencatan senjata","text":"ISLAMABAD: India dan Pakistan saling menuduh mengenai pelanggaran gencatan senjata awal pagi Ahad, hanya beberapa jam selepas Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, mengumumkannya.\n\nKedua-dua negara jiran berkuasa nuklear itu telah mengelak daripada tercetusnya perang besar-besaran, namun masing-masing terus melaporkan mengenai serangan di kawasan sempadan.\n\nSetiausaha Luar India berkata, negaranya bertindak balas selepas Pakistan 'berulang kali melanggar' perjanjian gencatan senjata/\n\nSementara itu, Pakistan pula menyatakan bahawa pihaknya 'komited' kepada perjanjian dan angkatan bersenjatanya menangani pelanggaran oleh India dengan 'bertanggungjawab dan berhemah'.\n\nPetugas AFP di Srinagar, di wilayah Kashmir yang ditadbir India, melaporkan bunyi letupan kuat kedengaran.\n\nSeorang pegawai kanan di wilayah Kashmir yang ditadbir Pakistan memberitahu AFP bahawa 'tembakan bertalu-talu masih berterusan' di sepanjang sempadan de facto kawasan itu, Garisan Kawalan (LoC).\n\nMaklumat lanjut belum diperoleh, dan dakwaan daripada kedua-dua pihak tidak dapat disahkan secara bebas.\n\nPada Sabtu, Pakistan dan India bersetuju untuk melaksanakan gencatan senjata sepenuhnya serta-merta selepas beberapa hari serangan maut menggunakan jet pejuang, peluru berpandu, dron dan artileri.\n\nPertempuran itu mengorbankan sekurang-kurangnya 60 orang serta menyebabkan ribuan penduduk melarikan diri dari kawasan sempadan dan Kashmir yang terbahagi.\n\nBerita gencatan senjata itu diumumkan secara mengejut oleh Trump.\n\n\"Selepas rundingan panjang dengan AS selaku pengantara, saya dengan sukacitanya mengumumkan bahawa India dan Pakistan telah bersetuju untuk melaksanakan GENCATAN SENJATA SEPENUHNYA DAN SERTA-MERTA. \n\n\"Tahniah kepada kedua-dua negara kerana menggunakan Kebijaksanaan dan Kecerdikan,\" kata Trump dalam satu hantaran media sosial.\n\nSetiausaha Luar India, Vikram Misri, berkata kedua-dua pihak akan 'menghentikan semua tembakan dan tindakan ketenteraan di darat, udara dan laut' berkuat kuasa jam 5.00 petang (1130 GMT).\n\nNamun, beliau kemudiannya menuduh Pakistan melakukan 'pelanggaran berulang' dan berkata angkatan tentera India 'memberi tindak balas yang sewajarnya dan setimpal'.\n\nSementara itu, Kementerian Luar Pakistan menyatakan bahawa negara itu 'tetap komited untuk melaksanakan perjanjian gencatan senjata dengan penuh integriti'.\n\n\"Walaupun terdapat pelanggaran oleh India di beberapa kawasan, pasukan kami menangani keadaan dengan penuh tanggungjawab dan berhemah,\" katanya.\n\nPengumuman gencatan senjata itu disambut lega oleh beberapa negara termasuk Britain dan Iran, serta Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB).\n\nChina, yang berjiran dengan India dan Pakistan, menerusi agensi berita Xinhua yang dikendalikan kerajaan, berkata Beijing 'bersedia untuk terus memainkan peranan konstruktif' dan kekal prihatin terhadap sebarang ketegangan yang memuncak. -

Jon Ossoff and Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, who voted against legislation to bar biological males from women’s sports earlier this year, are backing the Equality Act, a bill that would make “gender identity” a protected class under federal anti-discrimination law. The candidates’ decision to support the far-reaching legislation comes as Republicans accuse the two lawmakers of catering to left-wing gender ideology that is at odds with their own voters. (RELATED: It Appears Democrats Have Finally Picked A Hill To Die On)\n\nNearly 70% of Democrats or participants who “lean Democrat” oppose biological males participating in women’s sports, according to a New York Times survey conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.\n\nOssoff, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking reelection, is currently running unopposed in Georgia’s Democratic primary. Stevens entered a contested Democratic primary field in April to vie for an open Michigan Senate seat following Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters’ decision to not seek reelection.\n\nIn Georgia, 73% of voters told a pollster in January they would support the state government banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation, dubbed the Riley Gaines Act, to protect women’s sports in April.\n\nDespite a majority of voters appearing to reject the Democratic Party’s stance on transgender issues, Ossoff and Stevens appear to be toeing the party line.\n\nOssoff and Stevens are among the 47 Senate Democrats and 214 House Democrats supporting the latest rollout of the Equality Act, which congressional Democrats introduced for the fifth time on April 29. The legislation passed the House in May 2019 and February 2021 under the leadership of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but did not clear the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” The legislation would force schools to open female-only spaces to biological males who identify as transgender girls, including sports teams, according to analysis from the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“As Republicans across the country continue their assault on LGBTQ+ Americans – particularly the trans community – the fight against bigotry and discrimination remains as urgent as ever,” Pelosi said in a April 29 statement marking the Equality Act’s reintroduction.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are seen as top pick-up opportunities for Senate Republicans during the midterms. Early analysis from the Cook Political Report rates both contests as “toss-ups.”\n\nTrump bested former Vice President Kamala Harris in both swing states in November.\n\nStevens called on Congress to take up the Equality Act again in February two months prior to her Senate campaign announcement.\n\n“As a member of the @EqualityCaucus, I’m celebrating 4 years since we last passed the Equality Act — the 119th Congress needs to bring it to a vote, it must become law,” Stevens wrote in a post on X.\n\nStevens also slammed legislation seeking to bar transgender athletes from women’s sports during a speech on the House floor in April 2023, characterizing the bill as “hateful.”\n\nFormer Republican Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who is viewed as the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, criticized Stevens for repeatedly failing to protect women’s sports and female-only spaces.\n\n“Michiganders see Haley Stevens’ In-Equality Act for what it is: the radical left’s latest scheme to force boys into girls’ bathrooms and sports teams,” Rogers campaign spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Meanwhile, Mike Rogers and President Trump are fighting to defend girls’ safety, privacy, and opportunity. Protecting girls’ sports and spaces is not only fair, it’s common sense.”\n\nOssoff, who ran on passing the Equality Act into law during his successful 2020 Senate campaign, has continued to oppose efforts to restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.\n\nThe senator joined Senate Democrats in filibustering Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in March despite pressure from Georgia Republicans to support the bill.\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, the first Republican candidate to jump into Georgia’s 2026 GOP primary following Kemp’s decision to pass on a run, came out swinging against Ossoff’s left-wing positions on transgender issues in his campaign announcement video.\n\n“Last November Georgia spoke, but Jon Ossoff doesn’t care,” the video’s narrator states. “He fought against President Trump securing our border and voted for men in girls sports. Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side.”\n\nSenate Leadership Fund, a Senate Majority Leader John Thune-aligned super PAC, has also targeted Ossoff for his votes against legislation to protect women’s sports. SLF’s issue advocacy arm, One Nation, ran a seven-figure ad buy to highlight Ossoff’s left-wing stance on women’s sports in April. The ad aired during several high-profile sports events, including the Masters tournament and the Final Four college men and women’s basketball games.\n\n“Man-to-man defense isn’t woke enough for Ossoff. He’s for they/them,” the ad’s narrator says while a man purporting to be Ossoff dunks over a female basketball player.\n\nSpokespeople for Ossoff and Stevens did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Macron later told reporters that if accepted, the ceasefire will have “oversight provided mainly by the United States of America, and to which all Europeans will contribute.” \n\nMacron told reporters that a ceasefire would provide all parties with the opportunity to begin negotiations for a “robust and lasting peace on the question of territories, the question of sensitive energy infrastructures, and of course the question of security guarantees.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had rejected calls for an extended ceasefire, citing Western military support for Kyiv as its reason. Macron responded to this news via reporters, telling them, “anything that disturbs the process by imposing conditions is, in a way, a delaying tactic to avoid peace.”\n\nAt a press conference in Kyiv, Merz spoke for the group of leaders, telling gathered press, “we are thankful that the American president fully supports our initiative.”\n\nThe news of Trump’s support for a ceasefire came soon after an Axios report on the MAGA response to the Trump administration’s changing rhetoric on Russia was published. The outlet interviewed big names in the MAGA-verse, including Jack Posobiec, about the fact that both Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance have been more critical of Putin in recent weeks.\n\nPosobiec said of the change, “In general, the MAGA base is not on board with extending or expanding the war and trust Trump when he is in negotiation mode. But I don’t think extra payments [to Ukraine] will go over well.”\n\nThis week, Vance said that Russia was “asking for too much,“ referring to Putin wanting to control territory currently not occupied by Russia as part of a potential peace deal. Last month, after Russia fired missiles at civilian-occupied areas of Ukraine, Trump said of Putin, “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently.”\n\nThe comments are a departure from the administration’s previous language around the conflict, which saw both Trump and Vance chastising Zelensky during his visit to the White House in February.\n\nDuring the meeting, Vance berated Zelensky for not publicly thanking the Trump administration and for failing to express support for any peace deal the U.S. dictates, telling him that it was “disrespectful“ to travel to D.C. and demand anything more than a ceasefire. In addition, a week prior to his visit, Trump called Zelensky an “unelected dictator“ who has done a “terrible job.”","summary":"Mikhail Svetlov/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has joined European leaders in calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nFollowing a meeting between U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Starmer told reporters that Putin must accept the ceasefire, adding that there should be “no more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.” Noncompliance could result in further sanctions being imposed, and increased military support for Kyiv.\n\nCalling President Trump together from Kyiv.\n\nOur joint call: there must be a 30-day ceasefire starting Monday, unconditional, that paves the way for a solid and lasting peace in Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/MloOm6YYHj\n\n&mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 10, 2025Read more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-joins-chorus-of-leaders-threatening-sanctions-on-vladimir-putin/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/PBL4FEV73JHOJB6TFFZXVN53SI.jpg?smart=true&auth=c4f4bef4ea584e5528708225342c51a38ec5cafde4258326b14dd7ae7c425ba9&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:45:50","author":"Catherine Bouris","authors":["Catherine Bouris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":320012170,"title":"Mexico SUES Google for changing Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America for tech giant's map users in United States","text":"Mexico has sued Google after it caved to President Donald Trump's demands to change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its map for users in the US.\n\nJust hours after he took office in January, Trump instructed the US Board on Geographic Names to make the change and also re-name the Alaskan peak Denali, the tallest mountain in North America, to Mount McKinley.\n\nThe name has remained Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps in Mexico but outside of the two countries, users will see both names with Gulf of America in brackets. \n\nMexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum did not disclose when the lawsuit was submitted but said it 'has already been filed'. \n\nThe demand for the change was one of Trump's many executive orders, as he argued the ocean basin was 'ours' and that the US had done 'most of the work there'.\n\nThe president also proclaimed February 8th as Gulf of America day on his way to the Super Bowl as Air Force One flew over the gulf.\n\nIn response, Google said it would follow the US government in renaming the gulf, which sits between the US, Mexico and Cuba.\n\nMs Sheinbaum previously warned Google she was considering legal action unless they went back on the decision.\n\nIn January, she said: 'For us, it is still the Gulf of Mexico, and for the entire world it is still the Gulf of Mexico.'\n\nThe same month, Ms Sheinbaum jokingly suggested North America, including the United States, should be renamed 'Mexican America' - a historic name used on an early map of the region. \n\nUS lawmakers voted in favour of the name change on Thursday, making the executive order signed by the US president now federal law.\n\nMexico argues that Trump's executive order only applies to the part of the continental shelf belonging to the US.\n\n'All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,' Ms Sheinbaum said, adding: 'The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn't have the authority to name the entire gulf.'\n\nWhen the change was made, a Google spokesperson said: 'We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\n\n'When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name.

On Friday, he hinted at the possibility of easing them, writing on Truth Social: “80 per cent Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.?” Still, Trump has remained firm in using tariffs as leverage, citing concerns over fentanyl inflows and long-standing disputes over China’s alleged intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\nThe standoff dates back to Trump’s first term, when the US accused China of forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets, heavily subsidizing its tech sector, and engaging in economic espionage.

Projectiles and flashes were also seen in the night sky over Jammu, according to authorities, residents said.\n\nIndian foreign secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of breaching the agreement, while Pakistan’s foreign ministry insisted they \"remain committed to the ceasefire\" and blamed Indian forces for initiating a violation.\n\nThe ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against major military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into all-out war.\n\nThe fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which 25 Hindu tourists and a guide were killed. India blamed the attack on Pakistani-backed extremists, an accusation Pakistan denied.\n\nJust as the situation seemed to be spiralling out of control, the US president announced that a ceasefire had been agreed.\n\n“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.”\n\nThis was soon confirmed by Indian and Pakistani ministers. Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar told Geo News that three dozen countries had been involved in the diplomacy that secured the “full-fledged” and “not partial” ceasefire.\n\nThe Indian foreign secretary said the two countries’ military chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm local time (11.30am GMT), without using the word “ceasefire”.\n\nMr Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement.\n\nMr Misri, India’s top diplomat, said the two military chiefs would speak to each other again on Monday.\n\nBefore the ceasefire announcement, military jets and missiles lit up the skies through the night across Indian-administered Kashmir and the state of Punjab, with residents reporting deafening blasts in cities including Amritsar, Jammu and Srinagar.\n\nShelling by Pakistani forces killed at least five people in Jammu and emptied out many villages along the border as people fled to safer areas, officials said.\n\n“Jammu city has never been hit before,” Rajeev Gupta, 60, a resident whose brother was wounded in shelling, told Reuters. “Never thought we would be hit like this.”\n\nIn Srinagar, residents said explosions overnight felt unlike previous drone attacks and were concentrated around military installations.\n\nMohammed Yasin, a resident, told the Associated Press his children were shaken awake by the blasts. “They started crying,” he said.\n\nIn Pakistan, officials said Indian missiles had targeted three air bases – Nur Khan in Rawalpindi, Murid in Chakwal and Rafiqui in Jhang district – early on Saturday. A military spokesperson said air defence systems intercepted most of the missiles and no air force assets were damaged.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan’s Shehbaz Sharif, Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan’s army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Rubio commended Mr Modi and Mr Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site”.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have been locked in a dispute over Kashmir ever since the partition of India at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full.\n\nThey have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smaller outbreaks of fighting.

He spoke after India said it was committed to non-escalation if Pakistan responded in kind.\n\nDar made similar remarks to the country's Geo News outlet, but he warned that “our response will follow” if India launches any strikes.\n\nThe comments came after Pakistan said it launched a military operation against India after accusing it of firing missiles at three Pakistani air bases late on May 9, another escalation.\n\nPakistani security sources told RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal that the operation is codenamed Bunyanun Marsoos, an Arabic word taken from a verse in the Koran meaning a strong pillar.\n\nReports said Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called an urgent meeting of the National Command Authority, which deals with the country's nuclear arms policy, among other functions. But Defense Minister Khwaja Asif said later on May 10 that no meeting had taken place.\n\nPakistan's Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said a depot used to store India’s Brahmos missiles had been destroyed. The military said attacks on several other locations, including the Pathankot Airfield and Udhampur Air Force Station, had also taken place. Pakistan also said it fired Fatah 1 missiles on the two Indian air bases.\n\nThe Indian Army called Pakistan's actions unacceptable.\n\n\"Pakistan’s blatant escalation with drone strikes and other munitions continues along our western borders. In one such incident, today at approximately 5 a.m., Multiple enemy armed drones were spotted flying over Khasa Cantt, Amritsar,\" the army said on X. \"The hostile drones were instantly engaged and destroyed by our air defense units.\"\n\nThe fresh attacks started hours after Saudi Arabia's foreign minister left Pakistan. Adel Al-Jubeir was in Islamabad to meet with Sharif, according to a statement. He visited India before landing in Islamabad on May 9 for talks with Pakistani leaders.\n\nPakistani security sources also claimed that a simultaneous cyberattack had been launched and electrical power in several cities had been cut.\n\nThe security sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, added that the Pakistani side has decided that if India launched more attacks, they would hit the highways in India.\n\nPakistan said earlier that missiles, apparently fired by India, had fallen at different locations in Pakistan.\n\nOne of the missiles hit the Noor Khan Air Noor Khan Airbase Base in Rawalpindi city. The air base is where the military has its headquarters and is less than 30 kilometers from key buildings, including the Presidential House, the House of Parliament, and the prime minister’s house, in the Pakistani capital city of Islamabad.\n\nFahim Ahmad, a resident of Rawalpindi city, who lives near the Noor Khan Air Base, told Radio Mashaal, he saw an object blasted out of the air and drop near the air base.\n\nAhmad said alarm sirens went off, heightening fears of a large escalation just days after Indian air strikes claimed multiple lives in Pakistan, prompting Sharif to vow retaliation.\n\nSpeaking at a hastily arranged news conference soon after the missiles were fired on Pakistan late on May 9, the director-general of the ISPR, Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif, said an attack by India to target the Noor Khan Air Base had been foiled.\n\nTwo other missiles were fired at two other air bases -- Murid Air Base and Shorkot Air |Base -- he said. Sharif claimed that India also fired some missiles in Afghanistan.\n\nAn explosion was reported in the city of Peshawar in the early hours of May 10, according to Radio Mashaal correspondent Wasim Sajjad.\n\n“We were awakened by the sound of an explosion around 3 a.m. (local time), which was followed by firing from the ground,” Sajjad said. “We saw lights going from the ground toward the sky with sounds of firing that continued for nearly an hour.”\n\nThe explosion drew people out of their houses and apartments into the dark night, said Sajjad.\n\nTensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu Indian tourists, on April 22. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad rejects.\n\nAzaz Seyed, author and journalist, told Radio Mashaal that the world is not taking interest in stopping a looming full-fledged conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe Group of Seven leading industrialized countries on May 9 urged both India and Pakistan to avoid escalation and called on them to engage in direct dialogue.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, and the European Union said they \"strongly condemn\" a deadly attack on tourists in Indian Kashmir on April 22 and \"urge maximum restraint from both India and Pakistan.\"\n\nIndian and Pakistani forces on May 7 exchanged artillery fire after Indian air strikes claimed multiple lives. Both sides reported several fatalities in the shelling. Pakistan also claimed to have shot down several Indian jets.\n\nIndian forces on May 6 hit targets across Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistan’s Punjab Province.\n\nIndia said it carried out “precision strikes” against “terrorists” following the attack in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago that killed 26 Hindu tourists.\n\nIndia had earlier said that two of three suspects in that attack were Pakistani nationals but had not detailed any evidence. Pakistan denied that it had anything to do with the killings.\n\nIndia and Pakistan, which gained independence from Britain in 1947, fought full-scale wars in 1948, 1965, and 1971, and a limited conflict in 1999.

He said he was scheduled to speak to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later Sunday with hopes of holding talks next week in Istanbul. There would be no preconditions on Russia's part, he said. Putin said Ukraine walked away from such talks in the past and broke ceasefire agreements, though both sides have been blamed for attacks during the last three ceasefires. He used language that expressed his desire for serious talks with long-term consequences, including long-lasting peace. Putin’s comments came on the last day of the three-day ceasefire declared by Russia, and almost immediately after leaders from the United Kingdom, France, Poland and Germany threatened to increase sanctions against the nation if he does not accept an unconditional, 30-day ceasefire starting Monday. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made the demand for an unconditional ceasefire in a news briefing, which included over 30 countries that have pledged to strengthen Ukraine. They also joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the memorial of fallen Ukrainian soldiers at independence square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday. The leaders said the proposal to start the ceasefire Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ceasefire aims to enforce a halt to fighting on land, sea and air. The world leaders’ show of force came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of war. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, said on X on Saturday that such a ceasefire could \"start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.\" Kellogg enlisted a quote from Trump — \"stop the killing now\" — to bolster his own statement in support of a 30-day ceasefire. Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country. Last week, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.","summary":"MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin of Russia said early Sunday that his country is committed to direct talks with Kyiv about ending their war, and suggested the next discussions begin May 15 in Turkey.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/world/putin-comments-tktk-rcna206026","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250510-putin-ch-1138-0b8af3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:37:39","author":"Keir Simmons,Mirna Alsharif","authors":["Keir Simmons","Mirna Alsharif"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":320007304,"title":"Putin to ‘think through’ Ukraine ceasefire proposal","text":"Vladimir Putin will “think through” a Western proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, after Britain, the US and European allies threatened to send more weapons to Kyiv if Russia did not comply by Monday.\n\nThe ultimatum was made after a meeting in Kyiv, where the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelensky, spoke on the phone with Donald Trump, the US president.\n\nIn response, the Russian President proposed “direct negotiations” with Ukraine at a meeting in Istanbul on Thursday.\n\n“It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022,” Putin said, blaming Kyiv.\n\n“Nevertheless, we are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions.\n\n“Let me remind you that as a result of these negotiations, a joint draft document was prepared, and it was initialled by the head of the Kyiv negotiating group, but at the insistence of the West, it was thrown into the trash.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer told the Russian president that there should be “no more ifs and buts” and that he must agree to a truce or face further sanctions on its energy and banking sectors.\n\n“All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” Sir Keir said at a press conference.\n\nThe Kremlin then agreed to “think through” the proposal, without committing to sign anything.\n\n“We have to think this through. It is a new development,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary, said. “But trying to pressure us is quite useless.”\n\nMoscow’s unilateral three-day ceasefire declared for the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany was due to expire on Saturday night.\n\nThe Russian president insisted that during the ceasefire “Kyiv has made five attempts to attack the Russian border”.\n\n“Russia has repeatedly made ceasefire initiatives,” Putin said.\n\n“Kyiv authorities have not responded to any of our ceasefire proposals.”\n\nShow of unity in Ukraine\n\nThe unprecedented visit to Kyiv was the first time the leaders of the four European nations had made a joint trip to Ukraine.\n\nSir Keir, together with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, and Mr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, also held a videoconference with around 20 member countries of the “coalition of the willing” supporting Ukraine.\n\nAfterwards, Sir Keir said: “So we are clear, all five leaders here – all the leaders of the meeting we just had with the coalition of the willing – an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond.\n\n“Working with president Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.\n\n“No more ifs and buts. No more conditions and delays. Putin didn’t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade. And he doesn’t need them now.\n\n“Ukraine has shown their willingness to engage again and again. But again and again, Putin has refused.”\n\nKeith Kellogg, Mr Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, was not at the meeting, but said that a “comprehensive” 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, “will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II”.\n\nMr Macron said that the US would take the lead in monitoring the proposed agreement, with support from European countries. He threatened “massive sanctions, prepared and co-ordinated, between Europeans and Americans” should Russia violate the truce.\n\nAddressing scepticism over whether fresh sanctions against Moscow would work, Mr Merz said “almost all member states of the European Union and a large coalition of the willing around the world are determined to enforce these sanctions even if our initiative of the weekend should fail”.\n\nRussia has long said that it was open to talks, accusing Kyiv of closing off that option by adopting a 2022 decree ruling out any negotiation with Putin.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Peskov said that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of “a large number of nuances”.\n\nHe also suggested that Western military assistance for Ukraine would have to stop in order for a ceasefire to occur. “Otherwise, it will be an advantage for Ukraine,” he said.\n\nRussia believes it has the advantage on the battlefield and says it is concerned that Ukraine could use a 30-day pause in the war to rest its forces, mobilise more men and get hold of more Western arms.\n\nIn Kyiv, Mr Macron did not commit to the Russian proposal.\n\n“There is no precondition. Neither stopping delivery of arms to protect and resist for you [Ukraine],” he told Mr Zelensky.\n\nThe leaders also discussed security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nForeign troops could be deployed\n\nBuilding up the country’s military capabilities will be a key deterrent against Russia, while a force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added “reassurance” measure, Mr Macron said.\n\nHe said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned, and no mention was made of Nato membership, still Kyiv’s top choice for a security guarantee.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the European leaders joined a ceremony at Kyiv’s Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. They lit candles alongside Mr Zelensky at a makeshift flag memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians killed since Russia’s invasion.\n\nHours before, and despite Russia’s own supposed ceasefire, three people were killed and four others wounded by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region. Another civilian died on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin.\n\nThe US embassy in Kyiv on Friday warned of a “potentially significant” Russian air attack in the coming days, without giving details.\n\nIn November Russia gave the US brief advance warning before striking Ukraine for the first time with its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, an experimental hypersonic weapon that Putin claimed could travel at 10 times the speed of sound.\n\nUkrainian Telegram channels linked the embassy’s warning to reports of an imminent flight ban by Moscow over the Kapustin Yar military training and rocket launch complex.

Its speed and manoeuvrability make it extremely difficult to intercept.\n\nIt was first used in combat in November in an attack on Dnipro, however it appeared to have been fitted with inert munitions.\n\n11:18 AM BST\n\nPictured: Starmer, Macron and Zelensky pay tribute to fallen Ukrainians\n\n11:00 AM BST\n\nRussia and North Korea have ‘blood-sealed bilateral relationship’, says Kim Jong-un\n\nRussia and North Korea have a “blood-sealed bilateral relationship”, Kim Jong-un said as he visited Moscow’s embassy in Pyongyang to celebrate Victory Day on Friday.\n\nThe North Korean dictator said he wanted to congratulate Russia on the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, “and celebrate this historic day with the Russian friends”.\n\nThe two countries have a “blood-sealed bilateral relationship [that] will continue to be in its heyday in the future, making a perfect demonstration of its inexhaustible potential in all realms”, Kim was quoted as saying by state media.\n\nHe said it took only 80 seconds for him to travel to the embassy from the Korean Workers’ Party headquarters, which reminded him of 80 years of “spiritual intimacy” between Pyongyang and Moscow since the end of the Second World War.\n\n“Thanks to Comrade President Putin’s outstanding foresight and decision, the Korea-Russia relationship has regained its original features befitting allies and made the choice which could not be substituted by anything else for all its fate.”\n\n10:42 AM BST\n\nRussia will face harder sanctions if it refuses ceasefire, Germany says\n\nRussia will face much tougher sanctions if it refuses a 30-day ceasefire demanded by the West, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, said in an interview published on Saturday.\n\nIf Putin does not agree to the truce, “there will be a massive hardening of sanctions and the massive aid to Ukraine will continue - politically, of course, but also financially and militarily,” Mr Merz told the Bild newspaper.\n\n“We agree with the US government, with Donald Trump. We are demanding a 30-day ceasefire so that peace negotiations can be prepared during this period,” he said.\n\n“The ball is now in Putin’s court. Putin must respond to this offer.”\n\n10:33 AM BST\n\nKremlin: Starmer’s sanctions plan does not scare us\n\nThe Kremlin has said it is not worried by Sir Keir Starmer’s announcement of new sanctions on Russia.\n\n“We have already become accustomed to sanctions, we can already even imagine what we will do after these sanctions are announced, how we will minimise their consequences,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary, was quoted by Russian state media as saying.\n\nScaring Russia with the threat of new restrictions was a waste of time, Peskov added.\n\nDowning Street on Friday said it was planning the “largest ever” sanctions package on Russia’s shadow fleet, which transports the Kremlin’s oil across the world.\n\n10:26 AM BST\n\nVictory Day parade made Europe nervous, Kremlin says\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia’s Victory Day parade in Moscow on Friday made Europe “nervous”.\n\n“Europeans are nervous about what is happening in Moscow on May 9,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary, was quoted as saying by Russian state media.\n\nHe added: “Europeans are nervous about the large international consolidation around Victory Day.\n\n“And the large international consolidation around pride in that victory over fascism and for the liberation of the world from fascism.”\n\n10:07 AM BST\n\nSlovak PM derides EU attempts to keep him from Moscow war commemorations\n\nRobert Fico, Slovakia’s prime minister, says his country wants to develop relations with Russia, and derided those in the European Union who he said created obstacles to his attendance at Second World War commemorations in Moscow.\n\nMr Fico broke ranks with the EU by visiting Moscow late last year, more than two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHe met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin late on Friday evening following the Red Square parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nChina’s Xi Jinping was among several dozen leaders at the commemorations, but nearly all Western leaders stayed away.\n\nFico arrived after a circuitous journey made necessary by EU members’ barring his aircraft from their airspace.\n\n“As a head of government, I want to assure you that it is in my interest to have pragmatic relations with the Russian Federation,” Russian news agencies quoted Fico as telling Putin.\n\nHe said he opposed the creation of any new “iron curtain and pledge to do everything so that we can shake hands across a curtain”.\n\n“Let us consider as a childish joke all the technical problems we confronted, created by our European Union colleagues.”\n\nPutin said Russia appreciated Fico’s decision to attend despite the “logistical obstacles that were created. But you are nonetheless here.”\n\n09:22 AM BST\n\nRussia says Western arms flows to Ukraine would need to stop during any ceasefire\n\nRussia would require a halt to US and European arms supplies to Ukraine during any potential ceasefire, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with ABC News.\n\n“Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to (the) frontline,” Peskov said.\n\n“Ukraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones. So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?”\n\nUS President Donald Trump urged Russia and Ukraine on Friday to “get this stupid war finished”, as he pushed for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine says it is willing to agree to.\n\nBut Peskov, in the interview, restated Russian concerns that Putin had made public as far back as March 13 and set out in a phone call with Trump on March 18.\n\n“A ceasefire was supported by President Putin, but he asked several questions. He said that right now we have certain dynamics on the front, Russian troops are advancing, and advancing in quite a confident way,” he said.\n\n“So if we speak about ceasefire, what are we going to do with shipments of weapons coming every day from the United States and from European countries?”\n\n08:51 AM BST\n\nZelensky posts morning highlights\n\nThe Ukrainian president has posted a slick video on social media of his busy morning with the European leaders.\n\n08:40 AM BST\n\nMacron calls for ‘direct talks’ between Ukraine and Russia\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called on Saturday for “direct talks” between Ukraine and Russia in the event of a ceasefire in Moscow’s three-year invasion.\n\nIf there is a 30-day truce, as Western countries have floated, “we will look to direct talks between Ukraine and Russia, we are ready to help,” Macron said in an interview with French news outlets TF1 and LCI while travelling to Kyiv to meet European leaders.\n\n08:12 AM BST\n\nLeaders visit Ukraine’s Independence Square\n\nBefore any meetings this morning, the leaders have paid their respects to the victims of war at the Memorial for the Fallen at the Independence Square in Kyiv.\n\n08:07 AM BST\n\nHamish de Bretton-Gordon\n\nA peace deal and ceasefire seem far away, but there is a suggestion that the wind may be about to change.\n\nRead Hamish’s full piece here.\n\n08:04 AM BST\n\nWhat is the visit for?\n\nTheir visit to Kyiv is designed to expose Putin as a barrier to peace as he continues to resist American, Ukrainian and European calls to sign up to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.\n\nThe three leaders will also convene a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” that plans to defend Ukraine’s airspace and seas and train Kyiv’s armed forces to deter future Russian attacks following any peace deal.\n\n08:01 AM BST\n\nEuropean leaders arrive in Kyiv\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz have arrived in Kyiv.\n\nThe three arrived by train from Poland.

In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking.\n\n‘A very important signal’\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking to reporters alongside the European leaders in Kyiv, called their meeting \"a very important signal.”\n\nIn a joint statement, as published on Zelenskyy's official website, the five leaders called for a ceasefire “lasting at least 30 days\" from Monday, to make room for a diplomatic push to end the war.\n\n“An unconditional ceasefire by definition cannot be subject to any conditions. If Russia calls for such conditions, this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy,” the statement read.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that the U.S. would take the lead in monitoring the proposed cease-fire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated, between Europeans and Americans,” should Russia violate the truce.\n\nMacron traveled to Kyiv with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\n“This is Europe stepping up, showing our solidarity with Ukraine,” Starmer said.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, said Saturday that a “comprehensive” 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, “will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday held a series of bilateral talks with foreign officials who had attended Moscow's own celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, in an apparent attempt to underscore the West’s failure to isolate it on the global stage. Putin's interlocutors included To Lam, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and the leaders of Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nEurope threatens more sanctions if Russia ignores ceasefire offer\n\nProgress on ending the three-year war has seemed elusive in the months since Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult.\n\nSince the start of U.S.-mediated talks, Russia has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets. \n\nThe ceasefire would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The European leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia’s energy and banking sectors, if Putin did not comply.\n\nThe priority was to make it too costly for Russia to keep fighting in Ukraine, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.\n\nWhen asked how the monitoring mechanism would work, Sybiha told The Associated Press the details were still being discussed.\n\nAddressing skepticism over whether fresh sanctions against Moscow, which has so far managed to keep fighting in the war, Merz said “almost all member states of the European Union and a large coalition of the willing around the world are determined to enforce these sanctions even if our initiative of the weekend should fail.”\n\nThe leaders also discussed security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nBuilding up Kyiv's military capabilities will be a key deterrent against Russia and require supplying Ukraine with robust quantities of arms to deter future attacks and investing in its defense sector. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added “reassurance” measure, Macron said.\n\nHe said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned. No mention was made of NATO membership, still Kyiv’s top choice for a security guarantee.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the European leaders joined a ceremony at Kyiv's Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles alongside Zelenskyy at a makeshift flag memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians slain since Russia's invasion.\n\nRussian attacks continue\n\nRussian shelling in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more, local officials said. Another civilian died Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Friday warned of a “potentially significant” Russian air attack in the coming days, without giving details.\n\nRussia in November gave the U.S. brief advance warning before striking Ukraine for the first time with its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, an experimental hypersonic weapon that Putin claimed could travel at 10 times the speed of sound.\n\nUkrainian Telegram channels linked the embassy's warning to reports of an imminent flight ban by Moscow over the Kapustin Yar military training and rocket launch complex. A similar flight ban preceded November’s strike. There was no immediate comment from Russian officials.\n\nTrump said last week that he doubts Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, and hinted at further sanctions against Russia.\n\nUkraine’s European allies view its fate as fundamental to the continent’s security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of whether Trump pulls out.\n\nAssociated Press writers Thomas Adamson in Paris, Philipp Reissfelder in Berlin and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, 'without preconditions,&amp;quot; an offer that came in response to Ukraine and its allies urging Moscow to commit to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

She'll be spending it with her husband and son, 'barring any unforeseen events in the news cycle,' she joked.\n\nWe spoke in her West Wing office, shortly after she finished the day's press briefing, which she ended with a reminder to those watching: 'Don't forget to call your mom this Sunday.'\n\nLeavitt, the youngest person ever to hold the press secretary job, is winning accolades for her ability to balance the 24/7 needs of her high-profile position with the 24/7 demands of an infant.\n\nIn front of the press pack, she rarely appears frazzled - and, in her signature blazers and pristine dresses, often does it all without so much as a bright blonde hair out of place.\n\nHer young Republican female fans have dubbed her 'Mom Boss'. \n\n'Super mom,' Margo Martin, special assistant to the president, agreed recently.\n\nAs for the boss, President Trump says she's 'a big star', jokingly pleading with Leavitt this week: 'Don't ever leave us.'\n\nHe doesn't have to worry. She says she's not going anywhere. \n\n'Absolutely not,' she said.\n\nThough, she confesses that while she finds being political role model to other women is 'humbling', her 'favorite job of all' is being a mom.\n\n'I'm very blessed to have this job, and I love my job as press secretary, but my favorite job of all, and my top priority is my job of being a mother, and I have learned quickly how to prioritize my time,' she said.\n\nShe also leans on her 'village' of people: her own mother Erin, her father Bob, and her husband Nicholas, who is a real estate developer, among them.\n\n'It's challenging,' she admits but advises other young women: 'You can do it. Lean on your support system and prioritize your number one job, which is to be be the best mom you can be.'\n\nShe sounded cheerful but slightly tired when she spoke with the Mail on Friday, wrapping up another long week in the West Wing. \n\nAlso helping Leavitt are the moms who served as press secretary before her - particularly Kayleigh McEnany, 37, who had a young daughter while working in Trump's first White House, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, 42, the mom-of-three who went on to become governor of Arkansas.\n\n'I have really soaked up their wisdom like a sponge, particularly when it comes to learning how to balance this incredibly demanding job with being a mom, and I still don't know how now-Governor Sanders managed to do it all with three children,' Leavitt said.\n\nShe shares some of the advice both women gave her: 'Prioritize time and make it home for bedtime... I try to do that as much as I possibly can, and make that a priority.'\n\nLeavitt will especially enjoy family time this Sunday for, on Monday, she leaves with the president on a trip to the Middle East, where they are due to make stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. \n\n'I'm very much looking forward to joining the president on this historic trip to the Middle East, and again, very blessed to know my my beautiful baby will be safe and sound with his father. But of course, I will miss him dearly, and will be giving him lots of love this weekend before I depart.'\n\nLittle Niko has already enjoyed more experiences than he'd ever be able to remember in his mom's 100 days on the job: he's joined her at commission meetings and at the White House Easter Egg Roll. And of course, on that Air Force One ride. He was a happy, bouncing baby when the Daily Mail met him coming off the plane with Leavitt.\n\n'He's the happiest baby in the world. I'm very blessed, and I love him so much,' Leavitt said.\n\n'He's at the age now where it's very difficult to fly with him, because he wants to crawl around everywhere and move around. It was much easier when he was a newborn, and I was bringing him with me everywhere on the campaign trail. But he did have his first Air Force One plane ride, and he was a very active boy on that.'\n\nLeavitt credits Trump for help in being able to handle motherhood and the Washington press corps, which can be an equally demanding creature.\n\nShe points out that the president has a history of hiring strong, working mothers - including Susie Wiles, 67, his chief of staff and the first woman to serve in that position. She has two daughters.\n\n'Being a working mother in this role would not be possible without President Trump and his encouragement,' Leavitt said. 'He has empowered so many working women.'\n\nIt runs in the family.\n\nTrump's First Lady Melania managed her own business ventures while raising their son Barron. First Daughter Ivanka Trump was a highly successful businesswoman as she raised her three children. Lara Trump, wife of the president's son Eric, has balanced a high-profile TV gig and two small kids. And youngest Trump daughter Tiffany, an attorney by trade, is about to become a first-time mom with husband Michael Boulos.\n\n'I wish her the best, and we'll be praying for her and Michael. They're an amazing couple, and they're gonna have a beautiful baby, and she'll be a great mom,' Leavitt said. \n\n'You know, look at the other women in President Trump's life, his daughters, his daughter, Ivanka, of course, is an amazing working woman. And Lara Trump is incredible. And of course, our beautiful First Lady, as the President said yesterday, has been a phenomenal mother to their son, Barron. And so great examples all around in the Trump family.'\n\nLeavitt hasn't paused in her upward trajectory since she went from being an intern in the first Trump administration, to working on Capitol Hill and on her own close - but ultimately failed - congressional campaign.\n\nShe joined the Trump team again during the 2024 presidential race, helping him win her home state of New Hampshire before taking on the role of national press secretary.\n\nLeavitt traveled across the country while pregnant and returned to work four days after giving birth to her son. \n\nShe and Nicholas Riccio married a few days before Trump was inaugurated and set up their new home in Washington D.C.\n\nBut her roots and her family are never far from her mind.\n\nBecause one other thing she'll be doing on Mother's Day is calling her own mom 'to tell her that I love her. In fact, I've been telling all of my staff today, as a mom, there's nothing better than feeling love from your child.'\n\n'So I told all of my staff that their weekend assignment is to call their moms and tell them how much they love them.","summary":"A first-time mom and President Trump's redoubtable White House press secretary, 27-year-old Karoline Leavitt makes both jobs look easy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14697057/Karoline-Leavitt-task-trump-sisterhood-interview.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/10/21/98236281-0-image-m-4_1746909588492.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/09/6828705774904324905/1024x576_MP4_6828705774904324905.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:22:19","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.539},{"id":320007826,"title":"Trump says US and China negotiated 'total reset' in Geneva talks - TradingView","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump hailed talks with China in Switzerland on Saturday, saying the two sides had negotiated \"a total reset ... in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\"\n\n \"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland.

Inside Mexico, the gulf remains the Gulf of Mexico, and outside of the two countries, users can see both names.\n\nStill, Sheinbaum argues the United States overstepped its authority by unilaterally changing the name of the international water.\n\nShe said Friday that the Trump administration is well within its right to rename its own territory, but maritime zones controlled by Mexico or Cuba cannot be relabeled by the US, the New York Times reports. \n\n'What we are saying is, \"Google, abide by what the US government has approved,' Sheinbaum told reporters as she announced the lawsuit, arguing that Trump's executive order applies only to the maritime regions controlled by the US.\n\n'We would have no business in telling them to rename a state, a mountain or a lake,' she added.\n\nThe US only controls about 46 percent of the Gulf, while Mexico has control over about 49 percent and Cuba controls about six percent, according to Sovereign Limits, a database on international borders.\n\nSheinbaum did not offer specifics about the lawsuit against the tech giant in her announcement Friday, but the New York Times reports that the suit was filed in a Mexican court in late March.\n\nIt came after Sheinbaum had warned Google that she was considering taking legal action over the name change - arguing that the term Gulf of Mexico has long been internationally recognized and accepted.\n\nIn return, Chris Turner, the vice president for government affairs and public policy at Google, sent a letter to Mexican authorities informing them that the change was in line with its 'longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,' after the name change was added to the Geographic Names Information System.\n\nThe very next day, though, Mexico's foreign ministry sent a letter back to Turner - saying that relabeling the entire gulf, even if it's just for American users, 'exceeds the powers of any national authority or private entity.'\n\nExecutives at Google have not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit, which comes as US lawmakers seek to codify the name change.\n\nA bill, spearheaded by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, to make the change permanent narrowly passed the House of Representatives on Thursday.\n\nIt now heads to the Senate, where it is unlikely to pass, according to MSNBC. \n\nStill, the name change appears to be of the utmost importance to President Trump, who reportedly hung a poster of the renamed body of water in the Oval Office and had hats made with its new name.\n\n'He literally keeps the map next to his desk,' Greene previously told the Daily Mail. \n\nShe then dared any GOP lawmaker to jump out of line and 'stand with Mexico,' even though some Republicans are reportedly upset over the measure. \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Google for comment.","summary":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum made a bold legal move as part of her effort to reclaim the 'Gulf of America.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14699227/Mexico-makes-shock-legal-effort-reclaim-Gulf-America.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/10/23/98257781-0-image-m-25_1746917854722.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/25/873708848619305310/1024x576_MP4_873708848619305310.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:20:06","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":320008270,"title":"How World Leaders Reacted To India-Pakistan Ceasefire Agreement Before Pakistan Allegedly Violates It","text":"India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire following intense military clashes, thanks to mediation by the United States. The announcement of the \"full and immediate ceasefire\" by US President Donald Trump on May 10 was welcomed by global leaders who praised the move as a critical step toward de-escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\nHowever, just hours after the deal was brokered, India accused Pakistan of violating the ceasefire agreement. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that the Indian armed forces had begun retaliating against what they described as \"repeated violations\" by Pakistan. Misri urged Pakistan to address the situation with seriousness and responsibility to ensure the agreement's success.\nGlobal Leaders Express Optimism\nDespite the accusations of breach, world leaders have expressed hope that this ceasefire could pave the way for long-lasting peace in the region. US President Trump hailed the agreement, congratulating both India and Pakistan for “using common sense and great intelligence” to end the hostilities.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance also commended both nations for their commitment to peace, with Vance shifting his earlier tone of indifference to praise the diplomatic efforts. Rubio highlighted Washington's intensive engagement in facilitating the deal, which included high-level talks with senior officials from both countries.\nThe United Nations and the European Union have joined in urging both countries to maintain calm and ensure that the ceasefire holds. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need for sustained dialogue, while EU Foreign Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the importance of compliance with the ceasefire.\nRegional Support for Diplomatic Resolution\nRegional leaders also expressed their support for the ceasefire. Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, lauded the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in agreeing to the ceasefire. Yunus reaffirmed Bangladesh's commitment to supporting peaceful resolutions between the two countries.\nSaudi Arabia also welcomed the ceasefire, voicing optimism about its potential to restore peace and security in the region. The Saudi Foreign Ministry called on both nations to prioritize dialogue and self-restraint as a means to resolve future disputes peacefully.\nThe Ceasefire Violation Allegations\nHowever, the positive developments were quickly overshadowed by accusations from India. Shortly after the ceasefire was announced, India accused Pakistan of violating the terms of the agreement, stating that there had been repeated breaches. The Indian government confirmed that its armed forces were retaliating against the violations. Misri urged Pakistan to take responsibility and prevent any further escalations.\nThe ceasefire agreement was reached after days of intense military exchanges, which had been triggered by a terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, resulting in the deaths of 26 civilians. India blamed cross-border terror networks for the attack and responded by carrying out strikes on terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir under Operation Sindoor.\nFuture of the Ceasefire and Diplomatic Efforts\nThe ceasefire, while a significant breakthrough, faces many challenges. Both India and Pakistan have a history of tensions, with numerous ceasefire violations over the years. The success of this agreement largely depends on the willingness of both countries to engage in sustained dialogue and diplomatic efforts.\nThe international community, including the United States, the United Nations, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, continues to urge both nations to uphold the ceasefire and work toward a more lasting peace agreement.\nAs the situation remains fluid, the international community is closely monitoring the developments. While the ceasefire has been hailed as a positive step, India’s accusations of Pakistan’s breach have cast a shadow over its long-term viability. The path to peace between India and Pakistan will require continued diplomacy, self-restraint, and a genuine commitment to resolving their differences peacefully.\nALSO READ: What Role Did The US Play In De-escalating The India-Pakistan Conflict?","summary":"India and Pakistan agree to a ceasefire after US mediation, but India accuses Pakistan of violating the deal, leading to concerns about the peace&#8217;s durability.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/how-world-leaders-reacted-to-india-pakistan-ceasefire-agreement-before-pakistan-allegedly-violates-it/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/India-Pakistan-Ceasefire.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:19:15","author":"Lavanya R","authors":["Lavanya R"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":320012784,"title":"Bill Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, losing Miss Maine fan vote to transgender competitor","text":"The 2025 Miss Maine pageant will feature Bill Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, looking to claim the crown after finishing as runner-up last year.

I had to do it for money.'\nThese were the chilling words of homeless drug addict Abdi when MailOnline visited a high street in Middlesbrough this week.\nWhether they were the shameless boasts of an attention seeker with an inflated ego or the brazen admission of a violent criminal is unclear. \nBut this fact is certain - Middlesbrough and the surrounding towns in the North East are fighting a horrifying knife and drug crisis. \nCleveland Police Force, which covers the areas of Redcar, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees, deals with the highest rates of crime rate in the country.\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released last year showed the force deals with 132.4 crimes per 1,000 people, compared to the average of 110.5 across England and Wales.\nViolent crime, specifically knife crime, as the region in a chokehold.\nLocals say it has become 'the norm' for children fresh out of primary school to carry blades on them.\nOne terrified local told MailOnline: 'It's constant. It's rife now this knife crime. You can't fight with them, they have to have a weapon.\n'There's no deterrent or anything like that.\n'The drugs are rife too. As soon as they get a slap on the wrist, they go out and do it again.\n'It's just a joke. They're laughing at the judges, and then they're out doing the same thing.'\n\nCleveland has one of the highest rates of knife crime in the country. Speaking to MailOnline this week, one man brazenly admitted that he has 'had' to stab people before\n\nPictured: A large knife previously seized by officers from Cleveland Police\n\nAnother blade also seized by Cleveland Police.

He says knife crime is so bad in the area that he has got to continuously look over his shoulder\nA study done by security experts 'Get Licensed' using the ONS figures found Cleveland to be battling the second-highest rate of serious knife crime, with only London in front.\nLast month, a knife was reportedly seized from an 11-year-old in Hartlepool.\nJust last week, in the early hours of Wednesday, a 17-year-old boy in Hemlington, Middlesbrough, was found fighting for his life after being stabbed. Two males, aged 17 and 18, were arrested in connection with attempted murder.\nAnd on Thursday, an 18-year-old in North Ormesby, also Middlesbrough, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting emergency workers, after two officers required hospital treatment having sustained arm and facial injuries.\nMailOnline visited the 'roughest' parts of Cleveland in a search to find out just how badly the community is being affected by violent crime.\nWhile speaking to a shopkeeper on Parliament Road, in the crime-ridden TS1 area of Middlesbrough, a customer came in looking for some crocs to buy.\nOverhearing our conversation with the workers at the store, the man, known as Abdi, chimed in: 'Everywhere in north-east is bad. I'm not being rude but they're all crack babies. \n'All these kids' mums and dads, they take heroin and crack, so the kids come out and they're all [makes a buzzing noise] and by the time they're 15 they're stabbing someone up.\n'Also around here you've got nowt to do. You sell drugs.\n'I know all the crackheads, I know everyone around here.\n'It's all the crack man. But forget going to that, what they give people in the chemists is the worst.\n'These tablets f*** the whole town.\n'That's heroin, f***ing everywhere that is. The opioid tablets, they're the worst, even I'm addicted to them.'\nBut what came next was shocking. \nThe 27-year-old admitted: 'On a bad day bro, I'll shank someone up.\n'I'm a good lad.\n'But I'll tell you I've had to stick it into some people man.\n'Even if they're nice.

I'm business-minded.\n\nPictured: Bags filled with drugs seized by Cleveland Police during a crackdown\n\nAt one store in the TS1 area of Middlesbrough, there are CCTV cameras installed in every corner of the shop, as the area is blighted by drugs, violence and shoplifting\n\nA recent study also found that Cleveland has the second worst levels of knife crime\n\nEight members of a 'highly organised' criminal gang were jailed last year after Cleveland Police launched an investigation into kidnap, drugs supply, and firearms offences spanning Cleveland, Merseyside, Manchester and Scotland\n'Right now I'm homeless. I got no help from the council right, so guess where I'm sleeping? Crack houses. \n'And guess what I got to do, a little something init. To stay afloat. \n'The council won't help me even though I've got sleep apnea, PTSD, severe depression.'\nAsked if he carried a knife to protect himself, he shrugged his shoulders as though obvious, responding 'of course'.\nHe told MailOnline that over the years it has become normality for people to carry knives on them.\nHe said: 'It's too normal. About five or six years ago, say 2019, you wouldn't see none of this man.'\nWhile Abdi was unphased about the repercussions of holding a blade, elsewhere in Cleveland, three miles west in Stockton-on-Tees, MailOnline spoke to a young father whose life has been forever changed by the impacts of knife crime.\nOn February 17, 2020, David Harmer and friend Taylor Black, 18, had got home at 8am after a night out.\n\nMr Harmer had seen Taylor Black, who was murdered aged 18, just hours before he was killed\n\nPictured: Mr Harmer and Taylor. The pair had met about five years prior to Taylor's murder and had just 'clicked' instantly\n\nPictured: Taylor. His mother Lindsey Allison has issued a desperate plea to youngsters to think twice before picking up a knife\n\nDrugs seized during a raid by Cleveland Police\nMr Harmer, now 26, had gone off to work shortly after, only to receive a call from Taylor's grandma crying down the phone.\nTaylor had been stabbed 64 times - including 40 times to the head. \nTalking about that moment Mr Hamer said: 'It was horrendous. The bit that struck me was the knife embedded in his skull.\n'It's just ruthless. That's what affected me the most, the manner in which he did it.\n'I was suffering from night terrors after, waking up in the middle of the night, that lasted a couple of years. I still get them sometimes.\n'That week that Taylor died, I think there were another six or seven people that had been stabbed, just around this area.\n'It's just mental. I've just seen this morning that a 17-year-old has been stabbed.\n'The knife crime is horrendous here, I've not seen anything like it.\n'You're on edge all the time walking down the street. You never ever know what people might do around here.\n'I've had knives pulled out on me, I've been threatened with knives.'\n\nMr Harmer has a four-year-old stepson and says he worries 'everyday' about the dangers of living in Cleveland\n\nPictured: Taylor with little brother Shae\n\nNorth Ormesby, in Middlesbrough, is known to be particularly hard-hit by drugs and crime\n\nOne store in Grangetown was seen with a bike lock used as a lock to secure the front of the store and with broken glass windows on either side\nMr Harmer raised money for the Chris Cave Foundation - which was started up by grieving mother Theresa Cave who also lost her son to knife crime - earlier this year.\nHe rode a motorbike from Redcar to Scafell Pike in the Lake District, before then hiking up Scafell Pike and placing a flag at the top which featured a collage of pictures of knife crime victims.\nOn the lasting impact Taylor's death has had five years later, he said: 'It's just crazy how many lives it can ruin.\n'It gives you chills just thinking about it.\n'You can't get away from it, and it's so easy to be pulled into it too. Drugs is massive too, and that'll be a factor in it as well.\n'I just don't understand why you would want to turn to knives and drugs and stuff like that.\n'In school we had a form group, and six of them were behind bars in jail by the time we left school.\n'If you're on the wrong path, that's it you're in trouble, they won't let you get out.'\nMr Harmer has a four-year-old stepson and worries everyday for when he grows up.\nHe said: 'It's everyday I worry. I definitely wouldn't want him to grow up in the areas where I was.\n'It's talking to him everyday, and when he gets older telling him that if anyone ever pulls a knife out on him not to try and stand and fight.\n'You've got no chance against a knife. No chance.'\n\nPictured: Taylor and his uncle Niki. Niki had killed himself five days into the trial of Taylor's killer after hearing the details of his death\n\nMs Allison warns youngsters that picking up a knife is 'final', and the act will impact several families for life\nTaylor's killer, Nathan Costello was sentenced to life in 2021 after what police described as a 'pre-planned' attack.\nCostello was previously known to the family and had been a former friend of Taylor's, having even babysat Taylor as a child.\nTaylor's uncle took his life after hearing about the details of his nephew's brutal murder.\nNow, Taylor's mum, who has lost both her son and her younger brother, keeps strong for her youngest boy, Shae.\nLooking up at a framed picture of her son and brother Niki, Lindsey Allison said: 'I'd spoken to Taylor on that morning at about 8.30am.\n'By 9.30am my brother phoned me and said Taylor has been stabbed.\n'I'd rushed to the scene, it was all cordoned off, and I just knew it. There were no ambulances, only police everywhere, and they took me to one side and told me Taylor had been killed.\n'It was awful. I was in shock for so long.\n'Taylor never got in trouble ever. If anyone tried to argue with him, he would walk away, he was that kind of kid.\n'He was at university doing computer science, he shouldn't have even been home that day, but he'd came home for the weekend just to see myself and his brother and his nan.\n\nMs Allison has a picture of brother Niki and son Taylor hung up in the centre of her living room\n\nPictured: Ms Allison with Taylor. She told of how Taylor would never get into any trouble and on the weekend of his death he had been visiting back home from university\n\nPictured: Ms Allison with Taylor and Shae. Ms Allison says Shae now suffers from separation anxiety as a result of his brother's brutal murder\n\nJonothan Grant (left) and Craig Perkins were jailed last year for 'flooding' Teesside with crack cocaine and heroin\n'Now my brother is dead too, my mum has PTSD and my little one Shae has separation anxiety, he can't be away from me.'\nSpeaking about how rife knife crime has become in the area, Ms Allison said: 'I don't know whether I'm more aware of it now because of what happened to Taylor, but you just seem to hear and see about stabbings every single day.\n'It's just so bad now. Maybe I just didn't realise before, but it feels like every time you check Facebook or open the paper it's literally there all the time now.\n'It's just like normality to the kids now to pick up a knife, it's like a fashion statement.\n'It's not even something they hide now.\n'You hear stories, and hear that kids as young as 12 are carrying them.'\nIn a desperate plea to youngsters to not carry knives, she said: 'It is final.\n'You can just stab somebody once and there's no safe place to be stabbed, none whatsoever, and it's the end of a life, end of their life, end of a family's life.\n'It literally effects everybody. It's just final isn't it, so think twice.\n'If it's something to do with a gang, just pull out of the gang and leave.'\nLast year, Stockton CID arrested the final member of a 'highly organised' criminal gang after a long running investigation into kidnap, drugs supply, and firearms offences spanning Cleveland, Merseyside, Manchester and Scotland.\nIn total, the eight-person gang were charged and either pleaded guilty or were convicted, with sentences ranging from four and a half years to 12 years and nine months.\nAnd in June last year, a gang involved in 'flooding Teesside with crack cocaine and heroin' were jailed.\nIt was found 23-year-old Jonothan Grant had been fundeding a lavish lifestyle spent on holidays, car rentals and hotel accommodation, through the supply of Class A drugs.\nHe had worked alongside his partner Nichola Vout and recruited associates Craig Perkins, Amanda Eddy and Naomi Richmond.\nOver in North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, a grandma told of how her teenage grandson was stabbed earlier this year.\nJust weeks later, another man was stabbed to death in the same street.\n\nDiane Morley told MailOnline her grandson had been stabbed earlier this year\n\nJust a month after Ms Morley's grandson was stabbed, 28-year-old father Jordan Hogg (pixtured) was killed on the same road in Hemlington, Middlesbrough\n\nOfficers standing by the scene of Jordan's death, as people laid floral tributes and balloons to the victim\n\nAs MailOnline was driving to Grangetown this week, there were police cordons around a holdall which is believed to have contained animal remains\nDiane Morley said: 'My grandson was stabbed in Hemlington in January.\n'In Fonteyn Court, just before that other lad was murdered.\n'My grandson is 17. And now there's been another 17-year-old stabbed in Hemlington this week.\n'I don't live here now. I wouldn't walk around here at night, it's frightening.'\nWhile it remains one of the biggest issues causing terror to residents in Cleveland, the force has said there has been a reduction in knife crime. \nLatest figures for 2024 show knife crime in young people across Teesside dropped by 12 per cent compared to the year before.\nThe force began running its 'Carrying a Blade Doesn't Give You an Edge' campaign in 2023, aimed at educating young people against picking up a blade.\n\nKnives seized by Cleveland Police in 2021\n\nEarlier this year, bags of suspected drugs and a bladed weapon were seized from a 17-year-old\nOperation Sceptre is also dedicated to keeping knives off the street - blades were linked to 503 reports of violence resulting in injury in the 12 months from October 2023 to 2024, with six deaths occurring as a result of knives in the same period.\nKnife surrender bins, or 'amnesty' bins are even placed at Cleveland's main police stations which gives people the opportunity to voluntarily give up their weapons.\nIn May last year, a week-long effort by police, more than 250 knives including zombie knives and axes were seized through both stop-and-searches and amnesty bins. \nPeter, of Middlesbrough, who asked for his face to be blurred out of fear for his life, told of how both he and his daughter are constantly the victims of attacks.\nHe spoke of an incident last year in which he was attacked by three teens with knives.\nHe told MailOnline: 'I got jumped by three young lads just round the back here.\n'One of them tried to take my phone off me, but I stood up for myself and then there were two more of them over my shoulder.\n'I wasn't well at all but I ended up fighting him off, kept putting him down, but then the other two went and got knives and tried to stab me up.\n'That was May last year. If I had that top on, it's got the slit marks here [points to his lower right torso] where they tried to stab me.\n'Kids have also tried to put the window through using knives and machetes.\n'You don't even feel like living the house now. I wasn't even going to walk up here, I usually come on my bike so I can get away and I've got a dog chain on me for protection.\n'And I wear this so they can't stab through it. It's not a stab proof vest but it'll stop it going through.\n'To be honest with you I've really been in the mindset that it's kill or be killed.'\nHe also told of how a lot of the crime is linked to drugs and that the area has a big cocaine problem.\n\nPeter Duffy told of an incident last year where he was 'jumped' by three teens, with the group attempting to stab him\n\nCleveland Police have said knife crime has reduced by 12 per cent in the 2024 year when compared with the year prior\n\nA cannabis farm discovered by Cleveland Police\nHe said: 'They're on crack. It's a really big problem around here. It's worse than cocaine and all.\n'It's just something you're craving, craving, craving, want, want, want, no matter how much you have.\n'And I don't bother with that. Never have.'\nCleveland Police told of how their initiative to tackle serious violence, Operation Deterrence, has been working to reduce such crimes in the police force area.\nAssistant chief constable Richard Baker said: 'Operation Deterrence is Cleveland Police’s ongoing pro-active approach to tackling serious violence, with officers from each district’s Proactive Team carrying out both uniformed and plain clothed patrols in areas identified as having high levels of violence. \n'Operation Deterrence has delivered a 30 per cent decrease in serious violence in hot spot areas. \n'Between 15th July 2024 and 30 April 2025, there were 292 serious violence offences in hot spot areas. This is a decrease of 126 offences when compared to the same period the previous year.\n'In addition, officers conduct stop and search patrols in those hot spot areas. These targeted stop searches have shown an increase in those arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article, with 156 arrests in 2024 -up from 140 in 2023. \n'This increase shows that we are targeting the right areas and the right people to remove knives and bladed weapons from the streets of Teesside.\n'The force also runs additional operations throughout the year to target those involved in violent crime, such as Operation Artemis which takes place every month, and Operation Sceptre - a national week of intensification which runs twice a year with a strong focus on engagement with young people and education in schools.\n\nCleveland Police run operations including Operation Deterrence and Operation Sceptre which are aimed at tackling knife crime\n\nParliament Road in Middlesbrough which is known for drugs and shoplifting. Many stores on the street had shutters up when MailOnline visited\n'Policing is only a part of the whole approach to tackling knife crime, and Cleveland Police works closely with partner agencies to drive down serious violence across Teesside.\n'In addition, we jointly delivered a first of its kind youth custody suite in Middlesbrough last year. The youth custody suite means a more appropriate environment is available for young people in custody, which in turn means we can better communicate with them... so the appropriate support can be provided to address their behaviour and tackle reoffending.'\nHead of CURV (Cleveland Unit for the Reduction of Violence), John Holden M.B.E, said: 'Cleveland Police and the Cleveland Unit for the Reduction of Violence (CURV) work collaboratively on a number of initiatives to tackle knife crime, including holding the first ever multi-agency knife crime summit in the area taking place in March this year which brought together front line responders tackling the issue and a number of subject matter experts.\n'We will continue with both enforcement and long-term prevention focused activity to address the issue of knife crime and the harmful impact it has on individuals and communities.\n'The Cleveland area faces challenges such as deprivation, substance misuse and domestic violence - all factors that have been proven to drive violent behaviour. But our partnership of local organisations strongly believes that violence does not have to be an inevitable outcome for young people growing up here.\n'In the last 12 months, CURV-funded interventions have engaged with over 9,500 young people under the age of 24 and a further 800 people over the age of 24, supporting them in making positive choices to reduce the risk of being drawn into violent crime.\n'These joint efforts have helped to reduce the number of young people aged 24 and under involved in knife crime reduce by 12% - from 305 offences between January and December in 2023 to 268 between January and December in 2024.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe towns becoming Britain's knife crime capitals: How schoolchildren as young as ELEVEN carry blades and drugs gangs hold streets in a chokehold\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

If Russia calls for such conditions, this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy,” the statement read.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that the US would take the lead in monitoring the proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions… prepared and coordinated, between Europeans and Americans,” should Russia violate the truce.\n\nMr Macron travelled to Kyiv with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\n“This is Europe stepping up, showing our solidarity with Ukraine,” Sir Keir said.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, “without preconditions”.Speaking to ...","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41629954.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9232/4616491_1_seoimage1x1_f8474929ae9d4aa7a2633544020bcb17.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:16:00","author":"Associated Press Reporters,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Associated Press Reporters","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":320011946,"title":"DHS Shares Insane Body Cam Footage Of Democrats Harassing ICE Agents In Newark","text":"The Department of Homeland Security exclusively shared video with Fox News depicting several Democrat politicians breaching the gates of a New Jersey detention center and harassing ICE agents.

Democrat Party Politicians Keep Hurting Themselves On Immigration After the Democrat Party disgraced itself yet again by storming the ICE facility in a very insurrection-y way, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the facility is holding several detainees that are \"murderers, terrorists, child rapists and MS-13 gang members.\" Sounds exactly like the type of people the modern political left views as their coalition. At this point, it's remarkable that the left is willing to destroy what's left of its political credibility over an issue that 70 percent to 80 percent of Americans agree. Violent criminals here illegally should be deported. MS-13 members here illegally should not be allowed to remain in the country. Those who belong to terrorist organizations here illegally should not be allowed to remain in the country. Of course, the left is using this to fundraise and claim abuse, though the video shows ICE agents remaining professional while they're \"abused\" by deranged politicians. This is what happens when you make the entire identity of a political party an opposition of whatever Donald Trump says or does. America wants him to control the border and rid the country of violent criminals. Overwhelming majorities agree. Democrats, though, have no choice but to act like entitled spoiled children, fighting to keep criminals here. Good luck to them.","summary":"The far left mayor of Newark and several other Democrat Party politicians are shown on an insane body cam video attacking ICE agents at a detention center.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/dhs-shares-insane-body-cam-footage-democrats-assaulting-ice-agents","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2213751713.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:15:26","author":"Ian Miller","authors":["Ian Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":320006746,"title":"Vance Must Have Missed Trump’s Memo on U.S. Involvement in India-Pakistan","text":"Vice President J.D. Vance is seriously struggling to stay in step with President Donald Trump‘s messaging.\n\nJust two days after Vance declared the India-Pakistan conflict “none of our business,” Trump swept in with a different message—announcing that the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between the two countries.\n\nVance had claimed during a Fox News interview Thursday that the U.S. wouldn’t play a major role in trying to stop the escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. \n\n“What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it,” Vance said, likely expecting to be in line with Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, Trump took to Truth Social to take credit for a ceasefire he said his administration had brokered. \n\n“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” he wrote. “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.” \n\nVance quickly posted on X, “Great work from the President’s team, especially Secretary Rubio. And my gratitude to the leaders of India and Pakistan for their hard work and willingness to engage in this ceasefire.” \n\nIn March, Vance was revealed to have questioned Trump’s foreign policy messaging behind the president’s back when his Signal messages were leaked. \n\n“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance texted other members of the Trump Cabinet. He said framing planned U.S. strikes on Houthi forces in Yemen as protecting European trade was a “mistake,” given that Trump had launched a trade war against Europe.\n\nContradicting Trump’s claims, India on Saturday said that the ceasefire with Pakistan was negotiated “directly between the two countries,” according to Rolling Stone. \n\nHowever, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did take to X late Saturday morning to “thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” and also expressed his gratitude toward Vance and Rubio. “Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,” Sharif said.\n\nRegardless of who brokered the deal, the truce didn’t hold. Within hours of the announcement, India’s foreign secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of breaking the ceasefire almost immediately, telling reporters there had been “repeated violations of the understanding arrived between the two countries today.”\n\nIn response, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said the country “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire” and accused India of violating the truce “in some areas,” according to CNN.\n\nTensions between the countries are at their highest levels in more than two decades after India hit Pakistan with missiles on Wednesday in retaliation for a terror attack on tourists in India-controlled Kashmir last month. The Kashmir region is divided between India and Pakistan, but both nations claim full sovereignty over it. \n\nTrump called the missile attack “a shame” and said he hoped it would “end quickly,” but it wasn’t until Friday that Vance reportedly called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to urge him to deescalate.","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesVice President J.D.

It was Kyiv. Nevertheless, we are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions.\n\n\"Despite everything, we offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.\n\n\"Let me remind you that as a result of these negotiations, a joint draft document was prepared, and it was initialled by the head of the Kyiv negotiating group, but at the insistence of the West, it was thrown into the trash.\" \n\nA smirking Putin, who has repeatedly bombarded civilians in Ukraine and was accused of breaking the VE three-day ceasefire, said Kyiv failed to respond to his peace proposals. \n\nHe said: \"Kyiv authorities have not responded to any of our ceasefire proposals.\" \n\nBut the tyrant has now agreed to hold direct talks with Kyiv. \n\nIt comes after Sir Keir Starmer joined leaders from France, Germany and Poland to issue a tough ultimatum to Russia as they visited war-torn Kyiv to mark the end of VE Day week.\n\nThe coalition of the willing group pushed Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire deal in just 24 hours. \n\nIf Moscow refuses, it will be hit with more crippling sanctions which targets their lucrative oil trade in a bid to grind down its wartime economy. Russia’s banking sector will also be targeted.\n\nCrucially, Donald Trump backed the plan - piling massive pressure on Putin to sign up to the peace deal or face America’s wrath.\n\nLast week, Washington announced it would no longer act as the mediator to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine after Putin refused to accept a full ceasefire.\n\nThe State Department said the country is changing “the methodology of how we contribute” to the talks and will no longer “fly around the world at the drop of a hat” for meetings.\n\n'BATTLE FOR PEACE' \n\nThe Sun on Sunday joined Sir Keir in Kyiv as he stood shoulder to shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky to challenge Mad Vlad to lay down his weapons and come to the negotiating table.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in the grounds of the Ukrainian Presidential Palace, Sir Keir said it is time to “win the battle for peace”.\n\nThe PM said: “All of us together with the US are calling Putin out.\n\nMilitary aid to Ukraine will again be ramped up so it will be armed to the teeth to take on the Red Army if Putin refuses to comply.\n\nSir Keir said there is “unity and strength” as around 30 countries across Europe and including Canada, America and Japan are signed up to the plan.\n\nBut Russian figures immediately hit back at the peace plan.\n\nDmitry Medvedev - the former leader of Russia - fumed online: \"Shove these plans into your pangender a****!\".\n\nThe three-day VE Day ceasefire that Putin announced has now ended, while the leaders are still in Kyiv.\n\nAnd Ukraine has accused Russia of already breaching the truce numerous times with bomb raids and gunfire.\n\nUS intelligence warned that Putin could plot a massive airstrike on Kyiv, where world leaders today gathered. \n\nAmerican officials felt pressed to issue a public warning, which read: “The US Embassy in Kyiv has received information concerning a potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days.\n\n“The Embassy, as always, recommends US citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.”\n\nA similar warning was issued on November 20 last year - one day before Russia struck Dnipro with an Oreshnik ballistic missile.\n\nIntelligence has revealed that Russia plans to close the airspace over its Kapustin Yar missile test site between 6am on Monday and 6:am on Tuesday.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14772947/putin-peace-talks-ukraine/","image":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-18vhuo091-1746918436745.jpg?1746922136&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 23:07:56","author":"Sayan Bose","authors":["Sayan Bose"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":320006666,"title":"India, Pakistan setuju laksana gencatan senjata lepas berbalas serangan","text":"NEW DELHI: India dan Pakistan bersetuju melaksanakan satu gencatan senjata pada Sabtu selepas tentera kedua-dua pihak saling berbalas serangan dalam beberapa hari kebelakangan ini.\n\nPresiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump mendedahkan bahawa kedua-dua negara bersetuju untuk melaksanakan 'gencatan senjata sepenuhnya serta-merta' hasil usaha perantaraan yang diketuai AS bagi menamatkan ketegangan.\n\nSetiausaha Negara AS Marco Rubio berkata beliau dan Naib Presiden JD Vance telah berhubung dengan pegawai kanan India dan Pakistan.\n\n\"AS menghubungi Perdana Menteri India, Narendra Modi;
