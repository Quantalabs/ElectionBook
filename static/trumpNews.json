They look fully valued.”\n\nThe monthly US consumer price index on Thursday highlights next week’s economic releases, with investors focused on signals from the inflation data about the prospects for interest rate cuts and the fallout from tariffs on prices. \n\nFollowing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks late last month that flagged rising risks to employment, markets have been widely expecting the central bank to lower rates for the first time in nine months at its September 16-17 meeting. \n\nFed Fund futures were baking in a 96 percent chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the meeting, LSEG data as of Thursday showed, so only a CPI number that comes in “egregiously higher” than estimates could dent assumptions of imminent monetary policy easing, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.\n\nAbout 58 basis points of easing, or slightly more than two standard cuts, are projected by December, according to the futures data.\n\nRecently, “the prospect of the Fed cutting has been the overwhelming factor driving equity sentiment to be more positive,” Miskin said. “And so if that reverses, then it could be problematic for equities.” Along with CPI, a Wednesday report on producer prices could also reveal impacts from import tariffs. Last month’s PPI data showed US producer prices increased by the most in three years in July as the costs of goods and services surged.\n\nTariffs and their implications for the economy were the main risk facing markets earlier this year, but other factors such as questions over Fed independence and caution about the artificial intelligence trade have been more prominent recently. The issue returned to the fore this week after a US appeals court ruled that most of President Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal. While the Trump administration since asked the US Supreme Court to hear a bid to preserve the sweeping tariffs, the ruling injected fresh uncertainty for markets.\n\n“It felt as though the fog of trade war was clearing, and now we’re just back into the thick of it,” Hogan said. “And that doesn’t help corporate America make decisions, consumers make decisions, and investors make decisions.”","summary":"NEW YORK: A spate of inflation data confronts US stock investors in the coming week as markets grapple with fresh uncertainty over tariffs and government bond yields, while equities hover at lofty valuations.\n\n\n\nThe benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a record high on Thursday despite an uneven start to September, which has been the worst month for stocks on average over the past 35 years.\n\n\n\n“September has been known to see a wearing down of the sentiment picture,” said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at Manulife John Hancock Investments.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he said, “stocks aren’t pricing in a lot of risks right now.

He added that he thought all the hostages would be returned, dead or alive. \"I think we're going to get them all.\" On Saturday, Israel's N12 News reported that Trump has put forth a new ceasefire proposal to Hamas.

Sports fan Trump has attended a series of glitzy sporting events since retaking office in January.He was booed at the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey but had a warmer reception at the Super Bowl and a number of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts, as well as the Daytona 500 NASCAR race.Trump says he also plans to attend the first day of golf's Ryder Cup later this month, and preparations are underway for him to host a UFC fight on the White House grounds.Trump has hailed the 2026 World Cup -- jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico -- and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles as part of what he claims is a \"Golden Age of America\" ushered in by his presidency.Both events were scheduled before he won reelection.The last sitting president to attend the tennis Grand Slam in New York -- and the first in history to go to the US Open -- was Democrat Bill Clinton, who watched the women's final in 2000.Trump was there as well and had a cordial meeting with Clinton, according to pictures from the encounter.Though Trump made his name in New York, he changed his residency during his first term from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.The 79-year-old has only intermittently returned to New York, but spent several weeks at his luxury Fifth Avenue condo last year while undergoing a historic criminal trial mid-campaign.He is expected back in the city to attend a baseball game on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, as well as to address the UN General Assembly on September 23.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump US Open 2025US Open men's finalJannik Sinner Carlos AlcarazTrump booed at US OpenRolex Trump US OpenTrump delayed US OpenTrump tennis match attendancesporting events attended by Trump\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

When the time comes, they will have a big say on who will be the next Labour leader – a fact that can't have escaped Streeting, who is currently the bookies' favourite.\n\nHowever, his support for Rayner was less conspicuous during Prime Minister's Questions last week.\n\nThe Health Secretary chose not to join her on the frontbench in a public act of solidarity, instead finding a discreet spot by the Speaker's Chair to observe proceedings.\n\nHe then sidled out after ten minutes, presumably to attend to his ambitions.\n\nMorgan's chutzpah is without peer\n\nWatch out Keir, Nigel and Kemi, there's another stellar name eyeing up No10.\n\n'I love New York,' said TV loud-mouth Piers Morgan in a new podcast. 'I always stay at The Carlyle Hotel [which] gave me a monogrammed pillowcase recently with 'PM' in gold lettering for my 25th stay. PM for PM!\n\n'Somebody said, 'What a slogan!' We've had Boris Johnson so, let's be honest, it couldn't be a lot worse, could it?' Err, yes it could.\n\nPrediction of the week: In his first email to supporters as the newly minted leader of the Greens, Zack Polanski – who has defended the right of 'poor people' to shoplift – failed to mention climate change. Or the environment. He preferred to bang on about the 'dangers' of Reform. I see trouble ahead for the eco mob.\n\nPresident Trump has got the measure of Lord Mandelson – dubbed the high priest of the dark art of political spin. In Mandy's role as ambassador to the US, I'm told The Donald has nicknamed the silken mandarin 'Sneaky Pete'. Enough said.\n\nFormer Tory MP-turned-writer Gyles Brandreth recalls a recent trip to the Caribbean with his wife Michele. 'Standing on the beach in Jamaica I saw a little bent old lady coming towards us. Then we realised it was Mick Jagger.'\n\nRayner's debt – to Mrs T!\n\nRayner wrote in her resignation letter: 'I would never have become deputy Prime Minister if not for the decisions taken by the last Labour government, giving me a council house to support me.'\n\nWhat she failed to mention was that is was under Margaret Thatcher's Right to Buy scheme – a benefit Rayner set about largely demolishing – that she was able to buy the house at a 25 per cent discount, which turned into a tax-free profit of £48,500 when she sold it.\n\nIdea of the week: Jeremy Corbyn's as-yet-unnamed political outfit has a new member: his brother, and inveterate conspiracy theorist, Piers. He says: 'I think it's a great idea. I have joined it. I last spoke to Jeremy a few days ago. It was about family matters but I was also urging him with his new party to campaign for the banning of vaccines and digital identities.'

Mike Rogers (R-MI), the Trump-endorsed Republican Senate candidate for Michigan, called for President Donald Trump to deploy the National Guard to Detroit to “give these neighborhoods back” to law-abiding citizens in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday.\n\nRogers, who announced his Senate campaign in April, told host Matthew Boyle that he demanded Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan request Trump’s Washington, DC, crime-busting strategy to come to his city. \n\n“What I basically said was, ‘Hey, Mr. Mayor, pick up the phone and call the president and request some backup. We’re the second most violent city in the country, behind Memphis,” the former congressman said. \n\nHe continued, “There’s a lot of neighborhoods in Detroit that just aren’t safe to be in, and it’s not fair to the people who are playing by the rules. You know, just because you’re poor or at the lower middle class does not mean you have to put up with crime in this way, at least in my mind.”\n\nAccording to Rogers, Duggan has been “trying to dispute the statistics” on the crime crisis plaguing the city, so he laid out the official crime reports live on the air. \n\n“You know, the mayor has been trying to dispute the statistics. Okay, well, they were given from Detroit to the FBI, and that’s where we got these statistics. And by the way, what it shows is that we’re about 536 percent higher on aggravated assault, 580 percent higher than the national average for murder, 180 percent for rape, 240 percent higher for robbery.”\n\nRogers then blasted one of his Democrat opponents, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), for her hypocrisy; she called on the National Guard to come into Chicago in 2016 after more than 60 people were shot over Independence Day weekend, but claimed that Rogers’ call for them to come to Detroit was “wrong.”\n\n“It is time to call in the National Guard. Enough is enough,” Stevens wrote on July 5, 2016, with a link to a USA Today article reporting the shootings:\n\nThe Democrat congresswoman contradicted herself in another post made last week, writing, “Mike Rogers just called to deploy the National Guard to Detroit. Was wrong in ‘67 and it’s wrong now.”\n\n“This is exactly why I introduced a bill to stop Trump’s abuse of power, because this chaos won’t stop in someone else’s community. It’ll come to ours unless we do something,” Stevens added:\n\nRogers told Boyle, “One of my potential opponents attacked me, saying this is a terrible idea, even though this particular candidate called for the National Guard to go into Chicago to fight violent crime in 2016.”\n\n“So, it has been an interesting journey here. But my whole thing is, listen — if we continue to do the same thing over and over and over, we’re going to get the same result, so fifth graders can figure this out,” he continued. “Well, you’ve got to break the cycle. And I think what you saw happen in Washington, DC, is breaking the cycle.”\n\nThe Senate hopeful added that a cycle break is needed in the education system as well, which he said is “sentencing” students to poverty by failing to teach them. \n\n“If I just look here in Michigan, the Democrats have failed Michigan, and they failed our kids … If you’re not reading by the fourth grade, you have a 70 percent chance of ending up in jail or on welfare,” Rogers said. “We have almost half of fourth graders in the state of Michigan can’t read at the fourth grade level, which means they’re headed for no place good, right?”\n\n“We’re sentencing them to poverty,” he argued.\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

He and Steve Bannon were each held in contempt of Congress and imprisoned for four months after the DOJ prosecuted them.Former Trump advisers Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino also were held in criminal contempt of Congress, but the DOJ didn't prosecute them.Navarro tried to appeal his case to the Supreme Court, but the justices declined to hear his case.The DOJ also dropped a case against Navarro, in which he is accused of using an unofficial email account for government work and wrongfully retaining presidential records during the first Trump administration.What To KnowNavarro has argued that his status as a senior presidential adviser to Trump during the first administration should have protected him from the contempt charges – mainly because the president had invoked executive privilege on the case, which Navarro believes made it impossible for him to testify before the committee.However, appeals courts determined that Navarro never invoked that privilege ahead of the contempt charge.The DOJ has said that it no longer stands behind the arguments that led to Navarro's conviction, but Navarro is keen to keep the department involved in order to determine \"the separation of powers this case presents.\"In a 13-page brief filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Navarro and his lawyers say the sudden reversal, for which the DOJ has only said it has \"determined it is not longer taking the same position as the prior administration\" on the case, is unacceptable.The filing asserts that the case has \"extraordinary constitutional implications\" about the separation of powers and whether a White House adviser can be criminally prosecuted for resisting congressional subpoena.\"The Department of Justice should not be allowed to disavow, without explanation or acknowledgment of its reasons, the positions it has pursued in this case for more than three years,\" the filing states.\"Without such an explanation, the Court and the Appellant are left to speculate whether the decision rests on principled legal grounds or on other, less appropriate, considerations,\" Navarro and his lawyers argue.\"For these reasons, the Court should deny the Department's motion to strike its brief unless and until it provides a full and particularized statement of its reasons for abandoning its previously held position,\" the filing continued.\"If the Court nevertheless grants the motion, it should first require the Department to set forth those reasons on the record before considering whether to appoint an amicus curiae as substitute counsel for the Department.\"What People Are SayingPeter Navarro in August wrote on X: \"U.S. v. Peter Navarro is a landmark case of first impression. At stake: executive privilege & the very doctrine of constitutional separation of powers. This is SCOTUS-level \"good law\" waiting to be settled. DOJ flipped position on Friday and it's HUGE -- Keep reading now!\"President Donald Trump posted this message on Truth Social in 2024 when nominating Navarro: \"I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American.

Their favorite target was Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the rapporteur of the case.\n\nBolsonaro is standing trial for allegedly leading a coup to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to Lula. He denies the charges and says he is being politically persecuted. \n\nA research group of Sao Paulo University said about 40,000 Bolsonarosupporters attended the protest in the metropolis, a similar figure to other demonstrations earlier this year.

A high-flier with top grades, exceptional SAT scores and a stellar extracurricular portfolio, he was working his way towards that coveted acceptance letter from Harvard.\n\nBut now, the 17-year-old has had a change of heart. Instead Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Michael sends off his applications this fall he will be looking south to Charlottesville and the University of Virginia.\n\nMichael, an American citizen who lives in Singapore, is part of a growing trend of talented students snubbing the politically-riven and left-leaning campuses of the northeast in favor of the more relaxed institutions of the south.\n\nThis southern swing is not new - in the last two decades the number of northerners going to southern universities has climbed by 84 percent, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Education Department data.\n\nBut in recent years the rate at which students are turning their backs on the institutions of the north has gathered pace. The data shows that schools in the south saw a 30 percent increase in applications between 2018 and 2022.\n\nNow, the Daily Mail has spoken with students, sociologists and college counselors about what lies behind this Ivy League exodus.\n\nFor students like Michael, applying to a southern college means breaking from family tradition and expectation. \n\nHe explained: 'My older brother is currently at Harvard. From what he has told me, the level of activism there can be overwhelming, and it has made his college experience more stressful than it should be. \n\n'He is even thinking about transferring, which made me realize it might not be worth it to put myself in that same situation.'\n\nHarvard has been rocked by protest since the October 7, 2023, attack, with Israel's offensive in Gaza sparking a series of pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nIn January 2024, then-university president Claudine Gay resigned amid criticism over her failure to call out antisemitism on campus. Students were named and shamed for their participation in protests.\n\nTrump threatened to freeze more than $2 billion in federal research grants after the university refused to comply with his administration's demands to limit activism on campus. Earlier this week a federal judge ruled that his move was illegal.\n\nBut for students eyeing their future alma mater, that decision makes little difference. The off-putting ugliness of the campuses' months of activism remains.\n\nHarvard is not alone. Columbia, in New York; Brown, in Rhode Island; Northwestern, in Chicago; the University of California in Los Angeles and University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have all been roiled by protest.\n\nBut Harvard is the only institution to have earned the dubious distinction of having been ranked the worst in the nation for free speech by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).\n\nThe school, a perennial lightning rod, came last in FIRE's annual list of 251 colleges. With a score of 0.00 out of a possible 100.00, Harvard was the only university deemed to have an 'abysmal' climate for free speech.\n\nMeanwhile UVA, a top contender for Michael, is ranked the most relaxed and tolerant. He likes that.\n\n'Seeing how activism has affected my brother's day-to-day life really made me think twice,' he said.\n\n'He was even blocked from entering his dorm room at one point due to the protests. I want to be in an environment where I can focus on my academics, build strong relationships, and prepare for my career without the constant distraction of campus politics.'\n\nChristopher Rim, a tutor who charges $120,000 to guide wealthy students through the rigors of applications, said his clients were, 'paying attention to what is happening on campus and in the news,' and choosing carefully.\n\n'Applications are submitted a year before enrolment, so most students cast a wide net of 15 to 20 schools to have options once decisions come in,' he said. 'Families want to secure admissions offers first and then weigh the political and social climate when choosing where to enroll.'\n\nHe said there is a growing number of families who are, 'uneasy about the perception of activist culture and the political spotlight on schools like Harvard and Columbia.'\n\nProfessor Neil Gross, a sociologist at Colby College in Maine, who researches higher education agreed: 'I do think that politics is part of the story of college selection now, more than it was a generation ago.'\n\nThe appeal of better weather, cheaper living costs and the rising academic reputation of some Southern universities all play a part but, he said, it's the 'fraught' political climate seen in Ivy League campuses of the north that is really fueling the 'general flow toward the South.'\n\nHe said: 'Students are taking politics into account in their college choices in ways that are relatively new.\n\n'Some are trying to get away from politicized schools. Others are trying to get out of states where they disagree with the politics.'\n\nDr Rachel Rubin, who got her own doctorate from Harvard before founding Massachusetts-based tutoring company Spark Admissions, agreed that an increasing number of talented students are shunning the elite colleges of the northeast in favor of more relaxed campuses in the South, Texas and Florida.\n\nThe University of Miami, where Lauren Sanchez 19-year-old son Evan started last month, and where Donald Trump Jr's daughter Kai's will enroll next year, had a record number of applicants for is fall 2025 admissions.\n\nWith 58,139 applicants – an 8 percent increase from last year - the school admitted just 17 percent.\n\nVanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, also set a record for applications: Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter Apple was among the mere 4.7 percent of students accepted this year.\n\nDuke University, in Durham, North Carolina, also saw its applications up 10 percent year-on-year, pushing their acceptance rate below 5 percent for the first time in their history.\n\nCost is less of a factor than many imagine: one year at Harvard costs $86,926, according to the university's estimate - but is free for students whose families earn less than $100,000. Tuition, food, housing, health insurance and travel costs are all covered.\n\nA year at Duke, meanwhile, costs $94,217, while Vanderbilt checks in at $94,274. The University of Miami is an eye-watering $98,118.\n\nRubin said those swerving the northeast fall into three categories: 'Students who are a little bit more apolitical; those who don't agree with a particular politics on many of the Ivy League campuses; or those who maybe would like a slightly more conservative bent to their campus.'\n\nSome students were also alarmed about potential cuts to funding, she said - particularly those who feared their professors may have their labs shut down.\n\nTo those students, southern universities more in step with the current administration feel 'more stable.'\n\nParents too have voiced concerns, and, in Rubin's experience, the predominant one is the presence of antisemitism on campus – sadly not a new phenomenon, she admitted, but one clearly on the rise.\n\nShe said: 'The only time it's really the parents [who intervene] are when it's Jewish students and the parents are concerned that their students might feel unsafe or encounter antisemitism.\n\n'Of course, antisemitism is obviously not new on these campuses, but I think that the degree has increased significantly, and I think there's just much more tension to it.\n\n'And so, students are really rethinking because of that.'\n\nGrace, a 17-year-old at high school in upstate New York, told the Daily Mail that her academically-gifted Jewish friends were veering away from Columbia for that very reason.\n\nShe herself is hoping to go to Vanderbilt; Tulane University, in New Orleans; or the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nShe said: 'When I'm older I will obviously vote, but while at college I don't really want to be into activism and protests.'\n\nRight now, she said, 'The northeast is a bit bleak.' And as far as she and those like her are concerned, 'The South is just more fun.","summary":"Michael was in no doubt about his university of choice.

But our job is to decide these legal questions.\n\n'We're trying to get the law right.' \n\nThe Supreme Court has allowed Trump's most controversial policies - including routine deportations and mass layoffs of the federal workforce - to temporarily proceed amid mounting lawsuits in lesser courts.\n\nBut Barrett doesn't necessarily see this as a shift to the right, arguing politics is not relevant for her when she makes a decision.\n\nInstead, she said she approaches each case with an open mind, relying on briefs, oral arguments, her law clerks and colleagues to form her opinion.\n\n'At any step of that process, I might change my mind from my initial reaction,' she said. 'In fact, I often do.' \n\nFor that reason, Barrett refused to be drawn on generic questions about the constitutional limitations of some of Trump's policies.\n\nOn tariffs, she said: 'That one actually is pending in the courts, and we may well (dare I say likely will) see that case. \n\n'I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can honestly say. You know, stay tuned. If that case comes before us, and after I dive in and read all the relevant authorities, then I'll draw a conclusion.' \n\nShe said weighing in on Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Democrat-led cities to reel in crime, or on his tariff regime, would actions be 'the opposite of the judicial rule.' \n\nOn August 26, when challenged about his use of the National Guard, Trump sensationally said: 'Not that I don't have - I would - the right to do anything I want to do.\n\n'I'm the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger - and it is in danger in these cities - I can do it.'\n\nBarrett was also confronted with the ramifications of her crucial vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending nearly 50 years of precedent which constitutionally enshrined a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nCBS said it was just one example proving Barrett, a 53-year-old mother-of-seven, had become 'the most influential justice' on the court.\n\nLast month, former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned the Supreme Court could 'do to gay marriage what they did to abortion.' \n\n'American voters, and to some extent the American media, don't understand how many years the Republicans have been working in order to get us to this point,' she said.\n\n'It took 50 years to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court will hear a case about gay marriage... they will send it back to the states.'\n\n'Anybody in a committed relationship out there in the LGBTQ community, you ought to consider getting married because I don't think they'll undo existing marriages, but I fear they will undo the national right.'\n\nBut Barrett dismissed Clinton's fears, insisting she and her colleagues 'have to tune those things out' to get on with their jobs.\n\nShe also noted that the rights to marry, use birth control and raise children are 'fundamental' and part of 'our doctrine.' \n\nBarrett enjoyed a meteoric rise in 2020 after Trump chose her to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nAt the time, she had been a long time law professor in Indiana, but she had caught Trump's eye several years prior during her time on the 7th Circuit.\n\nIn that position, she took conservative stances on hot-button conservative issues like abortion and gun control.","summary":"The Trump-appointed Justice rubbished claims the Supreme Court has given the president untapped power in his quest to expel illegal immigrants and reshape the federal workforce.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15075315/amy-coney-barrett-scotus-trump-clinton.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/07/23/101924415-0-image-m-19_1757285854761.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 23:45:39","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":358355626,"title":"South Korea to fly detained workers back as U.S. vows more raids on employers","text":"South Korea is moving to pick up Korean workers following a raid at a Hyundai Motor manufacturing facility in the U.S. state of Georgia last week, a presidential official for Seoul said on Sunday as the Trump administration promised more raids on businesses.\n\nThe negotiations to release about 300 South Koreans who were detained have concluded and processing for their release from custody is ongoing, South Korea's presidential office said late on Sunday.\n\nA chartered plane will be flown to bring them back as soon as the processing by the two countries is complete, the office said in a statement.

This comes as Trump’s health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has started to restrict certain vaccinations. The poll was conducted before Kennedy faced opposition from both Democratic and some Republican senators during a heated congressional hearing regarding vaccine accessibility last week.\n\nThe survey reveals that just over four in ten people, or 43%, approve of Trump’s job performance, which is consistent with his approval rating in June, while 57% disapprove. Trump’s lowest ratings are on economic issues, with only 39% approving of his approach to inflation and 41% satisfied with his management of trade and tariffs.\n\nTrump receives higher approval for his immigration policies. The poll used slightly different questions for different respondent groups. Those questioned about Trump’s management of “border security and immigration” offered him a 47% approval rating.\n\nHowever, when asked about Trump’s handling of “deportations and border security” in light of his administration’s rigorous deportation policies, he received a somewhat lower approval rating of 43%.\n\nAs redistricting fight spreads, most Americans oppose political parties drawing election lines\n\nPolitical leaders are swiftly working on redistricting strategies in several states to influence the 2026 midterm elections. Nevertheless, a vast majority of U.S. adults, including those in crucial states like Texas and California, oppose the idea of political parties having control over the redrawing of congressional maps.\n\nThe findings in the latest NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey were gathered amid Texas Republicans’ successful effort to redraw their congressional map for 2026 to boost GOP chances of keeping the U.S. House majority next year. That move, at Trump’s urging, set off an arms race of mid-decade redistricting that now includes efforts by California Democrats and Republicans in other states.\n\nNationwide, over 8 in 10 (82%) prefer that nonpartisan commissions draw congressional districts rather than the party in power in each state.\n\nHyundai workers will be flown back to South Korea after massive raid\n\nWorkers detained during a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia will be returned to their home country on a chartered flight, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung’s office has said. \n\nFederal and immigration agents arrested 475 people Thursday — most of them South Korean nationals — and executed a judicial search warrant as part of a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment at the facility.\n\nThe raid came just 11 days after a summit between Trump and Lee at the White House, where South Korean firms pledged $150 billion in U.S. investments. It has strained ties with South Korea, a key U.S. ally and the world’s 10th-largest economy.\n\n“Negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded,” a South Korean presidential spokesperson announced Sunday. “Once the procedures are complete, the chartered plane will depart to bring our citizens.”\n\nTrump’s presence causes a delay at the U.S. Open men’s final\n\nTrump’s arrival at the U.S. Open men’s singles final appeared to delay entry for spectators, resulting in long lines of frustrated fans and empty seats in sprawling Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nThe match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz kicked off at 2:30 p.m. ET, half an hour later than scheduled, because of “security measures in place” and to “ensure that fans have additional time to get to their seats,” the U.S. Open wrote on X.\n\nTrump walked around to wave to the crowd around 1:45 p.m. as the stadium was just about 10% full and was met with a wave of mixed cheers and boos. He then took his seat at the Rolex box at midcourt.\n\nWhat he witnessed was a return to form for Alcaraz, who beat Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 for his second trophy at Flushing Meadows and his sixth overall at a major.\n\nSabalenka repeats: Aryna Sabalenka beat American Amanda Anisimova to repeat as the women’s champion, making her the first woman to win the tournament in consecutive years since Serena Williams more than a decade ago.\n\nMeet the Press\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is “confident” the Supreme Court will overturn an appeals court decision that found Trump’s far-reaching tariffs were unlawful.\n\nHe told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump, “there are numerous other avenues that we can take” to continue to impose tariffs.\n\nBut those other avenues, Bessent added, would “diminish President Trump’s negotiating position.”\n\nStill, he largely defended Trump’s agenda, telling Welker earlier in the program that tariffs are not a tax on the American people and pointing to other markers of success in the economy.\n\nWhite House aides have been exploring backup plans on tariffs for many months, because some White House officials anticipated the possibility that courts would intervene to stop the tariffs, according to two people familiar with the internal discussions. \n\nMeanwhile, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said on the show that he was ruling out a presidential run in 2028.\n\nAsked by Welker whether he had ruled out running, Moore confirmed that he had and later reiterated his interest in serving another term.\n\n“Our population is growing, Maryland is moving, and so I’m really excited about going back in front of the people of my state and asking for another term,” Moore said.\n\nPolitics in brief\n\nChicago threats: Trump seemed to threaten to unleash the rebranded Department of War on the country’s third-largest city, posting what appeared to be an artificial intelligence-created image of himself in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters, flames and the phrase “Chipocalypse Now.”\nDelaware donations: Former President Joe Biden has decided to build his presidential library in his home state, Delaware, and has tapped a group of former aides, friends and political allies to begin the heavy lift of fundraising and finding a site for the museum and archive.\nTag team: Progressive heavyweights Zohran Mamdani and Bernie Sanders rallied New Yorkers at an iteration of the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, where both levied attacks at Trump.\n\nFate of thousands of kidnapped Ukrainian children hangs in the balance of peace talks\n\nArmed with machine guns, balaclava-clad Russian soldiers burst into 16-year-old Vladislav Rudenko’s home in southern Ukraine, forced him to get into a car and drove away “in an unknown direction.” \n\nVlad is one of thousands of children kidnapped by Russia as part of a systematic relocation and re-education campaign, in which young Ukrainians are sometimes forcibly adopted or sent to military training camps.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly raised the issue of the “abducted children” as a top priority, including in a meeting with Trump and several European leaders last month. The International Criminal Court has also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of the war crime and issued a warrant for his arrest in 2023. \n\nMykola Kuleba, the founder of Save Ukraine, a leading nonprofit humanitarian organization supporting people trying to secure the return of their children from Russia, insisted world leaders’ “focus must remain on children, not just land.” But as ceasefire talks stall, the fate of those kidnapped hangs in the balance.\n\nAaron Rodgers turns back the clock in Week 1\n\nLast spring, Aaron Rodgers took months to decide whether and where he would play during the 2025 NFL season.\n\nThen the season began Sunday.

Trump: Rebuilding America’s Infrastructure.” It is not an isolated case. Similar signage has appeared on bridge replacements in Maryland, rail yard upgrades in Philadelphia, and tunnel projects along Amtrak’s busy Baltimore–Washington corridor, according to Amtrak spokesman W. Kyle Anderson. The irony is striking: these projects are financed by a law Trump once branded “a loser for the USA.” The Law Trump Opposed The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, IIJA) was passed in 2021, allocating $1.2 trillion to roads, bridges, rail, climate resilience, and broadband expansion. It marked Biden’s most significant legislative achievement in his first term, after Trump’s repeated but failed promises of an “Infrastructure Week.” By late 2024, the Biden White House reported that nearly $600 billion had been committed to over 72,000 projects across the country. Trump, who left office before the law’s passage, railed against it in speeches, warning Republicans it would damage the country and threatening political reprisals for those who voted in favour. Fact Check: Trump’s Executive Order Paused Funds Trump’s record since returning to office in 2025 further undermines his claims. On his first day back, he signed an executive order directing agencies to pause disbursements under the IIJA and Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the pause as necessary to counter a “radical social and environmental agenda.” The pause threw state budgets into confusion. Jim Tymon of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials clarified that while not all IIJA funds were frozen, key initiatives like Biden’s $7.5 billion EV charging programme were stalled, leaving projects vulnerable to delays. Adie Tomer of Brookings Metro warned that even temporary halts imposed “real costs” on local governments. In other words: the very projects Trump now claims credit for, his administration actively tried to slow down. Criticism of Credit-Grabbing Lawmakers have condemned the move. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon argued that “the law is very clear that he has to do what has been passed by Congress. He is not a king.” Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Trump of trying to “illegally withhold” funds and usurp Congress’s authority over spending. Beyond legality, critics argue the signs amount to political gaslighting—branding Biden’s legislative success as Trump’s achievement. “This is history being rewritten in real time,” said Adie Tomer of Brookings Metro. A Familiar Strategy The tactic is consistent with Trump’s political style. In his first term, he frequently took credit for policies initiated by prior administrations, from economic trends to veterans’ reforms. Branding infrastructure with his name fits that pattern, reinforcing an image of achievement regardless of legislative authorship. Yet for many voters, the facts remain clear: the IIJA was Biden’s signature bipartisan victory, passed over Trump’s objections. The signs now plastered across the country may carry Trump’s name, but the funding behind them comes from Biden’s law.

This is my last warning, there will not be another one! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"Although, Trump’s social media post did not detail the conditions, but Israel’s Channel 12 reported the plan envisions all hostages being freed on the first day of a truce, with broader talks to follow. In exchange, Israel would release Palestinian prisoners and halt its advance into Gaza City. Negotiations would take place under Trump’s direct oversight, with the ceasefire holding as long as talks continued, Times of Israel reported. Israel has not confirmed its acceptance, but a source close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government is “very seriously considering” the proposal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Israel to back the deal, calling it a potential “breakthrough.”'Ready to immediately sit at the negotiating table': HamasAfter the “last warning,” Hamas responded with a guarded statement, saying it “is ready to immediately sit at the negotiating table to discuss the release of all prisoners in exchange for a clear declaration to end the war, a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and creation of a committee of independent Palestinians to run the Gaza Strip.”“Hamas welcomes any move that helps the efforts to stop the aggression against our people,” Times of Israel quotes statement, affirming that it received “some ideas from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire.”Hamas says it is in “constant contact with the mediators to turn these ideas into a comprehensive agreement that meets our demands.” Opposition leader Yair Lapid accused Netanyahu’s government of stalling negotiations despite mediators’ efforts, warning, “There is a hostage deal on the table. It can be done, it must be done.” The reported framework comes as international pressure mounts against Israel’s Gaza City offensive, with critics warning it imperils both hostages and soldiers. The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 64,000 people in Gaza, according to Hamas-run authorities, and over 460 Israeli soldiers.","summary":"Donald Trump claimed Israel accepted his ceasefire and hostage release proposal, issuing Hamas a final ultimatum to agree to terms for ending the Gaza war.

He hopped between parties, voted irregularly, and never truly committed to a single ideology. No surprise, then, that Americans weren’t sure what box to put him in.\n\nFour years in the White House changed that. And since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has doubled down on a hard-right agenda—rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people, cutting deals that benefit the wealthy, dismantling DEI initiatives, and pushing policies that are both anti-democratic and anti-Democratic. Whatever ambiguity existed a decade ago is long gone.\n\nRelated | Trump's just fine with queer kids killing themselves\n\nAnd yet, a sizable share of Republicans still see Trump very differently. A late August YouGov poll shows just how off the mark GOP voters are about his record. According to the survey, 35% of Republicans think Trump supports raising the minimum wage, 45% believe he backs stronger worker protections, 26% say he favors higher corporate taxes, and just 29% think he’d raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nIn reality, Trump’s record runs the other way. His administration moved to strip minimum wage and overtime protections from 3.7 million home-care and domestic workers. He killed a plan to stop employers from paying disabled workers less than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. And his sweeping tax and budget plan—officially called the The One Big Beautiful Bill Act—is expected to deliver the largest transfer of wealth from working-class Americans to the ultrawealthy in U.S. history. \n\nThe disconnect is striking. Democrats and independents are much more accurate in gauging Trump’s positions. The same YouGov poll found only 9% of Democrats and 17% of independents believe Trump supports stronger worker protections. Just 10% of Democrats and 18% of independents think he favors raising the minimum wage.\n\nIn other words, Democrats and independents generally see Trump for who he is. Republicans, not so much.\n\nSo why the misperception? Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said it comes down to polarization and “expressive bias.” \n\n“I imagine what’s happening among many Republicans is that they start with the notion that they are supporters of Trump,” Reeher told Daily Kos. “Then, when they are asked what he wants to do in those specific policy areas, they choose what they would like to see happen, and assume that’s also what Trump wants to do, because they support Trump.” \n\nThat’s the polarization effect at work.\n\nExpressive bias takes it further. Popular policies—like raising the minimum wage or taxing corporations—are often attributed to Trump by Republicans who want to reinforce their support. \n\n“Some of them may recognize that raising the minimum wage, improving worker conditions, and raising the tax on corporations are popular positions, and then assert that Trump wants to do those things—again because they support Trump and want to show that support, rather than stating that Trump wants to do something less popular,” Reeher said.\n\nReeher added that some Republicans may be connecting dots that don’t actually line up. For example, seeing Trump’s tough talk on immigration or manufacturing as proof that he wants to raise wages.\n\n“Some voters seem to translate Trump’s rhetoric into policies he doesn’t actually support—like assuming support for blue-collar workers means raising the minimum wage, or that calling out corporations means taxing them,” Reeher said.\n\nRelated | Trump’s tariffs hit his blue-collar backers where it hurts\n\nThis isn’t entirely new. Democrats were privately fuming about it during the 2024 campaign. A New York Times/Siena College survey that September found just under one-in-three (32%) likely voters thought Trump was “too conservative,” compared with 47% who said former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was “too liberal.” It was a striking data point, one that helped reinforce the narrative that Trump was a more moderate option than Harris—even as his actual record said otherwise.\n\nWe saw shades of the same phenomenon in 2021, when millions of Americans insisted the 2020 election was “stolen.” For many, the claim was less about genuine belief in voter fraud and more about signaling allegiance to Trump. \n\nAs Reeher put it, this kind of bias isn’t necessarily about facts—it’s about expressing loyalty.\n\nFraming matters too. People like the idea of “worker protections” in theory, but they may not connect that principle to actual policies. Moves like weakening OSHA rules, loosening child labor restrictions, or undermining wage standards don’t sound like “pro-worker” positions when spelled out plainly. It’s easier for supporters to say Trump is “for workers” in the abstract, even when his policies cut against them in practice. \n\nBy contrast, Democrats’ policy positions are far less muddled in the public mind. The same YouGov survey found adults across the political spectrum generally understood where Democrats stand: 86% of Democrats, 65% of independents, and 63% of Republicans knew that Democrats want to increase the minimum wage. Similar majorities across partisan groups also knew Democrats want to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Even if voters don’t always like Democrats’ positions, they tend to know what they are.\n\nThat’s what makes Republicans’ perception of Trump so revealing. If GOP voters truly believe he’s more liberal than he is, it suggests two things: Either Republicans want policies like higher wages and stronger worker protections but don’t realize Trump opposes them, or they don’t know enough about his record to notice the gap between rhetoric and reality.\n\n“Many polls over recent decades have suggested that the public is generally supportive of more liberal policies when those policies are described in objective ways,” Reeher said. “Whether that means Republicans should adopt those policies is a more complicated question—historically, they have been arguing for a more conservative approach.”\n\nThe bigger issue here is a lack of political literacy. Most voters don’t follow the fine print of economic or labor policy closely enough to see where the parties really split. That gap makes it easy for misperceptions to take hold—and for partisan loyalty and Trump’s branding to fill in the blanks. \n\nJohn Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told Daily Kos that with unions representing just 6% of private-sector workers, very few Americans hear consistently pro-worker messaging outside of partisan politics. Into that void, Trump has filled the space with performative stunts that sound worker-friendly. But when it comes to actual policy, his record tells a different story. \n\n“Most people have very limited information about policies, particularly in areas that don’t affect them,” Hansen said. “Partisans tend to fall back on party talking points when they don’t know or care much. How else did a chest-thumping party of Russia haters come to champion Putin as America’s best friend?”\n\nIn the end, the polling says less about Trump’s policies than about how voters see themselves reflected in him. What this survey and other surveys suggest is that Trump supporters project their own preferences onto him—even when those preferences are at odds with his actual record. That gap between perception and reality isn’t just a quirk of polling—it’s a feature of today’s politics: Facts often take a back seat to identity.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Fresh polling from the Wall Street Journal–NORC shows Americans sinking deeper into economic gloom. Only 25% say they have a good chance of improving their standard of living—the lowest share since the survey began in 1987. Nearly eight in 10 (78%) doubt the next generation will be better off, and close to 70% say the American dream either never existed or no longer does, the most skepticism recorded in 15 years. The discontent cuts broadly across gender, age, education, and income. Still, the outlook isn’t entirely bleak. Forty-four percent now describe the economy as excellent or good, an uptick from 38% a year ago. Yet most adults—56%—continue to rate conditions as poor, underscoring how Trump’s economic policies are weighing on public sentiment.\n\n Over the holiday weekend, rumors circulated that Trump had died—claims the president himself said earlier this week he had heard nothing about. While Trump remains very much alive, his health has come under scrutiny after he was seen with bruising on the back of his right hand and swelling around his ankles. Ongoing questions about his age and fitness have led some voters to wonder if he’s fully capable of handling the job as president. A YouGov poll found that 59% of adults believe Trump’s health and age affect his ability to do the job, at least somewhat, while about a quarter (26%) say it hasn’t affected him at all. As expected, opinions vary sharply along party lines, with Republicans much less likely to see an impact. Still, if a transition were necessary, most GOP voters trust Vice President JD Vance: 75% of Republicans told YouGov that he is qualified to take over, compared with just 10% of Democrats.\n\n Trump and his allies have been blunt about wanting women—especially white women—to have more kids. And new Gallup polling shows that even with falling birth rates, Americans still like the idea of bigger families. A plurality now says the “ideal” family size is two or three children—down from three or four back in 1935—but the point is clear: People still want families, despite Republican talking points suggesting otherwise.\n\nAs of midday Friday, 44.3% of the Americans approved of Trump, while 51.3% disapproved—a net approval rating of -6.9 points, after rounding, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling average.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nBack in June 2015, it wasn’t easy to pin down President Donald Trump’s politics. \n\n\n\nThe celebrity businessman spent most of his public life discussing money, rather than policy.

The Spanish sensation triumphed over his Italian adversary in four sets, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. Alcaraz now boasts six Grand Slam trophies at just 22 years of age. He's reached this landmark younger than fellow Spaniard Rafa Nadal, with only Bjorn Borg managing the achievement at an earlier age. The triumph sees Alcaraz reclaim his position at the summit of the world rankings. This marked the third occasion this year that he and Sinner had clashed in a Grand Slam final, though Sinner was scarcely given a look-in as his rival took control. Alcaraz stormed ahead early, claiming the opening set whilst some spectators were still queuing to enter the Arthur Ashe Stadium due to security delays surrounding Donald Trump's attendance. Sinner fought back to secure the second set, but from that point onwards it belonged entirely to Alcaraz. Sinner rescued two match points in the fourth set, recovering from 40-15 behind to reach deuce. However, Alcaraz seized his third opportunity without hesitation, wrapping up a commanding triumph, reports the Mirror . The set he surrendered to Sinner in the final was his sole dropped set throughout the entire tournament, underlining his exceptional form. \"I've never seen Alcaraz serve like that,\" former British No. 1 Tim Henman remarked during Sky Sports' coverage. \"You think about the great servers in the game, and I now have to put Alcaraz in that category. \"Against one of the great returners, Alcaraz's serve was absolutely phenomenal. He was able to hit his spots with such pace and consistency. \"He gave Sinner so few opportunities to get into those service games, and it gave Alcaraz the opportunity to play with even more freedom, unleashing. You can see the joy of that performance. It was complete.\" Defeated finalist Sinner was gracious in defeat, saying: \"Carlos and his whole team are doing amazing, and I know there was a lot of hard work behind this performance today and it was better than me so congratulations, it's a great moment for you, \"I tried my best today and I couldn't do more. The fans here are amazing, seeing packed stadiums. This place is so, so special.\" The champion also praised his vanquished rival, with Alcaraz commenting: \"It's unbelievable what Jannik has done throughout the whole season, a great level in every tournament, \"I see you more than my family! It's great to share the court, locker room and everything with you, watching you improve. \"This tournament is incredible and it's a privilege to be a part of it.

Israel [is] aiming to force Palestinians to the southern areas using these explosions, but everyone knows that there is no safe place in the south or any humanitarian zone,” Shawa said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that the army was “eliminating terrorist infrastructure and nefarious terrorist high-rises”, a talking point that Israel often repeats as it obliterates civilian infrastructure in Gaza.\n\nThe Al-Ruya attack follows an earlier one on the Al Jazeera Club in central Gaza City, where tents housing displaced families were also hit.\n\nIt comes after Israel targeted the 15-storey Soussi Tower on Saturday and the 12-storey Mushtaha Tower on Friday. Several Palestinians sheltering in tent encampments around those towers were wounded.\n\nIsraeli escalation in Gaza City\n\nIsrael’s security cabinet approved a plan for the military occupation of Gaza City in August, a move Netanyahu suggested had already led to the displacement of 100,000 Palestinians.\n\nAs Israel pushes to displace residents of Gaza City to the south of the enclave, Palestinians have been saying that nowhere is safe in the territory.\n\nGaza’s Ministry of Interior issued a statement on Sunday warning Palestinians in Gaza City not to trust Israel’s claim that it had set up a humanitarian zone in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis.\n\n“We call on citizens in Gaza City to beware of the occupation’s deceitful claims about the existence of a humanitarian safe zone in the south of the Strip,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli army had designated al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone” early on in its campaign against Gaza. Since then, it has been bombed repeatedly.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported that “every five to 10 minutes, you can hear the sounds of explosions from all directions in Gaza City”, including heavy bombing in the Sabra and Zeitoun neighbourhoods.\n\n“Israeli forces are using remotely controlled explosive robots, and detonating them in residential streets, destroying neighbourhoods,” he said. In Sheikh Radwan, Mahmoud added, homes, public facilities, schools and a mosque had been hit.\n\nEmergency services reported that at least six people were killed and several others were wounded in an air raid on the Shati area in northwestern Gaza City.\n\nAn Israeli drone attack also killed two people and injured many more in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.\n\nMedical sources said at least 65 Palestinians were killed across Gaza on Sunday.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed at least 64,368 Palestinians and wounded 162,776 since October 2023, according to Gaza’s health authorities. Thousands more remain buried under the rubble as famine continues to spread across the enclave.\n\nAcademics, United Nations experts and leading rights groups have described the horrific Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a genocide.\n\nLater on Sunday, United States President Donald Trump suggested that he put forward a new proposal to end the war in Gaza, calling it a “final warning” for Hamas.\n\nThe Palestinian group acknowledged receiving “ideas” from the US, saying that it welcomes any efforts to reach a lasting ceasefire.","summary":"Hundreds of families lose their shelters as Israeli attacks kill at least 65 Palestinians across besieged Gaza.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/7/israel-intensifies-gaza-city-destruction-bombs-another-high-rise-tower?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap_68bdfae482cf4-1757280996.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:49:55","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":358347324,"title":"Alcaraz outshines Sinner to claim second U.S. Open title","text":"Carlos Alcaraz ended the reign of Jannik Sinner with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win to claim the U.S. Open title on Sunday (September 7, 2025) and tighten his grip on the era-defining rivalry between the torch-bearers of the men’s game. \n\nIn a perfect echo of the triumph that first propelled him to the number one spot in 2022, Alcaraz’s second New York title lifted him back to the top of the world rankings as the 22-year-old Spaniard displaced Sinner and took his Grand Slam trophy haul to six. \n\nAs grey clouds hovered over the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium, Alcaraz continued to deliver the sunshine tennis that has lit up Flushing Meadows over the last fortnight, consolidating an early break by faking a drop to hit a winner that wrong-footed Sinner. \n\nHe beamed after pulling off an outrageous half-volley at the net and wrapped up the opening set shortly afterwards, finishing it off with a big serve that Sinner crashed into the net as the Italian’s metronomic precision briefly deserted him. \n\nWith U.S. President Donald Trump watching from a luxury box in the stands and adding another layer of spectacle to the third straight Grand Slam final between the duo this year, Sinner hit back to take the next set after saving an early break point.\n\nAfter missing a few steps to drop his first set of the championship, Alcaraz blasted his way to a 5-0 advantage in the third set before Sinner got on the board, and the Spaniard closed it out with a monster serve. \n\nSinner conjured up two breathtaking volleys in the opening game of the fourth set to roaring applause and held serve after being pushed to the limit again, but he cracked under pressure and handed the crucial break to Alcaraz in the fifth game. \n\nResembling a flamingo in full flight in his bright pink vest, Alcaraz soared ahead to secure the victory on his third match point and celebrated by raising his fists before a warm embrace with his rival and wild celebrations with his team.","summary":"After missing a few steps to drop his first set of the championship, Alcaraz blasted his way to a 5-0 advantage in the third set before Sinner got on the board, and the Spaniard closed it out with a monster serve","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/alcaraz-outshines-sinner-to-claim-second-us-open-title/article70023875.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/lq3n4s/article70023882.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-07T220924Z_846022670_UP1EL971OZ9ON_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-USOPEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:45:04","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.038},{"id":358354276,"title":"U.S. Open: Carlos Alcaraz tops Jannik Sinner in 4 sets, wins 6th Grand Slam title","text":"NEW YORK — Carlos Alcaraz reasserted his superiority over Jannik Sinner with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory Sunday in the U.S. Open final for his second trophy at Flushing Meadows and sixth overall at a major. This was the third Grand Slam tournament in a row where these elite, young rivals met to decide the champion.\n\nThe match’s start was delayed for about a half-hour while thousands of fans were stuck outside Arthur Ashe Stadium while going through extra security, because President Donald Trump sat in a sponsor’s suite. Perhaps the extra wait got the No. 1-seeded Sinner, who was the defending champion.\n\nRight from the beginning, under a closed roof because of rain earlier in the day, No. 2 Alcaraz outplayed Sinner, reversing the result from when they played for Wimbledon’s title less than two months ago.\n\nAlcaraz’s leads over Sinner are now 10-5 in their head-to-head series, 6-4 in major trophies, and 2-1 in U.S. Open championships. Plus, this 2-hour, 42-minute win allowed Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, to take away the No. 1 ranking from Sinner, a 24-year-old from Italy.\n\nThis hard-court matchup followed Alcaraz’s victory over Sinner after erasing a trio of match points on the French Open’s red clay in June, and Sinner’s victory over Alcaraz on Wimbledon’s grass in July.\n\n“I’m seeing you more than my family,” Alcaraz joked, eliciting a grin from Sinner. “It’s great to share the court, to share the locker rooms, everything.”\n\nSunday’s showdown represented the first time in tennis history that the same two men played each other in three consecutive Slam finals within a single season.\n\n“You were better than me,” Sinner told Alcaraz. “I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more.”\n\nTruth is, these two guys are so, so much better than the rest of men’s tennis at the moment. Their traits are unique, their strengths multiple, their games untouchable at the moment.\n\nExcept, of course, against the other.\n\nThey have combined to collect the past eight Slam trophies and 10 of 13. Novak Djokovic, whom Alcaraz eliminated on Friday, took the other three in that span.\n\nBoth Sinner, who had won his past 27 hard-court matches at majors, and Alcaraz offered glimpses of why they are so good, although it was rare that both were at their best simultaneously.\n\nAlcaraz, who ended up with twice as many winners, 42-21, was superb in the first, third and fourth sets; Sinner’s top efforts arrived in the second.\n\nSince the start of the 2024 U.S. Open, Sinner had won 33 of 34 matches at the majors; Sunday was his fifth straight final at those events. The loss? To Alcaraz at Roland-Garros.\n\nIndeed, over the last two seasons, Sinner is now 1-7 against Alcaraz — and 109-4 against everyone else.\n\nAlcaraz, meanwhile, has won 37 of 38 contests since May. The loss? To Sinner at the All England Club, Alcaraz’s lone defeat in a Slam final.\n\nIn 2025, Alcaraz now has more titles (a tour-leading seven) than losses (his record is 61-6, also the best in men’s tennis).\n\nDuring his defeat at Wimbledon, Alcaraz was caught by a camera telling his team in Spanish: “From the back of the court, he’s much better than me.”\n\nPerhaps that’s why Alcaraz was aggressive Sunday with his sledgehammer of a forehand — and on-target, too. Whenever even the smallest opening presented itself, Alcaraz tried to barge on through with that shot, going big early in points, which worked, either for an outright winner or forcing mistakes from Sinner.\n\nSinner had dropped a total of just one service game in his three matches leading into the final, but he did deal with an abdominal muscle issue in his semifinal. Sinner and one of his coaches said it was nothing serious, which might be right, but Alcaraz broke right away Sunday and five times in all.\n\nTo counteract the forehand effectiveness, Sinner made a tactical switch, going increasingly after Alcaraz’s backhand when possible.\n\nPaid off. Briefly.\n\nIn the first set and third set, Alcaraz’s ratios were 11 winners to two unforced errors. Truly remarkable. In the second, those numbers swung the other way: five winners, 11 unforced errors.\n\nAn hour and 20 minutes in, it was a set apiece, after Alcaraz ceded one for the first time all tournament, allowing Neale Fraser to retain his distinction as the most recent man to win every set he played at the event — in 1960.\n\nAs Sinner worked his way into things, he would celebrate points by pumping a fist toward the box where his coaches and others, including Olympic champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn, were seated.\n\nAh, but it was Alcaraz who seemed to have more ticket-buyers on his side.\n\nThey regaled him with standing ovations. For one particularly magical volley at a hard-to-believe angle struck just before the ball hit the court — even Alcaraz himself liked that one, saying “Wow!” and breaking into a wide grin. For one special overhead smash to a corner with the tailing movement of a firefly.\n\nSinner, needless to say, wasn’t as pleased by those sorts of strokes.\n\nHe bounced his racket off the ground and caught it after one lost point. He exhaled and shook his head after another.\n\nSinner simply doesn’t see that sort of stuff from anyone else.","summary":"Alcaraz reclaimed the No. 1 ranking with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory, improving to 10-5 against Sinner and winning his second title at Flushing Meadows.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/07/u-s-open-carlos-alcaraz-tops-jannik-sinner-in-4-sets-wins-6th-grand-slam-title/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25250802407960.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:44:06","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":358350606,"title":"Trump walks back Chicago 'war' threat, but vows to 'clean up' cities","text":"President Trump says he doesn't intend to \"go to war\" with American cities but is vowing to \"clean them up\" in his latest comments on an apparent plan to send National Guard troops to U.S. metropolitan areas to help fight crime or assist with deportations of suspected undocumented immigrants.\n\nTrump was asked Sunday whether he was threatening war with Chicago following a post on his website Truth Social one day earlier.\n\n\"We're not going to war. We're going to clean up our cities,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday as he left the White House. \"We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war, that's common sense.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump posted online that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\" (Last week Trump signed an order renaming the Defense Department, though Congress would have to officially change its title.)\n\nThe social media post featured references to the 1979 Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now as well as an image of Trump made up to look like a character from the movie, Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore.\n\nIn response to the post, Illinois' Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, wrote on X that Trump was \"threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal.\" Pritzker added: \"Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, said Trump's threats were \"beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution.\"\n\nFor the past several weeks, Trump and other administration officials have suggested that Trump could send National Guard members to Chicago. Trump has claimed that Chicago needs federal help to combat crime, even though the mayor says that homicides, shootings, robberies and carjackings are all declining. Guard members may also be used to assist federal officers carrying out ramped-up deportations and immigration raids.\n\nTrump has also threatened to send troops to Baltimore and New Orleans in recent days, cities where crime is also down. Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans are all heavily Democratic.\n\nTrump's intention to send National Guard troops to American cities that didn't request them has also faced court challenges. Last week a federal judge ruled that Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles in June was illegal and violated the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nIn August, Trump asserted federal control over the Washington, D.C., police force and deployed the National Guard to city streets over the objections of some local leaders. Due to its unique status, the federal government has greater authority over the nation's capital than other American cities.\n\nIn Chicago, opponents of Trump's plan to deploy the National Guard made themselves heard over the weekend.\n\nMarchers filled the streets of downtown Chicago Saturday evening, passing by Trump Tower and chanting slogans such as, \"No hate.

Serving with pace and precision, he allowed Sinner to win only three receiving points.\n\nBut Alcaraz's propensity to dip more than Sinner appeared in the second set.\n\nSinner raised the stakes, hitting his trademark ferocious groundstrokes and pushing Alcaraz back with an improved return of serve, ultimately levelling the match after decisively breaking in the fourth game.\n\nThe touchpaper had been lit - and thankfully, Ashe was now pretty much full to witness it.\n\nLike the Wimbledon final eight weeks earlier, a delicately poised match after two sets quickly turned one-sided.\n\nAlcaraz broke early in the third by again taking time away from Sinner, rediscovering his first serve and touch at the net, before cruising a double break ahead as his artistry shone through.\n\nSinner, who had struggled with an abdominal issue in his semi-final, continued to make uncharacteristic errors in the fourth set.\n\nAfter losing serve for the fifth time in the match, he did not seriously threaten to break back before Alcaraz served out victory.\n\n\"I tried my best today - I couldn't do more,\" Sinner said.","summary":"Carlos Alcaraz triumphed in the latest chapter of his compelling rivalry with Jannik Sinner, earning a four-set victory to regain the US Open title.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/alcaraz-edges-sinner-trilogy-to-win-us-open/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-518.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:39:32","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 39pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 39pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.104},{"id":358347328,"title":"Trump attends U.S. Open as Rolex's guest despite Swiss tariffs","text":"President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open on Sunday (September 7, 2025) and briefly stepped out from a luxury box to wave at a main court crowd mostly still arriving for the men’s final. He drew mixed cheers and boos.\n\nArthur Ashe stadium was only partially full, and Mr. Trump’s waves weren’t announced beforehand. They were also brief enough so that some of those in attendance didn’t notice them. \n\nThe President attended as a guest of Rolex despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker’s home country, and organisers were seeking to keep booing of him from being seen on the TV broadcast. \n\nMr. Trump has built the bulk of his second term’s domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate. \n\nBecause of extra security screening, the final between second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and No. 1 seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, 24, of Italy, was pushed back half an hour — meaning Mr. Trump arrived more than 45 minutes before the new start time. \n\nThe President was watching from Rolex’s suite, and his acceptance of Rolex’s invitation came mere weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products. \n\nThe levy is more than 2 1/2 times higher than the one the Mr. Trump administration agreed to for European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S. It has raised questions about Switzerland’s ability to compete with the 27-member bloc that it neighbours. \n\nThe White House declined to comment on Mr. Trump accepting a corporate client’s invitation at the tournament, but the President has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business. \n\nThat includes tirelessly promoting cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties around the country and the world that bear his name. He announced on Friday (September 5, 2025) that the U.S. will use its turn hosting the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 to stage the sweeping event at Trump National Doral in South Florida. \n\nAny negative reaction to Mr. Trump’s presence won’t be shown on ABC’s national telecast, per standard policy, the U.S. Tennis Association says. “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organisation said in a statement. \n\nAs heavy rains began mostly clearing, and throngs of fans arrived for the match, no major street protests against the president could be seen from the tournament’s main stadium. Attendees also steered clear of wearing any of the president’s signature “Make America Great Again” caps, though. \n\nA 58-year tennis fan originally from Turin, Italy, came from her home in the Boston area to watch the final and said that when she bought a U.S. Open cap, she went with a fuchsia-hued one so it wouldn’t be mistaken for the signature darker colour of MAGA hats. “I was careful not to get the red one,” said the fan, who declined to give her name because of her employer’s rules about being publicly quoted. \n\nAttending with Mr. Trump were White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special administration envoy Steve Witkoff and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. \n\nElsewhere in the crowd were a slew of celebrities — some of whom publicly backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s election against Mr. Trump. Among them were Pink, Bruce Springsteen, Shonda Rhimes, Michael J. Fox, Sting, Shaggy, Ben Stiller and Courtney Cox. \n\nMr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One during the flight to New York to note that the plane would be flying over Ashe stadium but didn’t offer any further comment. \n\nMr. Trump was once a U.S. Open mainstay but hasn’t attended since he was loudly booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign. \n\nThe Mr. Trump Organisation once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the stadium’s television broadcasting booth, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Mr. Trump’s first term. The family business is now being run by Mr. Trump’s sons with their father back in the White House. \n\nMr. Trump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in the suite’s balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena’s video screens. \n\nIn recent years, however, including between his presidential terms, Mr. Trump primarily lived at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. \n\nAlcaraz said before the final that having Mr. Trump on-hand would be a privilege and “great for tennis,” but also suggested that such sentiment went for any president watching from the stands. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it,” he said. \n\nThe President has also frequently attended sporting events — where the roar of the crowd sometimes features people booing him while others cheer him. \n\nSince returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday’s (September 7, 2025) U.S. Open swing, Mr. Trump went to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. \n\nHaving a sitting president attend the U.S. Open hasn’t happened since Bill Clinton went to the 2000 tournament, though former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended the event’s opening night in 2023.","summary":"The President was watching from Rolex’s suite, and his acceptance of Rolex’s invitation came mere weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-attends-us-open-as-rolexs-guest-despite-swiss-tariffs/article70023870.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/bykq3o/article70023873.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-07T214923Z_549807563_UP1EL971O9GNA_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-USOPEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:34:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.022},{"id":358352062,"title":"Alcaraz beats Sinner to lift US Open 2025 trophy as Trump watches on","text":"Carlos Alcaraz pulled off a calm yet ferocious performance to end his great rival Jannik Sinner’s reign and win the US Open men’s singles final in four sets in front of a sellout crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City.\n\nAlcaraz claimed his second US Open title with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win on Sunday as United States President Donald Trump watched along with his entourage. Trump’s presence delayed the match start time due to the extensive security checks for the spectators.\n\nIn a perfect echo of the triumph that first propelled him to the number one spot in 2022, Alcaraz’s second New York title lifted him back to the top of the world rankings, as the 22-year-old Spaniard displaced Sinner and took his Grand Slam trophy haul to six.\n\n“I want to start with Jannik. It’s unbelievable what you’re doing the whole season; great level during every tournament that you’re playing… I’m seeing you more than my family,” said Alcaraz, who took his win-loss record with Sinner to 10-5.\n\n“It’s great to share a court, to share the locker room, to share everything with you.\n\n“I’m just really proud about the people I have around. Every achievement I’m having is because of you, thanks to you… This one is yours.”\n\nAs grey clouds hovered over the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium, Alcaraz continued to deliver the sunshine tennis that has lit up Flushing Meadows over the last two weeks, consolidating an early break by faking a drop to hit a winner that wrong-footed Sinner.\n\nHe beamed after pulling off an outrageous half-volley at the net, and wrapped up the opening set shortly afterwards, finishing it off with a big serve, which Sinner crashed into the net as the Italian’s metronomic precision briefly deserted him. But Sinner hit back to take the next set after saving an early break point.\n\nIt was the third straight Grand Slam final between the duo this year.\n\nAfter missing a few steps to drop his first set of the championship, Alcaraz blasted his way to a 5-0 advantage in the third set before Sinner got on the board, and the Spaniard closed it out with a monster serve.\n\nSinner conjured up two breathtaking volleys in the opening game of the fourth set to roaring applause and held serve after being pushed to the limit again. But he cracked under the pressure and handed the crucial break to Alcaraz in the fifth game.\n\nResembling a flamingo in full flight in his bright pink vest, Alcaraz soared ahead to secure the victory on his third match point, and celebrated by raising his fists before a warm embrace with his rival and wild celebrations with his team.\n\nA dejected Sinner was left to contemplate another Grand Slam final loss to Alcaraz this season after coming up short in their French Open epic in June. Although, he beat the Spaniard to take his Wimbledon crown the following month.\n\n“A lot of big stages and matches we played this season,” Sinner said, after quickly composing himself.\n\n“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more.”","summary":"Alcaraz returns to number one spot after winning his sixth Grand Slam title and second of 2025 in four sets in New York.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/9/7/alcaraz-beats-sinner-to-lift-us-open-2025-as-trump-watches-on?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFP__20250907__73PK9VC__v1__HighRes__TennisUsaOpen-1-1757283369.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:32:35","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.129},{"id":358345486,"title":"Sergio Garcia joins $156M-worth Steph Curry & other sports icons to witness the US Open finals","text":"Sergio Garcia was among several big names spotted at Arthur Ashe Stadium for Sunday’s US Open men’s singles final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in New York.

The contest carried extra stakes, with Carlos Alcaraz leading Sinner 9-5 in their ATP singles head-to-head and the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings on the line.Sergio Garcia’s appearance comes just days after he pulled out of the Irish Open, admitting he wasn’t in the right frame of mind following his omission from Luke Donald’s European Ryder Cup team. The all-time Ryder Cup points leader with 28.5, Garcia last featured at Whistling Straits in 2021, where he delivered three points from four matches despite Europe’s heavy defeat.He had hoped to make his 11th appearance in the biennial event but was overlooked as Donald chose Jon Rahm, Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Aberg, Sepp Straka, and Matt Fitzpatrick to join the six automatic qualifiers, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, Robert MacIntyre, Tyrrell Hatton, and Rasmus Hojgaard.Sergio Garcia cheers on Carlos Alcaraz at the US OpenSergio Garcia was in the stands at Arthur Ashe Stadium with his wife, Angela Akins Garcia, during the US Open semifinals, showing his support for Carlos Alcaraz.

Although this one was not as reality-bending as the one they played at the French Open, the duo showed off some quality hitting and athleticism before Alcaraz prevailed on Arthur Ashe Stadium.In the end, it was a straight-forward 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win for the Spaniard, who also managed to take off the World No. 1 crown from the Italian. Alcaraz now has six Majors to his name, compared to Sinner's four.After the win, the presentation ceremony was highly-anticipated for two interesting reasons. One was the format, especially after the women's final between Aryna Sabalenka and Amanda Anisimova ended in a controversial interview-style format with Mary Carillo taking over the microphone.On Sunday, thankfully, no such mishap occured again. This time, it was former World No. 1 Jim Courier who did the speaking, keeping it as minimal as possible. The American introduced both players and let them speak what they wanted, only looping back in to introduce the check and trophy presenters to Alcaraz and Sinner once they were done.To their credit, both players kept their speeches fairly short -- dedicating a small message to their opponent, their family, the fans in New York who supported them for 15 days, and then to the staff at the US Open for keeping the event going smoothly.\"Hello everyone. First of all I’d like to start with Carlos and his whole team. You’re doing amazing. Congrats. I know it’s a lot of hard work behind this performance today. You were better than me. Congrats. Enjoy it. It’s a great moment,” Jannik Sinner spoke first.“[To] my team, thank you for supporting me and understanding me. For working hard. We all know how much dedication we put in to be here. It’s been an incredible season. A lot of big stages and matches we’ve played throughout the season. I’m super happy to share this moment with you, my family who’s at home, all the people I love, my friends. I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,\" he added.Carlos Alcaraz, who spoke for a bit longer, made a small joke about seeing Sinner 'more than his own family' and then dedicated a long message to his team and family, some of whom were at the stadium and some of whom were back home in Spain.\"To my team and family, I’m lucky to have you guys. Honored to be honest. The hard work you do to make me even better. Not only in the professional part, but also the personal part as well. I’m really proud about the people I have around. Thank you very much. Every achievement I have is because of you,\" Carlos Alcaraz said.\"This one is also yours. I’m really lucky to have part of my family here. My brother, uncle, father, mother.. my little brothers are at home watching as well. The support I’m receiving from you is great,\" he added.Another detail many would have been waiting for was to see whether either Alcaraz or Sinner acknowledged the presence of President Donald Trump at the stadium.Trump was returning to the US Open after 10 years, and his increased security ended up delaying the final by 30 minutes as fans had to wait in long queues after he entered first. Unsurprisingly, neither player mentioned Trump in their speech.Carlos Alcaraz has tied Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg in Grand Slams2025 US Open - Day 15 - Source: GettyWith his sixth Grand Slam title coming at the US Open, Carlos Alcaraz has tied Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg in Grand Slam titles won.

Bruce Springsteen, Lindsey Vonn, Anna Wintour and Stephen Curry were just some of the athletes and celebrities who were in the stands of Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens. They have been some of biggest critics of the president outside of the politics world. Springsteen, while over in Europe in June, called Trump and his administration \"treasonous.\" He urged his fans in Germany to stand up with him against \"authoritarianism.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"The America that I love, the America that I sung to you about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,\" he told the crowd during his set. Vonn, who won a gold medal in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, said in 2017 that she wouldn’t be representing Trump at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea. \"Well I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the president,\" she said in 2017.

She criticized his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Wintour appeared to be averse to having first lady Melania Trump on the cover of the fashion magazine after her husband became president. Curry had a high-profile social media feud with Trump. Curry suggested he didn’t want to go to the White House to celebrate the 2016-17 NBA championship. Trump withdrew the invitation. The Golden State Warriors star went further in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2022. \"Most of his rhetoric — before he was president, during his four years, and even now, if he tries to run again — has a tone of divisiveness that doesn’t have a place in our country,\" Curry told the magazine. \"As serious and loud as the threat is of him or whoever else is running for office, there’s a similar urgency and a loudness that’s necessary on the other side.\" Trump entered the stadium less than an hour before the match started. He was greeted with cheers as initially came into the venue. During the national anthem, the president received some applause and boos when he appeared on the videoboard.

Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Myanmar’s military chief Min Aung Hlaing, Nepal’s Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the Maldives’ President Mohamed Muizzu are among other leaders who attended. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn also attended the Summit.\n\nThe SCO began in 1996 as a security bloc, dubbed the “Shanghai Five”. It was formed by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to settle their border disputes following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in June 2001, the group evolved into the SCO, including Uzbekistan, with headquarters in Beijing. In 2017, the group expanded to include India and Pakistan. Iran in 2023 and Belarus in 2024 were also added as full members.\n\nIn addition, the organization has 14 key dialogue partners, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkiye, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. SCO member states account for 43 percent of the world’s population, and 23 percent – or almost a quarter – of the global economy. This year’s SCO summit was held under the growing shadow of war in Ukraine, Israel’s brutal onslaught in Ghaza, Security dangers between India and Pakistan, fears in the Asia Pacific region and the mysterious trade war antics of the US President Donald Trump. The world community is in a sort of a deep flux and China and Russia will make a case that the world is now entering an era of multi polarity and they will suggest indivisible security as the way to move forward.Two days after the SCO summit ends Beijing on September 3, hosted a major military parade to commemorate the end of World War II in Asia. Many of the leaders arriving for the SCO summit – such as Putin, Lukashenko and Subianto stayed on for the parade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is also expected to travel to Beijing for the event, which will also be “a big part of this optic” of Xi hosting world leaders.\n\nThe SCO summit in China took place in an era of great regional expectations and the SCO is now being reshaped by Beijing and Moscow into a more pragmatic development organization.\n\nAt the conclusion of the summit the Chinese leadership announced the establishment of a development bank and pledged new soft loans for development in future ventures by the member countries. Developing countries including Pakistan are in desperate need of funding for their development projects and this new initiative of the SCO will go a long way in helping the works of development and now the SO will not be concerned with only security but will play a major role in development activities in the member states. The Indian PM Modi and the Pakistani PM Shahbaz Sharif both made their ideas clear in their speeches. Modi came to China for the first time after the border standoff with China in 2020 and now spoke of terrorism without naming Pakistan directly and made a veiled reference to the Chinese initiative of CPEC running through Gilgit Baltistan.\n\nShehbaz Sharif spoke eloquently about Territorial integrity, mutual development and cooperation with China in industry, technology and agriculture and his speech did manage to cancel out the Indian hue and cry and place Pakistan as an important partner in the development plans of the SCO and the Chinese initiative of CPEC. The Pakistani PM made it clear in all his meetings even after the summit that Pakistan has now entered the Second Phase of CPEC which will mean not only roads and highways but also power plants, industrial zones, skill developments and innovative plans. Pakistan now will be an important partner in the future evolution of the SCO both leaders, in their own way, acknowledged the same reality: the SCO is drifting away from its early identity as a security platform and becoming a forum where development, connectivity and financial support take center stage.\n\nChina during the summit also proposed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), another important public good that China has shared with the world to promote building a more just and reasonable global governance system.The GGI marks the fourth landmark global initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping over the past several years, following the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.”I look forward to working with all countries for a more just and equitable global governance system and advancing toward a community with a shared future for humanity,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said upon putting forward the proposal during the “Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Plus” Meeting.Xi highlighted five principles of the GGI: adhering to sovereign equality, abiding by international rule of law, practicing multilateralism, advocating the people- centered approach, and focusing on taking real actions. “All countries, regardless of size, strength and wealth, are equal participants, decision-makers and beneficiaries in global governance,” he noted.\n\nHighlighting that the SCO has increasingly become a catalyst for the development and reform of the global governance system, Xi urged the SCO to step up, play a leading role and set an example in carrying out the Global Governance Initiative (GGI). He vowed that China will readily share the opportunities of its vast market and continue to implement the action plan for high-quality development of economic and trade cooperation within the SCO family.\n\n—The writer is Professor of History, based in Islamabad.","summary":"&#160; The SCO Tianjin Summit 2025 is the 25th Heads of State Council meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),…","url":"https://pakobserver.net/sco-summit-and-future-hopes/","image":"https://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tariq.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:30:11","author":"Tariq Aqil","authors":["Tariq Aqil"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.297},{"id":358345814,"title":"Alcaraz sinks Sinner in U.S. Open tennis finale, regains No. 1 ranking","text":"Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Carlos Alcaraz harnessed unmatched energy and overwhelmed Jannik Sinner with raw athleticism Sunday to win the U.S. Open tennis title and reclaim the No. 1 world ranking.\n\nThe Spaniard often appeared to levitate above the acrylic hard surface until sounds of his sneaker slides and ball pops echoed throughout Arthur Ashe Stadium during the 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win.

This was the third Grand Slam tournament in a row where these elite, young rivals met to decide the champion.\n\nThe match’s start was delayed for about a half-hour while thousands of fans were stuck outside Arthur Ashe Stadium while going through extra security because President Donald Trump sat in a sponsor’s suite. Perhaps the extra wait got the No. 1-seeded Sinner, who was the defending champion.\n\nRight from the beginning, under a closed roof because of rain earlier in the day, No. 2 Alcaraz outplayed Sinner, reversing the result from when they played for Wimbledon’s title less than two months ago.\n\nAlcaraz’s leads over Sinner are now 10-5 in their head-to-head series, 6-4 in major trophies, and 2-1 in U.S. Open championships. Plus, this 2-hour, 42-minute win allowed Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, to take away the No. 1 ranking from Sinner, a 24-year-old from Italy.\n\nThis hard-court matchup followed Alcaraz’s victory over Sinner after erasing a trio of match points on the French Open’s red clay in June, and Sinner’s victory over Alcaraz on Wimbledon’s grass in July.\n\n“I’m seeing you more than my family,” Alcaraz joked, eliciting a grin from Sinner. “It’s great to share the court, to share the locker rooms, everything.”\n\nSunday’s showdown represented the first time in tennis history that the same two men played each other in three consecutive Slam finals within a single season.\n\n“You were better than me,” Sinner told Alcaraz. “I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more.”\n\nTruth is, these two guys are so, so much better than the rest of men’s tennis at the moment. Their traits are unique, their strengths multiple, their games untouchable at the moment.\n\nExcept, of course, against the other.\n\nThey have combined to collect the past eight Slam trophies, and 10 of 13. Novak Djokovic, whom Alcaraz eliminated on Friday, took the other three in that span.\n\nBoth Sinner, who had won his past 27 hard-court matches at majors, and Alcaraz offered glimpses of why they are so good, although it was rare that both were at their best simultaneously.\n\nAlcaraz, who ended up with twice as many winners, 42-21, was superb in the first, third and fourth sets; Sinner’s top efforts arrived in the second.\n\nSince the start of the 2024 U.S. Open, Sinner had won 33 of 34 matches at the majors; Sunday was his fifth straight final at those events. The loss? To Alcaraz at Roland-Garros.\n\nIndeed, over the last two seasons, Sinner is now 1-7 against Alcaraz — and 109-4 against everyone else.\n\nAlcaraz, meanwhile, has won 37 of 38 contests since May. The loss? To Sinner at the All England Club, Alcaraz’s lone defeat in a Slam final.\n\nIn 2025, Alcaraz now has more titles (a tour-leading seven) than losses (his record is 61-6, also the best in men’s tennis).\n\nDuring his defeat at Wimbledon, Alcaraz was caught by a camera telling his team in Spanish: “From the back of the court, he’s much better than me.”\n\nPerhaps that’s why Alcaraz was aggressive Sunday with his sledgehammer of a forehand — and on-target, too. Whenever even the smallest opening presented itself, Alcaraz tried to barge on through with that shot, going big early in points, which worked, either for an outright winner or forcing mistakes from Sinner.\n\nSinner had dropped a total of just one service game in his three matches leading into the final, but he did deal with an abdominal muscle issue in his semifinal. Sinner and one of his coaches said it was nothing serious, which might be right, but Alcaraz broke right away Sunday and five times in all.\n\nTo counteract the forehand effectiveness, Sinner made a tactical switch, going increasingly after Alcaraz’s backhand when possible.\n\nPaid off. Briefly.\n\nIn the first set and third set, Alcaraz’s ratios were 11 winners to two unforced errors. Truly remarkable. In the second, those numbers swung the other way: five winners, 11 unforced errors.\n\nAn hour and 20 minutes in, it was a set apiece, after Alcaraz ceded one for the first time all tournament, allowing Neale Fraser to retain his distinction as the most recent man to win every set he played at the event — in 1960.\n\nAs Sinner worked his way into things, he would celebrate points by pumping a fist toward the box where his coaches and others, including Olympic champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn, were seated.\n\nAh, but it was Alcaraz who seemed to have more ticket-buyers on his side.\n\nThey regaled him with standing ovations. For one particularly magical volley at a hard-to-believe angle struck just before the ball hit the court — even Alcaraz himself liked that one, saying “Wow!” and breaking into a wide grin. For one special overhead smash to a corner with the tailing movement of a firefly.\n\nWarriors star Stephen Curry, sitting in the Arthur Ashe Stadium seats between wife Ayesha and his father, Dell, raised his arms and then rested his hands on his head after a strong trio of shots by Alcaraz in the fourth set.\n\nSinner, needless to say, wasn’t as pleased by those sorts of strokes.\n\nHe bounced his racket off the ground and caught it after one lost point. He exhaled and shook his head after another.\n\nSinner simply doesn’t see that sort of stuff from anyone else.\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.","summary":"Right from the beginning, under a closed roof because of rain earlier in the day, No. 2 Alcaraz outplayed Sinner, reversing the result from when they played for Wimbledon’s title less than two months ago.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/07/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-us-open-final-trump-curry/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BNG-L-USOPEN-09081.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:24:55","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.014},{"id":358352114,"title":"Carlos Alcaraz Smashes His Way Past Jannik Sinner To Capture Second US Open Crown","text":"Man, what a show Carlos Alcaraz put on at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The Spanish sensation absolutely steamrolled Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to claim his second US Open title, and honestly? It wasn’t even as close as the score line suggests.\n\nThe King Of Clay Shows He’s Master Of Hard Courts Too\n\nYou know that feeling when your favorite team is clicking on all cylinders? That was Alcaraz for most of this final. The 22-year-old looked like he was playing a different sport than everyone else, mixing power with finesse in ways that make tennis purists weep tears of joy.\n\nThe most telling stat? Alcaraz fired 10 aces without a single double fault. Meanwhile, Sinner managed just two aces and coughed up four double faults. When your serve is that dialed in during a Grand Slam final, you’re pretty much announcing to the world that this is your day.\n\nBut here’s the kicker – this wasn’t just about raw power. Alcaraz was surgical with his shot placement, consistently finding corners that left Sinner scrambling like he was chasing ghosts. The Italian looked genuinely frustrated at times, which is saying something for a guy who usually has the emotional range of a poker player.\n\nWhen Champions Collide, Only One Can Stand\n\nThe buildup to this match had all the drama of a heavyweight boxing match. These two have been trading blows all year, splitting the four Grand Slams down the middle. Sinner took Australia and Wimbledon, while Alcaraz claimed the French Open and now the US Open. It’s like watching Magic and Bird all over again, except with more sweat and Spanish celebrations.\n\nThe delay caused by Donald Trump’s surprise appearance (because apparently even presidents can’t resist good tennis) only added to the theater. Thirty minutes of extra waiting time would rattle most players, but Alcaraz seemed to feed off the energy. Maybe all those extra trunk rotations in the tunnel were exactly what he needed.\n\nThe Numbers Don’t Lie About This Beatdown\n\nLet’s talk about those break point numbers, because they tell the real story of this match. Sinner converted just one of his lone break point opportunities – that’s not winning tennis against someone as dangerous as Alcaraz. Meanwhile, the Spaniard was 5-for-11 on break chances, which is good enough to win pretty much any match at this level.\n\nThe third set was particularly brutal to watch if you’re a Sinner fan. Alcaraz won it 6-1, and honestly, Sinner was lucky to avoid the dreaded bagel. That one game he managed to steal felt more like charity than earned tennis.\n\nWhat This Victory Really Means For Tennis\n\nWith this win, Alcaraz joins some pretty exclusive company. He’s now won multiple titles on all three surfaces – clay, grass, and hard courts. The only other active player who can say that? Novak Djokovic. Not bad for a guy who’s still young enough to get carded at most bars.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolades, this rivalry with Sinner is becoming the gift that keeps on giving for tennis fans. Their head-to-head record now sits at 10-5 in favor of Alcaraz, but more importantly, they’ve played six finals this season alone. Six! That’s the kind of sustained excellence that makes sports legends.\n\nThe Human Side Of Championship Tennis\n\nPerhaps the most endearing moment came during the trophy presentation when Alcaraz joked to Sinner, “I’m seeing you more than my family.” It’s a funny line, but it also speaks to the incredible respect these two have built through their battles on court.\n\nSinner, gracious in defeat, simply said, “I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more.” That’s the response of a champion, even in loss. These guys are writing the next chapter of men’s tennis, and we’re all lucky enough to witness it unfold.\n\nThe season record now shows Alcaraz at an absolutely ridiculous 60-6 with seven titles, including two Grand Slams. Those are video game numbers in real life. Sinner’s 36-4 record with two titles isn’t exactly chopped liver either, but when you’re standing across the net from someone playing at this level, sometimes you just have to tip your cap.\n\nLooking Ahead To More Epic Battles\n\nAs the tennis calendar rolls toward the ATP Finals in Turin, one thing is crystal clear – this rivalry isn’t going anywhere. If anything, matches like this US Open final are just whetting our appetite for what’s to come. Alcaraz has now reclaimed the world number one ranking, but knowing Sinner, he’s probably already plotting his comeback. That’s what makes great rivals great – they push each other to heights neither could reach alone.\n\nFor now, though, this moment belongs to Alcaraz. Six Grand Slam titles at 22 years old, with the tennis world as his oyster. Not a bad Sunday’s work in Queens.","summary":"Man, what a show Carlos Alcaraz put on at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

It also secured Alcaraz’s second trophy at Flushing Meadows and his sixth major overall.\n\nIn Arthur Ashe Stadium, former President Donald Trump made an appearance in a sponsor’s suite and was met with a mix of applause and jeers from the crowd. His presence delayed the match’s start by about half an hour as several fans were still queuing outside, navigating through heightened security due to having a sitting president attend the tournament for the first time since Bill Clinton in 2000.\n\nThe delay might have unsettled No. 1 seed Sinner, who entered as the defending champion.

In the second, those numbers swung the other way: five winners, 11 unforced errors.\n\nAn hour and 20 minutes in, it was a set apiece, after Alcaraz ceded one for the first time all tournament, allowing Neale Fraser to retain his distinction as the most recent man to win every set he played at the event – all the way back in 1960.\n\nAs Sinner worked his way into things, he would celebrate just about every point he gathered by looking at the corner of the stands where his two coaches and others, including Olympic champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn, were seated and pumped his right fist.\n\nAh, but it was Alcaraz who seemed to have more of the ticket-buyers on his side.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz reaffirmed his dominance over Jannik Sinner with a 6-2, 3-6,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Carlos Alcaraz Defeats Jannik Sinner at US Open to Secure 6th Grand Slam Title and World No. 1 Ranking first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/carlos-alcaraz-defeats-jannik-sinner-at-us-open-to-secure-6th-grand-slam-title-and-world-no-1-ranking/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Carlos-Alcaraz-beats-rival-Jannik-Sinner-at-the-US-Open.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:22:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":358343740,"title":"Carlos Alcaraz destroys Jannik Sinner to underline undeniable truth in US Open final","text":"As men’s tennis has entered a new dawn, an undeniable truth has remained about the two best players in the world. From week to week, Jannik Sinner has mostly been unbeatable. But when Carlos Alcaraz finds his top level, no one, including Sinner, can stop him. In a US Open final that saw Alcaraz and Sinner face each other for the title in a third consecutive grand slam, the Spaniard completed his best-ever performance across a major tournament to demolish his rival, winning 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to reclaim the World No 1 ranking. \n\nEven the presence of Donald Trump, which caused the final to be delayed and forced it to start in front of thousands of empty seats as fans waited to pass through additional security checks outside, could not take the attention away from Alcaraz when he hit his spellbinding best. \n\nEight weeks on from Sinner’s win over Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz ended the Italian’s winning run at the hard-court grand slams at 27 matches, revenge served with a display of thumping serves and brilliant shot-making. Sinner was subdued, but Alcaraz was too good: with his sixth win over his rival in their last seven meetings. “You were better than me,” Sinner said. “I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more.\n\nAnd so it is fitting that Alcaraz regains the World No 1 ranking for the first time since September 2023, knocking Sinner off top spot after 65 consecutive weeks. The Spaniard remains on a trajectory towards being considered among one of the greatest players of all time, becoming the second-youngest man to reach six grand slam titles, after Bjorn Borg, at the age of 22.\n\n Alcaraz becomes just the fourth man in the Open era to win multiple titles on the three different surfaces, with two at the US Open, the French Open and Wimbledon. “To my team and family, I’m lucky to have you guys,” he said. “Honoured to be honest. The hard work you do to make me even better. Not only in the professional part, but also the personal part as well. Every achievement I have is because of you.” \n\nAlcaraz and Sinner were the first men to meet in three grand slam finals in a row in the Open era, and in their fifth final in a row overall. “I’m seeing you more than my family,” Alcaraz laughed, as both rivals began their speeches by turning to each other and offering praise. \n\nBut a different Alcaraz had arrived in New York. As if determined to bounce back from his first grand slam final defeat at Wimbledon, Alcaraz looked more focused and locked-in from the start. He found consistency, and without as many ups-and-downs in his matches. His accidental buzz-cut received on the day before the US Open proved fitting as he rolled through the draw and towards an inevitable rematch with Sinner. \n\nGiven the way Alcaraz was playing, it remains a curiosity that the player he has a mental block over is the diminishing force of Novak Djokovic. Alcaraz had been nervous and hesitant in defeating the 38-year-old in his semi-final on Friday - but he has no such problems against Sinner. He took to the Arthur Ashe Stadium following the 30-minute delay and immediately found the level described by his quarter-final opponent Jiri Lehecka as “grand slam Carlos”. \n\nHe broke Sinner in the opening game of the match, an opening eight-minute tussle that swung in Alcaraz’s direction with a series of vicious forehand blows that sparked the final into life, the last of which reached over 100mph. The inspiration flowed from Alcaraz from there, with a disguised forehand pass faked from a drop shot and a sumptuous pick-up volley the pick of a dazzling array of 10 winners to two unforced errors in the first set alone . \n\nSinner, who required a medical timeout of an abdominal injury in his semi-final victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime, looked rushed and struggled on his second-serve, with Alcaraz thundering the returns. With Alcaraz faultless on his booming serve, which he highlighted as his biggest improvement before his seventh grand slam final, Sinner made far too many errors for the first set to be competitive. \n\nA potential turning point came when Sinner faced a break point right at the start of the second set. Alcaraz could not get his return in play and Sinner began to claw his way back. After ending the run of Alcaraz points on serve, Sinner finally won an exchange that had the crowd on its feet as he swatted a forehand winner crosscourt, with a previously unflappable Alcaraz losing his serve for just the third time at the tournament with a forehand long. \n\nAlcaraz had lost three points on serve in the first set but lost four in a row to find himself behind. Sinner used the shift in momentum as the timing of his forehand returned. From shaking his head at the quality of Alcaraz’s play, the steel of Sinner’s determined fist-pumps indicated he had arrived. After winning a 19-shot rally with a flying backhand volley, Sinner levelled the match, the first set Alcaraz had dropped all tournament after 19 won in a row. \n\nBut no man had ever won the US Open without dropping a set. Alcaraz would have expected a response from Sinner but managed to turn the match around in a key couple of games at the start of the third. Sinner whacked a ball into the air in frustration after pushing a forehand wide to lose his serve, but then had a chance on 0-30 in the next game. Alcaraz pulled out another extraordinary, improvised shot, sending an overhead from behind the baseline onto the line and spinning out of his reach. \n\nIt was a magic moment that launched Alcaraz into a streak that took the set and match away from Sinner, who continued to show his irritation by bouncing his racket off the court. The break was celebrated by Alcaraz pointing to his ear after defending his backhand corner and then advancing into the net to put away the volley. Alcaraz broke Sinner for the fourth time in the match - as many times as the Italian had lost serve through the tournament - and then jammed Sinner with a body serve to win a landslide set. \n\nSinner immediately faced more pressure on serve at the start of the third set, saving a second break point to win a scrambling point and denying Alcaraz as he looked to make a sensational angled pick-up. He went again, always determined to pull off his greatest trick yet, denying Sinner a certain point with another magnificent reach. Sinner, always having to play the extra shot, slumped after volleying wide, a double-fault bringing up break point and a poor error handing Alcaraz the advantage. \n\nAs Alcaraz served for the title, Sinner was forced into two misses that you would not see against any other player in the world. In a desperate attempt to hold on, Sinner saved the second of two match points with a backhand winner. But there no reverse of Paris, where Alcaraz saved three match points to defeat Sinner in five sets. Alcaraz found his serve, slamming an ace out wide on the third match point. He broke into a wide smile, laughing in disbelief. There is no one like him, and Sinner knows that more than anyone.","summary":"Alcaraz won his sixth grand slam title and reclaimed the World No 1 ranking, winning 6-2 3-6 6-1 6-4 against his rival","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-us-open-final-result-b2821925.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/07/21/12/SEI265144393.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:18:27","author":"Jamie Braidwood","authors":["Jamie Braidwood"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.032},{"id":358357976,"title":"Who’s in attendance for the US Open men’s final?
