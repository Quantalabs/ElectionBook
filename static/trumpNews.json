{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":23259,"news":[{"id":395472164,"title":"Intel’s Stock Meltdown Risks Eroding Trump-Endorsed Comeback","text":"Intel Corp.’s stock slide is delivering a reality check to President Donald Trump’s vision for quickly reviving domestic chip manufacturing led by an American champion, four months after the US moved to acquire as much as a 10% stake in the company.Though Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan managed to win the president’s confidence and save his own reputation in Washington, turning around his company is proving more arduous. Intel’s shares plunged Friday, tumbling as much as 17.5%, following a lackluster forecast that highlighted the company’s struggles in lining up big customers. Just a few weeks ago, Trump had praised the company’s progress and its “very successful” CEO, as the president assessed early returns on the US investment. Tan took a more sober tone when speaking to investors on Thursday following the release of Intel’s quarterly results. “We are on a multiyear journey,” Tan said on a conference call with analysts. “It will take time and resolve, but my team and I are committed to rebuilding this iconic American company.” Intel’s first-quarter projections for revenue and earnings fell well short of Wall Street estimates. The company also disclosed that it still doesn’t have an anchor customer for its most advanced 14A process, though it expects firmer decisions from buyers in the second half of the year or the first half of 2027. Intel shares were down 17% at 1:16 p.m. New York time, on course for their biggest one-day decline since 2024. Tan acknowledged to investors that yields — the number of non-defective chips produced compared with the total possible capacity — are below his expectations. This metric is at the heart of chip manufacturing, as poor yields are likely to weigh on margins and deter possible customers for its foundry business, which makes chips for outside clients in its fabrication plants. “Customers aren’t going to lock in unless they know they have a manufacturing process that can deliver,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg Television. “You have to know the supply will be there if you commit to a certain manufacturing partner. It’s a real chicken and egg problem.”Since plans emerged for the US to become one of Intel’s top shareholders, the Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock had more than doubled, feverish gains that were pared by the latest projections. So far, the US owns 5.5% of Intel, a stake that’s currently worth roughly $12 billion, with options for the government to take ownership of additional shares in the future.White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump “remains committed to reshoring critical manufacturing and supporting American companies with a full policy suite of tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation. The Trump administration’s equity stake in Intel in particular represents how we are investing in the long-run success of American technology and manufacturing.” Spokespeople for the US Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Some analysts see the US investment in the company as a crucial backstop to its long-term success. “This makes Intel’s fabs a strategic asset to the US military, and Intel has the full backing of the US government,” Gus Richard, an analyst at Northland Securities, wrote. “Intel needs to leverage its US government contacts and its US military industrial base foundry business into broader commercial relationships.”While the success of Intel’s turnaround may not be clear for several more quarters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is already achieving what Intel has sought. That includes building in the US, where TSMC plans to invest another $100 billion in Arizona as part of a Taiwan trade deal unveiled by the Trump administration last week. TSMC has promised to bring 12 advanced manufacturing and packaging facilities to Arizona by the mid-2030s. Under the Taiwan agreement, companies investing in the US will receive an exemption on future potential chip tariffs to import as much as 2.5 times their American capacity, reducing the odds that the levies would make Intel’s products more attractive in the US market. Still, TSMC’s decision to continue adding manufacturing in Arizona points to a positive long-term trend for Intel: continued growth in demand for AI chips. Intel has begun shipping its sub-2-nanometer 18A chips, a generation behind 14A, to customers from its manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Oregon. The company’s Chips Act-sponsored investment in Ohio has been repeatedly delayed, and the company avoided any mention of it in the Thursday investor call. The more than $28 billion project was supposed to be producing chips last year, but Intel now doesn’t expect to begin operations until 2030.

NO SCHOOL. NO SHOPPING.\"Across the state, bars, restaurants, museums, shops and other local businesses were shuttering for the day. Many workers in Minneapolis planned to join a march in the afternoon, intended by organizers to be the largest display of opposition yet to the federal government's surge, which Mayor Jacob Frey and other Democrats have likened to an invasion.Miguel Hernandez, a community organizer who closed his business, Lito's Bakery in Minneapolis for the day, put on four layers, wool socks and a parka before heading out to protest.\"If this were any other time, no one would've gone out,\" he said, bracing for the weather. \"For us, it's a message of solidarity with our community, that we see the pain and misery that's going on in the streets, and it's a message to our politicians that they have to do more than grandstand on the news.\"No school districts were shutting down, but schools in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul offered remote-learning options, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.MARCH FOLLOWS ANGRY STREET CONFRONTATIONSTrump, a Republican, launched the Minnesota crackdown in response to fraud allegations against some members of the state's large community of people of Somali origin. He has called Somali immigrants \"garbage\" and said they are to be removed from the country as part of his effort to expel more immigrants, including some admitted into the country to seek asylum and other lawful residents, than any of his predecessors.Minnesota residents have responded with anger, making noise in the streets day and night with whistles and musical instruments. Some agents and protesters have yelled obscenities at each other, and agents have deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to scatter crowds. The Trump administration says some protesters have harassed agents and obstructed their work. Senior Trump administration officials have gone to Minneapolis to defend ICE, with Vice President JD Vance telling reporters during his Thursday visit the administration is \"doing everything we can to lower the temperature.\"Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old nonprofit worker, said she would be among those willing to join Friday's march and \"expose ourselves to the elements to demonstrate the level of anger and frustration that we have.\"\"We continue to be under siege from the federal government, and it feels like we need to do more because our normal forms of protest and resistance have shown to not be enough yet to really send a strong enough message to Trump,\" she said.The numerous Fortune 500 companies that call Minnesota home - mostly based in the Minneapolis area - have refrained from public statements about the immigration raids. Minneapolis-based Target, which has come under fire in the last year for retreating from its public commitment to diversity policies, has faced more criticism for not speaking out about activity at its stores. State lawmakers have pressed the company for details of its guidance to employees if and when ICE officers show up at stores.The company declined a request for comment. Reuters also contacted Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories, Best Buy, Hormel, General Mills, 3M and Fastenal. None immediately responded to requests for comment.

The so-called swap spread widener trade — which uses derivatives to wager that the gap between rates on interest-rate swaps and yields on Treasuries of the same maturity will grow — came under pressure at the start of the week after a Japanese bond market rout and rising tensions between the US and Europe over Greenland sent bond yields higher. The moves threatened to derail a widening trend in the spread that had been in place since markets recovered after April’s tariff-induced rout. But as this week’s tensions eased after US President Donald Trump said a framework of an agreement on the Arctic island was reached, the trade was back in play. By Friday, the 30-year swap spread reached as high as 62 basis points inverted, the widest since December 2022, rising by about 8 basis points this week from a low reached on Tuesday. The swap spread trade has gained in popularity in recent months in large part due to expectations that Trump’s deregulatory agenda will free up cash on banks’ balance sheet, which in turn will favor Treasuries. Spreads popped wider recently in response to comments by Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran who said that “sweeping deregulation” will support further monetary easing. A December BIS report put the value of the cash component of the swap spread trade at around $631 billion, more than doubling from $281 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and largely driving the growth of hedge fund exposure to Treasuries. That’s trailing the much more popular basis trade strategy, which bets on discrepancies between cash bond yields and futures. Morgan Stanley recently reported the cash-versus-futures basis trade close to $1.5 trillion. Rate swaps are usually an exchange of fixed for floating rates. The side that receives the fixed makes money when interest rates fall, so the position acts as a way for banks to add so-called duration without owning cash Treasuries on their balance sheets.Several recent policies are adding fuel to the swap spread widener trade, according to Wall Street strategists who have come out in favor of the strategy. Trading in many of these contracts is anonymous, making it difficult to identify the firms involved and the exact beneficiaries of the bets.Trump’s efforts to reduce the cost of home ownership, including ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities will support “hedging flows via paying in swaps from GSEs,” according to strategists at Barclays PLC. Recent steps by the Federal Reserve to calm conditions in the repo market with purchases of Treasury bills are favoring the long-cash side of the trade. Read: Pimco Sees US Mortgage Bond Purchases Boosting ReturnsBarclays hold a long position in the 5-year sector based on potential for MBS hedging flows while Morgan Stanley are in 2-year swap spread longs citing the current benign conditions in funding markets, an indication that cash remains plentiful. Meanwhile, strategists at TD Securities this week said swap spreads should widen this year, as funding conditions ease, Treasury demand remains robust, and bank deregulation unlocks dealer balance sheet capacity. The trade does not come without risks. In April, it violently blew-up as firms looked to unwind positions amid margin calls after Trump’s tariff liberation day announcement roiled markets. A similar shock or policy shifts could again threaten to unravel the bets. A changing outlook for Treasuries supply and the influx of corporate issuance, including a debt binge for artificial intelligence hitting the market as early as next week, could also to take some wind out of the recent swap spread widening by pushing Treasury yields higher.

Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also attending the meeting.Why talks are importantThis marks the first known occasion that officials from the Donald Trump administration have met with envoys from both countries as part of Washington’s effort to advance discussions aimed at ending Moscow’s nearly four-year invasion. While Russian and Ukrainian representatives have met on multiple occasions in separate discussions, this is believed to be the first time US envoys are also participating, a notable development as Trump continues to push for an end to the war, according to AP.The discussions stem from a recent wave of diplomatic efforts, even as Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine and its energy infrastructure, leaving parts of the country without electricity during a bitterly cold winter.Although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that a possible peace agreement was “nearly ready\", several key and sensitive issues, particularly those involving territorial disputes, remain unsettled.What is expected to be discussed?Zelensky mentioned the sensitive question of territorial concessions is expected to be discussed, while the Kremlin provided limited information, describing the gathering only as a “working group on security issues\". Kremlin officials also said separate economic talks will be held between Witkoff and Dmitriev.Both sides have suggested that any potential peace agreement depends on the still-unresolved matter of territory. In a WhatsApp chat with journalists on Friday, Zelensky stated the question of who would control the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine is “key\".Ukrainian officials stated that a first round of talks between US, Russian, and Ukrainian negotiators in Abu Dhabi concluded on Friday evening, with further discussions set for Saturday.“The meeting focused on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process aimed at advancing toward a dignified and lasting peace.

WRHA expanding psychosocial support services across Westmoreland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST JAMES, Jamaica — The Western Regional Health Authority (WRHA) is expanding psychosocial support services across Westmoreland, to assist residents affected by the passage of Hurricane Melissa.\n\nHealth Promotion and Education Officer for Westmoreland, Gerald Miller, said the initiative forms part of a wider response being implemented in parishes impacted by the hurricane, with a focus on providing emotional and mental health support to affected communities.\n\nHe informed that the sessions are being facilitated by trained professionals and are designed to give residents a safe space to discuss emotional challenges arising from the hurricane’s impact.\n\nMiller noted that the support also extends to individuals who may require further mental health assistance.\n\n“If they have other issues that they would need support on as it relates to their mental health, then the experts there would be able to provide that support,” he added.\n\nMiller informed that services are being offered at multiple locations across the parish on Saturdays and Sundays between 9:00 am and 2:00 pm, allowing residents in various communities to access counselling closer to where they live.\n\n“For persons who are living in the Petersfield area, you can go to the Petersfield Primary School between the hours of 9:00 am and 2:00 pm,” Miller said, noting that sessions at that location began the previous weekend.\n\nHe further indicated that residents in the Whitehouse community can access similar services at the Whitehouse Field Clinic during the same hours.\n\nMiller said additional sites have been activated in Beeston Spring, Darliston and Dundee to ensure wide coverage across the parish.\n\n“In the Beeston Spring area, you can go to the Salem Primary between 9:00 am and 2:00 pm… and for the Darliston area, you can get your support there from the Darliston Field Clinic,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that residents in the Berkshire area can access services at Dundee Primary School.\n\nEmphasising the importance of seeking help during the recovery period, Miller encouraged residents to make use of the services being offered.\n\n“We are asking persons who are in need of psychosocial support to go out and meet with the persons who are assigned to these sites to provide the necessary counselling for you,” he said.\n\nHe underscored that professional guidance can help residents cope more effectively, during what he described as a challenging time.\n\n“So, we want everybody to go out and meet these experts… go get some professional counselling on how to cope in this challenging time,” Miller added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa psychosocial support The Western Regional Health

The feedback that I have been getting from these two songs have given me the motivation to continue on this journey,” Chizz Chizem told Observer Online on Friday.\n\nNow residing in Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States, Chizz Chizem says a very small but united reggae scene is in full bloom.\n\n“Jamaicans are everywhere and the reggae scene is relatively small, but it is thriving. I have been building a fan base for my music since I got here and I am seeing the benefits of my efforts,” she said while noting, “I have an EP that I am completing so there will be a body of work for the fans to listen to.”\n\nCiting the need to create a project that will appeal to everyone, Chizz Chizem is putting in the work with her engineer Mac Niff.\n\n“Mac Niff is creating the beats and handling the recording and mixing of the songs. I feel this is going to be a worthwhile project that everyone can listen to,” said Chizz Chizem.\n\nChizz Chizem whose real name is Shanet Chisholm, made her debut in 2012 with the song Struggles, which was produced by Ralston Barrett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: artiste Chizz Chizem music \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Caribbean Airlines says no eviction underway at Hope Road office \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad — Caribbean Airlines says there is no eviction process underway at its Hope Road office in Kingston, Jamaica despite recent me... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica passport ranks ahead of Dominican Republic, Cuba and Haiti in global mobility index \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica’s passport has been ranked stronger than those of the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Haiti in a new global assessment of tra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manchester schools benefiting from hydroponics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica — Two secondary schools in Manchester are set to see the benefits from the use of vertical hydroponic towers in the enhancement of... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n UK PM slams Trump for saying NATO troops avoided Afghan front line \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom -- UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Friday denounced as \"insulting\" Donald Trump's claim that British troops avoided the front li... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spanish prosecutors dismiss sex abuse case against Julio Iglesias \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n MADRID, Spain -- Spanish prosecutors on Friday shelved a sex abuse and human trafficking complaint against veteran singer Julio Iglesias, saying Spain... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Snow and ice storm set to sweep US \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — A massive winter storm was set to drop a hazardous mix of freezing rain and heavy snow on some 160 million Americans s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gold nears US$5,000, silver shines as stocks slip on turbulent week \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom -- Global stocks were subdued and precious metals hit fresh highs Friday after a turbulent week that saw US President Donald Tr... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kiprich and Kizzy Don launch GoFundMe to airlift premature baby to US for medical care \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2026 \n\n\n Dancehall artistes Kiprich and Kizzy Don have launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for their newborn daughter, Miracle, who was born prematurel... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

virtually stopped almost 100 percent of all drugs coming in by water,' Trump said in remarks on Thursday at the World Economic Forum at Davos.\n\nIn the wake of his capture of Maduro, Trump has leveraged the remaining members of the regime into making deals on oil.\n\nDays after the capture of Maduro, Trump announced a deal with the Venezuelan regime to give the United States 30 to 50 million barrels of oil which could be worth up to $2billion.\n\n'I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America,' he posted to Truth Social. \n\nTrump also announced that he will be in control of the money made off the oil's sales - which at market price, could be worth up to $2billion according to Reuters. \n\n'This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!' \n\nTrump has placed Energy Secretary Chris Wright in charge of executing the plan which is scheduled to begin immediately. \n\n'It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States,' he wrote. \n\nTrump has largely put his team in charge of relations with Venezuela, while sidelining Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\nTrump had largely dismissed Machado's prospects, saying 'it would be very tough for her to be the leader' and claiming she 'doesn't have the support or the respect within the country.' \n\nHis comments caught Machado's team off guard, according to people close to her.\n\nMachado's proxy candidate, Edmundo González, won more than two–thirds of the vote in last year's election, which Maduro refused to honor by stepping down.\n\nUS officials say Venezuela's vast oil wealth offers both an incentive for Rodríguez to engage with Trump and a source of leverage if she doesn't.","summary":"The US military said Friday carried out its deadly strike on alleged narcoterrorists in the Caribbean since the raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15493451/US-military-conducts-strike-Maduro.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/24/00/105786831-0-This_image_from_video_provided_by_U_S_South_Command_shows_a_vess-a-11_1769214987275.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:32:32","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

This is blatant ideological indoctrination and needs to stop.”\n\nStaley’s right: This kind of skewed, racist brainwashing feeds division and hostility not just on campuses but at corporations, government, the media and other key institutions.\n\nIt’s the kind of depraved curricula that fueled the pro-terrorist, antisemitic encampments after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and surely underlies some of the anti-ICE riots today.\n\nIt might also explain the radical, uber-left support that paved the way for socialist antisemite Zohran Mamdani and the racists who surround him to rise to power.\n\nTeam Trump has made a good start in fighting the scourge — with DEI bans, civil-rights probes and by targeting the accrediting system.\n\nYet Brooklyn College is hardly alone in clinging to its perverse agenda: K-12 schools as well as numerous colleges around the country continue to offer similarly race-based courses.\n\nSuch as the University of Maryland’s “Decolonizing Medicine: Steps to Actionable Change,” per The College Fix.\n\nAnd the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities’ “Critical Indigenous Theory,” which offers “content such as critical theories, decolonization, Marxism, Queer theory, and Palestine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s 2026 free-speech rankings showed some small progress recently among colleges in providing campus environments open to diverse viewpoints.\n\nBut of 257 schools surveyed, more than half (166) scored an “F” grade, while only 11 got better than a “D.”\n\nClearly, Team Trump has more work to do. \n\nThe left — in education and elsewhere — can’t be allowed to stand in the way of Americans reaching their own conclusions based on accurate, unbiased facts.\n\nAnyone who cares about the nation’s future should rush to purge wokeness everywhere it has reared its ugly head.","summary":"Despite pushback by President Donald Trump, woke programming at US colleges continues to infect young minds, scarring generations — and one particularly sickening example is right here in New York, at Brooklyn College.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/23/opinion/the-fight-to-purge-wokeness-at-colleges-is-far-from-over/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/BCOELD.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:31:11","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":395525986,"title":"Thousands rally against immigration enforcement in sub-zero Minnesota temperatures","text":"Police arrested about 100 clergy demonstrating against immigration enforcement at Minnesota’s largest airport Friday (January 23, 2026), and thousands gathered in downtown Minneapolis despite Arctic temperatures to protest the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThe protests are part of a broader movement against President Donald Trump’s increased immigration enforcement across the state, with labor unions, progressive organisations and clergy urging Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and even shops. The faith leaders gathered at the airport to protest deportation flights and urge airlines to call for an end to to what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\nThe clergy were issued misdemeanor citations of trespassing and failure to comply with a peace officer and were then released, said Jeff Lea, a Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman. They were arrested outside the main terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport because they went beyond the reach of their permit for demonstrating and disrupted airline operations, he said.\n\nRev. Mariah Furness Tollgaard of Hamline Church in St. Paul said police ordered them to leave but she and others decided to stay and be arrested to show support for migrants, including members of her congregation who are afraid to leave their homes. She planned to go back to her church after her brief detention to hold a prayer vigil. \n\n “We cannot abide living under this federal occupation of Minnesota,” Tollgaard said. \n\nThe Rev. Elizabeth Barish Browne traveled from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to participate in the rally in downtown Minneapolis, where the high temperature was minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 degrees Celsius) despite a bright sun.\n\n“What’s happening here is clearly immoral,” the Unitarian Universalist Minister said. “It’s definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that’s dangerous to us is not the weather.”\n\nProtesters have gathered daily in the Twin Cities since January 7, when 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.\n\nSam Nelson said he skipped work so he could join the march. He said he’s a former student of the Minneapolis high school where federal agents detained someone after class earlier this month. That arrest led to altercations between federal officers and bystanders.\n\n“It’s my community,” Nelson said. “Like everyone else, I don’t want ICE on our streets.”\n\nOrganisers said Friday morning (January 23, 2026) that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups. \n\nA two-year-old was reunited with her mother on Friday (January 23, 2026), a day after she was detained with her father outside of their home in South Minneapolis, lawyer Irina Vaynerman told The Associated Press.\n\nVaynerman said they had quickly challenged the family’s detention in federal court. The petition states that the child, a citizen of Ecuador, was brought to the U.S. as a newborn. The child and her father, Elvis Tipan Echeverria, both have a pending asylum application and neither are subject to final orders of removal.\n\nA U.S. district judge on Thursday (January 22, 2026) had barred the government from transferring the toddler out of state, but she and her father were on a commercial flight to Texas about 20 minutes later, according to court filings. They were flown back Friday.\n\nAgents arrested Tipan Echeverria during a targeted operation, according to a DHS statement said. DHS said the child’s mother was in the area but refused to take the child.\n\nVaynerman rejected that explanation, saying Tipan Echeverria was “not allowed” to bring his 2-year-old to her mother inside their home.\n\nDHS repeated its allegation Friday (January 23, 2026) that the father of 5-year-old abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday (January 22, 2026), leading to the child being detained, too.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the child was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, “fled from the scene.” The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Centre in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get child's mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.\n\nThe family’s attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was “used as bait.” \n\nProkosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam's father has a criminal history. \n\nOn Friday (January 23, 2026), Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from the child’s detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.\n\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from “multiple gunshots wounds.\"\n\nA more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good’s family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released on Wednesday (January 21, 2026) through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren’t immediately life-threatening.\n\nAntonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and “hope that they communicate with Renee’s family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.”\n\nA spokesperson for the firm said there were no funeral plans to share yet.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thousands-rally-against-immigration-enforcement-in-sub-zero-minnesota-temperatures/article70545167.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/me1icg/article70545172.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/APTOPIX_Immigration_Enforcement_Minnesota_08122.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:23:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":395524706,"title":"Jennifer Lopez, 56, wears bizarre braless look for high-end shopping trip in LA","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 24th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'She trusted people and paid the ultimate price': Parents of 'girl in the helmet' waitress cruelly blamed for Swiss inferno speak out\n\nThe mother of four - and force of nature - battling the politicians who think it's OK to dump hundreds of young migrant men on her pretty little town in Sussex\n\nAt least have the guts to say sorry, Mr Trump!

I'm kidding.'\nShe then joked, 'Things happen,' before kicking out her leg and adding, 'And then get rid of them.'\nLopez and Affleck ended their first engagement in 2004 before rekindling their romance in 2021.\nThey tied the knot in July 2022 and Lopez filed for divorce two years after their second wedding ceremony in Georgia – listing April 26, 2024 as the date of their separation.\nLos AngelesInstagramJennifer Lopez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Lopez, 56, wears bizarre braless look for high-end shopping trip in LA\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JADA BAS, TRAINEE REPORTER \n Published:01:13 GMT, 24 January 2026 |Updated:01:18 GMT, 24 January 2026 \n\nFans have dubbed Rachel Duffy 'the best and most honourable Traitor of all time' after she and Stephen Libby won the hit BBC show.\nThe pair emerged victorious in Friday's nail-biting final of The Traitors as host Claudia Winkleman announced they had won the game, with each contestant taking home a whopping £47,875.\nIn the most tense of finales, the pair were the first ever duo of traitors to triumph despite fans thinking that she would turn on her friend to win.\nStephen and Rachel have stuck together from the very beginning and it was a selfless move from Stephen at the end, who could've snatched the entire prize pot knowing Jack Butler would vote Rachel.\nInstead, both Stephen and Rachel were loyal to the pact they made at the family tree, which was to not betray each other.\nBut fans have praised Rachel – who was so keen to win that she got training from an ex FBI agent on the art of lying - as one of the best Traitors there will ever be.\n\nFans have dubbed Rachel Duffy 'the best and most honourable Traitor of all time' after she and Stephen Libby won the hit BBC show\n\nIn the most tense of finales, the pair were the first ever duo of traitors to triumph despite fans thinking that she would turn on her friend to win\n\nEXCLUSIVE Rachel Duffy set for huge showbiz career as agents line up to sign her after Traitors win \nFlocking to social media, fans wrote: 'Rachel really is the best and most honourable Traitor of all time. I'm ELATED',\n'Rachel is without doubt up there as one of the finest traitors we’ve seen. SO well deserved',\n'You could run the traitors for another 20 years and it would be hard to imagine there will ever be a better traitor than Rachel',\n'This was the best final yet! The faithful traitors played a sublime game, well Rachel did and just hoped Stephen went along with it',\n'Rachel & Stephen effing DID IT!!!!!!! Only person I feel sorry for is Faraaz. Claudia saying \"2 traitors but totally faithful to each other\" Gosh, their bond. Rachel is my president!'\n'Incredible result. What a queen Rachel is, she won it for Stephen realistically. Smart, cool and in control the whole way through; what a woman!'\nFollowing her win, industry insiders have told the Daily Mail that Rachel's income is now set to rocket, as they tip the mother of three from Newry, Northern Ireland to become a millionaire – and the richest Traitor yet.\nThe communications director, 43, has been branded one of the BBC show's best-ever players, hailed for her ability to gain so many friends among the Faithfuls. And it's this appealing charisma which looks likely to turbocharge her earnings potential.\n\nStephen and Rachel were loyal to the pact they made at the family tree, which was to not betray each other\n\nFans have flocked to social media and praised Rachel as one of the best Traitors there will ever be\n\nRachel underwent four months of FBI online training, which, she said, enabled her to spot a liar at a hundred paces\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nDuring the series, Rachel amassed an impressive 89,800 Instagram followers and a further 54,100 followers on TikTok.\nOn Friday, one celebrity agent told the Daily Mail: 'Rachel is a superstar, she's brilliant and she has been the standout contestant from start to finish.\n'She has won millions and millions of fans and showbiz agents know they can make her a fortune. Already they are thinking about what other reality television programmes they can get her on. She has all of the ingredients for stardom.\n'In a few days she will be inundated with people wanting to represent her. She has been a household name for the last three weeks and she will continue to be so.'\nThe duo appeared on The Traitors spin-off show Uncloaked to reflect on the intense finale.\nRachel said: 'I was so nervous for Stephen so watching it back, it made me cry.'\nStephen added: 'I didn't know what I was going to do, watching it back I can see in my face. I'm just so proud of the decision that I made, proud of myself and Rachel.'\nEarlier in the series, Stephen had expressed doubts over whether Rachel would keep her side of the pact they made never to write each other's names on their slates at the roundtable.\n\nFollowing her win, industry insiders have told the Daily Mail that Rachel's income is now set to rocket, as they tip the mother of three from Newry, Northern Ireland to become a millionaire\n\nStephen and Rachel explained why they were determined to stick to the agreement, despite initial doubts\n\nNow, speaking after their win, the pair explained why they were determined to stick to the agreement, despite initial doubts.\nRachel said: 'I knew from the minute it came out of my mouth I wouldn't break the pact and I thought this is a new game for me I'm not breaking it.'\nStephen added: 'It's so hard to trust someone in there whose job it is to lie and so I was really struggling to see how Rachel could hold onto that pact for the whole game which is why to the end I was wobbling.'\nRachel made no secret of the fact she wanted to win the show.\nThat aim was assisted by the four months of FBI online training she had endured, which, she said, enabled her to spot a liar at a hundred paces. The ex agent tutored her in how to spot micro-expressions, read blink patterns, and monitor breathing and swallowing.\nShe also practised keeping a straight face while lying to her lawyer husband, Seamus, and said she became so good even he couldn't now tell if she was telling fibs.\n'My husband can't even tell if I'm telling the truth any more, not that I lie to him all that often, but I could wind him up and say something off the cuff, and he's like, 'I don't even know if that's true!' she said. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Traitors fans brand Rachel Duffy 'the greatest contestant of all time' after she and Stephen Libby were crowned 2026 winners\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The lengthy document mocks ICE agents for \"living out their ‘Call of Duty’ fantasy army roles, only with real assault weapons.\" No name or return address was listed, and there was no mention of Sonoma County in the document, the local GOP said. NEW JERSEY TWINS CHARGED IN THREATS TO KILL DHS OFFICIAL, ‘SHOOT ICE ON SIGHT’ \"NOTE: No official of any party had anything to do with the composing or distributing of this document; it is strictly a private ‘patriotic effort,’ like Donald Trump’s January 6th Washington, D.C., insurgents,\" the letter states on page seven. The letter’s opening line mentions the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. The Department of Homeland Security said Good was trying to ram her vehicle into an ICE agent when he opened fire in self-defense. \"It is clear that every private citizen’s life, immigrant or not, is at risk of annihilation by these low-IQ, trigger-happy domestic terrorists, with no restraints from their commanders in the field. NO ONE IS SAFE NOW,\" the writer states. The sender also accused ICE of inflicting a \"real foreign invasion–style war\" on unarmed men, women, and children. WHITE HOUSE BLAMES DEMOCRATS FOR ICE VIOLENCE AS MINNEAPOLIS ERUPTS, INSURRECTION ACT THREAT LOOMS \"They now need to feel real war, just as any foreign invading army would,\" the letter said, before condemning Republican congressional lawmakers for backing the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. The letter then went on to urge violence against ICE personnel. \"Since ICE-DHS make so light of our innocent citizens’ lives, then it is time to show ICE how light and worthless their lives are,\" the letter said, while also calling those who support the agent \"fair game.\" \"ICE agents and their backers need to become the targets,\" the letter continued. \"IED’d, run over with vehicles, shot at by snipers, sprayed with toxic chemicals.\" ANTI-ICE THREAT SPRAY-PAINTED ON VEHICLE BELIEVED TO BE USED BY FEDERAL OFFICERS DURING MINNEAPOLIS UNREST Several Trump administration officials are also mentioned, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller, as well as Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who has been sharply critical of ICE and the Trump administration's crackdown on criminal illegal immigrants. Pages two and three give detailed instructions on how to make a chemical improvised explosive device (IED) in a section of the letter titled \"Carrying the War Back to the ICE Invader Murderers and Protecting Our Personnel.\" The anonymous person or group responsible for the letter included several images of ICE agents carrying out their duties. \"A shrapnel device guaranteed to shred the legs, genitals, face, eyeballs, and hands of murdering ICE agents and their bosses,\" one note said. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The Sonoma County GOP reported the letter to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Department, which has not responded to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Earlier this month, DHS said ICE is facing a 1,300% increase in assaults and an 8,000% increase in death threats toward its agents.","summary":"Threatening letter allegedly sent to California GOP reportedly calls for violence against ICE agents, including detailed bomb-making instructions.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anonymous-letter-california-gop-chapter-war-ice-urges-agents-sent-home-body-bag","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/ice-federal-officers-minneapolis.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:13:11","author":"Louis Casiano","authors":["Louis Casiano"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":395523212,"title":"Italy's Meloni Hopes to Nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize","text":"ROME: Italian leader Giorgia Meloni said Friday she hoped US President Donald Trump would end the conflict in Ukraine so she could nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Meloni revels in her cordial ties with Trump, who has expressed frustration at failing to win the prize. \"I hope that one day we can award a Nobel Peace Prize to Donald Trump,\" Italian Prime Minister Meloni told a press conference after meeting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"I trust that if he makes a difference... in achieving a just and lasting peace for Ukraine, for Ukraine too... finally, we too could nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.\" In a message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store made public on Monday, Trump said failing to get the prize meant he no longer felt obliged \"to think purely of peace\". On Thursday, Trump unveiled his \"Board of Peace\", initially designed to oversee the Gaza truce and the territory's revival, but which has morphed into a mechanism aiming to resolve all sorts of international conflicts. Italy has been invited to join the \"Board\", but Meloni said she had told Trump that Italy faced \"constitutional problems\". Italy's constitutional rules do not allow the country to join an organisation led by a single foreign leader, according to media reports. Trump is the chairman of the \"Board\", as well as serving as the US representative and the chair of its executive board. Meloni said she had asked Trump to reopen the framework \"to meet the needs not only of Italy, but also of other European countries\". \"We must try to do this work,\" she said. \"The presence of countries like ours can make a difference.\"","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/italys-meloni-hopes-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize-1932388","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/01/24/2002773-mel.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:10:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":395523822,"title":"Iran will treat any attack as 'all-out war against us'","text":"Iran will treat any attack \"as an all-out war against us,\" a senior ‍Iranian official has said, ahead of the arrival of a US military ​aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the ⁠coming days. \"This military buildup - we hope it is not intended for real confrontation - but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,\" said the senior Iranian official on Friday, speaking on ‌condition of anonymity. \"This time ​we will treat any attack - limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they ‍call it - as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,\" the official said. President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States had an \"armada\" heading toward Iran but ​hoped he would not have to use ‌it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program. \"If the ​Americans violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,\" said the ‍Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like. \"A country under constant military threat from the United States has ​no ​option but to ensure that ​everything at its disposal can be used ​to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,\" the official said.

The truth, his critics say, is that Trump aims to gain “total access” to Greenland’s untapped mineral resources first, before others find a chance.\n\nIMAGE CREDIT: Anti-Trump protesters in Copenhagen / January 10, 2026 (Photo by Bloomberg)","summary":"A new poll has found that in some of Europe's largest countries, more people see the US president as an \"enemy\" rather than a \"friend\" and ally of the Europeans.","url":"https://www.radiohc.cu/en/poll-shows-more-europeans-view-trump-as-enemy-rather-than-friend/","image":"https://www.radiohc.cu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4e112248-6dda-4c96-b7ab-4da9bcaf4388.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:04:53","author":"Ed Newman","authors":["Ed Newman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CU","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":395525110,"title":"UK PM slams Trump for saying NATO troops avoided Afghan front line","text":"LONDON, United Kingdom — UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Friday denounced as 'insulting' President Donald Trump's claim that troops from NATO allies avoided the front line in Afghanistan, as anger grows at the US president's remarks.In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Trump appeared unaware that 457 British soldiers were among NATO troops who died during the conflict in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.'They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,' Trump told the US outlet, referring to NATO allies.'And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,' he added, triggering outrage across the political divide in Britain.Trump also repeated his suggestion that NATO would not come to the aid of the US if asked to do so.In fact, following the 9/11 attacks, the UK and several European countries joined the US in Afghanistan after it invoked NATO's collective security clause for the first and only time.Soldiers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and others also died in the conflict.'Let me start by paying tribute to 457 of our armed services who lost their lives in Afghanistan,' Starmer said in a video message.'There are many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries, and so I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly, appalling, and I'm not surprised they've caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.'He said that if he had misspoken in such a way, he 'would certainly apologise'.The White House rejected Starmer's comments and defended the president.'President Trump is absolutely right — the United States of America has done more for NATO than any other country in the alliance has done combined,' Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement sent to AFP.'Heroes'Poland's Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said he expected respect for Polish veterans 'who have proven how much they serve this country and our commitments to allies'.Poland lost 43 soldiers in the conflict in Afghanistan.French armed forces minister Catherine Vautrin said 90 French soldiers died in Afghanistan on operations alongside NATO allies and 'many others' were wounded.'We remember their sacrifice, which commands respect.'UK defence minister John Healey posted on X that the British troops who died were 'heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation'.UK Armed forces minister Al Carns, who served five tours in Afghanistan, said Trump's comments were 'utterly ridiculous'.The leader of the opposition Conservatives, Kemi Badenoch, said Trump's comments were 'complete nonsense' which could weaken the NATO alliance.Even Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration Reform UK party and a long-time Trump supporter rebuked the American leader.'Donald Trump is wrong,' he said on X. 'For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America's in Afghanistan.'Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died aged 18 in Afghanistan, told The Mirror newspaper that Trump's remarks were 'extremely upsetting'.Mark Atkinson, Director General of the veterans' charity, The Royal British Legion, said the service and sacrifice of British troops in Afghanistan 'cannot be called into question'.Prince Harry, who undertook two frontline tours to Afghanistan with the Army Air Corps, also weighed in.'I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,' he said.'Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect.'According to official UK figures, 405 of the 457 British casualties who died in Afghanistan were killed in hostile military action.The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.More than 150,000 UK armed forces personnel served in Afghanistan between September 2001 and August 2021, the Ministry of Defense said, making the UK the second-largest contributor to the US-led force there.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/24/world/americas-emea/uk-pm-slams-trump-for-saying-nato-troops-avoided-afghan-front-line/2264596","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/24/911087.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:04:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":395524954,"title":"Just deserts","text":"THE Europeans have had a dispiriting week. In the snowy landscape of Davos, leaders of the major European nations had to have a huddle about US President Donald Trump’s escalating rhetoric on taking over Greenland. There were righteous speeches and statements by them about how such a takeover would be the end of the rules-based international order. Canada, which Trump had also threatened with a takeover, got into the game, too, with Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying the rupture in North Atlantic relations and the imminence of a world where force eliminates respect for sovereignty.\n\nIt was oddly gratifying to see the world’s political and economic elite, mostly white men and some white women, having to consider how devastating attacks on sovereignty can be and how a superpower gone rogue is a global threat. The rest of the world saw this face of the US post 9/11, in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, both under the label of ‘protecting US national security’. At that time, Europe joined forces with the US. So, why is Denmark suddenly so bothered with the details of sovereignty, especially given its part in the US-led Nato effort in Afghanistan? Nor did the US care when Barack Obama ordered unmanned aerial bombings of places in Pakistan. Definitions were altered to justify the US bombings in Yemen as well.\n\nAll this is to underscore that the international rules-based order that all the white men in Davos are weeping for died a long time ago. Or perhaps their tears simply affirm the truth that these rules were never considered applicable when the sovereignty of various brown and black people was at stake to ensure no one attacked the lands of the white colonisers.\n\n Europe has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.\n\nThe irony of the moment where one colonising power (Denmark) insists that its rights over Greenland are more legitimate than the rights of another (the US, a settler colonial country) must be noted. Listening to Carney’s much-lauded speech, for instance, it was impossible not to recall that Canada’s white people stole land from the First Nations. The temerity of white men who rule stolen lands and then chastise the world about further theft of land represents the disordered ethics that have made white and Western cooperation against the rest of the world a ‘legitimate’ exercise.\n\nDenmark established trade relations in Greenland and its representatives set up outposts on the territory. The Danes realised they had made enough inroads to take over. They then imposed a trade monopoly on Greenland and what had been a trading company transformed itself into an administrative state.\n\nIn all the outcry, no one has acknowledged that Greenland’s indigenous Kalaallit populations don’t want to be ruled by either Denmark or the US. As Vijay Prashad of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research notes: “Greenland is always a place that someone else must hold, but not the Kalaallit. For people like Trump, or indeed for generations of Danish prime ministers (despite soft statements about the path to self-determination), the Kalaallit have no role as political subjects.” The true solution is not some backroom deal where the US can get what it wants while leaving Denmark with face-saving control, but a return of Greenland to its people.\n\nThe entire debacle underscores what the rules-based international order was really for. True to its origins, which go back to the time when the Great Powers carved up what remained of the Ottoman Empire, the rules-based international order ensures that white and Western nations, either colonisers or settler col-onialists, do not mess with each other’s illegitimate claims on ter-ritory. It also exi-sts to legitimise the use of force impacting the sovereignty of brown and black countries when the aggressor is one of its own.\n\nFor most of the world, the international rules-based order has never provided safety. The brutish world where force means the power to bully is one which everyone, except white and Western countries, has experienced. Currently, Europe is in a bind. It had saved money by not spending on military and defence, which allowed Europeans to have easy lifestyles. Europe has now discovered it has no recourse against Trump.\n\nWhatever happens to Greenland, Europe, home to so many colonising powers that caused devastation and pain around the world, is getting its just deserts. Its weak economy and ageing populations are festering problems which America under Trump is likely to exploit. It’s possible that Europe, while superficially independent, will be reduced to a functional colony of the US — dependent economically and militarily on the Americans. If it does, history will have come full circle: that which Europe did to others will now be done to Europe.\n\nThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\n\nrafia.zakaria@gmail.com\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2026","summary":"THE Europeans have had a dispiriting week.

The potential cut ties are related to talks of Port KC selling additional land to the company and would not directly change anything happening with the warehouse facility in question.\n\nPort KC, which helps carry out big development projects in Kansas City by offering financial incentive plans, has worked with local firm Platform Ventures to build out a large industrial park on the city’s far south side, near Grandview and Belton.\n\nThat partnership over the past few years has resulted in what is now known as the I-49 Industrial Center, with multiple warehouse-type buildings in the area of the former Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base.\n\nBut the Port KC Board of Commissioner’s agenda for Monday includes an item that would cut off ties with Platform Ventures that would signal its disapproval of the company’s alleged plans to turn a warehouse into an ICE detention center for in KC.\n\nCutting off Platform Ventures\n\nPast reporting shows that Platform Ventures is a big player in Kansas City real estate and development and has been tied to high-profile projects like the redevelopment of the old Kansas City Club building downtown that houses Hotel Kansas City. Brothers Ryan and Terry Anderson are co-founders and co-presidents of the company, according to their LinkedIn profiles and since-removed pages on the company’s website.\n\nAccording to a proposed resolution that the Port KC board will vote on, Platform Ventures and its affiliates own or control about 195 acres of property in the area of the industrial park. Port KC owns more land to the south, in an area the agency calls 49 Crossing, and has sought further development on it.\n\nThe agenda item says that Platform Ventures has expressed interest in buying an additional 305 acres from Port KC for more industrial development in the 49 Crossing area.\n\nBut while negotiating the sale of that additional land, Port KC learned that Platform Ventures “intends to sell” an approximately 1 million-square-foot facility in the industrial park, “to the federal government for use as a detention facility by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” according to Port KC documents.\n\nSuch a sale would come as President Donald Trump’s administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, detention and deportation efforts over the past year.\n\n“That sale is inconsistent with the intended industrial use that was represented to Port KC and which would have benefited the public good through increased tax revenues to the relevant taxing jurisdiction, the creation of new jobs, and the remediation of blight,” the agenda item says.\n\n“The sale of land that might be used in a manner that is inconsistent with Port KC’s statutory mission and community expectations is not in the public interest.”\n\nThe Port KC board is expected to vote on Monday whether to terminate any negotiations with Platform Ventures for the sale of additional land in the area. Officials would be directed to pursue other offers.\n\nICE facility in KC?\n\nPrevious reports have indicated that federal agents visited a large warehouse tied to Platform Ventures at 14901 Botts Rd. last week. Jackson County Legislative Chair Manny Abarca said that DHS agents told him on site that ICE and DHS are planning to build a detention facility with capacity for about 7,500 beds there.\n\nThe roughly 920,000-square-foot space was built in 2023, with Port KC help, as a speculative warehouse.\n\nPlatform Ventures said in a statement last week that it received an “unsolicited offer” on “a vacant, industrial warehouse” in October and that “negotiations are complete.” The company did not say who made the offer.\n\nPort KC reiterated on Friday that the warehouse property is not Port KC’s to sell and that Platform Ventures does not need Port KC’s permission to sell it.\n\nKansas City’s zoning code indicates that the warehouse could theoretically be used for a detention center if its owner met certain requirements and obtained a special use permit, which city officials placed a moratorium on approving last week in an effort to block ICE from operating a mass detention center in city limits.\n\nThat said, the possibility of the federal government’s involvement raises questions about the city’s ability to block an ICE detention site, experts told The Star. Depending on how things play out, the moratorium could be challenged in court, and Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas has vowed to “use all available legal tools to enforce the moratorium” and fight any future facility.\n\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2026 at 7:03 PM.","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article314433588.html","image":"https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/3nijij/picture314349116/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_SouthKC_011626_EJC_001.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:03:01","author":null},{"id":395524708,"title":"Nicola Peltz gave 'It's me or her ultimatum' to Brooklyn Beckham after Victoria's 'inappropriate' wedding dance - as Posh is pictured for the first time since his scathing statement","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 24th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'She trusted people and paid the ultimate price': Parents of 'girl in the helmet' waitress cruelly blamed for Swiss inferno speak out\n\nThe mother of four - and force of nature - battling the politicians who think it's OK to dump hundreds of young migrant men on her pretty little town in Sussex\n\nAt least have the guts to say sorry, Mr Trump!

Unfortunately Brooklyn wasn't able to stand up for his mum and explain to Nicola that she'd massively overreacted.'\nThe butler added: 'After the dance row, she told Brooklyn in regard to David and Victoria: \"I don't want to be around them, and you have a decision to make: Me or her\". She gave him an ultimatum and he was helpless in that scenario to do anything other than choose his wife.'\nThe publication further claims that Nicola has 'put her foot down' and said 'I'm not going' to any invitation from David and Victoria.\nDespite Brooklyn trying to 'talk sense into Nicola', she allegedly won't budge and instead backs down.\nThe Spice Girls star kept a low profile in a black hat which covered her eyes as she was seen being driven in a Mercedes in her first sighting.\nBrooklyn stated in an explosive six-page statement on Monday that Victoria had 'hijacked' his first dance with his wife and 'danced very inappropriately on me', leaving him 'uncomfortable and humiliated'.\nNicola, 31, was left devastated by the three-minute dance to a love song performed on stage by Latin artist Marc Anthony - and left the room in tears.\nHer family went after Nicola and Brooklyn looked humiliated and also went to find his new wife after the 'awkward' dance took place, says DJ Fat Tony who performed at the wedding. \n\nBrooklyn and Nicola finally broke cover earlier this week after the aspiring chef took to Instagram to call out his mother on his wedding day\n\nAll episodes\n\nThe Spice Girls star, 51, kept a low profile in a black hat which covered her eyes as she was seen being driven in a Mercedes by a male companion\nSpeaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, the DJ said at one point Brooklyn's hands were on his mother's waist while her arms were placed around his neck.\n‘The timing was inappropriate for me. It was meant to be a bride and groom’s moment,' he told us.\n‘It was in the heat of the moment. Brooklyn left right after the dance. Nicola left the room and afterwards he went after her.\n‘Nicola’s family left, they went after their daughter... Marc Anthony is a Latin singer. It was a love song.'\nWhen asked if Brooklyn had his hands on Victoria’s hips, he said: 'Well, yeah. It was slow dancing, it wasn’t like some samba number. Victoria had her arms around his neck.\n‘Families don’t get on sometimes. It’s not the Waltons, it’s the Beckhams. I’m sure they don’t all go to bed at night and say good night and switch the lights off like the Waltons do.\n‘There are problems with every family, this one just happened to be played out publicly.' \nHe went on: ‘Brooklyn is a friend of mine. The whole situation is just awful, the way it’s played out so publicly. \n\nThe star kept her head low after her son released a scathing six page rant earlier this week\n\nDJ Fat Tony branded Victoria's 'inappropriate' dancing as 'really awkward' and confirmed that Nicola fled the reception in tears\n\nTony, a longtime friend of the Beckhams, claimed that Marc Anthony was to blame, revealing the musician had called Victoria to the dance floor with her son \n\nNicola, 31, was left devastated by the three-minute dance to a love song performed on stage by Latin artist Marc Anthony - and left the room in tears\n‘Families are families, I don’t know what started it. At one point someone might say something publicly.’\nHe continued: ‘Brooklyn is upset about a lot of things, sometimes the smallest of things can become bigger the biggest of things, because it highlights it.\n‘I’m not speaking bad about either party in it, I’m just putting the narrative straight about the dance.\n‘I’ve talked about it because someone needs to speak about it, and here is what it is. I didn’t make it about me, Brooklyn or the Beckhams, it was just about the situation.\n‘Although people have laughed at the memes and they have been incredible, there are still two people here that are in pain. We have to remember that.\n‘Everyone needs to let it die down now.’\nThe Daily Mail has contacted representatives for Brooklyn and Nicola for comment.\nFat Tony's new remarks come after he confirmed the exact nature of Victoria's 'inappropriate' dance with son Brooklyn on Friday's This Morning. \n\nHer family went after Nicola and Brooklyn looked humiliated after the 'awkward' dance took place, says DJ Fat Tony who performed at the wedding (pictured in February)\n\nNicola Peltz’s wedding DJ Fat Tony has sensationally claimed her whole family stormed out of the wedding during Victoria Beckham’s dance with Brooklyn\n\n'Victoria was thrown into that situation, and I think too much has been read into it,' Tony said\n\nThe 60-year-old branded the incident 'really awkward' and confirmed that Nicola fled the reception in tears.\nTony, a longtime friend of the Beckhams, claimed that Marc Anthony was to blame, revealing the musician had called Victoria to the dance floor with her son and instructed him, 'place your hands on your mother's hips'.\nSpeaking on Friday's episode of ITV's This Morning, Tony shared: 'There was no slut-dropping, there was no PVC cat suits, no Spice Girl action!\n'The word \"inappropriate\", why I said it was as well, it was the timing, this is what happened.'\nTony continued: 'What happened was, basically, Marc Anthony was performing on stage, he then called Brooklyn onto stage.\n'Brooklyn went on to the stage, and the next minute everyone’s expecting Nicola to go up and do the first dance, and then Marc asked for the most beautiful woman in the room to come to the stage - and then he says \"Victoria, come to the stage\".'\nHe revealed that Brooklyn looked 'devastated' at the fact his first dance was with Victoria and not his wife, adding that Nicola left the room 'crying her eyes out'.\nTony went on: 'Brooklyn is stuck there on stage, and they do this dance, and Marc Anthony says \"put your hands on your mother's hips\" and it was a Latin thing, and the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room…\n'I’ve done an awful lot of Beckham parties in the past, and they are a very dancing close-knit family and love to dance, right? So you know, what we deem as \"inappropriate\" is not how Brooklyn feels.\n'This is all about how Brooklyn feels. If he feels that it was inappropriate and awkward, it was inappropriate and awkward.\n'What’s sad is that this is the bit that everyone's taken from the statement, and kind of whitewashed everything else that went on.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicola Peltz gave 'It's me or her ultimatum' to Brooklyn Beckham after Victoria's 'inappropriate' wedding dance - as Posh is pictured for the first time since his scathing statement\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 118\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The faith leaders gathered at the airport to protest deportation flights and urge airlines to call for an end to to what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\nThe clergy were issued misdemeanor citations of trespassing and failure to comply with a peace officer and were then released, said Jeff Lea, a Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman. They were arrested outside the main terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport because they went beyond the reach of their permit for demonstrating and disrupted airline operations, he said.\n\nRev. Mariah Furness Tollgaard of Hamline Church in St. Paul said police ordered them to leave but she and others decided to stay and be arrested to show support for migrants, including members of her congregation who are afraid to leave their homes. She planned to go back to her church after her brief detention to hold a prayer vigil.\n\n“We cannot abide living under this federal occupation of Minnesota,” Tollgaard said.\n\nProtesters demand ICE leave Minnesota\n\nThe Rev. Elizabeth Barish Browne traveled from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to participate in the rally in downtown Minneapolis, where the high temperature was minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 degrees Celsius) despite a bright sun.\n\n“What’s happening here is clearly immoral,” the Unitarian Universalist minister said. “It’s definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that’s dangerous to us is not the weather.”\n\nProtesters have gathered daily in the Twin Cities since Jan. 7, when 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.\n\nSam Nelson said he skipped work so he could join the march. He said he’s a former student of the Minneapolis high school where federal agents detained someone after class earlier this month. That arrest led to altercations between federal officers and bystanders.\n\n“It’s my community,” Nelson said. “Like everyone else, I don’t want ICE on our streets.”\n\nOrganizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups.\n\nDetention of a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old\n\nA 2-year-old was reunited with her mother Friday, a day after she was detained with her father outside of their home in South Minneapolis, lawyer Irina Vaynerman told The Associated Press.\n\nVaynerman said they had quickly challenged the family’s detention in federal court. The petition states that the child, a citizen of Ecuador, was brought to the U.S. as a newborn. The child and her father, Elvis Tipan Echeverria, both have a pending asylum application and neither are subject to final orders of removal.\n\nA U.S. district judge on Thursday had barred the government from transferring the toddler out of state, but she and her father were on a commercial flight to Texas about 20 minutes later, according to court filings. They were flown back Friday.\n\nAgents arrested Tipan Echeverria during a targeted operation, according to a DHS statement said. DHS said the child’s mother was in the area but refused to take the child.\n\nVaynerman rejected that explanation, saying Tipan Echeverria was “not allowed” to bring his 2-year-old to her mother inside their home.\n\nDHS repeated its allegation Friday that the father of 5-year-old Liam Ramos abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday, leading to the child being detained, too.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Liam was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, “fled from the scene.” The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Center in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get Liam’s mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.\n\nThe family’s attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was “used as bait.”\n\nProkosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam’s father has a criminal history.\n\nOn Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from Liam’s detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.\n\nDetails from Good’s autopsy\n\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from “multiple gunshots wounds.”\n\nA more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good’s family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released Wednesday through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren’t immediately life-threatening.\n\nAntonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and “hope that they communicate with Renee’s family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.”\n\nA spokesperson for the firm said there were no funeral plans to share yet.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Tiffany Stanley in Washington, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas, and Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-immigration-ice-minnesota-rally_n_697416b7e4b0bae0f7818895?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/697416b9220000e3006d8763.jpeg?cache=HyxBShTuVc&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 00:57:01","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":395524300,"title":"Melania Trump Faces Ticket Sales Humiliation While Jeff Bezos Splashes 75 Million To Save The Glossy Project","text":"Reports about slow ticket sales for Melania Trump’s upcoming documentary have been circulating online. Although no one has ever seen the film in full, it has already faced mockery and backlash from critics, who have called it a waste of time. Luckily for the FLOTUS, her husband, President Donald Trump, is a very powerful man and has a wide network of friends who are willing to rescue them in times of need.\n\nRadar Online reported that Jeff Bezos is throwing a lot of money at the problem. It is claimed that Amazon MGM Studios has committed $75 million to acquire and market the film, despite insiders saying it is struggling to gain traction with audiences before its January 30 theatrical release.\n\nThe investment breaks down plainly: forty million for the distribution rights, thirty-five million for marketing. For a documentary about the First Lady’s twenty days leading up to her husband’s inauguration, it’s an enormous bet. But Bezos isn’t leaving anything to chance.\n\nAs if that is not enough, Jeff Bezos has reportedly dispatched execs to host red-carpet premieres in nearly 24 cities, which include the world premiere at the Kennedy Center. Amid the backlash, early projections suggest a whooping $5 million opening weekend.\n\nMELANIA, The Film\nHow a First Lady’s history begins.\nOne Moment In Time, Captured – 20 days before the U.S. Presidential inauguration.\nMelania Trump’s Unfiltered Journey—family, business, philanthropy—unprecedented access into this very private person’s life (@flotus).\nOnly… pic.twitter.com/AwMTGYwE6t\n— Marc Beckman | Some Future Day (@MarcBeckman) December 17, 2025\n\nMarc Beckman, Melania’s agent and senior advisor, has been out front defending the project. He told Fox News Digital that Melania has been deeply involved from concept to execution. “She is fully committed from the ideation of the concept itself to the creative direction across all touchpoints,” Beckman said. He was careful to draw a distinction that mattered to his client. “This is not a documentary. This is a film.”\n\nThe reframing is deliberate. Documentaries are observational. Films are crafted experiences. Beckman emphasized that Melania Trump wanted to “create a very rich, cinematic experience unlike anything that has been created before.” The film will screen in 1,400 theaters across 27 countries—unusually wide distribution for a documentary, which typically plays in limited release.\n\nWhat’s in it? Beckman laid it out: “She brings the audience into certain moments—interacting with her husband; the U.S. Secret Service for security; geopolitical moments; moments with world leaders; and—of course, for those who want it—there are tons of fashion here.” The emphasis on fashion makes sense. Melania has built her public identity around style. Her inaugural gown alone generated headlines and fashion analysis for weeks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has previously said that Melania’s documentary is worth watching. “I’ve seen pieces of it, it’s incredible,” the father of Barron shared.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump talks about her upcoming film, titled MELANIA:\n“A first of its kind, capturing the 20 days of my life before the inauguration. 20 intense days of transformation from private citizen to First Lady.”\nMELANIA will be released in theaters on January 30,… pic.twitter.com/RDl4pRkK2k\n— FLOTUS Report (@MELANIAJTRUMP) November 7, 2025\n\nThe POTUS then compared it to the FLOTUS’s memoir, published in October 2024 and instantly a number-one bestseller. “She did a book, and the book was a big number one bestseller, and this is a movie, and it seems to be captivating a lot of people’s attention,” Donald Trump stated, though early sales data suggest the captivation may not be translating to tickets.\n\nThe documentary’s origins trace back to Mar-a-Lago. Melania pitched the project to Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez, at Trump’s Palm Beach estate. Both showed their support by attending the inauguration prominently. That alignment is significant. Bezos doesn’t typically involve himself in political projects. His decision to back this one, and to back it so heavily, suggests either confidence in the product or a desire to maintain goodwill with the incoming administration.\n\nThe film itself diverges from Melania’s memoir in scope and subject matter. While the book covered her childhood in Slovenia and her rise to First Lady, the movie focuses exclusively on a compressed twenty-day period.","summary":"Jeff Bezos invests $75 million in Melania Trump's documentary as ticket sales struggle to gain momentum.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/melania-trump-faces-ticket-sales-humiliation-while-jeff-bezos-splashes-75-million-to-save-the-glossy-project","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-88.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 00:55:24","author":"Jaja Agpalo","authors":["Jaja Agpalo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.086},{"id":395522710,"title":"Trump says US VP headed to Azerbaijan, Armenia next month","text":"US President Donald Trump on Friday thanked the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia for upholding the peace agreement.

(AP) — California sued the federal government Friday for approving a Texas-based company’s plans to restart two oil pipelines along the state’s coast, escalating a fight over the Trump administration’s removal of regulatory barriers to offshore oil drilling for the first time in decades.\n\nThe administration has hailed the project by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill as the kind of project President Donald Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production.\n\nThe state oversees the pipelines that run through Santa Barbara and Kern counties, said Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta.\n\n“The federal administration has no right to usurp California’s regulatory authority,” he said at a news conference. “We’re taking them to court to draw a line in the sand and to protect our coast, beaches and communities from potentially hazardous pipelines.”\n\nBut the U.S. Transportation Department agency that approved Sable’s plan pushed back on the lawsuit.\n\n“Restarting the Las Flores Pipeline will bring much needed American energy to a state with the highest gas prices in the country,” said a spokesperson with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n\nSable did not respond for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse former President Joe Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden’s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.\n\nThe federal administration in November announced plans for new offshore oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts, which the oil industry has backed for years.\n\nBut critics say the plans could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.\n\nBonta said one of the pipelines Sable wants to restart burst in 2015, spilling oil along the Southern California coast. The event was the state’s worst oil spill in decades. More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. It polluted a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.\n\nThe drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered.\n\nSable has faced a slew of legal challenges but has said it is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say.

The faith leaders gathered at the airport to protest deportation flights and urge airlines to call for an end to to what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.The clergy were issued misdemeanor citations of trespassing and failure to comply with a peace officer and were then released, said Jeff Lea, a Metropolitan Airports Commission spokesman. They were arrested outside the main terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport because they went beyond the reach of their permit for demonstrating and disrupted airline operations, he said.Rev. Mariah Furness Tollgaard of Hamline Church in St. Paul said police ordered them to leave but she and others decided to stay and be arrested to show support for migrants, including members of her congregation who are afraid to leave their homes. She planned to go back to her church after her brief detention to hold a prayer vigil. \"We cannot abide living under this federal occupation of Minnesota,\" Tollgaard said. Protesters demand ICE leave MinnesotaThe Rev. Elizabeth Barish Browne traveled from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to participate in the rally in downtown Minneapolis, where the high temperature was minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 degrees Celsius) despite a bright sun.Live Events\"What's happening here is clearly immoral,\" the Unitarian Universalist minister said. \"It's definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that's dangerous to us is not the weather.\"Protesters have gathered daily in the Twin Cities since Jan. 7, when 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.Sam Nelson said he skipped work so he could join the march. He said he's a former student of the Minneapolis high school where federal agents detained someone after class earlier this month. That arrest led to altercations between federal officers and bystanders.\"It's my community,\" Nelson said. \"Like everyone else, I don't want ICE on our streets.\"Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\"We're achieving something historic,\" said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups. Detention of a 2-year-old and a 5-year-oldA 2-year-old was reunited with her mother Friday, a day after she was detained with her father outside of their home in South Minneapolis, lawyer Irina Vaynerman told The Associated Press.Vaynerman said they had quickly challenged the family's detention in federal court. The petition states that the child, a citizen of Ecuador, was brought to the U.S. as a newborn. The child and her father, Elvis Tipan Echeverria, both have a pending asylum application and neither are subject to final orders of removal.A U.S. district judge on Thursday had barred the government from transferring the toddler out of state, but she and her father were on a commercial flight to Texas about 20 minutes later, according to court filings. They were flown back Friday.Agents arrested Tipan Echeverria during a targeted operation, according to a DHS statement said. DHS said the child's mother was in the area but refused to take the child.Vaynerman rejected that explanation, saying Tipan Echeverria was \"not allowed\" to bring his 2-year-old to her mother inside their home.DHS repeated its allegation Friday that the father of 5-year-old Liam Ramos abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday, leading to the child being detained, too.Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Liam was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, \"fled from the scene.\" The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Center in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get Liam's mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.The family's attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was \"used as bait.\" Prokosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam's father has a criminal history. On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from Liam's detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.Details from Good's autopsyThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from \"multiple gunshots wounds.\"A more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good's family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released Wednesday through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren't immediately life-threatening.Antonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and \"hope that they communicate with Renee's family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.\"A spokesperson for the firm said there were no funeral plans to share yet.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontollgaardprokoschicedhsvaynermantipan echeverrialiamminneapoliszena stenvikminnesotathe\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News ontollgaardprokoschicedhsvaynermantipan echeverrialiamminneapoliszena stenvikminnesotathe","summary":"Protests erupted across Minnesota against federal immigration crackdowns.

Wade.\n\nVice President JD Vance’s remarks at the pre-march rally, in which he highlighted the administration’s pro-life record, were met with a warm reception by the crowd.\n\n“You know he loves and cares deeply about this movement,” Vance said, after a video message from the president was played. “It’s why he has fought for the pro-life cause and why we do it in this administration.”\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade, he said, was a defining achievement. \n\n“Three years ago — we cannot forget — he delivered, and his Supreme Court justices delivered, the most important Supreme Court decision of my lifetime,” Vance said.\n\nThe vice president went on to list the administration’s pro-life initiatives, drawing repeated applause from the crowd. His remarks were, however, interrupted several times by small groups of demonstrators chanting, “Ban the abortion pill!”\n\nThose interruptions underscored broader tensions within the pro-life movement. Vance’s appearance comes as several pro-life leaders have voiced disappointment with President Trump for failing, thus far, to use the full authority of his office to advance key protections for the unborn.\n\nChief among their concerns is the administration’s failure to restore restrictions on the abortion pill that were rolled back by President Joseph Biden, including the requirement that the abortion drug mifepristone be dispensed only after an in-person visit with a physician. Trump’s recent call for Republicans in Congress to “be a little flexible,” on the Hyde Amendment, which bars taxpayer funding of abortion, further fueled doubts about whether the administration is aligned with the movement’s priorities.\n\nAhead of the march, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said President Trump had an opportunity to be a “hero” for the movement by committing to what she described as its most urgent policy priorities: action on abortion drugs and a recommitment to the Hyde Amendment. In the end, neither Trump, in his video message pledging his support for the pro-life cause, nor Vance, in his speech, would make such a commitment.\n\nSeveral of the marchers the Register spoke with shared Dannenfelser’s concerns. \n\nRandall Terry, the founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, who was among those who interrupted Vance’s speech, said that he is “forever grateful” to President Trump, who he said became his hero when he nominated justices who ended Roe v. Wade. However, Terry said, Trump has the power to save lives of the unborn but hasn’t exercised it. \n\n“Over 60% of all babies who die from abortion are being killed by the abortion pill, and the Trump administration has the ability to rein it in or to abolish it altogether,” Terry said. “They’re in charge of the FDA and HHS. In 2019, the number of children killed was down to just over 600,000. Now, because of the abortion pill, it’s over 1.1 million,” he said.\n\nAnne Bolenbaugh, 21, who attended the march with a group of students from Gettysburg College, said that restricting abortion-pill access should be a priority, adding that she is not sure whether Trump sees it that way.\n\n“Obviously, we can hope and pray that he’ll do it, but I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going through his head right now,” Bolenbaugh said.\n\nAs for Vance, she thinks he could show a greater commitment to protecting the unborn.\n\n“I’d like him to stick up for us more consistently throughout all of his policies, I think. It’s great that he showed up today, but I think in every area of his political interest, there’s room for him to be fully dedicated to the pro-life cause,” she said.\n\nOthers expressed a mix of gratitude and frustration.\n\nBretton White, who traveled from Fredericksburg, Virginia, with his wife Mary and their 9-month-old daughter Alice Maria, told the Register that he is heartened by Trump’s pro-life wins.\n\n“I wish it [restoring restrictions on the abortion pill] was more of a priority for the entirety of the administration,” White said. “But honestly, it’s hard not to take the victories after so many losses in the last decade or so. I think in the last couple of years, when you’ve seen the conservative movement and the rise of Catholicism in America, it’s a bright future looking forward. I’m glad to see so many people out here looking forward to protecting life because it’s inherently valuable,” he said.\n\nCraig Philpot, 72, and wife Kim, 65, attended are involved with 40 Days for Life and local pro-life efforts in Birmingham.\n\n“We had a march in Birmingham for 30 or 40 years, and that ended with Roe v. Wade ending,” Kim said. “We started coming here because there’s no abortion in Alabama.”\n\nCraig said he believes Trump has been the most pro-life president to date. “Thank God we don’t have Roe v. Wade,” he said. “And hopefully we’ll have restrictions on the chemical abortion pills.”\n\nKim cautioned that rolling back access to abortion pills may prove difficult.\n\n“Once you let the genie out of the bottle, I’m not sure how you get it back in,” she said. “But we can pray, and we can offer alternatives. In Birmingham, we have pro-life ministries, free ultrasounds, and resources for mothers. We try to offer a better alternative than death.”\n\nBill Jacquet, an 83-year-old deacon with the Archdiocese of Baltimore, said the administration should be commended for what it has done for the pro-life cause, adding that it still has fallen short. \n\n“Of course, they haven’t done enough,” he said. “But I’ll give them credit — they did defund Planned Parenthood for a year. I’m much more encouraged by JD Vance, and I was happy to hear he’s ready to have a fourth child.”\n\nCharles Jenkins of Durham, North Carolina, praised the role Trump’s judicial appointments played in overturning Roe, but said the president’s support for the pro-life cause has since waned.\n\n“I think that achievement needs to be celebrated,” Jenkins said. “But over the past year and a half, Trump has signaled that he feels his end of the deal was fulfilled. Since then, support has been weak — from pushing flexibility on the Hyde Amendment to supporting IVF and suggesting some states have gone too far in their abortion laws.”\n\nAsked whether he expected an announcement from the Trump administration that they would seek to restrict access to the abortion pill, Jenkins said he was not optimistic.\n\n“I wasn’t hopeful, but it would have pleased me immensely,” he said. “A small part of me hoped against hope. But ultimately, this is what I expected.”\n\nRichard Hayden, 67, of Alexandria, Virginia, said progress takes time.\n\n“They’ve done a lot of great things policy-wise,” Hayden said. “The biggest issue now is abortion medication. I know they’re working on it, but it takes time to undo what the last administration did.”\n\nHayden added that he was encouraged by what he heard from pro-life leaders the day before the march.\n\n“They talked about a new office on family life and how committed the cabinet is,” he said. “They even mentioned that, collectively, cabinet members have 68 children — soon to be 69, with Vice President Vance’s wife pregnant.”\n\nFor some younger marchers, optimism remains strong.\n\nMadeline Brougher, 18, of Whittier, California, who prays outside her local abortion facility, attended her first March for Life this year. “I’m very happy with what they’re doing,” she said. “It’s in small amounts, but it will happen soon enough.”\n\nShe added that policy alone cannot resolve the issue.\n\n “No matter what happens, people will always find a way,” she said. “We have to have faith that God will lead us. If the abortion pill is destroyed, it’s his plan. If not, we pray for those who are taking it and help them.”\n\nSara Hassel, 23, a student at Texas State University and vice president of her campus Turning Point USA chapter, said she shares many of the movement’s concerns about Trump but is looking to Vance as a possible future leader.\n\n“I would like Trump to be more pro-life because [abortion] it is a murder,” Hassel said, adding that she is already thinking ahead to the next election cycle. “JD Vance has stood with the pro-life movement multiple times, and that gives me confidence looking toward 2028.”\n\nStill, she said she remains cautious because of Vance’s support for IVF.\n\n“That’s what throws me off,” Hassel said. “But he’s a good Christian man, and I hope that influences him. Only time will tell — we still have a few more years to see how it plays out.”\n\nRegister staff writer Gigi Duncan contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/news/trump-vance-reaction-at-2026-march-for-life","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20260123180112_374ed016e60c9e9b5020866bb2a1d56701d9a10977646fe7d71d73d511dca94d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 00:47:29","author":"Zelda Caldwell","authors":["Zelda Caldwell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.166},{"id":395476880,"title":"Caribbean Airlines says no eviction underway at Hope Road office","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 23, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Caribbean Airlines says no eviction underway at Hope Road office \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad — Caribbean Airlines says there is no eviction process underway at its Hope Road office in Kingston, Jamaica despite recent media reports.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the company said the decision to relocate its office is aligned with the natural end of the existing lease.

The strikes were conducted as the vessel was travelling along \"narco-trafficking routes\".\n“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” the US Southern Command said.\nThe latest attack is the first one ordered by the US military since President Donald Trump authorised the capture of President Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela earlier this month.\nThe statement added that two \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the operation, and the search for a survivor is underway. The US Southern Command released a video of the strike that showed a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.\nSince early September, the Trump administration has ramped up maritime enforcement off the coast of South America, resulting in over 30 US military strikes against suspected drug-smuggling vessels. According to the Associated Press, these operations have led to the deaths of more than 100 individuals.\nHowever, the US military has shifted its focus to seizing oil tankers linked to Venezuela. Just last week, the US forces in the Caribbean Sea seized an oil tanker that Trump said had ties to Venezuela.\nVenezuelan Parliament banks opening up oil sector\nVenezuelan lawmakers on Thursday gave their initial backing to plans to throw open the oil sector to private investors, paving the way for the return of US energy majors – a key demand of President Donald Trump.\nLess than three weeks after the US ouster of Nicolas Maduro, MPs endorsed on first reading a bill allowing private companies to independently engage in oil exploration and extraction. If adopted on a second reading, the bill would roll back decades of state controls over Venezuela’s oil sector, which were tightened by Maduro’s late mentor, socialist firebrand Hugo Chavez, in the mid-2000s.\nThe bill has been promoted by Maduro’s former deputy, acting president Delcy Rodriguez, who has overseen a lightning-fast thaw in ties with Washington since taking the helm.\nWith inputs from agencies","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-military-strikes-another-vessel-in-eastern-pacific-killing-2-13972001.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/12/Firstpost-2025-12-23T102936.358-2025-12-a1478f3acfa59b46c0e854f839716698.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 00:44:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":395521168,"title":"Iran will treat any attack as ‘all-out war against us,’ says senior Iran official","text":"Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.\n\n“This military buildup - we hope it is not intended for real confrontation - but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n“This time we will treat any attack - limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it - as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.\n\n“If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like.\n\n“A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said.\n\nThe U.S. military has in the past periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.
