You gotta build about five more places,\" Trump said, according to a livestream posted by Bukele's office on X.\n\nTrump later told reporters directly that he was \"studying the laws\" regarding send American criminals to foreign prisons -- which legal experts have said would be unconstitutional.\n\n\"If we can do that, that's good.

And to be very frank, if Kory was running that campaign, I don’t think Mr. Poilievre would be in the position he’s in right now,” Ford said during a press conference in Toronto on April 14.\n\nFord said while there is still time for the Tories to turn their poll numbers around before the April 28 election, and the English and French debates may help them, “the people will decide which way they want this country to move forward.”\n\n“But sometimes, the truth hurts,” he added.\n\nTeneycke, who served as Ford’s campaign manager and helped him win three majority governments, was quoted in a March 27 Toronto Star article saying there is “every buzzer and alarm” going off in the Conservative campaign as polls have shifted in favour of the Liberal Party.\n\nThen, during a Curse of Politics podcast episode on April 10, Teneycke said the Conservatives team had engaged in “campaign malpractice at the highest level” by “blowing a 25-point lead and being like 10 points down.”\n\nRelated StoriesWhy a Pollster Thinks the Tories Need to Emphasize Change, Not Trump3/31/2025Conservatives Will Not Have Candidate in Quebec City Riding After ‘Issue’ With Paperwork4/10/2025\n\nTeneycke has criticized Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s campaign for not pivoting their messaging to focus more on U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe governing Progressive Conservatives’ (PC) 2025 provincial election campaign managed by Teneycke was heavily focused on responding to Trump’s tariffs and his comments on wanting Canada to be a part of the United States, with Ford often wearing a hat that said “Canada Is Not for Sale.” \n\nFord also put on export tariffs on the province’s electricity to the United States, which resulted in Trump threatening to double his tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Following the threat, Ford dropped the export tariffs, saying he secured a meeting with the U.S. secretary of commerce to discuss trade. \n\nTeneycke has also played a key role in shaping the Ford PC’s policies on issues that have high impact in the media. During the pandemic, he was instrumental in ousting PC MPP Rick Nicholls from caucus for refusing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, and appeared in media interviews talking against Nicholls. \n\nFord won his third straight majority government in the Feb. 27 provincial election, winning 80 seats to the NDP at 27 seats, Liberals at 14 seats, and Greens at two seats. Ford said he called the early election because he needed a “clear mandate” from Ontario voters to respond to Trump’s tariffs.\n\nWhile Poilievre’s Conservatives were polling in majority territory in December 2024, the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 6, Mark Carney becoming prime minister on March 14, and Trump’s tariff threats have led to a Liberal resurgence. According to polling aggregator 338Canada, the Liberals have 43 percent support, while the Conservatives are at 38 percent and the NDP are at 9 percent.\n\nHowever, Darrell Bricker, CEO of polling company Ipsos Public Affairs, noted on April 14 that the current polls are showing the Liberal lead becoming smaller and the “federal race tightening” because “anxiety related to Trump and Canada has eased a bit.”\n\nPoilievre has rejected critics who say he should pivot to focus his campaign more on Trump, telling reporters on March 31 that he should continue talking about issues like drug overdoses, the increased usage of food banks, and the country’s housing crisis.\n\n“The unjustified threats by President Trump further strengthen the argument in favour of the ‘Canada First’ agenda that I’ve been fighting for my whole life,” Poilievre said. “We will continue, despite calls to the contrary, to talk about those things even if I am the only leader in the country that offers any change.”","summary":"Ontario Premier Doug Ford has come to the defence of his campaign manager Kory Teneycke, who has accused the federal Conservative team of “malpractice” due to the party&#8217;s slide in the polls. “He’s tough as nails, but he’s the best campaign manager in the country.

You know, if you look at the numbers, the numbers are incredible, actually. The stock market's up. And we're not letting other countries take advantage of this country like they have for the last 40 years,” Trump told reporters.The US President also pointed to tech giant Nvidia's announcement that it will produce artificial intelligence super computers in the United States for the first time as evidence of the success of his tariffs.\"Well, it's one of the biggest announcements you'll ever hear, because Nvidia, as you know, controls almost the entire sector, which is one of most important sectors in the world, between chips and semiconductors and everything else. And they're the biggest,\" Trump said.\"And the reason they did it is because of the election on November 5th and because of a thing called tariffs, as I said, the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he added.President Trump spoke following a turbulent week in the markets, during which his administration rolled back some of its most aggressive tariffs.Global stock markets saw gains on Monday after Trump temporarily eased certain tariffs, and tensions within the US bond market also appeared to lessen.Wall Street was buoyed by strong performances from Apple and other tech companies, following Trump’s announcement that smartphones, computers, and several other electronic products would be exempt from the latest round of tariffs. The move helped prevent potential price hikes for American consumers on goods imported from China.This exemption is expected to benefit US importers, who would otherwise face the difficult choice of either passing on the increased costs to customers or absorbing the financial hit themselves.The US President has also said he plans to provide temporary exemptions to carmakers on his tariffs.“I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office.He explained that the automotive industry needed more time to shift their production from countries like Canada and Mexico back to the United States.\"And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that,” he said.Global stock markets also rebounded as tensions in Trump’s trade war with China - the world’s second-largest economy - began to ease. Market indexes rose by 2.4% in France, 2.9% in Germany, 1.2% in Japan, and 1% in South Korea.","summary":"The US President's remarks follow a global surge in stocks on Monday after he eased some of his tariffs.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/04/15/president-trump-claims-to-have-solved-us-inflation-amid-market-turmoil","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/20/13/80/1440x810_cmsv2_9a28639e-f343-5a96-b951-f19bf7c67649-9201380.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:55:33","author":"Abby Chitty","authors":["Abby Chitty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.046},{"id":311178042,"title":"Diplomatic overtures: Pakistan pursues win-win trade deal with US","text":"ISLAMABAD: The government has reportedly established contact with Washington through diplomatic channels to seek a win-win trade deal, while also engaging local industry stakeholders on the implications of the recent reciprocal tariff announcement by the US President, well-informed sources told Business Recorder.\n\n“We are in contact with the Trump Administration through the Pakistan Embassy in Washington regarding the issue of increased tariffs,” the sources said. “Efforts are underway to initiate formal talks at the government level.

Such an increase could result in a 20–25% decline in exports to the United States, translating into an annual loss of $1.1–$1.4 billion. The textile sector—already burdened with high tariffs—would be particularly affected.\n\nHowever, the Ministry of Commerce disputes the inclusion of the 8.6% MFN tariff in the reciprocal tariff calculation, arguing that MFN tariffs are regulated under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, of which the U.S. is also a member.\n\nThe United States remains Pakistan’s largest single-country trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $5.540 billion during the first nine months (July–March) of FY 2024–25, up 15% from $4.283 billion during the same period in FY 2023–24.\n\nPakistan’s exports to the US grew by 12% to $4.345 billion during the period, compared to $3.889 billion in the corresponding months of the previous fiscal year. Imports from the U.S. also saw significant growth—rising 28% to $1.195 billion from $933.6 million.\n\nThe Pakistan-U.S. trade surplus increased 7%, reaching $3.150 billion during the first nine months of the current fiscal year, up from $2.956 billion in the same period of FY 2023–24.\n\nSources added that the issue of reciprocal tariffs was also raised with a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is maintaining diplomatic engagement with Washington on the matter.\n\nAccording to sources, the Ministry of Commerce has submitted proposals to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has returned them with suggestions for further refinement. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is also holding consultations on the issue.\n\n“We have formulated our strategy with regard to the US, but we cannot disclose it at this stage,” said Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, speaking to Business Recorder. He noted, however, that he had not yet reviewed the policy note released by PIDE.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry is also holding consultations with industry sectors likely to be affected by the proposed U.S. tariff regime. According to internal analysis, Pakistan is expected to face less adverse impact than other countries. For instance, Turkey has a 10% tariff rate but primarily exports denim to the U.S., while Pakistan’s denim exports are relatively limited.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025","summary":"ISLAMABAD: The government has reportedly established contact with Washington through diplomatic channels to seek a win-win trade deal, while also engaging local industry stakeholders on the implications of the recent reciprocal tariff announcement by the US President, well-informed sources told Business Recorder.\n\n\n“We are in contact with the Trump Administration through the Pakistan Embassy in Washington regarding the issue of increased tariffs,” the sources said. “Efforts are underway to initiate formal talks at the government level.

Or you just wait and see what happens and follow our advice which was to stay out of the markets even to see where the indices are for two weeks starting last week and into this one. For instance, on Monday, as India enjoyed a market holiday added to a long weekend, Asia-Pacific markets climbed after US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on some consumer electronics.Hong Kong stocks were up with the Hang Seng index going up almost 2.4%. The Hang Seng tech index is rising. Mainland China's CSI 300 is also rising. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P struck the ASX 200, all of them up more than a percent or a percent and a half.On Wall Street, the main indices were up on Monday morning, but not as much as they would have had President Trump's subsequent statement on tariffs not come. Remember, it's a long weekend by tariff standards. The first announcement opened up a window for electronics imports without the reciprocal tariffs, but the second one subsequently pointed out that there would be a sector of bucket-wise tariffs that would come soon, which was of course logical and expected since the core report has now discovered the ability to find logic even within these seemingly illogical moves.So, the Dow Jones was up 301 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also up on Monday morning. Trump exempted smartphones and computers as well as other devices and components like semiconductors from his new reciprocal tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection guidance issued late Friday.But then, a day later, both Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that the exemptions weren't permanent and that of course stirred up more uncertainty, according to CNBC. Trump said in a social post that these products are still subject to the existing 20% fentanyl tariffs that's on China and they're just moving to a different tariff bucket. So, India could have benefited since it was at a 0% tariff for electronics, including iPhones, that's as of Friday, but obviously only till Sunday, at least, as far as the celebrations go, because China's fentanyl tariff would have kept it at 20%, but then we don't know what the sector-wise tariffs will come at and when, and in which case, whether an iPhone is made in India or China, it could get hit similarly. Though it is, or again, it seems a little logical going by everything that's happened that China could see higher import tariffs going into the United States. Now, India is making progress in its bilateral talks with the US, as we hear, and it's quite likely it will be one of the few countries that will come out less bruised, largely because India has leeway to offer concessions, as we already have from Tesla cars to whisky to Harley Davidson bikes, and more importantly, because the domestic economy is large and we are less export-led than most other countries in the mix right now.Oil Demand Growth Is SlashedThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut its...","url":"https://www.thecore.in/podcasts/markets-digest-fresh-round-of-tariff-volatility-833510","image":"https://www.thecore.in/h-upload/2025/04/14/1055859-e557-1200x630.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:54:05","author":"Govindraj Ethiraj","authors":["Govindraj Ethiraj"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":311175372,"title":"Vance fumbles national football trophy at White House event honoring Ohio State","text":"April 14 (UPI) -- Vice President JD Vance fumbled the NCAA championship football trophy during a celebration with Ohio State on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday.\n\nVance, who graduated with a bachelor's degree from the school in Columbus, attempted to lift up the prize but it bobbled and it separated from its base as the vice president bobbled it in his hands.\n\nAs the Marine Corps Band's rendition of Queen's We Are The Champions continued background, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was standing next to Vance, recovered the fumble -- the main part of the 35-round trophy before it fell to the ground.\n\nVance tilted the trophy instead of raising it straight upward.\n\nThe trophy, which 26.5 inches tall, is made of gold, bronze and stainless steel.

Donald Trump's team has said to have no basis to bring Kilmar Ábrego García back to the US. This is despite a court in Maryland, where Mr Ábrego García lives, ordering the President to return the father. Mr Trump administration officials have today stressed the US has no say in Mr Ábrego García's future. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, who has been a vital partner for the Mr Trump administration in its deportation efforts, said he does not \"have the power to return him to the United States.\" The situation has left Mr Ábrego García's wife Jennifer heartbroken. She said last week: \"If I had all the money in the world , I'd spend it to buy just one thing - a phone call to hear Kilmar's voice again, and have the opportunity to talk to him. \"I miss you so much... And I'm doing the best to fight for you and our children. We are still waiting for that call we were promised. And I'm still holding on to hope.\" The Supreme Court has called for the Mr Trump administration to \"facilitate\" Mr Ábrego García’s return. However, Mr Trump remains stubborn the dad has to stay in El Salvador, which is where he was born. But days after the father was taken into custody there last month, the US government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\". Agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had stopped the man in Maryland as he drove home with his young son. Nicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, questioned the government's claim the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Ábrego García, citing an agreement between the two countries. Mr Ábrego García is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Mr Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison . Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation. More than 6,000 living immigrants in the US , meanwhile, have been classified as \"dead\" by the Donald Trump administration in a brutal move to make them leave the country. The action will hinder the immigrants' ability to work or receive benefits, make it much harder for those affected to use banks or other basic services where Social Security numbers are required. Social Security has wiped the 6,000 people from its system, so their information - needed to secure jobs - has been erased. Mr Trump, 78, has always insisted he would crack down on immigration in his second tenure as President. Last month, he even revoked legal status for more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela in a move for which he was widely condemned.","summary":"Kilmar Ábrego García was wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he is currently housed at a notorious gang prison, but pressure grows on Donald Trump to &quot;facilitate&quot; the man's return","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-not-return-kilmar-35055903","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35055911.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-Meets-With-El-Salvador-President-Nayib-Bukele-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:34:21","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":311178384,"title":"Trump’s tariffs rollercoaster is really about Republican unity","text":"After announcing Liberation Day – stiff “retaliatory” tariffs on every country and penguin-inhabited island in the world – US President Donald Trump rescinded the vast majority of tariffs eight days later when stock and bond markets crashed. \n\nHe followed that with more exemptions for phones, computers and computer chips two days later. Ten percent tariffs remain across the board, along with rates up to 145% on China.\n\nIs Trump aligned with previous Reagan on tariffs?\n\nAs with anything related to Trump, perceptions overwhelm reality. Trump’s showmanship – call him a carnival barker if you must – obfuscates what is really happening. \n\nTrump is seen as a protectionist and a populist. By comparison, former president Ronald Reagan was seen as a principled free trader and more ideologically conservative. Both images are misleading.\n\nReagan slapped tariffs on cars, steel, lumber, computers, computer chips, motorcycles, machine tools, even clothes pins. The great guru of free markets, Milton Friedman, is reported to have said that the Reagan administration has been “making Smoot-Hawley look positively benign.” (Smoot-Hawley was an infamous tariff law enacted in 1930 at the beginning of the Great Depression.)\n\nReagan went back and forth on tariffs, even attacking them in a radio address when Japan tried to impose them. At the end of the day, his record on the issue was as mixed as that of any American president.\n\nTrump’s politics, if not his showmanship, look a lot more like traditional Republican approaches in the cold light of day. The showmanship – provocative statements, grand exaggerations, outright falsehoods and even stand-up-comic-like aspects – is purposeful. \n\nKeeping Republicans united\n\nThe main goal of Trump’s tariff showmanship, largely unreported in the press, is keeping congressional Republicans unified as he pushes his domestic policy agenda of lower taxes, budget cuts, expanded energy production and tougher immigration policies.\n\nCongressional Republicans have been working for months on legislating this agenda through the complex budget reconciliation process. This legislative process is difficult and involves passing budget resolutions through the Senate and the House on a specific schedule. This process is required because it allows for a path around the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate. With only 53 Republican senators and a Democratic Party that is committed to resisting Trump on almost every policy choice, Trump needs the reconciliation process to work this year.\n\nIn one sense, all of Trump’s activities since his inauguration – the “waste”-cutting DOGE, spending cuts, ending foreign aid programs, laying off federal workers – have given him the political space with congressional Republicans, particularly fiscal conservatives, to advance his legislative agenda. It is important to know that Congressional Republicans have been ungovernable for quite some time.\n\nOver the past ten years, there have been five Republican Speakers of the House – John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Patrick McHenry (acting) and now Mike Johnson. This unprecedented turnover is caused by a virtually unmanageable Republican coalition of mainstream business-oriented conservatives and the fiscal hawks who generally populate the Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus is more than willing to vote against other Republicans – indeed they are proud of it. Because of this, speaker after speaker has had to reach out to Democrats for votes to pass legislation, ultimately dooming their time in the position.\n\nTrump has managed to keep this ungovernable group of House Republicans united, and this may be his true political gift. \n\nTo achieve this, he has engaged in a comprehensive campaign of maximum pressure on just about everything: Canada, Greenland, NATO, Europe, China, Ukraine, American universities, federal workers, illegal immigrants, big law firms and even paper straws. \n\nCongressional Republicans, in appreciation of this shock and awe campaign, have stayed united. This means Trump’s legislative agenda can move forward.\n\nWith his global tariff plan, Trump saw Republicans beginning to defect. In one Senate vote in April, four Republicans sided with Democrats against tariffs on Canada. Senator Ted Cruz warned that Republicans might lose the 2026 election because of tariffs. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the oldest senator and one of the most conservative, indicated he would support bringing tariff authority back to Congress and away from the president.\n\nTrump can read a room as well as anyone. When he saw Republican unity was at risk because of his tariff plan, he quickly pivoted to a much more moderate version. While Trump’s grandiosity is often highly criticised, it is that quality that gives him the ability to keep his party together, and therefore to govern.\n\nSparking panic among Democrats\n\nThe other major effect of Trump’s tariffs strategy is to sow discord among his opponents. \n\nDemocrats, who want to criticise Trump but know their own party has often endorsed tariffs in the past, are reeling. Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she understood Trump’s “motivation behind the tariffs” and even agreed with Trump that we “need to make more stuff in America”. She was immediately criticised by fellow Democrats.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, tried a slightly more aggressive anti-Trump approach. He said:\n\nTariffs, when properly utilized, have a role to play in trying to make sure that you have a competitive environment for our workers and our businesses. That’s not what’s going on right now. This is a reckless economic sledgehammer that Donald Trump and compliant Republicans in the Congress are taking to the economy, and the American people are being hurt enough.\n\nThis response won’t help Democrats climb out of their deep hole of unpopularity, measured last month at an historic low.","summary":"The president needs Republican unity to pass his legislative agenda.

They also pressure the university to stop recognizing or funding “any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal harassment.”\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber, in a letter to the Harvard community Monday, said the demands violated the university’s First Amendment rights and “exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI,” which prohibits discrimination against students based on their race, color or national origin.\n\n“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote, adding that the university had taken extensive reforms to address antisemitism.\n\n“These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate,” he wrote. “The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community.”\n\nThe demands of Harvard are part of a broader push of using taxpayer dollars to pressure major academic institutions to comply with President Donald Trump’s political agenda and to influence campus policy. The administration has also argued that universities allowed what it considered to be antisemitism to go unchecked at campus protests last year against Israel’s war in Gaza; the schools deny it.\n\nHarvard is one of several Ivy League schools targeted in a pressure campaign by the administration, which also has paused federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Princeton to force compliance with its agenda. Harvard’s demand letter is similar to the one that prompted changes at Columbia University under the threat of billions of dollars in cuts.\n\nThe demands from the Trump administration prompted a group of alumni to write to university leaders calling for it to “legally contest and refuse to comply with unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and university self-governance.”\n\n“Harvard stood up today for the integrity, values, and freedoms that serve as the foundation of higher education,” said Anurima Bhargava, one of the alumni behind the letter. “Harvard reminded the world that learning, innovation and transformative growth will not yield to bullying and authoritarian whims.”\n\nIt also sparked a protest over the weekend from members of the Harvard community and from residents of Cambridge and a lawsuit from the American Association of University Professors on Friday challenging the cuts.\n\nIn their lawsuit, plaintiffs argue that the Trump administration has failed to follow steps required under Title VI before it starts cutting funds, and giving notice of the cuts to both the university and Congress.\n\n“These sweeping yet indeterminate demands are not remedies targeting the causes of any determination of noncompliance with federal law. Instead, they overtly seek to impose on Harvard University political views and policy preferences advanced by the Trump administration and commit the University to punishing disfavored speech,” plaintiffs wrote.","summary":"The move comes after Harvard said on Monday it won’t comply with the Trump administration’s demands to limit activism on campus.\n\n\nThe post Trump administration freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over campus activism appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/education/2025/04/14/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard-over-campus-activism/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Harvard_Federal_Cuts_13840-67fd6814292bc-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:28:55","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.115},{"id":311176714,"title":"U.S. Army to control land on Mexico border as part of base, migrants could be detained, officials say","text":"A long sliver of federal land along the U.S.-Mexico border that President Donald Trump is turning over to the Department of Defense would be controlled by the Army as part of a base, which could allow troops to detain any trespassers, including migrants, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\n The transfer of that border zone to military control — and making it part of an Army installation — is an attempt by the Trump administration to get around a federal law that prohibits U.S. troops from being used in domestic law enforcement on American soil.\n\n But if the troops are providing security for land that is part of an Army base, they can perform that function. However, at least one presidential powers expert said the move is likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\n The officials said the issue is still under review in the Pentagon, but even as any legal review goes on, the administration's intent is to have troops detain migrants at the border.\n\n The corridor, known as the Roosevelt Reservation, is a 60-foot-wide federal buffer zone that ribbons along the border from New Mexico to California, except where it encounters tribal or privately owned land. It had been run by the Interior Department until Trump directed control be transferred to the Defense Department in a presidential memo released Friday night.\n\n For the next 45 days, the Defense Department will test taking control of a section of the Roosevelt Reservation in New Mexico, east of Fort Huachuca, which is an Army installation in Arizona, one of the US officials said. During that period, the Army will put up additional fencing and signs warning people not to trespass.\n\n People not authorised to be in that area could be arrested by the Army's security forces, the officials said, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.\n\n Any migrants in the country illegally who are detained by military personnel on those lands would be turned over to local civilian law enforcement agencies, the officials said.\n\n Troops are prohibited from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. An exception known as the military purpose doctrine allows it in some cases — but would not apply here and would likely be challenged in the courts, said Elizabeth Gotein, an expert on presidential emergency powers at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n That's because even though troops would be on land designated as an Army installation, they would have to prove that their primary mission there was not to conduct border security and law enforcement — and the whole point of Trump's order transferring the Roosevelt Reservation to the military's control is to secure the border, she said.\n\n The military purpose doctrine “only applies if the law enforcement aspect is incidental,” Gotein said. “Does this (area) have a military purpose that has nothing to do with enforcing customs and security at the border?”","summary":"The transfer of that border zone to military control — and making it part of an Army installation — is an attempt by the Trump administration to get around a federal law that prohibits US troops from being used in domestic law enforcement on American soil","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-army-to-control-land-on-mexico-border-as-part-of-base-migrants-could-be-detained-officials-say/article69450467.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/nxlbf0/article69450623.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Immigration_Border_59608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:26:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":311177140,"title":"‘Fill up today: Petrol prices plummet as global oil market in free fall","text":"Camera IconPetrol prices are tipped to drop even further over the Easter and Anzac Day long weekend as Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff war sends the global oil markets into turmoil.

It is also unconstitutional,\" attorney Luna Droubi said in an email.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014.\n\nHe recently completed coursework at Columbia in New York and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master's degree program there in the fall.\n\nThe petition describes him as a committed Buddhist who believes in \"non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion.\"\n\nArrest 'immoral, inhumane, and illegal'\n\nAs a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and organized campus protests until March 2024.\n\nHe co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia with Mahmoud Khalil, another Palestinian permanent resident of the U.S. and graduate student who recently was detained by ICE.\n\nKhalil was the first person arrested under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.\n\nOn Friday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil can be deported as a national security risk.\n\nChristopher Helali, a friend of Mahdawi who lives near him in Vermont, was present outside the immigration office when Mahdawi was detained and recorded a video of Mahdawi being led away by authorities.\n\nIn the video, which Helali released on social media Monday, Mahdawi is shown giving a peace sign with his hands and being led away to a car.\n\nHelali described Mahdawi as a peaceful demonstrator who has worked to foster dialogue about the struggle of Palestinians in his homeland.\n\nHelali said he and Mahdawi were aware that Mahdawi could be detained today and that his friend went forward with the appointment anyway.\n\n\"And rightfully so, he was nervous for what was going on around him. But he was very much resolute in coming to this interview and coming today because he didn't do anything wrong and was a law-abiding citizen, or soon-to-be citizen,\" Helali said.\n\nVermont's congressional delegation issued a statement condemning Mahdawi's arrest, saying that instead of taking one of the final steps in his citizenship process, he was handcuffed by armed officers with their faces covered.\n\n\"This is immoral, inhumane and illegal. Mr. Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,\" said the statement from Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint.","summary":"A Palestinian man who led protests against the war in Gaza as a student at Columbia University was arrested Monday at a Vermont immigration office where he expected to be interviewed about finalizing his U.S. citizenship, his attorneys said.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mohsen-mahdawi-arrested-1.7510325?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7510331.1744674283!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/immigration-palestinian-student-detained.jpg?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:16:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":311177780,"title":"Photos Show Trump’s Tree-Cutting Rose Garden Transformation","text":"It appears Donald Trump has cut down another tree at the White House. \n\nThis time, it was reportedly a saucer magnolia that sits directly outside the Oval Office—part of an extensive renovation of the storied Rose Garden spearheaded by the 47th president.

Indeed, no other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable—or constitutional—here,” the DOJ attorneys wrote.\n\nXinis wanted the regular updates from the DOJ after she said Friday that the government “failed to comply” with her initial order to address Abrego Garcia’s imprisonment. The DOJ has conceded several times that his deportation to the prison in El Salvador was an “administrative error.”\n\nThe DOJ’s court submission on Monday came more than an hour past the 5 p.m. deadline and after Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele visited Washington and met with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Bukele and administration officials faced questions from the press about Abrego Garcia’s case, leading top Trump officials to emphasize that the Department of Homeland Security believed he was a member of the MS-13 gang based off information the DHS received from an informant years ago.\n\nBukele, for his part, said the question of whether he would release Abrego Garcia and send him back to the United States was “preposterous.”\n\n“How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele said.\n\nIn Monday’s response to the court, the government did not provide any new information except for alerting the court to Bukele’s visit and providing a YouTube link to his remarks.\n\nDeputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a Fox News interview Monday morning that because the government classified MS-13 as a terrorist organization in February, Abrego Garcia could, in fact, be deported to El Salvador even after an immigration court in 2019 barred the government from deporting him to that country because of worries that he would face persecution by gangs there. Miller also emphasized this point from the Oval Office.\n\n“If he was your neighbor, you would move right away,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told a reporter.\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2012 and has been living in Maryland with his now-wife, who is a U.S. citizen, and his three children. He has no criminal charges or convictions in any country and is not a member of the gang, his lawyer has told the court.\n\nPrior to Monday, the DOJ provided two daily updates. The first one came Saturday in the form of a declaration from a State Department official, who said that it was his “understanding” that Abrego Garcia was “alive and secure” in the prison in El Salvador.\n\nSALVADORAN PRESIDENT NAYIB BUKELE DECLINES TO RETURN MISTAKENLY DEPORTED MARYLAND MAN\n\nThe following day, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said in a declaration that he had “no updates.” The official also said that since the government accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13, he was “no longer” eligible for protective status that blocked the government from sending him to El Salvador.","summary":"The Trump administration told a court on Monday it does not have the ability to retrieve a man it mistakenly deported to a Salvadoran prison, capping off a three-day string of defiant court filings in an intensifying case about Kilmar Abrego Gacia&#8217;s removal.

Here’s what to know","text":"By AYAKA MCGILL and MARI YAMAGUCHI \nAssociated Press\n\nOSAKA, Japan (AP) — The Expo 2025 opened in Osaka on Sunday with more than 10,000 people singing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony to celebrate the start of the six-month event that Japan hopes will unite the world divided by tensions and wars.\n\nHere is what to know about the Expo 2025 Osaka:\n\nWhat is Expo 2025 Osaka about?\n\nThe Osaka Expo is held at Yumeshima, which means “dream island,” a reclaimed industrial waste burial site in the Osaka Bay, where participants from more than 160 countries, regions and organizations showcase their futuristic exhibits inside about 80 pavilions of unique architecture.\n\n“Creating a future society for our lives” is the main theme. It is Osaka’s second Expo after the hugely successful 1970 event that attracted 64 million visitors, a record until Shanghai in 2010.\n\nOrganizers expect 28 million visitors through mid-October, though ticket sales have been slow, with about 9 million sold in advance, short of an initial target of 14 million.\n\n“It’s been 55 years since the last Expo in Osaka. I’ve been looking forward to it,” said Daiki Chiba, who traveled from Sendai, about 560 miles northeast of Osaka.\n\nMany visitors carried Myaku-Myaku mascots or wore clothes matching its colors—red, blue and white—to get in the mood.\n\nWhat does it mean to hold Expo amid global tensions\n\nThe Expo comes only four years after Japan struggled to host the no-audience Tokyo Olympics during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt opens in the wake of trade wars and fears of a global economic downturn sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the three-year Russian invasion of Ukraine and Middle East conflicts.\n\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba compared the global tensions to a “national crisis” and said that Trump’s tariffs, especially the 25% duty on automobiles, would be a blow to all industries and Japan’s economy.\n\nStill, Japan wants to turn the pinch into a chance.\n\n“I think the timing is actually quite fitting,” said Sachiko Yoshimura, head of Expo 2025 global communications. “Holding the Expo now could eventually help to address the divisions in the world. … I believe this Expo in Japan might actually lead to stronger international relationships and improvements.”\n\nWhat is the Grand Ring?\n\nThe iconic ring, designed by architect Sou Fujimoto, is a lattice-like structure encircling the venue and recognized by the Guinness World Records as the largest wooden architecture. It is 65 feet high and has a 1.2-mile circumference.\n\nThe costly ring takes up more than 14% of the Expo’s total spending of $1.64 billion and has triggered public criticism.\n\nThe total cost nearly doubled from the initial estimate largely due to the weaker yen, causing construction delays. Several pavilions, including those of Nepal, India, Vietnam and Chile, were not ready for the opening.\n\nThe ring is supposed to be partially reusable, reflecting the theme of creating a sustainable future.\n\nWhat are other highlights?\n\nExhibits of cutting-edge technology, such as robots and flying cars, as well as pop culture like Hello Kitty and Gundam, are among the highlights.\n\n“Pavilions all look amazing,” said Laurel Sylvester from New Zealand, visiting with her husband and two children. Her family is interested in ocean sustainability and planned to visit the Blue Ocean Dome. She said the boys are “super excited to have their photo with the (big Gundam) robot and some of the interesting tech things that are going on.”\n\nA small artificial heart made from induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS, demonstrated a heartbeat at a Japanese health care pavilion. At the Future of Life pavilion, visitors can interact with robots. A human washing machine that was a sensation at the 1970 expo returned with a high-tech makeover.\n\nThe U.S. pavilion focuses on space travel. Its lunar stone from the Apollo 12 mission, a sensation at the 1970 expo, was back on display.\n\nChina, also highlighting space technology, exhibits soil samples from its lunar missions.\n\nCarrying a “Not for sale” sign and decorated with its blue-and-yellow national flags, Ukraine attracted many visitors with a globe and other items carrying barcodes.

After years of economic stagnation following Ford Motor Co.’s exit from the region in 2021, there was hope that the global leader in electric vehicles would bring back well-paying jobs and a brighter future.\n\nThe timing seemed right. Brazil, the world’s sixth-largest auto market, is seeing a surge in EV sales—and BYD is leading the charge. For Camacari, the deal promised to fill the economic vacuum left by the American company, which had once been the city’s largest employer.\n\nThen plans went off track.\n\nA December raid led by Brazilian authorities rescued 163 Chinese nationals said to be working in “slavery-like” conditions at the site. A video from the Labor Prosecutor’s Office showed dormitories with beds lacking mattresses and makeshift cooking facilities. The company postponed plans to begin its first production line in March and has not established a new timeline, spreading fears among Camacari workers.\n\n“When BYD announced it was coming here, it sparked a lot of hope in us,” said Luizmar Santana Pereira, a metalworker and former Ford employee, who has been working as a taxi driver. “We’ve been waiting for this job opportunity, but so far, we haven’t seen it.”\n\nAfter the raid, a spokesperson based at BYD’s China headquarters denied wrongdoing, saying in a post on the Weibo social media site that the accusations were an attempt at “smearing” Chinese brands and China. The post also blamed “foreign forces” for the allegation and criticized media reports.\n\nIn a statement disseminated in Brazil, the carmaker adopted a more conciliatory tone. The company said it “does not tolerate disrespect for Brazilian law and human dignity” and rescinded the contract with Chinese construction company Jinjiang, which had brought the workers.\n\nIn Brazil, ample room for BYD to grow\n\nEVs are spreading fast in Brazil, Latin America’s most populous nation. Sales jumped 85% in 2024, reaching over 170,000 units, including fully electric and hybrid vehicles, according to the Brazilian Association of Electric Vehicles. That accounted for about 7% of new car sales in the country.\n\nThe growth is spearheaded by BYD. Seven out of 10 EVs sold in the country are from the brand, which also leads hybrid sales. In major cities such as Sao Paulo and Brasilia, imported BYD cars and dealerships have become a common sight. In Brazil’s capital, it’s the best-selling brand, whether EV or gas-powered.\n\nAnother Chinese EV maker, GWM, also recently announced plans to open a factory in Brazil after acquiring a shuttered Mercedes-Benz facility in the industrialized state of Sao Paulo.\n\nBYD’s inroads in Brazil are in tandem with the company’s global growth. The world’s leading EV company logged a record $107 billion in revenue in 2024 as its sales of electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%, surpassing American rival Tesla. This year, plans include the inauguration of its first car factory in Europe, currently under construction in Hungary.\n\nBrazil’s policies are driving EV sales and production, according to Adalberto Maluf, national secretary of Urban Environment and Environmental Quality.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press in Brasilia, Maluf cited incentives enacted in 2024 that favor electric motors, tax reductions for lower-emission cars and a new air quality program with nationwide monitoring and pollution reduction goals.\n\nBrazil is the one of the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases, contributing around 3% of global emissions, according to nonprofit Climate Watch. However, pollution from energy does not play a big role, as about half of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, mostly in the Amazon, followed by agriculture. About 85% of the country’s electricity comes from renewable sources.\n\nFor Maluf, who worked for almost nine years at BYD Brazil, the country is attractive to Chinese electric car makers for reasons ranging from the size of its market to the presence of several auto parts suppliers and the strong political relationship between the two countries.\n\n“Brazilians have no geopolitical issues with China. If you ask, ‘Are you against China?’ most people won’t have a strong opinion about it,” he said.\n\n“In the U.S., however, they do, because it’s part of the president’s rhetoric,” he added, referring to President Donald Trump’s frequent comments about China “ripping off” America on trade.\n\nIt’s unclear what is next for BYD factory\n\nSince the raid, BYD has not allowed press visits inside its Camacari premises, citing concerns about trade secrets.

Minutes later, security guards on motorcycles approached, honking and ordering the journalists to stop filming workers.\n\nBYD said its security guards acted appropriately and declined to answer other questions about its operations in Brazil.\n\nWhile the future of the factory is unclear, the raid and the presence of Chinese workers have gotten the attention of labor unions.\n\n“The Metalworkers Union will not tolerate Chinese workers on the production line. If that happens even in the beginning of the production, we will call for a work stoppage,” Júlio Bonfim, the union president, told AP.

And one day, while standing on the street adjoining the premises, three BYD guards, one who kept his hand on his gun, incorrectly accused the journalists of flying a drone inside factory boundaries and demanded to see identification. Minutes later, security guards on motorcycles approached, honking and ordering the journalists to stop filming workers.\n\nBYD said its security guards acted appropriately and declined to answer other questions about its operations in Brazil.\n\nWhile the future of the factory is unclear, the raid and the presence of Chinese workers have gotten the attention of labor unions.\n\n“The Metalworkers Union will not tolerate Chinese workers on the production line. If that happens even in the beginning of the production, we will call for a work stoppage,” Júlio Bonfim, the union president, told AP. Bonfim added that there were no objections with BYD employing Chinese technicians and managers, but the factory floor must employ only Brazilians. It was unclear if BYD had agreed to that.\n\nDespite the raid and seemingly slow pace of construction, in the Camacari region the shift from Ford to BYD is increasingly visible. A three-decades-old dealership for the American brand named Indiana, in tribute to the U.S. state, now shares space with a BYD reseller, Mandarim. A local hotel started distributing instructions specifically to Chinese guests, asking them not to hang washed clothes in common areas. And a state lawmaker introduced a bill to rename the city’s Henry Ford Avenue, where the plant is located, to BYD Avenue.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

His suggestions received broad support, with calls to incorporate them into the parties’ campaign platforms ahead of the election.\nSimilar discussions are also under way within the main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. Its leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has suggested that such measures are needed in light of US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imports from Japan.\n\nInflation has been a persistent issue in Japan in recent years, though its impact has been somewhat mitigated by companies belatedly starting to raise wages. However, the US administration’s global trade war is expected to hit Japan particularly hard, raising concerns about how ordinary citizens will weather the storm.\nIn March, the price of more than 2,300 food and beverage items rose by an average of 16 per cent, with analysts linking the increases to greater raw material costs and a weak yen, which has made imported foodstuffs more expensive.\nThe impact of rising prices is being felt across the economy. Domestic travel giant JTB Corp has warned that the number of people travelling during the coming Golden Week holiday in late April is likely to decline by 6.9 per cent compared to last year, citing the rising cost of living as the primary factor.\n“The current minority government is focused on how to restructure the nation’s finances and one argument that is being put forward is for some taxes to go down to help people on low incomes,” said Martin Schulz, chief policy economist for Fujitsu’s Global Market Intelligence Unit.\n“Into this relief on the tax side is the consumption tax because prices for groceries are now very high, even for a staple like rice,” he told This Week in Asia. “In recent years, households have constantly felt that taxes have been going up and as the consumption tax is the most unpopular, that is why the government is under pressure to discuss it.”\n\nThe consumption tax, equivalent to a value-added tax in other countries, was first introduced in 1989 at a rate of 3 per cent. It was increased to 5 per cent in 1997, 8 per cent in 2014, and 10 per cent in October 2019, where it remains today. Currently, the tax accounts for over 30 per cent of Japan’s total tax revenue, making it the government’s single largest source of income. The funds are primarily used to cover pensions, healthcare, and other social security costs, which are rising sharply as Japan’s population ages and its birth rate stagnates.\n“In my opinion, I do not believe they will touch consumption tax because it is the foundation of the government’s finances,” Schulz said.\n“The consumption tax may be extremely unpopular, but it affects everybody the same and with the way Japan’s demographics have changed over the decades, I do not think the government will let it go now.”\nNevertheless, the issue is expected to dominate the political agenda in the run-up to the July elections, with opposition parties likely to seize the opportunity to demand reductions and score political points.\n“The tax is unpopular so of course opposition parties are going to hit the government on that, but the moment that they got into power that would change because any government would need that income,” Schulz said.\n“The LDP cannot avoid the debate, but it will choose to manage the discussion because it knows the nation cannot afford to go even greater into debt.”","summary":"Rising inflation and Trump’s trade war have raised concerns about how ordinary Japanese will weather the storm.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3306464/will-trump-tariffs-force-japan-slash-its-unpopular-consumption-tax","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/15/9d83849c-79da-4043-ad1f-3176925c1e04_fd034dbb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 00:00:16","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.056},{"id":311177820,"title":"IRS chief information officer announces resignation","text":"WASHINGTON >> The chief information officer at the Internal Revenue Service said he would resign, according to an email sent to staff and seen by Reuters today, the latest in a string of high-profile departures at the tax-collecting agency in the run-up to the April 15 filing deadline for most U.S. taxpayers.\n\nCIO Rajiv Uppal, whose job was to oversee the development and improvement of the IRS’ computer and IT systems, said his resignation would be effective late this month.

Overall, whereas we were 21% of global GDP in 2012, now we are 26% — right about where we were in 1980. \n\nOur labor productivity has skyrocketed compared to other developed economies, and we spend more on R&D as a percentage of GDP than any other country except South Korea and Israel. \n\nCountries that had allegedly figured out a powerful mercantilist alternative to our free market have stagnated.\n\nGermany was once hailed as a model of industrial policy; its GDP hasn’t grown since 2019, and manufacturing has declined for years. \n\nJapan was once the object of fear and envy for its industrial policy; it’s been a low-growth economy for more than three decades now. \n\nCanada, too, was considered an alternative model, but its national income per capita was 80% of ours not too long ago and is now about 70%. \n\nRather than overtaking the United States in GDP, meanwhile, China has ceded ground in recent years, and has an output per person that isn’t even a third of ours. \n\nAccording to The Economist, “Average wages in America’s poorest state, Mississippi, are higher than the averages in Britain, Canada and Germany.”\n\nHasn’t our manufacturing sector been devastated? \n\nAs The Financial Times notes, our manufacturing output has actually increased since 1990.\n\nWe are employing fewer people and making different, higher-end goods than we did before — more tech and aerospace, less shoes and textiles.\n\nThe paper notes that the United States is the best in world in terms of manufacturing output per worker.\n\nAs we have lost jobs in manufacturing (5 million since 1990), we’ve picked them up in services (nearly 12 million) and in transportation and logistics (more than 3 million). \n\nThe aim of the Trump tariffs is to increase employment in one sector of the economy at the expense of the rest of the economy, which is inherently a bad deal.\n\nThe sweep of the tariffs means that they are poorly designed to achieve even this particular goal, since the price of steel, aluminum and other inputs that manufacturers use will go up.\n\nOne estimate is that Trump’s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs resulted in roughly 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs for this very reason. \n\nThe normal impulse is to want to change the rules in the middle of the road when you are losing, not when you are winning the race.\n\nEconomic shock therapy is what failing countries attempt, whether Russia under Boris Yeltsin, the former Eastern Bloc countries, or Bolivia in the 1980s.\n\nHere, Trump is using a defibrillator on a patient who not only passed his stress test with flying colors, but is beating everyone else in the 100-yard dash. \n\nTrump has talked about accepting “a little disturbance” with his new tariff regime.\n\nThe danger is that we will simply have less economic growth than we would have had otherwise — since the president isn’t rescuing an economic basket case, but changing what’s been a winning formula. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"It’s dangerous to disrupt willy-nilly a system that has ourselves at the apex, and getting stronger rather than weaker. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/opinion/trump-will-destroy-a-world-economy-that-has-us-at-the-apex/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-wjjcinoqp-1744670928101.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744656633&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:57:00","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":311175160,"title":"Mike Johnson opens the door to Medicaid cuts and the resulting political fallout","text":"Republicans seemingly made it official over the weekend: they’re going after Medicaid.\n\nDespite assurances from a wide range of party figures, including President Donald Trump, it appears as if the upcoming GOP budget proposal will include cuts to Medicaid after all.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson made as much clear on Sunday, when he spoke to Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo.\n\n“We have to root out fraud, waste and abuse, we have to eliminate on, for example, on Medicaid who are not actually eligible to be there. Able-bodied workers, for example, young men, who are– who should never be on the program at all,” the House speaker told Fox.\n\nMake no mistake: this is a direct retreat from Johnson’s previous position, which as recently as February was “we’re not going to touch Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.” On Sunday, Johnson inserted a key addition to that pledge.\n\n“The president has made absolutely clear many times, as we have as well, that we’re going to protect Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, for people who are legally beneficiaries of those programs,” Johnson said.\n\nBetween the two statements, the intent seems clear: the Republican House speaker is open to cutting Medicaid benefits in states that expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. In 2014, the federal government began assisting states with coverage for low-income individuals of all age groups — very much including “able-bodied workers” and “young men”, whom Johnson said should not have coverage.\n\nRepublicans have long opposed benefits to younger, low-income adults and families, arguing that Medicaid and other programs incentivize individuals to avoid work. \n\nActivists and experts who supported the Medicaid expansion under the Obama administration now warn that the program is both extremely popular and part of a key revenue stream for hospitals in lower-income and rural areas.\n\n“Rural hospitals are going to close,” said Dr Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care. He warned that facilities such as nursing homes would also lose key funding and be threatened.\n\n“Our hospital is so dependent on folks' ability to have access to insurance, and Medicaid is a huge payer, you know– about a third or more overall,” added Davidson, an emergency room doctor based in Michigan.\n\nAccess to hospitals and health services remains a major hurdle for rural residents of all income groups — not just Medicaid recipients. A 2024 report from CNN found that in Pennsylvania’s more remote counties, the average travel time to reach a hospital with a maternity ward for imminently expecting mothers was nearly an hour.\n\nDozens of rural hospitals have closed or shuttered some services across the country in the past two decades, and hundreds more are said to be at risk. A February report from the National Rural Health Association stated that “nearly 50% of rural hospitals operate with negative margins” and stated that kicking low-income “able-bodied” Americans off the program with work requirements (and the associated red tape) would be a major burden on rural hospitals.\n\nKelly Hall, whose group has supported and won seven Medicaid expansion ballot measure campaigns, told The Independent: “We know that states that have expanded Medicaid have been more successful in keeping their rural hospital infrastructure open and functioning. States that have not expanded Medicaid have seen more hospital closures.”\n\n“The places that have expanded Medicaid are at real risk of losing their rural hospital infrastructure if the program is rolled back, and that is not just devastating to people who are beneficiaries of the Medicaid program, but anyone who lives in those communities, regardless of their type of insurance,” said Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project.\n\nSo far, few Republicans beyond Johnson and hardcore conservatives in his caucus have come out in explicit favor of implementing Medicaid work requirements — or simply kicking low-income young adults off the program altogether.\n\nPart of that comes from reflex. Donald Trump’s first term, like Joe Biden’s after him, was marred by a major legislative defeat on a signature policy issue during his initial year. A massive blow to any president enjoying twin majorities in the House and Senate, the defeat of the Trump-supported GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act altogether sapped the president’s political capital and led to the Republican Congress passing just one major plank of Trump’s campaign platform, tax cuts, before the midterms began.\n\nRepublicans could be well on their way to a self-imposed state of deja vu. A battle over one of the ACA’s most popular provisions, Medicaid expansion, could divide the House and Senate GOP caucuses and tank a bill that only passed its latest hurdle last Thursday by the thinnest of margins.\n\nFurther defections within the GOP caucus could very well occur if Republicans broach the topic of work requirements any further. At least two House members, Nicole Maliotakis and Jeff Van Drew, have threatened to switch their votes to oppose the bill’s final passage over the issue already.\n\n“Working class people receive Medicaid as they are working. This is not just lazy people who are sitting around not doing their job,” said Rep Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who added to TIME that he had phoned the president to warn him: “I very well may not vote for this, and I’m certainly waiting until the last minute to see if some changes can be made, because I’m very unhappy.”\n\nMaliotakis was even more explicit on her position: “We will not vote for something that takes away eligibility from our constituents, period.”\n\nThey are far from the only ones. Progressives believe that more holdouts will emerge as the reality of cutting potentially billions of dollars, which would have otherwise ended up making their way to hospitals and health centers already threatened by closure or service reductions, is made clear.\n\nFair Share US, one of the progressive groups opposed to the GOP budget plan, held a rally outside the Capitol aimed at driving up popular opposition to the bill last week, which was attended by Democratic lawmakers. The DC rally was also attended by union leaders and others who warned that Trump was threatening to betray working-class voters whom he pledged to champion if he signed Medicaid cuts into law.\n\n“Two-thirds of adults on Medicaid are already working. [...] They don’t need any incentives to get a job. They need steady hours and a real pay raise – not cuts to the services that help them stay afloat while they do their essential jobs,” said one attendee, Charlotte Neal of AFSCME local 3930.\n\nActivists like Kelly Hall hope to spur further Republican resistance by making as much noise as possible, especially in red and purple districts where Democrats have held “empty chair” town hall-style events to draw scrutiny on GOP lawmakers over the past few months.\n\nShe predicted: “I think we'll see an evolving landscape on people's concern and outrage about potential Medicaid cuts, the more real they become.”","summary":"Opponents of GOP budget plan hope reality of Medicaid cuts for rural and low-income Americans will drive Republican defections","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/johnson-medicaid-republicans-work-eligibility-b2733294.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/01/17/59/GettyImages-2207970342.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3uyQ1yX5-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:56:48","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":311168366,"title":"Firebombing 'terrorist's' disturbing act as he's arraigned for torching Dem PA Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence while he and his family slept","text":"The man accused of firebombing the Governor's Mansion while Josh Shapiro and his family were sleeping inside in an act of terrorism pulled sick faces as he was marched into the courthouse.\n\nCody Balmer has been charged with attempted homicide, aggravated arson and terrorism for the Saturday night attack on the Pennsylvania Governor's home. \n\nThe 38-year-old Balmer repeatedly pulled faces at the cameras and reporters, sticking out his tongue and crossing his eyes to pose for photos.\n\nThe disturbing act came as Balmer shuffled into the courthouse on Monday with both his wrists and ankles cuffed, hours after he was reportedly taken to hospital suffering an undisclosed medical condition.\n\nBalmer allegedly used two beer bottles filled with gasoline to make homemade Molotov cocktails to light fire to Shapiro's Harrisburg mansion, the official property where Pennsylvania governors reside. \n\nHe then turned himself into Pennsylvania State Police, telling officers he was 'harboring hatred towards Governor Shapiro' and that he had removed the gasoline from a lawnmower.\n\nAnd according to the police affidavit seen by DailyMail.com, Balmer told police he 'would have beaten him with a hammer' if they had crossed paths. \n\nBalmer's former girlfriend and the mother to his two children initially called police to inform them that he had committed the crime. She alleged he wanted her to tell investigators.\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Passover started this weekend and Shapiro is Jewish, leaving some wondering if Balmer was expressing anti-Semitic views. \n\nBut Balmer's social media profile was littered with political commentary and criticism about American institutions, without any direct reference to anti-Semitism.\n\nThe 38-year-old Harrisburg father had made chilling posts about former president Joe Biden and his supporters, arguing that they 'shouldn't exist' and even suggesting Biden was going to be killed.\n\n'Biden supporters shouldn't exist,' he wrote in one post dated January 2021.\n\n'RIP Joe Biden... whoops that's in May. #notmypresident,' another read, while another added that 'knowing is half the battle... the other half is extreme violence.'\n\nBalmer had separately noted during Biden's presidential term that gas was cheaper under President Donald Trump. He insisted at the time he did 'not play favorites especially since they all suck.'\n\nTrump was asked about the suspect's political leanings on Monday, and said he was likely 'just a whack job.'\n\n'The attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand,' Trump told reporters. 'Just from what I read and what I've been told.\n\n'The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody, probably just a whack job, and certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.'\n\nExtraordinary photos show the sheer extent of the damage to Shapiro's home.\n\nFire crews were dispatched to Democrat Shapiro's home in Harrisburg around 2am Sunday, the town's Fire Chief Brian Enterline said. \n\nEveryone inside the home was in a separate part of the residence when the flames broke out and were able to evacuate safely. \n\nThe shocking images show the charred remnants of the once-stunning rooms. The living areas and common spaces have been left blackened with ash and soot with what's left of the furniture scattered haphazardly around the rooms. \n\nState police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer 'clearly had a plan' going into the late-night attack.\n\n'He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,' Bivens said. \n\nShapiro, who shares four children with his wife Lori, shared a post to X about the startling incident. \n\n'Last night at about 2AM, my family and I woke up to bangs on the door from the Pennsylvania State Police after an arsonist set fire to the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg.\n\n'The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was on the scene and while they worked to put out the fire, we were evacuated from the Residence safely by Pennsylvania State Police and assisted by Capitol Police. \n\n'Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities. Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.","summary":"Cody Balmer has been charged with attempted homicide, aggravated arson and terrorism for the Saturday night attack on the Pennsylvania Governor's home.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14610935/cody-balmer-josh-shapiro-firebomber-disturbing-face.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/15/00/97282409-0-image-m-66_1744674257130.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/13/8144384836926880125/1024x576_MP4_8144384836926880125.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:55:43","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":311178410,"title":"A Palestinian activist expecting a US citizenship interview is arrested instead by ICE in Vermont","text":"By PATRICK WHITTLE and HOLLY RAMER\n\nA Palestinian man who led protests against the war in Gaza as a student at Columbia University was arrested Monday at a Vermont immigration office where he expected to be interviewed about finalizing his U.S. citizenship, his attorneys said.\n\nMohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident who has held a green card since 2015, was detained at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, his lawyers said.\n\nThe attorneys said they do not know where he is.

Es un recuerdo que aún moldea la identidad de generaciones de estadounidenses de origen japonés y constituye un ejemplo ampliamente reconocido de cómo se ignoraron y violaron los derechos civiles de un grupo de personas.\n\nPero ahora, activistas de derechos civiles e historiadores sienten que están presenciando un retroceso a la historia, ya que el presidente Donald Trump ha invocado la misma ley estadounidense de 227 años de antigüedad que se utilizó para justificar el encarcelamiento de la comunidad estadounidense de origen japonés durante la guerra.\n\n“Con la forma en que el gobierno ha procedido con las órdenes ejecutivas, muchas cosas parecen poder volver a suceder”, dijo Susan Hasegawa, historiadora local de historia estadounidense de origen japonés y profesora del San Diego City College.\n\nLa Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros, promulgada en 1798 cuando Estados Unidos estaba al borde de la guerra con Francia, permite al presidente detener o deportar a cualquier “extranjero” que considere “peligroso para la paz y la seguridad” del país.\n\nLos presidentes estadounidenses solo han invocado la ley en tres ocasiones anteriores: durante la Guerra de 1812, la Primera y la Segunda Guerra Mundial, cuando se utilizó para encarcelar a personas de ascendencia japonesa, alemana e italiana.\n\nTrump ha estado invocando la ley para justificar la detención, deportación y revocación de visas de un número creciente de inmigrantes, principalmente venezolanos, que su administración ha enviado, sin cargos, a una conocida prisión de El Salvador.\n\nLa semana pasada, la Corte Suprema permitió que la administración Trump siguiera deportando personas bajo la ley, al tiempo que afirmó que la administración debía brindarles la oportunidad de impugnar sus deportaciones legalmente. La corte no se pronunció sobre la constitucionalidad de la ley.\n\nDefensores de los derechos civiles y otros han descrito las medidas de Trump como violaciones alarmantes de los derechos civiles, incluido el derecho al debido proceso.\n\nEl peligro de la Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros radica en que permite tales violaciones, “con el pretexto de la seguridad nacional”, declaró Michael Kurima, copresidente de la junta directiva de la sección de San Diego de la Liga de Ciudadanos Japoneses Estadounidenses.\n\nSeñaló que la última vez que se invocó la ley, aproximadamente dos tercios de las personas que se utilizaron para encarcelar eran ciudadanos estadounidenses.\n\n“Si la Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros es solo un primer paso, la represión gubernamental de la disidencia podría ser el siguiente”, dijo Kurima. “Lo que comienza con supuestos pandilleros extranjeros podría fácilmente expandirse a otros, incluso ciudadanos estadounidenses, cuando las libertades civiles se consideran condicionales”.\n\nLos críticos también han señalado que Trump es el único presidente en la historia que ha invocado la ley fuera de tiempos de guerra, como lo declaró el Congreso. Se ha referido repetidamente a la inmigración no autorizada como una “invasión”.\n\n“La última vez que se invocó, fue devastador para mucha gente que no tenía nada que ver con el enemigo”, dijo Hasegawa. “Por lo tanto, hacerlo de nuevo con un grupo objetivo en tiempos de no guerra, es aún más sospechoso y aterrador”.\n\nEl sábado, seis artistas locales inmigrantes y refugiados inauguraron una instalación artística en la Biblioteca Central de San Diego, en colaboración con la sociedad histórica local, que muestra paralelismos entre las experiencias de los estadounidenses de origen japonés durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial y las experiencias de los inmigrantes actuales.\n\n“Es simplemente horrible, y debemos entender que no sucedió justo ahora”, dijo Shinpei Takeda, director del Proyecto AjA, cuyos artistas becarios crearon la instalación, sobre el regreso de la Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros. “Con el arte, al menos se da a la gente la oportunidad de hablar de ello y se demuestra que algo así ha sucedido en el pasado”.\n\nUna comunidad de San Diego desmantelada\n\nCuando se invocó la Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros por última vez, en 1941, unas 2000 personas de ascendencia japonesa, conocidas como Nikkei, vivían en el condado de San Diego.\n\nLos inmigrantes japoneses de primera generación, o issei, llegaron a San Diego a partir de la década de 1880. Muchos de ellos trabajaron en la agricultura y el ferrocarril. En las décadas previas a la Segunda Guerra Mundial, contribuyeron significativamente a las industrias agrícola y pesquera de la región, según Ochi; muchos trabajaban como pescadores o en conserveras de atún en la bahía de San Diego, y muchos eran agricultores, desde el valle del río Tijuana hasta Oceanside, añadió Hasegawa.\n\nLos issei también dirigían unos 30 pequeños negocios en el centro de San Diego, cerca de la Quinta Calle y la Avenida Island, añadió Hasegawa. Había escuelas de japonés, así como un templo budista y dos iglesias cristianas japonesas.\n\nTras el bombardeo japonés de Pearl Harbor el 7 de diciembre de 1941, Estados Unidos actuó con rapidez para iniciar la expulsión forzosa de los nikkei. En febrero, el FBI había arrestado a unas tres docenas de Issei locales a quienes había identificado previamente como líderes comunitarios, entre ellos los líderes del templo budista de San Diego, profesores de lengua japonesa e instructores del arte marcial japonés kendo, dijo Hasegawa.\n\nEl 19 de febrero de 1942, el presidente Franklin Roosevelt promulgó la Orden Ejecutiva 9066, que ordenaba la expulsión de las personas de ascendencia japonesa de sus comunidades y su envío a campos de concentración. Los japoneses se vieron obligados a abandonar sus hogares, trabajos y negocios.\n\nLa gran mayoría de los residentes de San Diego fueron enviados en tren al hipódromo de Santa Anita, en el condado de Los Ángeles, un centro de detención para miles de personas reubicadas desde el sur de California. Luego fueron enviados a Poston, Arizona, uno de los 10 campos que el gobierno estadounidense creó para encarcelar a personas de ascendencia japonesa.\n\nMientras tanto, los líderes de San Diego apoyaron y elogiaron el encarcelamiento. El Ayuntamiento de San Diego, la Junta de Supervisores del condado y la Cámara de Comercio aprobaron medidas que establecían que los residentes estadounidenses de origen japonés debían ser encarcelados o no se les debía permitir regresar a San Diego.\n\nTrauma intergeneracional\n\nTras su liberación tras la guerra, los estadounidenses de origen japonés lucharon por reconstruir sus vidas, incluso en San Diego.\n\nSu expulsión forzosa y encarcelamiento diezmaron las instituciones japonesas, incluyendo los negocios que alguna vez existieron en el centro, afirmó Hasegawa. Muchos fueron reemplazados o no pudieron reconstruirse, a diferencia de ciudades más grandes como Los Ángeles. Y muchas personas fueron presionadas u obligadas a asimilarse abandonando su idioma y cultura.\n\nPara muchos, el impacto en la salud mental y la autoestima persistió durante décadas. “Algunos dicen que el reasentamiento fue incluso más duro que el encarcelamiento”, declaró Ochi. “El impacto emocional fue aún mayor y ha tenido un impacto duradero: un trauma intergeneracional”.\n\nEn 2022, el Ayuntamiento de San Diego se disculpó formalmente y revocó la resolución que había aprobado ocho décadas antes para apoyar el encarcelamiento. “Es fundamental que identifiquemos los actos racistas y las injusticias del pasado y los abordemos de frente”, declaró entonces el entonces presidente del Ayuntamiento, Sean Elo-Rivera. Podemos reconocer el agravio que cometió la ciudad.\n\nPara los artistas cuya obra se exhibe ahora en la Biblioteca Central, abordar estas injusticias también es fundamental, al tiempo que su instalación examina las maneras en que los nikkei encarcelados encontraron la manera de preservar su comunidad.\n\nLa artista laosiana estadounidense de primera generación, Tarrah Aroonsakool, se centró en cómo los nikkei encarcelados usaban la cocina como un acto de resiliencia, adaptando recetas a sus raciones de guerra. La artista mexicoamericana de primera generación, Jazmín Barajas, estableció paralelismos entre cómo las tradiciones japonesa y mexicana utilizan altares y santuarios para honrar a los muertos, y yuxtapuso imágenes de los muros del campo de concentración de Tule Lake con las del muro fronterizo entre Estados Unidos y México.\n\nLos artistas afirmaron que se necesitan educación y descripciones precisas de la historia para garantizar que los abusos masivos de los derechos civiles, como los que sufrieron los estadounidenses de origen japonés, nunca se repitan. Si se depura la historia, es más fácil que se repita, afirmaron los artistas.\n\n“El silenciamiento es precisamente lo que permite que este tipo de trayectorias se repitan sin que la gente se percate de las señales”, afirmó Barajas.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"Al intentar deportar a los inmigrantes venezolanos, el presidente Trump ha invocado la Ley de Enemigos Extranjeros","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/14/podria-volver-a-ocurrir-historiadores-estadounidenses-de-origen-japones-advierten-sobre-el-uso-de-la-ley-de-guerra-de-1798/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SUT-L-ALIEN-ACT-8.jpg?w=1024&h=681","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:54:17","author":"Kristen Taketa","authors":["Kristen Taketa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":311173372,"title":"NOG Energy Week 2025 to accelerate Africa’s integration into global energy value chain","text":"The 24th edition of NOG Energy Week will help to advance conversations on raising African stakes in global energy industry.\n\nThemed ‘Accelerating Global Energy Progress through Investment, Partnerships and Innovation’, the event is scheduled to hold from 29 June to 3 July 2025, at the International Conference Centre (ICC), Abuja.\n\nIt will bring together leaders, policymakers, regulators and professionals from across the globe to discuss energy transformation as well as explore emerging business opportunities within the country.\n\nSpeaking on the conference, Director – Nigeria, dmg Nigeria Events, Odiri Umusu, said: “For over two decades, NOG Energy Week has been at the heart of shaping Africa’s energy progress, driving conversations that influence policy, investment decisions and industry growth. \n\nAs we gather for the 24th edition, the stakes are higher than ever, with shifting global energy policies, the push for resource maximisation and the need for sustainable development. This platform remains indispensable. NOG Energy Week 2025 will dissect the challenges and also spotlight actionable strategies that ensure Africa strengthens its role in the global energy industry.’’ The event will feature high-level discussions on policy frameworks, financing mechanisms and technological innovations needed to drive Africa’s energy transformation. \n\n The NOG Energy Week is the official meeting place for the global energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa, is produced by dmg Nigeria events, a subsidiary of dmg events with over 80 conferences and exhibitions across the world such as Adipec and Gastech. \n\n As the world navigates a rapidly evolving energy landscape, NOG Energy Week 2025 promises to explore pathways for accelerating global energy progress through investment, partnerships and innovation, serving as a catalyst for discussions on energy security, economic resilience and sustainable growth. \n\n Recent remarks from the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, have sparked renewed conversations about Africa’s energy future. Wright underscored the urgency of pragmatic energy policies that balance economic growth with environmental considerations, emphasising the importance of leveraging Africa’s vast natural gas reserves while fostering investments in traditional hydrocarbons and emerging energy technologies. \n\n His insights align with the mission of NOG Energy Week 2025, reinforcing the event’s role in driving actionable strategies for energy development across the continent, Umusu said.\n\n As the energy sector is being shaped by key global developments, including the new President Donald Trump administration’s energy policies, shifting trade agreements and a revitalised focus on fossil fuels reinforcing the need for Africa to position itself within this evolving global context, ensuring that external policies do not hinder the continent’s drive for energy independence and infrastructure development.\n\n The establishment of the African Energy Bank and the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) signal a new chapter in regional cooperation, opening avenues for increased financing and cross-border energy collaboration. NOG Energy Week 2025 will provide a platform for industry leaders to discuss how to leverage these initiatives to expand energy access, finance large-scale projects, and promote sustainable energy solutions.\n\n As Africa’s largest economy, Nigeria remains a focal point in the global energy debate. The country’s oil production levels, gas development ambitions, and refining sector are undergoing significant transformations. With a focus on investment, partnerships, and innovation, NOG Energy Week 2025 will explore pathways to energy security, economic resilience, and a sustainable future for Nigeria, Africa, and the global energy landscape.\n\n Additional information about NOG Energy Week 2025 is contained in nogenergyweek.com.","summary":"The 24th edition of NOG Energy Week will help to advance conversations on raising African stakes in global energy industry.

The move comes amid efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.The investigations were announced as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled optimism over bilateral trade negotiations. He told Bloomberg TV that “there's a big deal to be done” with China but gave no timeline. Talks are underway with Vietnam, with Japan scheduled next and South Korea the following week.Despite the trade war’s widening scope, Wall Street rallied. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each rose just under 1% Monday, building on earlier gains in Asian and European markets. The rebound was fueled in part by temporary exemptions issued Friday on high-tech imports such as smartphones, semiconductors, and computers.Still, President Donald Trump warned Sunday that those exemptions may be short-lived. He said new tariffs on semiconductors and other tech goods would be announced “over the next week.”White House spokesman Kush Desai reinforced the administration’s urgency. “The entire administration is committed to working on Trump Time” — apparently referring to moving quickly — on the matter, he told AFP.Lutnick said the tariffs would likely be in place “in a month or two,” further raising stakes for U.S. tech giants like Apple and Nvidia, which manufacture premium products in China.Trump’s shifting tariff strategy began April 2 with sweeping duties on many countries, later narrowed to target China more aggressively. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods have reached 145%, while China retaliated with a 125% barrier on American imports.Speaking Monday at the White House, Trump hinted at possible relief for automakers hit by his 25% tariff on foreign vehicles. “I don’t want to hurt anybody,” he said. “I’m very flexible” and “looking at something to help some of the car companies.”In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping cautioned against deepening trade disputes as he began a Southeast Asia tour in Vietnam. “Protectionism will lead nowhere” and a trade war would “produce no winner,” he said.The administration maintains that tariffs are intended to bring back critical manufacturing and restore U.S. economic strength. “The lack of supply is one of the reasons for having the EERI natural gas facilities to fill in the 1,200 MW of its contracted capacity,” Energy Assistant Secretary Mario Marasigan said in a separate industry-related statement Monday.Meanwhile, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic, after meeting with Lutnick and U.S. trade envoy Jamieson Greer, said “the EU remains constructive and ready for a fair deal.” He proposed a “zero-for-zero” industrial tariff framework but acknowledged on social media that “achieving this will require a significant joint effort on both sides.”More than two dozen countries are now negotiating to avoid U.S. tariffs before the 90-day exemption period ends.Japanese Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa will visit Washington this week to address auto-sector concerns amid rising costs.As markets respond to daily shifts in U.S. trade policy, analysts warn that volatility could deter investment and dampen global growth, particularly in high-tech sectors where Asian manufacturers dominate.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/14/us-considers-tariffs-on-pharmaceuticals-semiconductors-in-trade-shift","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-03-07/xnvyrmnx/christine-sandu-jwWtZrm67VI-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:53:11","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":311178456,"title":"US freezes $3.2 billion in federal funding for Harvard","text":"The US Department of Education froze more than $3.2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University, just hours after the school rejected President Donald Trump's demands that it make policy changes on diversity.\n\nA Department of Education task force on combating anti-Semitism said in a statement that it was freezing $US2.2 billion ($A3.5 billion) in multi-year grants and $US60 million ($A95 million) in multi-year contract value to Harvard University.\n\nThe move marks a new level of contentiousness between President Donald Trump's administration and American universities it accuses of being captured by the extreme left.\n\nTrump's administration has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for numerous prestigious universities, pressing the institutions to make policy and other changes and citing what it says is a failure to fight anti-Semitism on campus.\n\nDeportation proceedings have begun against some detained foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while visas for hundreds of other students have been cancelled. The crackdown has raised concerns about speech and academic freedoms.\n\nHarvard on Monday rejected Trump administration demands that to receive federal funding it end diversity efforts and take other steps that the university said would stifle intellectual freedoms of faculty and students.\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber wrote in a public letter that demands made on Friday by the federal Department of Education would allow the federal government \"to control the Harvard community\" and threaten the school's \"values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge\".\n\n\"No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" he added.\n\nThe Department of Education said the letter \"reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges ? that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws\".\n\nThe issue of anti-Semitism on campus erupted before Trump took office for his second term, following pro-Palestinian student protests last year at several universities following the 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel and the subsequent Israeli attacks on Gaza.\n\nWhite House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement on Monday that Trump was \"working to Make Higher Education Great Again by ending unchecked anti-Semitism and ensuring federal taxpayer dollars do not fund Harvard's support of dangerous racial discrimination or racially motivated violence\".\n\nIn a letter on Friday, the education department stated that Harvard had \"failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment\".\n\nThe department demanded that Harvard, work to reduce the influence of faculty, staff and students who are \"more committed to activism than scholarship\" and have an external panel audit the faculty and students of each department to ensure \"viewpoint diversity\".\n\nThe letter said Harvard must only hire faculty and admit students based on merit and end all preferences based on race, colour or national origin.\n\nThe university must also screen international students \"to prevent admitting students hostile to American values\" and report to federal immigration authorities foreign students who violate conduct rules.\n\nLast week, a group of Harvard professors sued to block the Trump administration's review of nearly $US9 billion ($A14 billion) in federal contracts and grants awarded to the school.\n\nTo ease any funding crunch created by any cutoff in federal funding, Harvard is working to borrow $US750 million ($A1.2 billion) from Wall Street.","summary":"Harvard University has lost $3.2 billion in US federal funding after the prestigious ivy league institution refused to bow to Trump administration demands.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/education/harvard-to-fight-trump-administration-funding-demands-c-18378734","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18378734/b228fffbd82848c43aa7d291bd44ed5502e78b99-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:53:07","author":"Brad Brooks","authors":["Brad Brooks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.136},{"id":311168424,"title":"Florence Pugh swaps fashionista status for Guinness World Record holder after performing terrifying skyscraper stunt for latest movie","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 15th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hutchence's daughter Tiger Lily is married!

They filed a petition in federal court seeking an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.\n“The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian. His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional,” lawyer Luna Droubi said in an email.\nAccording to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master’s degree programme there in the autumn.\nThe petition describes him as a committed Buddhist who believes in “non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion”.\nAs a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and organised campus protests until March 2024. He co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia with Mahmoud Khalil, another Palestinian permanent resident of the US and graduate student who recently was detained by ICE.\nKhalil was the first person arrested under US President Donald Trump’s promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza. On Friday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil can be deported as a national security risk.\n\nChristopher Helali, a friend of Mahdawi who lives near him in Vermont, was present outside the immigration office when Mahdawi was detained and recorded a video of Mahdawi being led away by authorities. In the video, which Helali released on social media on Monday, Mahdawi is shown giving a peace sign with his hands and being led away to a car.\nHelali described Mahdawi as a peaceful demonstrator who has worked to foster dialogue about the struggle of Palestinians in his homeland. Helali said he and Mahdawi were aware that Mahdawi could be detained today and that his friend went forward with the appointment anyway.\n“And rightfully so, he was nervous for what was going on around him. But he was very much resolute in coming to this interview and coming today because he didn’t do anything wrong and was a law-abiding citizen, or soon-to-be citizen,” Helali said.\nVermont’s congressional delegation issued a statement condemning Mahdawi’s arrest, saying that instead of taking one of the final steps in his citizenship process, he was handcuffed by armed officers with their faces covered.\n“This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal. Mr Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,” said the statement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch, and congresswoman Becca Balint.","summary":"Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent US resident and a critic of the war in Gaza, was arrested in Vermont on Monday.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3306511/palestinian-activist-expecting-us-citizenship-interview-arrested-instead-ice","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/15/7241307f-2bca-4cfc-8e23-71220337448c_90a44397.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:47:43","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":311168286,"title":"Trump administration stonewalls Congress on questions about immigration crackdown on US citizens and green-card holders","text":"A U.S. citizen who voted for Donald Trump was detained by armed immigration agents during a stop in Virginia in March. A toddler, his mother, and his grandmother, all U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico, were detained while speaking Spanish while shopping in Milwaukee. U.S. citizen members of the Navajo Nation were stopped and questioned in Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nThese are just some of the immigration-related incidents that have raised alarm among members of Congress and prompted them to reach out to the Trump administration for more information.\n\nBut more than a dozen representatives, all of them Democrats, told ProPublica they haven’t received any response, even as long as months after seeking information, prompting fears as the administration has pursued a breakneck pace of deportations.\n\n“That is a big concern on a level beyond what ICE is doing,” Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico told the outlet.\n\nThe fear has been heightened in the wake of the mistaken deportation of Maryland father Kilmar Abrega Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison and the deportation of others who were simply snatched from their homes or off the streets and put on a plane to the same foreign prison without any court process.\n\nNot only are Trump officials apparently defying court orders, “this administration does not seem to recognize the power and authority and responsibility” of members of Congress, added Leger Fernández.\n\nA White House spokesperson insisted that the administration is “working with Congress,” and pointed to passage of the continuing resolution that kept the government open and of of the Laken Riley Act that allows Homeland Security to detain illegal immigrants who have committed a crime.\n\nMembers of Congress have long been frustrated with laggard administration responses to their immigration questions; during the Biden administration, for instance, members of the House had to subpoena Homeland Security for more information about a mass immigration parole program.\n\nImmigration officials’ reported indifference now, however, has taking on a new urgency as the Trump administration has consistently pushed the boundaries on migration policy. Trump’s all-out campaign has already involved major oversights and controversies.\n\nThe administration has admitted to wrongly deporting Abrego Garcia back to his home country, despite a court order barring him from being sent there.\n\nSince then, despite a Supreme Court ruling that the administration must “facilitate” his return, the administration has insisted it has neither the obligation nor the power to free him from the CECOT prison, a facility human rights observers have called a “tropical gulag” for its inhumane conditions and statements from Salvadoran officials that inmates inside will never be released.\n\nDuring a White House visit on Monday, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele also insisted the lacked the power to free Abrego Garcia, even though the Trump administration is paying for the imprisonment of its deportees, calling a question about the possibility “preposterous.”\n\nThe Trump administration is now also floating the unprecedented and highly controversial notion of jailing non-immigrant Americans in the foreign prison as well. Trump, told Bukele on Monday he’s “all for” putting “home growns” in El Salvador’s prisons.\n\nIn addition to those mistakenly caught up in the deportation net, the administration has sought to deport legal permanent U.S. residents over their roles in pro-Palestine campus activism, which critics argue violates bedrock protections for free speech and activism in the First Amendment.\n\nMembers of Congress aren’t the only ones who feel ignored in their oversight role towards the administration.\n\nA Washington federal court considered holding the administration in contempt, after it apparently defied a court order to turn around removal flights to El Salvador in March amid a challenge to the administration’s use of the wartime emergency Alien Enemies Act to fast-track summary deportations.\n\nThe administration has refused to name the officials who communicated the court’s order to the relevant parties inside the government during the flight controversy, claiming that information is subject to attorney-client privilege.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-stonewalls-congress-questions-234510873.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1c3e2c6c1e4f1de2b7b72f2817b61981","video":"","publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:45:10","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.459}]}
