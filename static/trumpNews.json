The United Kingdom is ready to send troops to Ukraine as security guarantees for the authorities in Kiev in order to settle the conflict, Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote in an article for The Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"The UK is ready to play a leading role in accelerating work on security guarantees for Ukraine. This includes further support for Ukraine’s military, where the UK has already committed ·3 billion ($3.8 billion - TASS) a year until at least 2030. But it also means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way. But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country,\" Starmer pointed out.\n\nAccording to him, the issue of Ukraine's future is \"existential for Europe as a whole.\" In this regard, European countries need to increase spending on their own defense, Starmer added. \"We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defence and bearing our own burden. We have talked about it for too long - and [US] President [Donald] Trump is right to demand that we get on with it. As European nations, we must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role in NATO,\" the prime minister emphasized.\n\nPeacekeepers in Ukraine\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph, Starmer has for the first time explicitly stated that he is considering the idea of sending a UK military contingent to Ukraine. The newspaper noted that the prime minister's comments are intended to put pressure on other European capitals, particularly Berlin, to send troops to Ukraine after the fighting ends. The newspaper added that Starmer decided to publicly support sending troops there in light of statements made by US officials at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph underscored that it is still unclear what the so-called peacekeeping forces of European countries in Ukraine might look like. According to the newspaper, these troops could be deployed not on the front line, but behind the backs of Ukrainian servicemen, who would be stationed directly on the new Russia-Ukraine border. European leaders are expected to discuss the proposal at a meeting in Paris on February 17.\n\nUpcoming contacts with Trump\n\nStarmer also emphasized that Europe and the US should work together to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. He said he intends to meet with Trump in the near future to discuss US security guarantees for Kiev.\n\n\"US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from attacking again. So I will be meeting President Trump in the coming days and working with him and all our G7 partners to help secure the strong deal we need,\" the prime minister wrote.\n\nStarmer also reiterated London's position that peace in Ukraine \"cannot come at any cost,\" Kiev's representatives should sit at the negotiating table, and Ukraine is on an \"irreversible path\" to NATO membership, although it \"may take time.\" The prime minister also reminded Trump of the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021, noting that such a scenario should not be allowed. \"I feel sure that president Trump will want to avoid this too,\" he noted.\n\n\"These crucial days ahead will determine the future security of our continent. As I will say in Paris, peace comes through strength. But the reverse is also true. Weakness leads to war,\" Starmer concluded.","summary":"The UK could put its own \"troops on the ground if necessary,\" Keir Starmer said","url":"https://tass.com/world/1914099","image":"https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20250217/1438693.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:34:15","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":0.087},{"id":291205362,"title":"Dave Chappelle Says ‘SNL’ Barred Him From Talking Gaza, Transgender People in Opening Monologue","text":"Dave Chappelle told an audience in San Francisco last week that Saturday Night Live producers told him to avoid talking about Gaza or transgender people during his opening monologue when he hosted the show Jan. 18, the first new episode of the year.\n\n Chappelle performed a stand-up show in San Francisco on Thursday, which was reviewed by SFGATE’s Dan Gentile, who wrote: “SNL producers told him he couldn’t speak about two topics: transgender people and Gaza, a shocking stroke of censorship, given the political nature of the monologue.”\n\n A rep for NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment.\n\n Despite the apparent SNL directive, Chappelle made reference to Palestine in his monologue. After wishing Donald Trump good luck two days before he was inaugurated as president, advising him to “Please do better next time,” he told the audience, “Do not forget your humanity and please have empathy for displaced people whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine.” He also referenced Palestine in a tribute to Jimmy Carter, saying, “I will never forget the images of a former American president walking with little to no security while thousands of Palestinians were cheering him on.

Tobin, set the tone by welcoming his special guest from Washington D.C., Cardinal Wilton D. Gregory, as “my brother,” before a predominantly Black crowd of hundreds of worshipers, including a contingent from Newark’s Nigerian Catholic community.\n\nGregory offered a forward-looking message of hope culled from the books of Matthew and Luke to Catholics of color concerned about present-day politics, a reference to President Donald Trump’s moves to end or limit diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the role of the federal government in education, and other areas. \n\n“Both texts suggest that we must maintain hope, that the present does not, and will not determine the future,” Gregory preached. “This was of critical importance to people of color in the past, as well as those of us living in today’s world.” \n\n“Black history,” he added later, “is as much about tomorrow as it is about yesterday.”\n\nPope Francis named Gregory the first Black Catholic Cardinal in the United States in 2020, while he was serving as archbishop of Washington, D.C., a position he had held since 2019. Gregory, a longtime advocate for social justice, was also the first Black president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nSunday’s Mass was livestreamed and can be viewed on the diocesan YouTube channel. \n\nThe liturgy included a balletic performance by a female dancer in a red dress, amid banners placed just below the church sanctuary with the names of Black candidates for sainthood, including Mother Henriette DeLille, Pierre Toussaint, and Julia Greeley.\n\nThe attendees included Michelle Lewis, resident of Union who’s a parishioner at Blessed Sacrament Church of St. Charles in Newark, a predominantly Black parish, though she sometimes attends services at a church closer to home.\n\nStanding amid the honey-stained oak pews before the service, Lewis said she was looking forward to seeing and hearing the nation’s lone Black cardinal.\n\n“It’s always nice to see ourselves in leadership, especially in the current political climate,” said Lewis, 59, a compliance officer in the pharmaceutical industry and a licensed professional counselor. “And I think it’s nice to know that we can all unify under God.”\n\nThe program for Sunday’s Mass included an appeal for unity by the Catholic diocese to “our fellow Christians,” welcoming them to receive communion.\n\n“We pray that our common baptism and the action of the Holy Spirit in this Eucharist will draw us closer to one another and begin to dispel the sad divisions which separate us,” the program read. “We pray that these will lessen and finally disappear, in keeping with Christ’s prayer for us ‘that they may all be one.’ (John: 17:21)” \n\nVierson Ilg personifies that interdenominational vision. \n\nIlg, 22, is a Catholic who regularly attends services at St. John’s Lutheran Church in Bloomfield, where he lives, though he occasionally attends services at Eastern Orthodox Christian churches. \n\nA restaurant worker of Eastern European descent, Ilg was heartened to see such diversity in Sacred Heart’s pews. \n\n“The Catholic Church is very big,” he said. “Very big.”\n\nNobody knows Jersey better than NJ.com Sign up to get breaking news alerts straight to your inbox. \n\nSteve Strunsky may be reached at sstrunsky@njadvancemedia.com","summary":"A Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart also included a display highlighting African American candidates for sainthood and the huge church's first-ever liturgical dance.","url":"https://www.nj.com/mosaic/2025/02/countrys-1st-black-cardinal-preaches-hope-at-black-history-month-mass-in-newark.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/VDDH7ZRLM5AMPIFXEXPNTJQQUA.JPG?auth=3304f60ff1eb98540f69de880ecb027cc2177322daae9d4fffea5ee260cb8859&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:23:31","author":"Steve Strunsky","authors":["Steve Strunsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.376},{"id":291199468,"title":"‘Co-ordinated attack’: Pete Evans opens up about cancellation following ‘neo-Nazi’ controversy","text":"Evans, a prominent sceptic of Covid vaccines and masks, was dropped from his hosting role on the popular Seven reality cooking show in May 2020 over his outspoken views, and in November that year he was engulfed in further controversy after posting a cartoon on Instagram featuring a Nazi “black sun” symbol.\n\nThe image, showing a caterpillar wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat speaking to a butterfly with the black sun on its wing, was quickly deleted with Evans saying he was unaware of the symbol’s meaning.\n\nBut the ensuing outcry saw major retailers including Woolworths, Kmart and Target remove his books, while other businesses including publisher Pan Macmillan and kitchenware brand Baccarat also cut ties with Evans.\n\n“It was a coordinated attack, it wasn’t just f**king out of the blue,” Evans told the Secrets of the Underworld podcast earlier this month.\n\n“Within the space of 24 hours, the 15 business partners I was involved with all pretty much publicly denounced me. For that to happen it has to be a co-ordinated effort from some party. I don’t know who or what, but it wasn’t like, ‘Pete f**ked up’, it was like, ‘Pete f**ked up, let’s put the attack dogs onto this.’”\n\nEvans suggested the cancellation was intended “to dissuade anybody else that may want to stand up against the vaccine or this that and the other thing”.\n\n“This is what we can do to somebody, so be good boys and girls, just go along with the agenda, don’t stick your head up because we will financially destroy you,’” he said.\n\nEvans said he did share the Nazi symbol but it was “unbeknownst to me”.\n\n“I just saw the Donald Trump hat and thought it was funny, I had no idea it was a f**king neo-Nazi sign,” he said.\n\n“It was like, ‘Got him! We’ve been waiting for this moment. Now we can bring out the whole neo-Nazi, white supremacist [thing]. We’ve got him now. We’re going to use this and pressure all his business partners, that you cannot be associated with this man anymore.’”\n\nEvans stressed that “just for the record, I’m not a neo-Nazi, never have been, never will be, I love all cultures, all cuisines, I respect everybody, every race”.\n\n“It’s so ridiculous people fell for that … that anybody could ever consider that I would be a neo-Nazi, it’s beyond ridiculous,” he said.\n\n“I respect their decision. They’re running a business, they want to protect their brand, their integrity. For me it was just like, sweet, cool, can I adapt to losing all that income, can I adapt to being known as a neo-Nazi by the media?”\n\nEvans also spoke about the furore surrounding his controversial June 2020 interview with Nine’s 60 Minutes, which was criticised at the time for airing his “dangerous” comments downplaying the Covid pandemic.\n\n“When Covid happened I had a call from 60 Minutes because they wanted to do an episode about Covid conspiracies, right at the start even before the vaccines were brought out,” he said.\n\n“I was like, ‘OK, if you think you have conquered this fear of being judged, why don’t you go on 60 Minutes and sit across from someone you know is going to do a hatchet job on you and make you out to be a crazy person in the face of the Australian public?’ I loved it, I enjoyed that experience because in my perception I was the comfortable one in that interview. None of that can hurt me, none of the lies they spin out there in the media can hurt me in any way shape or form because all it does is show the game for what it is.”\n\nSecrets of the Underworld host Neil Cummins suggested Evans had been “hounded” for his views on diet and health.\n\n“Eighty per cent of chronic illness in the western world is diet and lifestyle related,” Evans said.\n\n“A lot of people would have you believe that you have to work out and run marathons and be fit to change that, shows like The Biggest Loser and all this type of brainwashing that’s out there. I’m not saying physical activity is not important, but diet trumps physical activity 100 times.”\n\nEvans suggested the medical, pharmaceutical and food industries had a vested interest in keeping people “sick”.\n\n“If 80 per cent of chronic illness can be eliminated, reversed, stopped by diet choices, could you imagine what would happen?” he said.\n\nThe wellness guru, who admitted he lives a “hermit” life with his wife after years of controversies, now has friends in high places who share his views on diet and chronic illness.\n\nEvans last month released a children’s cookbook with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s recently confirmed Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary.\n\nMr Kennedy, who was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday by a 52-48 vote, announced that ending the “childhood chronic disease epidemic” would be one of his top priorities in the powerful role which oversees 13 divisions and agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — and a budget of roughly $US1.7 trillion ($2.7 trillion).\n\n“For 20 years, I got down every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country,” Mr Kennedy said after his swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office.\n\nPresident Trump the same day announced the formation of the “Make America Healthy Again Commission”, to be chaired by Mr Kennedy.\n\nThe commission will study chronic illnesses including asthma, auto-immune disease and autism.\n\n“Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases,” Mr Trump’s executive order said.\n\n“An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness … Seventy-seven per cent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. Ninety per cent of the nation’s $US4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively.”\n\nThe order calls for “ fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety”.\n\n“We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data,” it said. “We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.”\n\nThe commission is tasked with producing a report within 100 days that assesses “the threat that potential over-utilisation of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures pose to children”, as well as the “prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs”.\n\nWithin 180 days the commission will produce a strategy for a response to childhood chronic illness.","summary":"Former My Kitchen Rules celebrity chef Pete Evans has spoken up about the “neo-Nazi” controversy that saw his books pulled from shelves.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/coordinated-attack-pete-evans-opens-up-about-cancellation-following-neonazi-controversy/news-story/89054596685ffdaf2482c41dec35ff50?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b2e3180965e40805d7a5d527798edc3c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:21:03","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":291201074,"title":"What the papers say – February 17","text":"Ukraine takes centre stage on Monday’s front pages, with European leaders convening in Paris for an emergency security meeting ahead of the US and Russia beginning peace talks.\n\nThe Financial Times and the i lead on the emergency meeting of European leaders taking place in France on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, The Guardian says the talks lay bare a “transatlantic chasm” between European and American involvement in the peace talks.

In addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues,” the statement said of Rubio, who arrived on February 15 in Israel for the first Middle East trip since taking office.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry said the two \"agreed to maintain an open channel of communication to address long-standing issues in Russian-American relations.\"\n\n\"Both sides expressed a shared commitment to engaging on key international issues, including the situation in Ukraine, developments in Palestine, and the broader Middle East, as well as other regional matters,\" it said.\n\nAddressing the conference earlier in the day, Zelenskyy called on European countries to create a common army in the face of possible U.S. disengagement and a continued threat from Russia.\n\n\"The time has come, the armed forces of Europe must be created,\" he said.\n\n\"If the Americans decided to go that way, decreasing their presence, it's not good, of course, it's very dangerous,\" he said, speaking in English.\n\nZelenskyy’s call came at an annual conference that, this year, has been dominated by the question of Ukraine and the position of the new U.S. administration on ending the war, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022.\n\nDelegates in Munich have voiced concern over statements by senior U.S. officials this week, suggesting Washington is ready to make major concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nU.S. officials have also reiterated calls for European countries to spend more on defense and take on a bigger share of the security burden. And Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb confirmed media reports saying the United Sates had sent European countries a questionnare asking what they could contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy suggested the new U.S. administration had a new approach not only to Ukraine, but to Europe as a whole. \"The old days are over,\" he said, saying Washington needed Europe as a market but not necessarily as an ally.\n\nThe answer, he said, was collective strength.\n\n\"America needs to see where Europe is heading, and this direction of European policy shouldn't just be promising. It should make America want to stand with a strong Europe.\"\n\nSpeaking before Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was glad the United States had reaffirmed its commitments to Ukraine, adding that nothing should be agreed without Kyiv's involvement.\n\nThere could be, he said, no \"dictated\" solution and \"no decoupling\" of European and U.S. security.\n\nScholz added that Germany had provided four times more support than the United States for Ukraine, when measured as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe chancellor, who faces federal elections on February 23 that opinion polls predict he will lose, also responded to comments made by U.S. Vice President JD Vance yesterday criticizing standards of democracy in Europe and the levels of migration there.\n\n\"We will not accept that people who look at Germany from the outside intervene in our democracy, in our elections,\" Scholz said.\n\nVance's speech stunned delegates at the conference, who had been expecting him to lay out details of Washington's plans for peace in Ukraine. Vance also raised eyebrows here by meeting later with Alice Weidel, the leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nA meeting between Vance and Zelenskyy on February 14 ended without a deal that would give the United States access to Ukrainian critical minerals, including rare-earth elements, which Trump has indicated he is seeking in exchange for aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe following day, Zelenskyy told journalists he had rejected the version of the agreement offered by the United States, saying it lacked \"security guarantees\" for Kyiv and \"does not protect us.\"","summary":"U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is “ready and willing” to deploy British troops to Ukraine to help enforce any peace deal that ends the fighting there, even if it puts soldiers “in harm’s way.”","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/starmer-ukraine-russia-trump-putin-paris-eu/33317239.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/d3ae20b1-91b7-4723-a563-db1f14639287_cx0_cy8_cw0_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:18:49","author":"Rfe/rl","authors":["Rfe/rl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":291202528,"title":"Ensure fairness in deporting Nigerians, FG tells US","text":"The Federal Government has raised concerns over the deportation of its nationals from the United States, calling on Washington to uphold international conventions for a dignified repatriation process.\n\nOn his first day in office as the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump signed several executive orders aimed at tightening immigration policies.\n\nThese include ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border.\n\nHe also announced the deployment of more troops to the southern border and reiterated his pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn a meeting with US Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills Jr., the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu, stressed the emotional and financial toll these deportations are having on Nigerians in the US and their families back home.\n\nOdumegwu-Ojukwu, in a statement signed by her media aide, Magnus Eze, on Sunday stated that “with about 201 Nigerians currently detained in US immigration centres, and about 85 cleared for deportation,” the Federal Government is pushing for a more humane process.\n\nShe noted that many Nigerians in the US send vital remittances to families in Nigeria, supporting their survival and funding their education.\n\nOdumegwu-Ojukwu underscored that these deportations, particularly for individuals with no history of violent crime, should not be traumatic or abrupt.\n\n“We are asking as a country whether they will be given ample time to handle their assets or will they just be bundled into planes and repatriated?” she questioned.\n\nThe minister also expressed concern about the potential suspension of the US’s Drop Box Visa System, which has allowed Nigerians to renew visas without in-person interviews.\n\nWith thousands of Nigerians who rely on this system for travel to the US, Odumegwu-Ojukwu urged the US to clarify its stance and ease the growing anxiety over visa procedures. \n\nThe future of Nigerian students in the US is also in question, as some 14,000 students are supported by families in Nigeria who fear that US policy changes may affect their children’s education.\n\nFurthermore, Odumegwu-Ojukwu voiced worries over the ongoing review of USAID programmes, critical to humanitarian efforts in Nigeria.\n\nShe called for clarity, stressing that any reduction in aid would disproportionately affect vulnerable communities in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\n“We cannot say whether it’s outright suspension. A lot of NGOs are worried to get clarifications. We will just make that appeal on behalf of the NGOs in Nigeria, even less than a month into the 90 days review, there have been concerns. And I know before the completion of the review, there is already humanitarian issues in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n“We will make an appeal that this initiative be preserved, even if it is abrogated as an agency, there must be a way of keeping the ideals to ensure that the poor beneficiaries in the communities, not just in Nigeria but Africa are not abandoned,” the minister of state appealed.\n\nIn response, Ambassador Mills assured that the Drop Box Visa System had not been suspended, explaining that the US was undergoing a policy review typical with any new administration.\n\nHe noted, “Some of these NGOs are feeling the pains, but the situation is being reviewed.”\n\nOn the deportation issue, Mills stated that those to be repatriated would return to Lagos and clarified that most deportees would include convicted criminals or individuals who violated US immigration laws.\n\n“Those to be repatriated would be dropped in Lagos. There would not be room for whether it should be in Port Harcourt or Abuja.\n\n“The first group will be convicted prisoners; those who committed crimes and are in US prisons. Some of them are those who have clearly violated US immigration laws. They appealed but were denied yet they are still in the US.

Sir Keir will then travel to Washington DC later this month to report the discussions to Mr Trump directly.\n\nA defence source told the Mail last night: ‘It’s a big moment. It’s an opportunity to develop a clear and united position on how we secure any future peace in Ukraine.’\n\nThe insider claimed the US is ‘open to ideas’ and so Sir Keir needs to ‘present them with a unified pitch on what Europe can offer’.\n\n‘As you saw from the last few days with [Defense Secretary] John Healey and [Foreign Secretary] David Lammy out across Europe, the UK is playing an important leadership role already. We will be a central part of those conversations with the US, as their closest security ally.’\n\nOne of Sir Keir’s Cabinet ministers believes he can act as a ‘bridge’ between Europe and the US as the President demands Nato members spend more on their defence.\n\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC yesterday [sun]: ‘I believe we in the UK can play a part. As that bridge between the US and Europe as we adjust to this new era, and it certainly is a new era.’\n\nHe admitted the delicate role of middleman for Sir Keir will not be easy but insisted: ‘There is definitely from the new US administration, a view towards Europe, and there’s a slightly different view towards ourselves in the UK.’\n\nBut while he insisted that a peace settlement will require ‘the involvement of European nations and the Ukrainians themselves’, neither are invited to the talks due to start between the US and Russia this week.\n\nMr Trump’s top foreign policy advisers flew into Saudi Arabia last night following his dramatic phone call with Putin about ending the three-year war.\n\nDespite pleas that Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy be given a seat at the table, after he stressed that no one can make a deal without his agreement, the US confirmed last night that he will not be involved directly in the negotiations.\n\nWhite House Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News yesterday that he and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz were both going to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr Witkoff said he hopes for ‘good progress’. But asked why Ukraine was not invited, he said it was ‘part of the talks’, insisting: ‘I have to push back on any notion that they aren’t being consulted. They absolutely are.’\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio will also be at the first meeting and is expected to hold direct talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov but cautioned it would not bring an immediate end to the fighting.\n\nMr Rubio told CBS: ‘The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It’s their country and they’re on the front lines. So one meeting isn’t going to solve it. But I want to reiterate the President made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we’re going to take them if they present themselves.’\n\nHowever a former Deputy Assistant Secretary General of NATO accused Mr Trump of switching sides to align the US with Russia.\n\nStefanie Babst told Times Radio: ‘He is siding with the pariah state, with a war criminal, and he has been a Putin fan all along. We can certainly no longer rely on the transatlantic relationship as we have come to know it for the past 75 years.’\n\nAnd former Prime Minister Sir John Major said :‘If America is not to stand behind its allies in the way the world has previously seen, then we are moving into a wholly different and in my view, rather more dangerous world.’\n\nHe said Mr Trump’s call to Putin was made with ‘no consultation with Ukraine or anyone else’.\n\n‘Yet consider what happens if Russia can claim a win: China is going to notice that, and so will the world, and so will every tin-pot dictator around the world,’ Sir John said.","summary":"The Prime Minister will travel to Paris for the emergency meeting organised by French president Emmanuel Macron after to Mr Trump's shock move to begin negotiations with Putin.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14403917/Keir-Starmers-balancing-act-PM-join-EU-leaders-emergency-Ukraine-summit-today-hopes-remain-blocs-bridge-USA-Zelenskys-team-frozen-peace-talks-global-tectonic-shift.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/16/22/95275667-0-image-m-48_1739744185259.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:12:25","author":"Editor,Martin Beckford Policy","authors":["Editor","Martin Beckford Policy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":291200000,"title":"Florida has to deal with a toxic red tide off the coast, but enough about Mar-a-Lago [Florida]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support \nstyle sheets.

Echoing Trump, he said that “the gates of hell would be open” if Hamas doesn’t release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that triggered the 16-month war.\n\nTheir remarks came two weeks before the ceasefire’s first phase is set to end. The second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, has yet to be negotiated.\n\nTrump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News that he had “very productive” calls Sunday with Netanyahu and officials from Egypt and Qatar, which are serving as mediators, about continuing talks this week. He also said that hostages to be released include 19 Israeli soldiers and “we believe all of them are alive.”\n\nNetanyahu’s office confirmed the call and said that Israel’s security Cabinet would meet Monday to discuss the second phase.\n\nRubio said that Hamas can’t continue as a military or government force.\n\n“As long as it stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible,” he said. “It must be eradicated.”\n\nSuch language could complicate talks with Hamas, which reasserted control over Gaza when the ceasefire took hold last month despite suffering heavy losses.\n\nRubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which are political heavyweights in the region.\n\nThe Israeli military, meanwhile, said that it carried out an airstrike Sunday on people who approached its forces in southern Gaza. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its police officers while they secured the entry of aid trucks near Rafah on the Egyptian border.\n\nHamas called the attack a “serious violation” of the ceasefire.\n\nResuming the war could doom hostages\n\nThis week marks 500 days of the war. Resuming the fighting could be a death sentence for remaining hostages and may not succeed in eliminating Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu has signaled readiness to resume the war after the current phase, and has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top leaders into exile.\n\nHamas has rejected such a scenario and insists on Palestinian rule. Spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou told The Associated Press that the group accepts either a Palestinian unity government or a technocratic committee to run Gaza.\n\nLast week, Hamas threatened to hold up the latest release of hostages, because Netanyahu has yet to approve the entry of mobile homes and heavy machinery into Gaza as required by the ceasefire agreement, before proceeding with the release Saturday based on what it called assurances from Arab mediators.\n\nAn Israeli official said on condition of anonymity in line with regulations that the issue would be discussed in the coming days, and Israel was coordinating with the United States.\n\nIn another sign of closing ranks, Israel’s Defense Ministry said that it received a shipment of 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) MK-84 munitions from the United States. The Biden administration had paused a shipment of such bombs last year over concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza.\n\n‘If someone has a better plan … that’s great’\n\nIn an interview last week, Rubio indicated that Trump’s proposal was in part aimed at pressuring Arab states to make their own postwar plan that would be acceptable to Israel.\n\nHe also appeared to suggest that Arab countries send troops to combat Hamas.\n\n“If someone has a better plan, and we hope they do, if the Arab countries have a better plan, then that’s great,” Rubio said Thursday on the “Clay and Buck Show.”\n\nBut “Hamas has guns,” he added. “Someone has to confront those guys. It’s not going to be American soldiers. And if the countries in the region can’t figure that piece out, then Israel is going to have to do it.”\n\nRubio wasn’t scheduled to meet with Palestinians on his trip to the Middle East.\n\nArabs have limited options\n\nFor Arab leaders, facilitating the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza or battling Palestinian militants on behalf of Israel are nightmare scenarios that would bring fierce domestic criticism and potentially destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nEgypt will host an Arab summit on Feb. 27 and is working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.\n\nEgypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would undermine its nearly half-century peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of U.S. influence in the region.\n\nArab and Muslim countries have conditioned any support for postwar Gaza on a return to Palestinian governance with a pathway to statehood in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nIsrael has ruled out a Palestinian state and any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, whose forces were driven out when Hamas seized power there in 2007.\n\nRubio to visit regional heavyweights\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have rejected any mass displacement of Palestinians and would be key to any regional response.\n\nThe UAE was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords in which four Arab states – Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco and Sudan – normalized relations with Israel during Trump’s previous term.

The President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, had said the refinery could satisfy Nigeria’s fuel needs and would also export to other countries.\n\nAliko vowed that the refinery would end the importation of refined petroleum products, wondering how an oil-producing country like Nigeria would depend on ’dirty’ imported fuel for its energy needs.\n\nWhen the refinery started operations in January 2024, it crashed the diesel pump price from around N1,700 to N1,000. Recently it also lowered the ex-depot price of PMS from N950 to N890 per litre.\n\nIn its February Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC said the Dangote refinery could help stabilise the supply of petroleum products as it ramps up production. The $20bn refinery is currently ramping up production to hit its full capacity.\n\nRecently, the Vice President of the Dangote Group, Davakumar Edwin, disclosed that the refinery is currently at 550,000 capacity, saying it could attain its full capacity by March or thereabouts.\n\nIn its report, OPEC disclosed that the oil sector remains central to the Nigerian economy even though the non-oil sector plays an increasingly important role in driving growth.\n\nAccording to OPEC, after the Nigerian economy recorded healthy growth in the third quarter of 2024 across key sectors, economic growth is anticipated to have been steady in 4Q24 as well.\n\nIt added that economic growth reached 3.5 per cent year-on-year in 3Q24, up from 3.2 per cent year-on-year in 2Q24.\n\n“This came despite the impact of tightening monetary policy, with the non-oil sector playing an increasingly important role in driving growth, supported by easing price pressures and a potential loosening of tight monetary policy.\n\n“However, the oil sector remains central to the economy, and the Dangote Refinery reaching full production capacity should help stabilise the petroleum product supply and possibly lower petrol prices,” the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the refinery targets its full production capacity, low local crude supply has remained a major challenge. As Nigeria’s refining capacity increases, the 450,000 barrels of crude oil allocated for local refineries is no longer enough.\n\nRecently, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission revealed that the Dangote refinery, the Port Harcourt refinery, and six others would need 770,500 barrels for daily fuel production.\n\nNUPRC data sourced from the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority puts the country’s refining capacity at 974,500 barrels per day. The NUPRC estimated that eight refineries would need 123.5 million barrels of crude oil in the first six months of 2025.\n\nThe refineries are: the Dangote refinery, Port Harcourt refinery, Warri refinery, Kaduna refinery, Opac refinery, Waltersmith refinery, Duport Midstream Company Limited, Aradel refinery, and Edo refinery.\n\nAccording to the crude oil production forecast of producing oil companies and the refining requirement of functional refineries in Nigeria signed by the NUPRC Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, the Dangote refinery is forecasted to need 550,000 barrels of a blend of Nigerian crude oil daily, 17.05 million barrels monthly, and 99.55 million barrels between January and June 2025.\n\nOpac refinery requires 5,000bpd; Waltersmith needs 4,500bpd; Duport needs 2,000bpd while Edo refinery requires 1,000bpd. Others are Aradel refinery, 7,000bpd; Port Harcourt refinery, 60,000bpd; Warri refinery, 75,000bpd, and Kaduna refinery, 66,000bpd.\n\nRecall that in July 2024, President Bola Tinubu ordered the NNPC to sell crude oil to local refineries in naira. In October, the committee supervising the naira-for-crude deal commenced the sale of crude to only the Dangote refinery in naira, saying it would sell to only petrol-producing refineries.\n\nHowever, with the Port Harcourt and Warri refineries coming on stream, more refineries would be considered for the naira-for-crude arrangement. To avoid having its ramp-up plans disrupted, the refinery is looking elsewhere for its crude, importing 12 million barrels from the United States lately.\n\nAlready, the refinery is building eight more tanks to stockpile imported crude oil as local supplies become unreliable. Officials of the refinery were quoted as saying that low crude supply from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited “is driving import dependence.”\n\nThe building of eight additional tanks will increase crude storage capacity at the refinery by 41.67 per cent to 3.4 billion litres. \n\n“Importing crude from other countries instead of buying locally means that our crude stockpiles will have to be higher,” Vice President Edwin had said.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, a consultant with the Dangote refinery who did not want to be mentioned, called on the Federal Government and the committee supervising the naira-for-crude deal to do the right thing.\n\n“OPEC knows what it is saying, they must have done their research well before making projections. We all can see how the refinery crashed the price of diesel. It recently reduced the price of PMS and eliminated the year-long fuel queues in filling stations, especially during yuletide. They know what they are saying.\n\n“The thing is that let the local actors do the right thing. OPEC has its reasons for making that projection. Let the local actors behave and stop playing games. They tell the people that they are giving refineries crude for naira but they are playing games.\n\n“So, what we are saying is that all things considered, it (OPEC projection) will come to pass. That’s it,” the consultant stated.\n\nAnother inner source told our correspondent that though prices of petroleum products are determined by various factors, enough local crude supply would aid the availability and affordability of fuel across the nation.\n\n“Nobody fixes the price and that’s why it keeps changing. However, enough local crude supply will aid affordability. That’s why we are calling on the Federal Government to ensure the naira-for-crude policy achieves its objectives.\n\n“We have said it before, what we get from the committee is below what we requested. But we can only appeal to them to look into this for the good of all Nigerians,” the source said.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of CORAN, Eche Idoko, explained that in the refining business, the larger the quantity refined, the lower the product cost.\n\n“I agree with OPEC. It’s purely based on the economics of scale. In refining, the larger the quantity you refine the cheaper the cost and the more the yield. Consequently, the better the margins,” Idoko stated.\n\nHowever, he added that Nigeria should not have crude challenges considering the abundant oil reserves.\n\n“Ideally, we shouldn’t have crude challenges. We have abundant provable reserves of sweet crude in the country, and with the recent progress made with the domestic crude supply obligation as enshrined in the Petroleum Industry Act, we can not but hope for a bright prospect for domestic refining in Nigeria,“\n\nWhile saying inflation remains high, OPEC maintained that early signs of cooling have emerged, partly due to base effects from the naira’s devaluation.\n\nIt added that the Central Bank of Nigeria appears to be nearing the end of its tightening cycle, following its rate hikes in the second half of 2024 with the key policy rate standing at 27.5 per cent.\n\n“Consequently, real interest rates remain deeply negative. Inflation rose to 34.9 per cent, y-o-y, in December, following 34.6 per cent, y-o-y, in November and 33.9 per cent, y-o-y, in October. The S&P PMI remained at an expansionary level of 52 in January, compared with 52.7 in December,” the report said.\n\nIn its short-term prospects for product markets and refinery operations, OPEC revealed that there is upside potential for new product volumes entering international markets from Dangote refinery and Yulong petrochemical, Olmeca, lengthening product balances going forward, particularly for gasoline.\n\nThe ability of the country to meet the quota set for it by OPEC might be a good signal toward more crude supply to local refineries. In January, Nigeria made real its focus to ramp up oil production, raising average daily crude output to 1,538,697 barrels per day, which is 103 per cent of the OPEC quota.\n\nThis is also about 39,000 barrels above the 1.5mbpd set for the oil-producing country by OPEC. The PUNCH reports that Nigeria has failed to meet the crude oil production quota approved by OPEC throughout 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nAccording to the NUPRC, oil production, including crude and condensate, rose to 1.74mbpd in January, up from 1.6mbpd in December. However, this is below the 2mbpd target of the commission for the year.\n\nThe regulator’s data disclosed that the lowest and peak production in January were 1.66mbpd and 1.79mbpd respectively.\n\n“The daily average production in January was 1,737,480 barrels per day, consisting of both crude oil (1,538,697bpd) and condensate (198.783bpd). The average crude oil production was 103 per cent of OPEC quota (1.5 mbpd),” the NUPRC stated.\n\nFor years, crude oil theft, and pipeline vandalism, among other factors, stopped the country from meeting its OPEC oil production quotas.\n\nBut the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, expressed confidence that Nigeria could hit 3mbpd this year.\n\nThe oil minister had insisted that Nigeria would follow the ’Drill, baby drill’ slogan of the United States President, Donald Trump, to ramp up production.","summary":"The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has expressed optimism that the Dangote Petroleum Refinery can lower petrol prices in Nigeria.

Four years later, however, the program has not connected users to the internet, the Washington Policy Center found in a report last year. States were required to submit plans to the federal government by 2023 related to the investment and deployment of the internet services. Former President Joe Biden, upon the states submitting their plans, celebrated the internet initiative as similar to former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1936 Rural Electrification Act, which brought electricity to homes nationwide. \"What we’re doing is, as I said, not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm in our nation.

It all began when Bove, as authorized by Attorney General Pam Bondi, directed Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon to dismiss the federal indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The Biden Justice Department had indicted Adams on a somewhat questionable bribery charge after he had voiced public criticism of President Biden’s policies on illegal immigration. TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ORDER TO DROP PROSECUTION OF NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SPARKS RESIGNATIONS When he assumed office, President Donald Trump issued an order to de-weaponize the Justice Department, which had engaged in lawfare against him for years. In the spirit of this order, Bove—while not addressing the merits of Adams’ prosecution or impugning the integrity of the prosecutors—ordered the dismissal without prejudice, meaning charges can be brought in the future. Bove provided two rationales for the decision. First, the indictment reasonably could be viewed as interfering with the November 2025 mayoral election in which Adams is a candidate. Second, the indictment would hinder Adams’ ability to assist the Trump administration in its illegal immigration enforcement activities. Bove ordered, for instance, that Adams’ security clearances be restored. Bove made clear that the Trump Justice Department and Adams had not bargained to dismiss the indictment in exchange for Adams’ assistance. Adams and his counsel agreed to the dismissal without prejudice, and the unopposed motion awaits a ruling by Manhattan U.S. District Judge Dale Ho. Even though it called for no improper action by government attorneys, such as lying to the court, Bove’s directive set off a firestorm. Sassoon resigned and wrote a letter in which she asserted that dismissing the indictment would be contrary to the rule of law. She cited her clerkship for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She also clerked for Judge J. Harvey Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit, and the media made sure to publish Wilkinson's praise of Sassoon’s integrity in order to bash the Trump administration. Half a dozen other prosecutors under Sassoon refused to dismiss the indictment and resigned. One, Hagan Scotten, used the terms \"fool\" and \"coward\" to describe anyone who would file the motion to dismiss the indictment. The media made sure to point out that Scotten had received a Bronze Star and that he had clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts and then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh, now an associate Supreme Court justice. These points are irrelevant, because what happened here was simple. Bove, acting under Bondi’s direction, issued a lawful order that many subordinates refused to obey. The Department of Justice Manual, Section 9-2.001, decrees that \"[t]he United States Attorney . . . has plenary authority with regard to federal criminal matters. This authority is exercised under the supervision and direction of the Attorney General and his/her delegates.\" None of these sanctimonious prosecutors resigned during the four years of lawfare directed at President Trump. None of these holier-than-thou officials resigned when Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the FBI to investigate parents who had questioned the way their children were being taught at school board meetings. None of these arrogant attorneys resigned when the Biden Justice Department weaponized the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act to pursue pro-life Christians who had prayed at abortion clinics while doing nothing about attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers and Catholic Churches. None of these preening lawyers resigned when the Biden Justice Department perverted an obstruction statute with a maximum sentence of two decades in prison to pursue January 6 protesters when that statute was, as the Supreme Court ruled last year, inapplicable. But a dismissal without prejudice of an indictment for alleged political corruption has spawned insufferable letters of condemnation and seven resignations so far. To these insubordinates, good riddance, for you no longer reign over what you view as the \"Sovereign District of New York.\" Article II of the Constitution vests the executive power and authority of the presidency in the president. Bondi and Bove are exercising President Donald Trump’s authority not to persecute people, but to stop possible persecutions. Recall that Adams was indicted by the Biden Justice Department after lodging criticism against the administration. Leftists in the media certainly would have sounded the alarm if the Trump Justice Department had indicted a government official critical of Trump. In his extraordinary dissent in Morrison v. Olson (1988), Justice Scalia wrote about the prospect of a weaponized legal system. Times have proven him sadly correct, and Bove referenced the dissent in his damning response letter to Sassoon.

Still, the Bush 43 Justice Department filed charges against several members of the New Black Panther Party who allegedly had intimidated voters and poll workers at polling places. Kristen Clarke, who later headed the Civil Rights Division under President Biden, lobbied vigorously and successfully for the Obama Justice Department to drop the charges. This political decision sparked no outrage or letters of resignation from career prosecutors. No media howls erupted. Here, President Trump’s political appointees issued a lawful and ethical order that two career Justice Department prosecutors—apparently fools or cowards in Scotten’s view—signed. Spoiled-brat bureaucrats refused to obey the directive, believing they knew better. Sassoon, for instance, argued there was no reasonable basis to dismiss the case.

Kvitka – his wife who he is in the process of getting divorced from.\n\nHe was born in Khmelnytskyi, a city in western Ukraine, and lived there until 2008 before moving to Kyiv.\n\nFrom 2019 until June 2022, Mr Muliar, Ms Kvitka and their son Marko Muliar, nine, lived in Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, interspersed with several adventures cycling to countries including Australia, Brazil, Argentina and India.\n\nThe trio moved to Hexham, in Northumberland, in June 2022, following Russia’s full-scale invasion, after being offered residency there by locals Kevin Jones and Catriona Mulligan, who Mr Muliar said were “truly, incredibly helpful”.\n\nWanting to do something to keep Ukraine in peoples’ minds as the third anniversary of the attack draws ever closer, Mr Muliar embarked on his most daring challenge to date from May 31 2024 – trying to ride around as many countries in the world as he can over a three-year period.\n\n“This was my big dream, I have dreamed about doing this all my life,” Mr Muliar, whose base when he is not travelling is Hexham, told the PA news agency.\n\n“I have always been mad about travelling and discovering new places.\n\n“It’s such a difficult time for my country and I wanted to do something for my people, so decided to combine my ideas to cycle around the world and help Ukraine.\n\n“I was really honoured to start the cycle from Hexham because it’s a lovely place and it’s a place where people gave me a lot of love.”\n\nSo far, he has ridden through countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Senegal, Cape Verde and Uruguay and is currently in Chile.\n\nHe has been putting his legs to the test, cycling an average of 80 to 100km each day.\n\nThe most enjoyable aspect of the trip for him has been delving into the culture of each country he visits.\n\n“What I love most is meeting people from other cultures,” he said.\n\n“For example, when I was invited to visit the house of people in Morocco or Senegal, I felt their incredible hospitality.”\n\nIf he cannot physically get from one country to the next on his bike, he uses sailboats – but tries to avoid catching flights unless unavoidable.\n\nHe added there have been some challenging moments, in particular when dealing with the climate in the Sahara desert and being without his son.\n\n“It was really hot, about 45 degrees and you would be cycling for huge distances with just sand, wind and crazy heat,” he said.\n\n“I miss my son very much and I’m always thinking about him and for now, my biggest dream is to see him again and hug him.\n\n“He understands that it is important for me to continue travelling because this is one of my favourite things to do in life and I try to explain to him I am doing this not just for me, but the people of Ukraine too.”\n\nMr Muliar was travelling around Egypt with his family when Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine happened on February 24 2022.\n\nReflecting on that day, he remembered feeling shocked when he received the news.\n\n“It’s probably the biggest, most shocking news for us in our life,” he said.\n\n“We just couldn’t believe it could happen in our time, in Europe, in modern times when all of us have such great possibilities and opportunities to live in peace and harmony.”\n\nHis mother and older brother remain in Khmelnytskyi and he said while it is “a less dangerous place” compared to cities in the east, “there is no completely safe place in Ukraine now”.\n\nRecently, Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, called for the creation of an “army of Europe” following a call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin about plans to bring the invasion of Ukraine to an end.\n\nMr Muliar said he hopes the world remembers and supports Ukraine.\n\n“The world shouldn’t forget about the situation in Ukraine because it is not only about Ukraine – the big monster that is Russia will continue to take countries if we don’t stop them,” he said.\n\n“This is a battle between evil and good so if the world supports Ukraine, it means support for the victory of good.”\n\nAlongside the challenge, he has been fundraising for kit and expenses for his intercontinental adventure, as well as the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) so those directly impacted by the war in Ukraine can get the assistance they need.\n\nHe has also been documenting his travels on various social media platforms including Facebook and YouTube, which has been met with a plethora of comments and interactions.\n\n“I’m glad when people like my videos and posts,” he added.\n\n“It’s nice people like what I am doing.”\n\nMr Muliar’s fundraising page for kit and other expenses linked to his challenge can be found here: https://gofund.me/77bb8eb2, while his fundraising page where money will go to the DEC

Advocates for Resource Self-Reliance Amidst USAID Funding Suspension","text":"President Hakainde Hichilema has underscored the necessity for African nations to manage their resources prudently in light of the recent suspension of USAID funding across the continent. During a bilateral meeting with UNAIDS Executive Director and United Nations Under-Secretary-General Winnie Byanyima on the sidelines of the African Union (AU) Summit in Addis Ababa, President Hichilema emphasized that while the withdrawal of such aid was foreseeable, it presents an opportunity for Africa to strengthen its self-reliance.\n\n“The impact and disruption caused by the withdrawal of funding from USAID cannot be overstated,” President Hichilema remarked. He highlighted the critical need for African countries to prioritize efficiency and reduce wasteful expenditures, thereby redirecting resources to essential sectors such as health, agriculture, and education.\n\nThe suspension of USAID funding, initiated by an executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, has led to a 90-day pause in U.S. foreign development assistance to various entities, including foreign countries, NGOs, international organizations, and contractors. This abrupt halt has significantly affected numerous programs across Africa, particularly those related to health and humanitarian aid.\n\nDuring the AU Summit, President Hichilema and Ms. Byanyima discussed strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of the funding suspension. They concurred on the importance of African nations taking proactive measures to manage their resources effectively. This includes reducing wasteful and consumptive expenditures to ensure that critical sectors remain functional and resilient in the face of external funding uncertainties.\n\nPresident Hichilema’s call to action reflects a broader sentiment among African leaders regarding the need for self-sufficiency. The suspension of aid serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities associated with dependence on external assistance. By fostering prudent resource management and prioritizing key sectors, African nations can build more robust economies capable of withstanding such disruptions.\n\nThe President’s sentiments were echoed by Ms. Byanyima, who emphasized the role of efficient resource utilization in sustaining health programs across the continent. She highlighted the necessity for innovative approaches to healthcare funding, including increased domestic investment and the exploration of alternative financing mechanisms.\n\nPresident Hichilema and his administration is expected to implement policies that reflect this commitment to resource efficiency. By channeling funds away from non-essential expenditures and towards critical areas like health, agriculture, and education, Zambia aims to mitigate the impact of the aid suspension and set a precedent for sustainable development.\n\nThe current situation presents both challenges and opportunities for African nations. While the suspension of USAID funding disrupts many existing programs, it also serves as a catalyst for introspection and reform. By embracing prudent resource management and reducing dependency on external aid, African countries can pave the way for a more autonomous and resilient future.\n\nPresident Hichilema’s advocacy for self-reliance and efficient resource management resonates as a crucial strategy for African nations navigating the complexities of global aid dynamics. The recent developments underscore the imperative for Africa to harness its resources effectively, ensuring sustainable growth and development irrespective of external funding landscapes.","summary":"President Hakainde Hichilema has underscored the necessity for African nations to manage their resources prudently in light of the recent suspension of USAID funding across the continent.

All 20 had been intercepted and charged.\n\nBut US think-tank the Centre for American Progress says the new bill will instead bar millions of valid US citizens from attending the polls. \n\nIt won’t be a problem if they have a passport. But some 146 million US citizens have never passed beyond their nation’s borders.\n\nAnd corroborating documentation should exist. It’s just a convoluted, costly and time-consuming process to obtain it every time you want to vote.\n\nEspecially if you’ve been married more than once.\n\nBut no exemptions are allowed.\n\nThe SAVE Act stipulates that any election worker who registers a voter without the proper documentation will be jailed for up to five years. Regardless of whether or not that voter was truly a US citizen.\n\nMORE: High roller Trump kids’ multimillion dollar digs\n\nA challenged Constitution\n\nUnder the US Constitution, all citizens – barring children and some convicted criminals – have the inalienable right to vote. Any attempt to obstruct their vote is an offence.\n\nAnd the 19th Amendment, passed a century ago largely thanks to Republican Party efforts, guarantees this privilege to women.\n\nHowever, what constitutes “inalienable” has become a matter of debate.\n\nVoters must already provide proof of identification. Different states apply different measures, including social security numbers and other forms of photo ID.\n\nThe idea that there were millions of undocumented immigrants voting was raised in the 2016 election campaign that saw Donald Trump win his first presidency. He insisted the only reason he lost the popular vote (and not the decisive Electoral College vote) was that 3 million illegal votes had been cast in favour of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAn audit of that election later found only 30 out of 136,787,187 votes were suspected of being cast by non-citizens. \n\nBut the White House now insists that government-issued photo ID is not enough. So, it wants all voters to present their passports, military IDs and proof of naturalisation. And these need, or must be presented with, verified birth certificates.\n\nIt’s not as easy as it sounds.\n\nMarried voters who have changed their name must attend their local records office to purchase a copy. This, in itself, requires proof of identity. And time. And money. And available government staff.\n\nThen, that birth certificate must be taken to the election office responsible for your electorate. But it can only be presented alongside copies of current federal ID and marriage licences.\n\nProcuring certified copies of these can also be a protracted, costly process.\n\nEspecially if you’re living in remote areas or are under time pressures.\n\nAnd each change of name for each marriage must be thoroughly documented.\n\n“More than 21 million Americans are unable to access the additional documents that would be required to register to vote under the SAVE Act,” the Campaign Legal Centre says in a statement. \n\n“People of colour, married people who have changed their names, as well as young and elderly people are more likely to have difficulty in accessing these documents.”\n\nBut the Brennan Centre legal advocacy group argues the implications of the SAVE Act extend far beyond married women and the elderly. \n\nIt says the requirement to present citizenship documentation in person will “functionally eliminate mail registration”.\n\nAnd the tendency for postal votes to tip a tight election in favour of the Democrats has long been a bugbear for the Republican Party.\n\nRepresentative Roy insists the SAVE Act presents no new hurdles to any valid voter.\n\n“The legislation provides myriad ways for people to prove citizenship and explicitly directs states to establish a process for individuals to register to vote if there are discrepancies in their proof of citizenship documents due to something like a name change,” he told US media.\n\nA bridge too far?\n\nAlongside the SAVE Act is another piece of legislation.\n\nUS travellers will soon have to present identification compliant with the REAL ID identification standard before they can board domestic airline flights.\n\nPassport holders will get a pass. As will those with military IDs.\n\nBut getting any other form of REAL ID will demand proof of name change.\n\nAnd that, again, directly affects 69 million married US women.\n\nAs of May 7, failure to prove a maiden name will see “tradwife” travellers barred at the gate.\n\nThe REAL ID Act was passed shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, DC. It was intended to prevent foreign hijackers from getting aboard domestic flights such as those that slammed into the World Trade Centre and Pentagon.\n\nThe new laws will now impose the standard on all US travellers.\n\nLike the SAVE Act, the only way to get a REAL ID is to attend a registration office in person (in this case, the Department of Motor Vehicles) with validated birth certificates, marriage certificates and supplementary forms of federal proof of identity.\n\nRoy first introduced the SAVE Act in July 2024.\n\nBut this attempt failed when it encountered the then-Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nSimilar legislation introduced by Kansas and Arizona state governments has been overturned by the US Supreme Court for violating the Constitution and the National Voter Registration Act.\n\nNow, his fellow Republicans are in charge of both the Senate and Congress on Capitol Hill. So the SAVE Act is being reintroduced.\n\n“We already have strict laws in place to protect the security of our elections,” the Campaign Legal Centre states. \n\n“The right to vote is a basic American freedom, and our elected officials should be working to protect that right, not restrict it.”\n\nThe rise of the US tradwife\n\nIs the SAVE Act and broader application of the REAL ID Act really about illegal immigrants casting a vote to influence US politics?\n\nOr the role of US women?\n\nFundamentalist Christian pastor Dale Partridge argued ahead of the Presidential election last year that “in a Christian marriage, a wife should vote according to her husband’s direction”.\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, spoke out in a campaign speech about the need to protect US women from themselves: “I want to protect the women of our country … I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not”.\n\nIt also comes with a growing push among US Christian fundamentalists to challenge the feminist movement through nostalgia.\n\n“Tradwives market a romanticised lifestyle,” says Auckland University of Technology researcher Christina Vogels.\n\n“The tradwife lifestyle also promotes a pioneering domesticity. Tradwife influencers often post about baking their own bread, make their own preserves and mending their family’s clothes.”\n\nOf course, no mention is made of the epidemic of Valium dependency among bored homemakers of that era.\n\nIt clashes fiercely with President Trump’s campaign against fentanyl addiction.\n\nBut the sitcom-based ideal of the American housewife has taken root in US media, social media and broader culture. Especially among the far-right elements gaining popularity.\n\n“The tradwife identity offers women … security: a stable, strictly defined and seemingly uncomplicated identity that is predicated solely on serving one’s husband and children,” Vogels adds.\n\n“On the surface, this is what many feel a traditional return to womanhood offers. But the costs of giving up the gains of feminism are not clear …\n\n“When you strip away the romanticism of domesticity, the tradwife lifestyle only furthers the difficulties women face today by breeding a deep misogyny that is based on an intense subjugation of women.”\n\nJamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @jamieseidel.bsky.social","summary":"A truly bonkers scenario is unfolding in the US right now, with more than 69 million people facing the possibility of losing a basic right.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/wild-new-rule-could-stop-millions-of-married-us-women-from-voting-in-elections/news-story/c3bc9b984c19ed858c71a8c54dafdd78?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a0ecd3dbcf0a2b8cc4fd1ff2bbbf7552","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 00:00:28","author":"Jamie Seidel","authors":["Jamie Seidel"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":291199346,"title":"Ontario election: Group urges voters to turn homeless crisis into key issue","text":"Share this Story : Ontario election: Group urges voters to turn homeless crisis into key issue Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr \n\nAdvertisement 2Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nSign In or Create an Accountor View more offers\n\nHomes in LondonFor buyers, sellers, renters and dreamers — London's complex, fascinating real estate market is brought into focus and into context with this newsletter.By signing up, you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

The US Secretary of State also noted that Hamas must be completely eliminated and eradicated to ensure a lasting peace.“Hamas cannot continue as a military or government force. And frankly, as long as it stands as a force that can govern or as a force that can administer, or as a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”Netanyahu signalled on Sunday that he was moving ahead with Trump’s proposal. The plan was announced last week in the White House after the Israeli premier met the US president in Washington. Netanyahu calls the proposal the “only viable plan to enable a different future”.Netanyahu says he and Trump are working in “full cooperation and coordination”, before praising Trump and calling him “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House”.The Israeli leader also warned that the “gates of hell will be opened” if Hamas does not comply with terms of the ceasefire agreement. He added that he’s been discussing Israel’s response in that case with Trump, but didn’t offer more detail on what was planned.“We have a common strategy and we can’t always share the details of this strategy with the public”, said Netanyahu.Rubio and Netanyahu also discussed an array of other regional issues. Netanyahu announced that Israel is committed to the ceasefire understandings with Lebanon and says he expects the new Lebanese government to display equal commitment.Syria was also on the agenda, where the pair discussed Israeli responses to any conflicts or violence that may arise. Israel says it is ready to defend itself against any attacks on its territory and warned of escalating tensions or provoking them.Rubio will be visiting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates next as part of his tour. In Riyadh, Rubio and his delegation are also set to meet with Ukrainian and Russian officials to discuss ways to end the almost three-year long war on Ukraine.The US Secretary of State has opted to skip Egypt and Jordan, two regional US allies, after they refused to accept any influx of Palestinian refugees, to which Trump warned he might slash US aid if they don’t comply, carrying devastating consequences to both countries’ economies.","summary":"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem as he kicked off his first tour of the Middle East.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/17/marco-rubio-backs-trumps-gaza-proposal-as-he-visits-israel-in-his-first-tour-of-the-middle","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/05/99/58/1440x810_cmsv2_fe9ac144-9ed8-58e0-bc17-61adb2dac7dd-9059958.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:58:49","author":"Malek Fouda","authors":["Malek Fouda"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":291197032,"title":"RFK Jr. makes savage cut to the CDC and its vaunted team of 'disease detectives' on his first day as Trump's health chief","text":"RFK Jr. makes savage cut to the CDC and its vaunted team of 'disease detectives' on his first day as Trump's health chief\n\nLISTEN: Welcome to MAGAland - Daily Mail’s behind the scenes podcast with White House insiders\n\nPODCAST: Why big pharma is terrified of RFK appointment.

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”\n\n“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “Anora,” “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez” and Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown \" to the top prize. \"Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.\n\nSupporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,\" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” was a best-actress nominee but did not attend the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.\n\nThe film's director, Jacques Audiard, has condemned those comments, but in an acceptance speech thanked Gascón along with her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.\n\n“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,\" he said.\n\nFrom the BAFTAs to the Oscars\n\nStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs. The British prizes often provide clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.\n\nThey also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles).”\n\nMadison won the female acting trophy for her powerhouse performance as an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son in “Anora.” She beat Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for “Hard Truths.”\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Madison sent a message to the sex worker community. “You deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally and I implore others to do the same,\" she said.\n\nBrody beat competition from Fiennes, Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown,” Grant for the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo for prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”\n\nBrody, who plays a Hungarian-Jewish architect in the postwar United States, said “The Brutalist” carried a powerful message for our divided times.\n\n“It speaks to the need for all of us to share in the responsibility of how we want others to be treated and how we want to be treated by others,” he said. “There's no place any more for antisemitism. There's no place for racism.\"\n\n“The Brutalist” also won prizes for its cinematography and musical score.\n\nSaldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character in \"Emilia Pérez\" transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”\n\n“A Real Pain,” about mismatched cousins on a trip to explore their roots, won the BAFTA for best original screenplay, as well as Culkin's acting award.\n\n“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” quipped writer-director Jesse Eisenberg, who also co-starred in the film.\n\nClaymation caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.\n\nSci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects, while blockbuster musical \" Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.\n\nRising stars and lifetime honors\n\nMost BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance TV drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”\n\n“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”\n\nThe prize for best British debut went to Rich Peppiatt, writer-director of Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap.”\n\n“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.\n\nThe 3-foot, 6-inch (1.1-meter) actor founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”\n\n“This is the best thing that’s ever happened to me — and I’ve been in ‘Star Wars,’” Davis said as he accepted his award.\n\nThis awards season has been clouded by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, and BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone affected,\n\nThe event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate attended the ceremony, which coincided with school holidays for their three children.\n\nWilliam, 42, sent a video message, recorded during a visit to meet students at the London Screen Academy on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the visit, the heir to the throne discussed his own viewing habits, saying he’d watched World War II drama “Darkest Hour” and had begun postapocalyptic TV drama “The Last of Us.” He said he found it “quite full on” and didn’t make it to the end.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way,” Sir Keir said.\n\n“But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.\n\n“The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again.”\n\nIt is the first time he has explicitly said he was considering sending British troops to Ukraine, having previously only hinted that they could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire.\n\nThe prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine “is essential if we are to deter Mr Putin from further aggression in the future”.\n\nThe message comes ahead of his meeting with European leaders for emergency talks in Paris as they scramble to respond to Donald Trump’s push for a deal with Mr Putin and appears to be aimed at encouraging both European allies and Mr Trump to commit to deterring a future attack.\n\nThe meeting in Paris called by French president Emmanuel Macron will see Sir Keir joined by leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark along with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission and the secretary general of Nato.\n\nThe prime minister, who is due to visit Mr Trump in Washington later this month, said: “While European nations must step up in this moment – and we will – US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again.”\n\nHe added: “I am heading to Paris today with a very clear message for our European friends. We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defence and bearing our own burden.”\n\nRepresentatives of the US administration and Russian counterparts are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia for talks following Mr Trump’s direct phone conversation with Mr Putin on Wednesday. But Ukrainian officials are not expected to be at the table at this stage, while other European leaders might not be involved in the process at all.\n\nSir Keir said: “We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations, because anything less would accept Putin’s position that Ukraine is not a real nation.”\n\nEarlier, Mr Zelensky warned that the risk Russia will occupy Europe is “100 per cent” and said that intelligence showed 150,000 of its soldiers amassing in neighbouring Belarus.\n\nThe Ukrainian president issued the stark warning during an interview with NBC News, where he stressed that he trusted Mr Trump, but would not accept any ceasefire deal conducted without Ukraine at the negotiating table.\n\nWithout Mr Trump and the US administration’s support in Ukraine, Mr Zelensky said they had a “low chance to survive”, having already endured a three-year-long war which has seen them concede 20 per cent of their territory to Moscow’s forces.\n\n“And even if I will look at the army of Russia, if they will see it that they, Russia, have 220 or 250 brigades, and Europe has 50. That is the answer. The risk that Russia will occupy Europe is 100 per cent,” he warned.","summary":"In a dramatic escalation of rhetoric ahead of an urgent meeting of European leaders in Paris on Monday, the prime minister confirmed he is prepared to put a peacekeeping force into Ukraine if there is a deal to end the war with Russia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-british-troops-ukraine-russia-putin-b2699253.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/16/22/6ce58535d5bbb6b1ff73d7528c9b4fb5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM5ODMwMTE4-2.74927637.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:42:37","author":"Athena Stavrou","authors":["Athena Stavrou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.207},{"id":291203778,"title":"Schools serving military service members’ kids are pulling books on civil rights history after Trump’s DEI threats","text":"The federal education system that supports Defense Department schools around the world has ordered schools under its purview to remove books from their libraries that deal with any topic relating to diversity, equity and inclusion, following Donald Trump’s executive order.\n\nThe missive from the Department of Defense Education Activity was issued on February 6, forcing schools — like an elementary institution at the U.S. Army’s Fort Campbell in Kentucky — to round up books that don't align with the Trump administration's ideological views. \n\nThe order demands that employees at 161 elementary and high schools around the world “ensure compliance with executive orders and recent DoDEA guidance.”\n\nBut the order is reportedly being broadly interpreted by librarians and school officials to include any books dealing with issues that could be perceived as promoting one group over another — meaning that books about slavery, civil rights history, or treatment of Native Americans could be removed.\n\nSchools have already been told they can’t host events recognizing Black History Month and other cultural observances, agency spokesman Will Griffin said last week.\n\nThe document bans “monthly cultural observances,” prompting schools to immediately cancel Black History Month events and remove bulletin boards referencing Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, Tennessee’s Clarksville Now reported.\n\nThe DoDEA instructions also include anti-trans changes like ensuring programs for girls can “only be accessed by biological females.”\n\nLibrarians at Fort Campbell’s elementary school have reportedly been instructed to remove any books that contain “discriminatory equity ideology.”\n\nThe school employees have reportedly been given a deadline of February 18 to remove the books. \n\n“The librarians are frustrated – they’re not getting any true guidance but are getting specific time frames,\" one person told Clarksville Now under condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nIronically, the DoDEA order may force the school to scrub the history of the famed 101st Airborne Division, which is based in Fort Campbell. The 101st was deployed to Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957 to protect Black students during the desegregation of a high school. The moment was a pivotal turning point in the civil rights movement. \n\nAnother source told the outlet that a school in Europe under the DoDEA's purview was forced to remove books that discuss immigration in a positive light. \n\nLast week, the U.S. Military Academy disbanded 12 campus clubs that stem from ethnic and gender affiliation, including a club founded in 1976 for female cadets and professional organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nMore than 300,000 soldiers who fought for the United States during World War II were immigrants at the time of the conflict, according to the National World War II Museum. \n\nThe guidance is the result of Trump's executive orders titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.”\n\nThe American Library Association and the American Association of School Librarians lambasted the guidance as a “shameful censorship” decree that erases history and is designed to “silence the voices of Americans whose lives reflect the diversity of our nation.”\n\n“By ordering the removal and suppression of learning materials and activities in its schools and libraries, the DoDEA is engaging in censorship of legitimate views and opinions that violates the First Amendment rights of those who serve our nation and their families, thereby denying them the very freedoms they have pledged to protect with their lives,” the groups said in a statement this month.\n\n“The brave people who defend us deserve to exercise the rights they protect, and their children deserve the right to read a broad array of materials and learn from a range of perspectives that reflect the abundance of ideas from all Americans,” the statement said. \n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the U.S. Army.","summary":"Defense officials give schools around the world until February 18 to remove books that don’t align with Trump’s ideological views","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/military-schools-order-remove-dei-books-b2699252.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/16/23/25/U-S--President-Donald-Trump-signs-an-executive-order-in-the-Oval-Office-at-the-White-House-7kcnxem3.jpeg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/RbCWqzAs-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:40:38","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":291195302,"title":"US, Russia should have held summit before Ukrainian crisis — Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, February 17. /TASS/.

Many of them are elderly people. They should not have been prosecuted,” the president said.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke to several of the pardoned pro-life advocates, who thanked the president for setting them free. \n\nThe predecessor Biden-Harris administration’s Justice Department had brought criminal or civil cases under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act against at least 50 pro-life advocates. Twenty-three were convicted. Ten were released from prison after the pardons.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, are now leading the charge in Congress to repeal the FACE Act so it can’t be weaponized against pro-lifers in future Democratic presidents’ administrations. Ninety-seven percent of FACE Act prosecutions between the years of 1994 and 2024 were initiated against pro-life Americans.\n\n“[President] Joe Biden’s unjust weaponization of the FACE Act against pro-life activists and people of faith belongs in the dustbin of history,” Lee told The Daily Signal. “While President Trump is stopping these outrageous prosecutions, we should ensure that no future administration has the ability to persecute Americans through unequal application of the law.”\n\nCalvin Zastrow\n\nCalvin Zastrow, 64, of Kawkalin, Michigan, was released from federal prison on Jan. 23, about halfway through his six-month sentence in a low-security facility in Thomson, Illinois. He’s thankful to be back with his wife and children in Saginaw, Michigan, after receiving the presidential pardon.\n\nZastrow has been doing pro-life “rescues” for 30 years and has been imprisoned many times. \n\n“I’m very thankful to the Lord to be pardoned and to get back into the fight against baby-murdering and to serve the Lord and to be with my family,” he told The Daily Signal. “It’s absolutely wonderful.”\n\nThe Illinois facility where Zastrow was incarcerated was on lockdown for six day leading up to the pardon, so he was unable to access news, phone calls, or emails. On Jan. 20, he heard the Jan. 6 Capitol protest prisoners in his unit shouting “Worthy is the Lamb” and “Goodbye” on their way out after their pardons.\n\nWhen he didn’t hear anything about his own pardon, he thought, “Praise the Lord, I got three more months of prison ministry ahead of me.” \n\nZastrow believes it was God’s providence that he was pardoned on Jan. 23, instead of Jan. 20, because he had three days locked in his cell to disciple his cellmate.\n\n“It was powerful time in Christ, it was wonderful, and so then, on the evening of the 23rd, my cellmate and I went to bed at 10, the guards came and banged on our door real loud and shouted my name,” he said. “That usually is a sign that you’re going to get dragged out and beat up. So, it wasn’t fun. And then they woke me up and said, ‘You’re out.'”\n\nHe gathered his belongings and was out the front door an hour later.\n\nZastrow used his 101 days of incarceration to share the Gospel with the men imprisoned with him, which he describes as “a great privilege.”\n\n“I was able to minister to lot of men and encourage them, and some guys sought me out, some believers that needed some help or just strengthening, or we needed to work through some problems together and some family dynamics they were going through,” he said, “so, it was a joy for me to evangelize, to tell people about Jesus. It was a joy for me to minister to other believers in there and to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”\n\nNow that he’s free, Zastrow plans to continue spreading the good news of the Gospel and attempting to save babies from abortion. He also plans to lobby Congress to repeal the FACE Act, which he said is “designed to stop peaceful pro-life Christians from rescuing babies.”\n\n“What would it be like if Thomson prison didn’t come and tell me that I was pardoned? That would be cruel. That would be selfish,” he said. “And then I thought, the Creator of the universe, the Almighty Father, the Lord God Yahweh, He has sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die on the cross and to pay our sin debt. And He offers that pardon to all who will believe and confess their sins and repent and put their trust and faith in Him for salvation.”\n\n“How selfish and cruel for us to keep that from one single person in the whole world,” he said. \n\nThough Zastrow’s time behind bars is over, he plans to return to continue discipling the men whose sentences are far from over. He recently mailed many letters to Thomson prison, and he plans to visit his former prison mates if he is allowed. \n\n“A lot of them are doing good in the Lord,” he said, “and I want to bless and stay in touch with them.” \n\n“Some of them have family visit them, but most of the people in prison never have any visits, so I want to change that personally,” Zastrow continued, “but I also want to spread the word and encourage other people to go visit prisoners to write to them, pray for them, become friends with them.” \n\nThough sleeping conditions were far from comfortable, Zastrow thanks the Lord for sustaining him and keeping him from illness so he could continue sharing the Gospel.\n\n“I thank the Lord for the privilege, the honor to serve Him under some challenging circumstances,” he said. \n\nPaulette Harlow\n\nPaulette Harlow, 75, of Kingston, Massachusetts, was sentenced to 24 months for charges of federal conspiracy against rights and FACE Act violation. She was granted house arrest due to her chronic health conditions.\n\nShe told The Daily Signal she and her husband are happy and grateful that Trump is president because they think he cares about every American.\n\n“I really believe that President Trump saved my life,” Harlow said. “Because if I had ever gone to prison, I don’t think I would have made it. And I certainly would not have been able to have my back surgeries and everything that I needed to have, and have taken care of.” \n\nShe and her husband thanked Trump “from the bottom of [their] hearts.” \n\n“We really feel like this whole arrest and everything was, it was really ridiculous. It was not necessary. We were peaceful. We were prayerful,” she said. “We were just there to help the mothers and babies.”\n\nHarlow was not surprised to receive a pardon because Trump promised to pardon her. \n\n“We were very, very prayerful, and we had the words of President Trump on video saying, ‘Hang in there, Paula,’ or ‘I’m gonna get you out of there,'” she said.\n\n“I’ve seen him continually say that he’s going to do something and then do it,” Harlow said. “And so I really like that. I really like that. He’s a man of his word.”\n\nHarlow requested permission to go to Mass while on house arrest, but the judge specifically mandated in the court record that she could not attend. The devout Catholic is thankful to be able to go back to church after being pardoned.\n\nShe said the FACE Act, the law weaponized by the Biden DOJ against her, never should have been passed in the first place.\n\n“It was put together by the abortion industry and for the abortion industry,” she said. “The architects of this were abortionists who were concerned because the rescues of the ‘70s and ‘80s and early ‘90s were being effective, not only closing down abortion mills and saving lives, but also there were people from the abortion industry who were coming out of the industry due to this witness.”\n\nWilliam Goodman\n\nWilliam Goodman, 55, of the Bronx, New York, was in prison in Danbury, Connecticut, after being sentenced to 27 months for violating the FACE Act.\n\nLike Zastrow, he discipled the other men in his prison and shared the Gospel through Bible studies and prayer groups.\n\n“We saw the Lord moving, guys being delivered from the bondage of addictions with drugs. There were guys who were coming to pray who were suffering with various sorts of temptations,” Goodman said, “and the inmates who came and who joined us in prayer said that they could feel the peace of God.”\n\nThe FACE Act prisoners were often lumped together with the Jan. 6 prisoners as “political hostages,” so when the latter were pardoned on Inauguration Day, the men in prison were confused why Goodman wasn’t freed, he said.\n\n“God provided the opportunity once again to explain that we were in for protecting babies and for helping moms and dads,” he said. \n\nWhile Goodman was prepared for the worst, he had hope that his pardon from Trump was coming soon.\n\n“Part of me thought if anybody were to understand what we’re going through, it’d be President Trump, because he’s been so attacked by the weaponized Department of Justice, the [attorneys general] offices in the states,” he said, “and so when he said that ‘you are a political hostage,’ I felt like he really meant that, and he understood.”\n\nWhile in prison, Goodman sustained a serious concussion and did not receive sufficient medical care. \n\nHe was writing a letter on Jan. 23 when he received the news of his pardon, and he jumped out of his chair as quickly as his injuries allowed. \n\n“Guys were shaking my hand, and later, when the prison staff came to get me out, 60 guys were cheering for us,” he said, “so there was real joy in the prison, and thanks be to Jesus, who sets the prisoners free!”\n\nGoodman’s head injuries resulted from falling out of his bunkbed, which was about five-and-a-half-feet above the floor.\n\n“I really just did a straight nosedive onto this part of my head, had several skull fractures, fractures all in this area, lacerations and abrasions. I needed stitches, had pressure on my neck, on my spine, and in the back, on my lower back, hurt my thumb,” he said. “I was banged up.”\n\nOne of the Jan. 6 prisoners heard him fall and rushed to alert the guards. Goodman was unconscious, but witnesses said they had never seen so much blood.\n\n“All the fellows in the unit started praying,” he said. “They took me by ambulance to the hospital.”\n\nHe said he probably should’ve spent the night in the hospital, but the guards brought him back to fend for himself in a new cellblock alone. His inmates took care of him by finding him a bed, bringing him food, visiting, and praying.\n\n“The guards didn’t check on me or the medical personnel, and I had a very serious concussion and other injuries,” he said. “And again, by God’s grace, you know, I made it through. And when I was actually able to walk out on the compound again, a number of guys from Foxtrot unit where I fell, some of the Hispanic guys [were] making the sign of the cross, like we were praying for you.”\n\nIf given the opportunity, Goodman would thank Trump for inspiring courage by pardoning the pro-lifers. He would also urge Trump to fight to end abortion. \n\n“I would thank him for the courage that he showed in standing up to the weaponization of the government because his tenacity and his willingness to fight really gave many Americans and patriots inspiration to stand firm and not to compromise,” Goodman said. \n\nThrough his injuries and struggles in prison, Jesus was his hope.\n\n“Jesus loves us and that love extends everywhere in the cosmos,” he said. “I got a letter from Cal, and he said he’s writing from prison, where Jesus is king. And I shared that with the other guys. And so we would say in our prayer group, ‘We’re here praying in Danbury, where Jesus is king.'”\n\nGoodman said the pro-life “rescuers” are attempting to imitate Christ in their work of saving babies from abortion. \n\n“Jesus is the divine rescuer,” he said. “We’re following Him to the rescue. He’s the real rescuer, and it’s a privilege to rescue with Him. It’s an honor. It’s not heroic. It’s just [Jesus’] grace helping us to be faithful.”\n\nHeather Idoni\n\nHeather Idoni, 60, of Linden, New Jersey, started engaging in pro-life activism in 1989. She and her husband have five sons by birth and 10 adopted children from Ukraine. She suffered a stroke behind bars and was repeatedly denied insulin, but her trust in God remained steadfast.\n\n“Like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, I really don’t have the smell of smoke on me from this,” she said. “I feel like I’m a stronger person. I’m tougher in many ways.” \n\nIdoni was charged with federal conspiracy against rights and FACE Act violations and sentenced to two years and three months in prison. She served time in nine different county jails before being pardoned.\n\nWhen she found out Trump was reelected, she started to hope for an early release, but she and her husband trusted God to protect her either way. \n\n“When he pardoned the J-6ers, that was when my adrenaline hit, and it got really exciting,” she said. “And then I had to come back around with [Trump] the next couple of days and think, ‘OK, it’s possible he’s not going to pardon us.’ And then I got settled again in my spirit,” she said. “And then when it happened, it was so unexpected and fast that all the joy just poured out at that point.”\n\nShe had three indictments for pro-life activism in Washington, D.C.; Mount Juliet, Tennessee; and Sterling Heights, Michigan, so she was moved between jails.\n\nShe said the only time she felt unsafe was traveling between jails, because a tight chain was around her waste, making it difficult to breathe.\n\n“They put chains around your waist, and I had a medication that I was taking because of my heart catheterization that I had in jail, and that medication was causing my lungs not to function properly,” she said. “They put the chains on when you’re standing up, and when you sit down, you expand and the chains get tighter.”\n\nDespite spending limited time in each jail, God provided Idoni with opportunities to spread the Gospel, she said.\n\n“The very first place I went—Alexandria, Virginia—the first girl I met had gotten saved the day before through a Bible study,” she said, “so I could see that God was laying the foundation.”\n\n“It just started me seeing that God’s going to have work prepared for me ahead of time,” she continued. “And I got to tell these girls I had prayed for them for the last year and a half or so for every girl I’d meet. And that really impacted their lives. And I really didn’t have any negative responses, even the ones who were not pro-life.”\n\nMany women Idoni encountered had previously had abortions, and she was able to provide them counseling and healing.\n\n“Some of them didn’t want to disclose that they felt conflicted about it and needed forgiveness and love,” she said, “but the Lord gave me words to minister to their hearts, and they became some of my biggest cheerleaders.”\n\nA self-proclaimed atheist inmate asked Idoni to teach her to study the Bible. She now lives near Idoni in Michigan, so Idoni will be able to keep discipling her. She is working to become a chaplain at Livingston prison near her home so she can continue a prison ministry.\n\nIdoni said she has 10 grandchildren, two of them still in the womb. One of her grandchildren was born while she was in prison.\n\n“I’m very grateful for what [Trump] did,” she said on the pardon. “I wanted to be with my grandchildren.”\n\nIdoni plans to do more “rescues” and to encourage sidewalk counselors at abortion clinics to keep up the good work. She also hopes to regain her passport so she can travel to Ukraine for missions work. \n\nThough she was unable to leave the country, Idoni feels that God provided her with a Gospel-sharing opportunities for the past year-and-a-half in jails across the country.\n\n“It was like a federally funded missions trip,” she said.","summary":"Pro-lifers convicted under the FACE Act and released from prison after President Donald Trump pardoned them on Jan. 24 tell The Daily Signal they are...

I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way,” Starmer said.\n “But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.\n “The end of this war, when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again.”\n Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, UK prime ministers have refused to publicly consider sending British soldiers to the country.\n Starmer had previously suggested that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire.\n The UK’s prime minister, who is due to visit President Trump in Washington later this month, said: “While European nations must step up in this moment – and we will – US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again.”\n Representatives of the US administration and Russian counterparts are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia for talks following Trump’s phone conversation with Putin on Wednesday.\n But Ukrainian officials are not expected to be at the table at this stage and other European leaders might not be involved in the process at all.\n\nStarmer added: “We must be clear that peace cannot come at any cost. Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations because anything less would accept Putin’s position that Ukraine is not a real nation.”\n He also warned of a repeat of the chaos after the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 under former president Joe Biden, which followed a deal struck with the Taliban under Trump.\n “We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government,” Starmer said.\n “I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too.”","summary":"It is understood to be the first time the PM has been explicit about sending British peacekeepers to Ukraine\n\nKeir Starmer has said he is prepared to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine if there is a deal to end the war with Russia, acknowledging it could put troops “in harm’s way” if Vladimir Putin launches another attack.\n\n\n It is understood to be the first time the prime minister has explicitly stated he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.

Former Doctor Who star David Tennant served as host for the evening, cracking wise about US president Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.\n\nOver the past month, much has been made of the fluctuating awards season prospects of Emilia Perez, the Spanish-language musical released by Netflix. Once considered a frontrunner for many of the biggest awards going, the film has been embroiled in a controversy surrounding resurfaced racist tweets shared by its star, Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón. While Emilia Perez did miss out on nine of the 11 Bafta awards it was nominated for, it emerged victorious in both the international film category and Best Supporting Actress, with Zoe Saldaña winning the latter category over co-star Selena Gomez. \n\nAccepting the award, Saldaña gave a tearful speech, describing the film as “a creative challenge of a lifetime”. When her speech overran, and the countdown began to speed her off-stage, the flustered actor exclaimed: “Oh my god I’m getting a countdown. F*** f*** f***!\"\n\nThe film’s director, Jacques Audiard, thanked Gascón in his speech accepting the award for Best Film Not in the English Language, remarking: “I also thank you Karla Sofía, who I kiss.” The French filmmaker had previously distanced himself from Gascón following the controversy, describing the controversial tweets as “hateful”.\n\nBest Actress went to Mikey Madison, whose performance as a sex worker in the comedy-drama Anora beat out heavyweight competition in the form of Demi Moore, for her role in the body horror The Substance, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her role as a grieving and antisocial woman in Mike Leigh’s Hard Truths. In her acceptance speech, Madison paid tribute to sex workers, in a moment that drew an enthusiastic response from the audience.\n\nElsewhere, there was little drama in many of the wins. As expected, Kieran Culkin took home Best Supporting Actor for his role as a troubled American on a tour of Auschwitz in A Real Pain. Just as predictably, Best Director went to bookies’ favourite Corbet for the sensational, sweeping The Brutalist. A win for The Brutalist also followed in the Best Actor category, with star Adrien Brody beating Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) to the win.\n\nThere was, however, no single film sweeping the awards this year, with major prizes being shared among several nominees. The Brutalist added Best Original Score and Best Cinematography to its haul, while Anora won the prize for casting. In the technical categories, glossy musical adaptation Wicked won the award for Production Design, while blockbuster sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two won Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects.\n\nClaymation charmer Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl may have been pipped to Best British Film, but did emerge from the night with some recognition, taking home the prize for Best Children’s & Family Film, as well as Best Animated Film. The documentary award, meanwhile, went to Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story. \n\nThose hoping for irreverent Irish rap biopic Kneecap to seize an unlikely win for Best British Film may have left disappointed, but the celebrated film did earn an award for writer-director Rich Peppiatt, who took home the marque for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer.\n\nWillow actor Warwick Davis was also present at the ceremony, accepting the Bafta Fellowship. In his speech, he paid tribute to his late wife Samantha Davis, who died last March at the age of 53. The ceremony also featured live musical performances from Take That, whose song “Greatest Day” featured prominently in Anora, and Jeff Goldblum, who performed “As Time Goes By” on the piano during the In Memoriam segment.\n\nYou can find a full list of the winners here.","summary":"‘Anora’ and ‘A Real Pain’ also won major prizes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/baftas-2025-winners-conclave-the-brutalist-emilia-perez-b2699210.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/16/20/08/GettyImages-2199366026.jpeg?trim=0,1,0,1&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lbUNf2fs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:12:17","author":"Louis Chilton","authors":["Louis Chilton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.616},{"id":291190932,"title":"Dave Chappelle Claims ‘SNL’ Producers Blocked Him From Addressing Gaza and Transgender Issues in Opening Monologue","text":"Dave Chappelle recently told a stand-up audience in San Francisco that “Saturday Night Live” producers did not want him to talk about Gaza or transgender people in his opening monologue when he hosted the show in January.\n\nChappelle performed last Thursday at the Masonic as part of three San Francisco dates.

Since then, the US State Department has circulated a document reportedly containing six questions to assess European nations’ willingness to commit to a long-term security arrangement for Kiev.\n\n“If third-country military forces were to be deployed to Ukraine as part of a peace arrangement, what would you consider to be the necessary size of such a European-led force?” was one of the questions, according to Reuters.

However, analysts cited recently by the New York Times consider this figure unattainable, noting that deploying even 40,000 troops would be challenging.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly signaled its intent to minimize US involvement once a potential truce is reached, instead seeking to shift the financial and logistical burden of supporting Kiev onto regional allies.\n\n“To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told the Ukraine Defense Contact Group this week. “Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of NATO.”\n\nDETAILS TO FOLLOW","summary":"Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that the UK is ready to play a “leading role” in providing security guarantees to Kiev \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612829-uk-troops-ukraine-starmer/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/static.en/article/breaking.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:03:43","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.091},{"id":291203456,"title":"After Munich Conference, Zelenskyy And Allies Enter Uncharted Waters","text":"The Munich Security Conference is the closest thing the international diplomatic community has to the Super Bowl: Rich in pre- and post-game analysis, relentlessly live-blogged, and ultimately all about the spectacle.\n\nBut the real action this year will happen off the conference's playing field. Ukraine, its European allies, and the Kremlin are all positioning themselves for negotiating with a Trump administration that has made clear the traditional geopolitical rules no longer apply.\n\nIn a post on X, Kristi Raik, director of the International Center for Defence and Security in Tallinn, summed up the gloom expressed by many European observers of the conference.\n\n\"Leaving Munich with an anxious mood,\" she wrote. \"[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy made clear Ukraine does not hope for [the] U.S. to work for a just peace. It's up to Europe. Not sure if Europe is up to the task. [Europe] should stop whining about not being invited to negotiations and focus on what it can deliver.\"\n\nTo sum up the state of play: European leaders are slated to hold an emergency summit this week on the war in Ukraine, the Trump administration is sending a negotiating team to Saudi Arabia to begin negotiations with Russian officials with an eye to ending the war in Ukraine, and Ukraine does not appear to have a place at the table in those talks, as yet.\n\nThose developments all follow a combative appearance in Munich by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who took Washington's European partners to task about what he characterized as Europe's retreat from free speech and \"unvetted\" immigration to the continent.\n\n\"The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia,\" he said. \"It's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.\"\n\nRussia's assault on the remnants of its democratic opposition or its affront to international norms rated no mention from Vance. And the U.S. vice president delivered few specifics on how the Trump administration proposed to bring about what he described as a \"reasonable settlement\" to end hostilities in Ukraine.\n\nIt was an unsettling development for supporters of Ukraine. Vance's broadside against his European audience followed just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced what he described as a \"lengthy and highly productive\" call with Putin on February 12. An invitation for Trump to visit Moscow also seems to stand.\n\nTrump's conversation with Putin set the stage for this year's Munich conference. It raised concerns in Kyiv and European capitals that Trump would take a much more transactional approach to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe exact format of such prospective talks remains clear. In a lunch panel at the Munich conference, Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, appeared to suggest Europe may not be \"at the table\" when the time comes for brokering an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEither way, the conference was a clarifying moment for Ukraine and its backers. In remarks at the conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Europe needed to step up collectively in support of Ukraine as Washington shifts priorities.\n\n\"Ukraine will never accept deals behind our backs without our involvement,\" he said. \"The same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine -- no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"\n\nThat, it seems, is the main question to take away from this year's Munich conference: whether peace will be negotiated over the heads of the Ukrainians. But if the experience of the past three years is any guide, Ukraine has shown it has agency, a willingness to fight, and a powerful international communicator in the person of Zelenskyy.\n\nDepending on the view one takes, this year's conference is a reprise of 1938 -- British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s failed appeasement of Adolf Hitler -- or Russian President Vladimir Putin's blistering 2007 appearance in Munich, when he blasted the appearance of what he called the \"unipolar world\" led by Washington.\n\nBut to paraphrase former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld: You write the headline with the historical analogy you have, not the one you might want or wish to have at a later time. History can only offer inexact parallels, and Ukraine and Europe are entering completely new territory after Munich.","summary":"Trump's conversation with Putin set the stage for this year's Munich conference.

It represented a significant escalation by the White House in a four-day dispute with the AP over access to the presidency.\n\nThe administration has blocked the AP from covering a handful of events at the White House this week, including a news conference with India’s leader and several times in the Oval Office. It’s all because the news outlet has not followed Trump’s lead in renaming the body of water, which lies partially outside U.S. territory, to the “Gulf of America.”\n\nAP reporters and photographers travel with the president virtually everywhere as part of a press “pool” and have for decades. AP journalism serves millions of readers and thousands of news outlets around the world.\n\nJournalists consider the administration’s move a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment – a governmental attempt to dictate what a news company publishes under threat of retribution. The Trump administration says the AP has no special right of access to events where space is limited, particularly given the news service’s “commitment to misinformation.”\n\nAP calls that assertion entirely untrue.\n\n“Freedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people. The White House has said it supports these principles,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Friday night. “The actions taken to restrict AP’s coverage of presidential events because of how we refer to a geographic location chip away at this important right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for all Americans.”\n\nThe body of water in question has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. AP, whose influential stylebook is used by news outlets as an arbiter of language and usage, advised that because of its broad set of global customers, it would both refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico and also reference Trump’s order changing the name to the Gulf of America within the United States.\n\nAt the same time, the AP switched style last month from Denali to Mount McKinley for the mountain in Alaska that Trump ordered renamed. That location lies entirely within U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nTaylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff, said in a post to X Friday – one that was later released as a White House statement – that the AP “continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes The Associated Press’ commitment to misinformation.”\n\nWhile the First Amendment protects the AP’s “right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting,” it doesn’t ensure unfettered access to limited spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, Budowich said. He said AP would retain its credentials to the White House complex overall.\n\nOn Friday, an AP reporter and photographer had traveled to Joint Base Andrews for their participation in the traveling press pool to Trump’s Florida residence. But, after clearing security, neither was allowed to board Air Force One, a decision they were told was “outlet-specific.” Meanwhile, reporters in the press pool who were permitted on the plane sent the AP journalists pictures of cards with their names saying “welcome aboard” on their empty seats.\n\nOther news organizations, like The New York Times and Washington Post, have also said they would primarily use Gulf of Mexico. Fox News said that it was switching to Gulf of America.\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association has issued statements condemning the action against AP. Although there are talks going on behind the scenes, individual news outlets have been relatively quiet.\n\nThe Times, through spokesman Charles Stadtlander, said on Friday that “we stand by The Associated Press in condemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with. Any move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.”\n\nIn a statement, the Washington Post said that the AP’s “access to the administration is central for all journalistic organizations, including The Washington Post, in serving millions of Americans with fact-based, independent journalism each day.”\n\nThe issue was gaining some international attention.\n\n“We would never kick a news agency out of the press room of our Chancellery,” said Friedrich Merz, the top opposition leader in Germany and front-runner in polls ahead of the country’s Feb. 23 elections. He spoke Saturday at a security conference in Munich also attended by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and top Trump administration officials.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who on Wednesday used the word “lies” in describing AP content, posted on X Friday afternoon about executive orders Trump had signed before his departure.

He said he would later travel to Saudi Arabia, but Ukrainian officials said he had no plans to meet with U.S. or Russian officials there.\n\nJust days earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was no longer “primarily focused” on Europe’s security, in another blow to the continent.\n\nThe moves by Washington have triggered alarm and left European leaders on the continent scrambling over how to respond to what they see as Washington’s unilateral approach to ending the Ukraine war.But it is unclear if the continent can overcome its deep divisions and come up with its own concrete strategy to end the Ukraine war and deal with Russia.“Europe has spent more time discussing, making statements, and making calls than actually putting its money where its mouth is and stepping up to give concrete support to Ukraine or to pursue any other policy of its own choosing,” said Ian Garner, a Russian expert at the Warsaw-based Pilecki Institute.European officials have warned that a hurriedly agreed peace or cease-fire deal will undermine Ukraine and wider European security.\n\nEurope is the largest financial supporter of Ukraine, even overtaking the United States. But it lags in military support, despite pledges to boost defense spending and arms production in recent years.With the exceptions of Hungary and Slovakia, there is broad support for Ukraine in Europe. But there is also disagreement.“Everybody is technically on the same page,” said Garner. “The problem is when you actually look at finer details of the plans, everybody disagrees.”The creation of a European army is a prime example. Some European leaders have called for deploying European military forces to Ukraine to ensure security if a peace deal is agreed. But the idea has been rebuffed by other officials, including EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.“All these European leaders are still trapped in potential maybes,” added Garner. “Nobody has come up with a cohesive, comprehensive, and collaborative plan to say, ‘here’s what we would actually be willing to definitely do.’ And so, of course, Trump, Putin, and even Zelenskyy don’t take Europe seriously.”\n\nRFE/RL’s Ray Furlong contributed to this report","summary":"Europe has been excluded from negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.

Hong Kong is readying stablecoin regulations that will be overseen by the city’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n“Stablecoins has been one of those places where it was a very great product-market fit when it came out,” Lau said. “Because people realised that … it was a really, really great tool for the ability to do remittances, to do payments in a way that makes it more efficient as well as … retain more value to the user.”\nCoinDesk’s new event comes two months after the newsroom was rocked by controversy over the firing of editors, including its editor-in-chief, allegedly for a story about Tron founder Justin Sun. In the article, reporter Callan Quinn struck a tongue-in-cheek tone about Sun’s public eating of a banana that was part of the conceptual artwork Comedian, which the crypto entrepreneur bought for US$6.2 million.\nFortune reported in December that Bullish dismissed the editors, raising questions of editorial independence and conflicts of interest. Quinn said she resigned after learning of the firings and blamed Tron for undue influence. Tron is a top sponsor of Consensus Hong Kong.\n“We have great respect for journalists and the important work media outlets do,” Tron said when asked for comment. “Internal matters at CoinDesk are their business, and we cannot speculate or comment on their behalf.”\nBullish did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nLong before the controversy, however, InvestHK – a government group tasked with bringing business to the city – had been in conversation with CoinDesk during their search for a new Consensus event outside North America, according to Leung.\n“We have a lot of Web3, crypto natives in Hong Kong who have been attending Consensus for years, so we already have a very strong fan base,” Leung said.\nAmid its push to become a global virtual asset hub, Hong Kong has been dealing with seismic shifts in the crypto industry. The re-election of the now crypto-friendly Donald Trump to the US presidency sent the price of bitcoin to a record high.\nLau noted that Consensus Hong Kong is the first major industry event since Trump’s inauguration on January 20. While he did not give specific numbers for registered attendees, he said more than 100 countries are represented and the large influx of people reflects how moves in the US have increased interest in this space.\n“The fact that you have a widening base of different governments showing public support and more regulators providing clarity, all of those things are quite positive,” Lau said. “[Sentiment] has certainly shifted because all of a sudden it’s accelerating – the excitement around this, the adoption around this.”\nCrypto adoption has long been higher in Asia than in other parts of the world, which some have attributed to factors including a large underbanked population. Citing data from a CoinDesk survey last year, Lau said crypto adoption in Asia is at 22 per cent, nearly three times the global average of 7.8 per cent.\nHong Kong, once home to leading crypto companies such as Crypto.com and FTX, lost its edge when it signalled regulatory tightening in 2020. While it has been trying to reverse course through greater regulatory clarity since 2022, there is greater competition now from other regional players, especially Singapore.\nHowever, Lau and Leung say that Hong Kong has no competition when it comes to liquidity and capital markets, pointing to the much larger market for initial public offerings.\n“Anything related to innovation, related to capital markets, then Hong Kong has to be the natural choice,” Leung said.\nLau himself has a strong connection to Hong Kong. He has been based in the city for 16 years, even as New York-based Bullish established its regional headquarters in Singapore. But while Lau said he is happy to see Consensus come to his home city, he insisted the real reason behind the location choice was all business.\n“There are very few places in the world where you could do something like this,” he said. “Where you have the vision of what we want to bring, the environment that supports it, as well as the infrastructure to be able to execute it.”","summary":"Hong Kong is leaning into its role in traditional finance as it courts Web3 enthusiasts to the city for CoinDesk’s Consensus Hong Kong.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3298876/consensus-building-crypto-conference-arrives-hong-kong-test-city-and-coindesk","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/16/001c5d02-c728-41d9-8fee-7c7ace986443_9f0e68f6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 23:00:12","author":"Matt Haldane","authors":["Matt Haldane"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.18}]}
