Rubio warned that the administration was looking out for “these lunatics.” Around the country, scholars have been picked up, in some cases by masked immigration agents, and held in detention centers, sometimes a thousand miles away from their homes with little warning and often with few details about why they were being detained. “It might be more than 300 at this point. We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” Rubio said at a news conference in Guyana, where he was meeting with leaders there. Many of those rounded up by Trump officials attended or were part of the pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept college campuses last year, and while the administration hasn’t said publicly why these students are being singled out over others, at least one sought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appeared on lists made by far-right pro-Israel groups as targets for deportation. And Trump allies, many in government again, telegraphed for months before he took office they’d seek to deport students who openly advocated for Hamas or other U.S.-designated terrorist groups or after they participated in an unauthorized campus protest and were suspended, expelled or jailed. The detentions are a signal of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to clamp down on the actions of legal permanent residents, student visa holders and others who live and work legally in the United States, one that threatens to undermine a fundamental American right to free speech and to assemble, experts and advocates said. “There’s something uniquely disturbing about sending a message to the best and the brightest around the world, who traditionally have flocked to U.S. universities because of their openness, because of their freedom, because of their intellectual vigor, and now say, ‘We don’t want you here,’” said Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, has repeatedly said the administration’s deportation policy is “worst first,” meaning it is prioritizing removing people with criminal records or people suspected of being national security threats. According to the Department of Homeland Security data, there are at least 400,000 noncitizens convicted of crimes in the United States. The administration has sent more than 200 Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, alleging that the migrants have gang ties, claims that families and attorneys of some of those deported have strongly denied. Targeting students is shift from their stated goal of going after criminals, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told NBC News. Bush-Joseph said that for noncitizens, “the government has so much discretion when it comes to granting or taking away immigration benefits, and that can be done based on a number of reasons.” The State Department has used as justification for some student deportation proceedings an immigration provision that dates to the Cold War and gives Rubio the authority to deport noncitizens if their activities pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” And U.S. officials can revoke a student visa if they deem the student a threat. Some scholars have already been deported. And arrests continue. Just this week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested two students near their homes. One was Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student from Iran studying at the University of Alabama. ICE didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Doroudi’s immigration status or why he was arrested. The University said a doctoral student had been detained but gave no other details. Another was Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was in the United States with a valid student visa and pulled off the street. Ozturk co-authored an opinion essay in the Tufts student newspaper last year criticizing the university for how it responded to student demands, calling for the school to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” The essay, which was authored by four students and endorsed by 32 others, does not mention Hamas. In response to questions about Ozturk’s arrest, Rubio questioned why “any country in the world” would allow people to come into their countries and disrupt college campuses. “We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to be a social activist that comes in and tears up our university campuses,” he said. “If you invite me into your home because I say, ‘Oh, I want to go to your house for dinner,’ and I come into your house and I start putting mud on your couch and spray-painting your kitchen, I bet you you’re going to kick me out,” Rubio said. Ozturk is being held at a Louisiana detention facility. It’s not clear where Doroudi has been sent, and little is known about his case. The National Iranian American Council demanded information on Doroudi’s whereabouts and whether he’d been charged with a crime and called for those “unjustly detained” to be released. “Doroudi’s arrest comes on the heels of the baseless arrest of students and a green card holder as apparent retaliation against their speech and activism against war,” the group said. Meanwhile, one far-right group has compiled names and other identifying information of students and professionals — both noncitizens and U.S. citizens — who are alleged to be “promoting hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews on college campuses,” saying its goal is to combat antisemitism on campuses. Another group says it handed the Trump administration a list of hundreds of names for deportation; at least one of the students listed on both sites, Momodou Taal, has been targeted by the Trump administration for deportation and asked to surrender to ICE. Taal, a Ph.D. student who is a U.S. visa holder, participated in protests at Cornell University expressing support for Palestinians in Gaza. Among the other students targeted by the Trump administration: — Yunseo Chung, 21, a Columbia University student who took part in the protests. She is a legal permanent resident and doesn’t need a student visa; she moved to the United States as a child from South Korea. She is fighting deportation in court, and last week, a federal judge ruled that she can’t be detained as the legal case continues. — Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian student who participated in the protests at Columbia last spring. Immigration officials say she had overstayed her student visa and was arrested by ICE. — Badar Khan Suri, a graduate student from India who was teaching at Georgetown University on a student visa when he was arrested this month. Suri filed a court petition in Alexandria, Virginia, in hope of being released from detention. He is being held at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, according to the ICE detainee locator. Homeland Security officials said on X he was “actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.” — Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and Columbia University graduate student who was detained over his pro-Palestinian activism on campus, immigration officials said. He’s being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Facility in Jena. A federal judge in New York recently ruled that a challenge to his arrest and detention should be heard in New Jersey. The judge issued an order blocking the government from deporting Khalil as his case proceeds. He also faces a separate deportation case in immigration court in Louisiana, with his next hearing set for early April. Samah Sisay, one of Khalil’s lawyers, said lawyers and advocates are concerned that more students will be targeted and that many may also face criminal charges for their activism if government officials cite potential terrorism concerns. “None of them have criminal records,” Sisay said. “This is an attack on speech, and I think any sort of criminal allegations that may be brought in the future would still be attached to this desire to chill free speech and to really say that certain speech is not welcomed under this administration and can lead to you being criminalized, detained, and deported.” And it’s increasingly unclear whether colleges will support students in the face of growing efforts to deport students who speak out. Just last week, Columbia University bowed to Trump’s demands after he threatened to cancel $400 million in federal research grants for “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The university agreed to sweeping changes. Ranjani Srinavasan, a Columbia University doctoral student from India, isn’t detained by ICE, because she left for Canada, instead. She told NBC News she got a message on March 5 from the U.S. consulate in Chennai, India, that her student visa had been revoked. She said she had participated in some protests. On the night of a large demonstration where students occupied Hamilton Hall, she had been trying to get to her dorm and was among the dozens swept up by police, but the charges were late dropped, her lawyer said. Two days later, ICE agents turned up at her apartment, but another person in the apartment with her didn’t let them in because they didn’t have a warrant, Srinavasan said. The agents returned the next day, and again were not let inside. Then, Srinavasan got a message from the international student office saying that her visa had been revoked and that she had to leave the United States and the school. Until then, she had been grading papers as a teaching assistant and finishing out the last six months in her five-year Ph.D. program. “If I had opened the door,” Srinivasan said. “I would be in a detention center now.”","summary":"The Trump administration has been targeting foreign-born graduate and doctoral students whose main transgression seems to be activism.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration-takes-aim-immigrant-students-rcna198346","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250327-Rumeysa-Ozturk-arrest-mn-0900-2e9d15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:58:28","author":"Abigail Williams,Chloe Atkins,Daniella Silva,Julia Ainsley","authors":["Abigail Williams","Chloe Atkins","Daniella Silva","Julia Ainsley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":304959186,"title":"Elon Musk's DOGE tries to put new faces on its reclusive federal office","text":"The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency has had one public face since late January: tech billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk, who posts nearly constantly about DOGE on social media and has given several media interviews about its budget-slashing effort. Musk said as recently as last month that it was a “crime” to publicly name other people who worked at DOGE, and his strict secrecy helped to keep DOGE employees out of the spotlight, even as they went about radically remaking the federal government and trying to dismantle entire agencies. But in a switch, Musk introduced a few other faces Thursday in a group interview on Fox News that featured some of his chief lieutenants. They included DOGE staffers who have worked quietly behind the scenes to upend key components of the U.S. government such as the Treasury Department and the Social Security Administration. Follow live politics coverage here Seven DOGE employees participated in the interview on “Special Report” hosted by Bret Baier, and it was by far their most extensive public comments since President Donald Trump began his second term Jan. 20. The seven DOGE staffers struck a more technocratic tone than Musk often does in his rhetoric about the federal government. None referenced a chainsaw or a wood chipper — two of Musk’s go-to analogies — choosing instead to talk about the duplication they see in government software systems. “We really believe that the government can have an Apple Store-like experience: beautifully designed, great user experience, modern systems,” said Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb who is focused on overhauling the retirement system for federal workers. Gebbia has a net worth of $8 billion, making him one of the 400 wealthiest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is ranked first, with $337 billion. DOGE staffers have generally kept a low profile, with news organizations relying sometimes on anonymous sources to compile lists of DOGE employees in defiance of threats by Musk. But some of the staffers interviewed Thursday, including Tom Krause, had previously popped up in lawsuits challenging DOGE’s authority. In February, after a lawsuit by labor unions, the Trump administration agreed that Krause’s access to Treasury Department payment systems would be “read only,” without the authority to make changes. Krause told Fox News’ Baier that he wants to be able to audit all the payments the government makes. “What we’re doing is applying private company standards to the federal government,” he said. The interview did not include some of the most-talked-about DOGE staffers, such as one 19-year-old who has gone by the nickname “Big Balls.” All seven of the interviewed staffers are men, and they did not include Amy Gleason, the person whom the White House has said is the acting administrator of DOGE. Her name did not come up in the hour-long Fox News program, and Trump has repeatedly said that Musk is the head of DOGE. All seven are also new to government work, with some of them including Steve Davis joining from Musk’s private companies. Davis has worked at Musk’s SpaceX and The Boring Co. and he has been an investor in Musk’s social media app, X. Davis said the stakes for DOGE were high, arguing that the country was at risk of “going bankrupt.” Another DOGE staffer, Anthony Armstrong, formerly a Morgan Stanley investment banker who worked on Musk’s deal to buy X, said in the interview that he did not believe the changes brought on by DOGE had been as radical as critics argue. He said that reductions-in-force, or firings, amounted to less than 0.15% of the federal workforce, and he said there was still money “sloshing out the door.” The other DOGE staffers interviewed were Aram Moghaddassi, who specializes in the Social Security system, Brad Smith, who works with the Department of Health and Human Services, and Tyler Hassen, who’s assigned to the Interior Department. Musk frequently chimed in as Baier questioned the seven DOGE staffers, generally to emphasize their points or rephrase their answers. Backing up Armstrong, Musk argued that, “Basically, almost no one’s gotten fired.” Asked by Baier about rulings by several federal judges that DOGE had exceeded its legal authority, Musk went on the offensive and argued, without naming specifics, that the federal judges are corrupt. Musk said he remained committed to DOGE’s goal of cutting the federal budget deficit by $1 trillion, though he reframed the goal in percentage terms, saying it would be a 15% reduction in spending. Musk also appeared to endorse sparing Social Security from cuts, saying that people who are “legitimate” beneficiaries would see their benefits go up, not down, although he did not define the term. “We feel confident that a 15% reduction can be done without affecting any of the critical government services,” Musk said. But budget experts say that even if DOGE succeeds at slashing spending, Trump’s policies including major tax cuts would still substantially add to the deficit if they came to fruition.","summary":"Seven members of the Department of Government Efficiency broke their media blockade and sat for a group interview with Fox News.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/elon-musks-doge-tries-put-new-faces-reclusive-federal-office-rcna198491","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250321-Musk-aa-116-f67066.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:57:55","author":"David Ingram","authors":["David Ingram"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":304960404,"title":"The simple reason judges keep rejecting Trump's Alien Enemies Act argument","text":"Blurring the distinction between substance and process is a tactic of disinformation. The Trump administration is using the technique in its efforts to deport immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, but the courts are seeing through it. On Wednesday, an appeals court upheld an order to block President Donald Trump’s administration from using the 1798 statute to deport people it says are members of a violent Venezuelan gang known as Tren De Aragua. The substance of Trump’s policy has broad appeal. The administration knows that most Americans support the removal of transnational criminal members of a gang it recently designated a foreign terrorist organization. And Trump frequently invokes his strong “mandate” to engage in aggressive immigration enforcement, which was a major theme of his campaign. When district court Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations on March 15, Attorney General Pam Bondi blasted the judge for “supporting the Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans.” In fact, Judge Boasberg is not “supporting” either party. He is supporting the law. The legal problem isn’t with what the administration is doing; it is how the administration is doing it. In a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also ruled against the administration, rejecting an emergency motion to overturn District Court Boasberg’s decision to stop the program temporarily. Two judges, one appointed by a Republican president and one by a Democrat, wrote concurring opinions noting problems with the application of the statute and the apparent denial of due process. In her concurring opinion, Judge Karen L. Henderson explained that the Alien Enemies Act applies only in wartime. At the moment, of course, the United States is not at war. As Judge Henderson wrote, the Alien Enemies Act was enacted during a time when “our fledging nation was consumed with fear” of a war with France and “internal strife from her sympathizers.” As a result, Congress passed a package of bills known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Alien Enemies Act would permit the president to expel “enemies” during times of war. The problem with using that statute now, of course, is that none of those conditions are currently being met. A counterpart to the statute known as the Alien Friends Act was passed for use in times of peace. That statute permitted the removal of any immigrant the president deemed “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” Why, you might ask, did the Trump administration not simply use the Alien Friends Act to deport this group? That’s because, as the court noted, the statute was immediately seen as unconstitutional and allowed to lapse in 1800. But that’s where the how becomes a problem. As Judge Henderson explained, the language of the Alien Enemies Act requires a “declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government” or “an invasion or predatory incursion ... against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation of government.” Happily, we are not at war, which, under the Constitution, may be declared only by Congress. Nor have we experienced any “invasion” or “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation or government. Despite the government’s argument that unwanted migrants who cross the border unlawfully have “invaded” our country, the court said that those terms as used in the statute instead must be considered in their “military sense.” Indeed, the court noted that James Madison had called the statute “an exercise of the power of war.” The court concluded that the words “invasion” and “predatory incursion” in the statute must be read to mean a “hostile encroachment by a nation state.” Because these conditions do not exist, the plaintiffs in this case have shown a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their lawsuit against the administration. In another concurring opinion, Judge Patricia Millet explained her concerns with how the administration is deporting the plaintiffs, noting the apparent denial of due process. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees due process to anyone within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States before they can be denied life, liberty or property. Courts have long held that due process rights apply to immigrants, legal or not, in deportation proceedings. The basic requirements of due process are fair notice, an opportunity to be heard and an impartial decision-maker. The individuals in this case received none of these procedural safeguards to determine whether they are, in fact, noncitizens who are members of Tren de Aragua. The judge noted that some of the men were designated as gang members based on tattoos matching those found in a Google search. The case now goes back to Judge Boasberg’s courtroom for further proceedings, including the court’s order that the government show that it did not violate his initial order to halt the departure of planes and their return, as well as its refusal to answer his questions about those issues. The Trump administration no doubt handpicked members of a transnational criminal gang to test the waters for aggressive immigration enforcement, gambling that most members of the public would be happy to see them go. But by focusing only on the substantive goal of ridding our country of individuals it deems dangerous criminals, the administration steamrolls over the lawful process that protects any of us from getting ensnared in a net by mistake or abuse. Under the law, sound process is required to yield effective substance.","summary":"Trump is deporting Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act but judges like Judge James Boasberg and the D.C.

Musk convened with key members of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team to review the work DOGE has undertaken during the initial months of Trump's administration , informing Fox News' Bret Baier that he anticipates the work will be completed in approximately 130 days. He envisages that he \"will have accomplished most of the work\" within the 130-day timeframe he is allotted. Anthony Armstrong, a DOGE employee, stated that President Trump's directive to DOGE was to utilise a \"scalpel not hatchet\" approach when executing their cuts . Armstrong said: \"President Trumps has been very clear, scalpel not hatchet and thats the way its been getting done. \"Once those decisions are made there's a very heavy focus on being generous, being caring, being compassionate and treating everyone with dignity and respect.\" The Tesla billionaire has featured several times on the network since becoming involved in the Trump administration and this appearance coincides with his electric car company Tesla facing a series of assaults against its dealerships and charging stations over the past few weeks. This follows the world's wealthiest man asserting his influential position within Donald Trump's administration on Monday when he occupied a seat at the cabinet meeting, despite not holding an official role. Musk received glowing commendations, including from the president himself. \"Elon, I want to thank you,\" Trump said, showing some love for the tech mogul amidst a storm of international protests targeting Tesla. \"I know you've been a lot with this horrible situation that happened. Very unfair. What he is is a patriot... He's become a friend of mine.\" This came hot on the heels of several attacks and demonstrations at Tesla dealerships worldwide.

Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Obama. \n\nIn the end, Allen and Parnes suggested whether Harris won or lost in her race against Trump 'she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him' as Biden staffers remained with her campaign.\n\nAt one point, the authors claim, Sean Clegg - a Harris advisor who was not trusted by the Biden staffers - was helping the vice president prepare for a joint appearance with her running mate Tim Walz, when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished.\n\nClegg quickly stopped her, according to the book. \n\n'Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,' Clegg said, according to an excerpt previously published by The Hill.\n\nFor the remark, Clegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides have also claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out.\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe for her loss because he refused to drop out of the race sooner.\n\nHe had claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called 'the cardinal sin' of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as 'catastrophic.'\n\n'When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,' he told The Atlantic. \n\nIn the end, Harris and Walz lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout.\n\nIt marked the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Democrats had been secretly planning for former President Joe Biden to either drop out of the presidential race or even 'die in office' as far back as 2023, a damning new book claims.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14545359/Democrats-secretly-planning-Biden-withdraw-die-office.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/00/96655227-0-image-m-21_1743122087627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:44:06","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":304958900,"title":"Morning digest: SC to hear plea seeking FIR against Justice Varma over unaccounted cash; Opposition slams Centre’s ‘inaction’ on U.S. tariffs, and more","text":"Plea for police probe into Delhi HC judge residence fire to be heard on March 28\n\nA petition seeking a direction to the police to register a First Information Report and investigate allegations of “huge sums of unaccounted money” found on the official residential premises of sitting Delhi High Court judge Justice Yashwant Varma is listed in the Supreme Court on March 28, 2025.

The plan means DOGE would need to cut over half of the $1.8 trillion put toward non-defense discretionary programs last year, according to Bloomberg. The billionaire also said DOGE is “confident” it can secure a 15% reduction in funding without impacting critical government services.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe Social Security Administration has undergone some major changes since the start of Trump’s second term and Musk’s rise to governmental power overseeing DOGE. The agency announced last month it would lay off 7,000 of its roughly 57,000 employees and recently required employees to return to in-office work. Musk’s DOGE has targeted a swath of government agencies in its attempt to cut government spending and reduce the federal workforce. DOGE has received backlash for errors linked to its savings tracker and firings at agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and many more. Judges have ordered the Trump administration to rehire or place on administrative leave previously fired employees at over a dozen federal agencies.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSocial Security Administration Backtracks On Controversial Plan Cutting Phone Services (Forbes)\n\nHere’s What We Know About Trump And Musk’s Social Security Plans—As Agency Reportedly Mulls Cutting Phone Services (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The elections will be dominated by the soaring cost of living, the economy, energy and China.

Affordable housing is in short supply, interest rates remain high and the major parties are starkly divided on how to wean the nation off fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Here's what you need to know about the main issues: Surging inflation Australians have endured one of the sharpest rises in the cost of living in recent history and the current government has been at the helm through the worst of it. Egg prices surged 11 per cent last year and beer rose 4 per cent, according to government figures. Australian rents rose 4.8 per cent last year after a 8.1 per cent spike in 2023, property analyst CoreLogic said. The central bank's benchmark cash rate rose from a record low 0.1 per cent to 0.35 per cent two weeks before Albanese's center-left Labour Party came to power at elections in May 2022. The rate rose a dozen times since then, peaking at 4.35 per cent in November 2023. Inflation peaked that year at 7.8 per cent. The central bank reduced the cash rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1 per cent in an indication that the worst the cost of living crisis had passed. Scarce and expensive housing Inflation has put some builders out of business, exacerbating a shortage of housing which in turn has inflated rents. The government has provided tax cuts and assistance for some rent and energy bills, but critics argue government spending has contributed to maintaining elevated inflation. Albanese promised in 2023 to build 1.2 million homes through incentives over five years starting mid last year, an ambitious target in a country of 27 million people. Early building approval figures suggest his government will miss that target. The opposition has promised to reduce competition for housing by reducing immigration. It's also promised to allow Australians to spend money held in their compulsory workplace pension funds, known as superannuation, on down payments to buy a home. Different paths to net zero Both parties agree on the goal: to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The opposition has promised to build seven government-funded nuclear power plants across Australia, the first providing electricity in 2035. The government argues Australia's existing coal and gas-fired generators won't last long enough to meet the nation's needs until nuclear power arrives. It plans to have 82 per cent of Australia's energy grid powered by renewables by 2030. The opposition argues the government's policy of replacing coal and gas with renewable energy sources including wind turbines and solar cells is unachievable, and would reduce investment in clean energy technologies. The government was elected in 2022 with a promise to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade and achieve net zero by 2050. The opposition won't set a new target for 2030 before the election but retains a commitment to net-zero by 2050 with nuclear power. Ties with China Trade and diplomatic relations between Australia and China plumbed new depths in 2020 after the previous conservative Australian government demanded an international inquiry into the origins of and responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Beijing barred minister-to-minister contacts with Australia and imposed a series of official and unofficial bans on commodities including coal, wine, barley, wood and lobsters that cost Australian exporters up to 20 billion Australian dollars (USD 13 billion) a year. The thaw started almost immediately with the election of the centre-left Labour Party in 2022. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang wrote to congratulate Prime Minister Albanese on his election victory within days. All the trade barriers were gradually lifted and Albanese met President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing in 2023. Albanese often says about China: “We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.” Opposition leader Peter Dutton, a longtime critic of China, has said bilateral relations would improve even further with a tough and uncompromising approach. He has accused Albanese of self-censorship to avoid offending Beijing. “Australia must be willing to criticize any nation whose behavior imperils stability in the region, and that's what a coalition government I lead will do confidently and in concert with like-minded countries,” Dutton told the Lowy Institute international policy think-tank in Sydney this month.

These plans have long-standing historical roots,’ Putin told an Arctic forum in the northern city of Murmansk.\n\n‘This may surprise some, only at first glance,’ said the Kremlin dictator, who seeks the Trump’s backing for his own claims on Ukrainian territory. ‘It is a profound mistake to believe that these are some kind of extravagant talks of the new American administration. Nothing of the sort.’\n\nPutin said Russia is worried that ‘NATO countries in general are increasingly designating the Far North as a springboard for possible conflicts’, with Russia monitoring the situation and preparing an appropriate response.\n\n‘It is obvious that the role and importance of the Arctic both for Russia and for the whole world is growing. But unfortunately, geopolitical competition, the struggle for positions in this region, is also intensifying,’ he added.\n\nPutin appeared to give his blessing to Trump to make a land grab for Greenland – and even hinted the US President might grab Iceland, too.\n\nHe said: ‘In fact, the United States had such plans back in the 1860s. Even then, the American administration was considering the possibility of annexing Greenland and Iceland. But this idea did not receive support from Congress at the time.’\n\nThis comes as JD Vance is set to visit Greenland with his wife Usha on Friday – making him the most senior US official to visit the territory amid a growing war of words following threats from Donald Trump to take the island over.\n\nAhead of the visit, the Vice President suggested that the self-governing Danish territory has not received enough defence support from Copenhagen, arguing that global security is at stake.\n\n‘Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it’s important to protecting the security of the entire world,’ he said in an online video.\n\nIn an apparent jibe after a comment he made about Europe ‘free-loading’ off the US for its defence was revealed on Monday, Vance added: ‘Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long.\n\n‘That’s been bad for Greenland, it’s also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I’m gonna go check it out.’\n\nPresident Trump has irked much of Europe with claims that the US will get control of the mineral-rich territory ‘one way or another’, with tensions ratcheting up as leaders from Greenland and Denmark condemned the US approach as ‘aggressive’.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of widespread backlash against Washington, Denmark has taken changes to the US delegation’s itinerary as a diplomatic victory.\n\nThe VP’s decision to visit a US military base Pituffik in northern Greenland, rather than doing a tour of the country, has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invite\n\nThe Vances will visit the base instead of Usha Vance’s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race.\n\n‘I have to speak diplomatically here, but in many ways it’s a masterful spin to make it look like they’re escalating when really they’re de-escalating,’ Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR earlier on Wednesday.\n\nBut Løkke also said it was ‘positive’ that the ‘Americans have canceled their visit among Greenlandic society. ‘They will only visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that.’\n\nPresident Trump has irked much of Europe with claims that the US will get control of the mineral-rich territory ‘one way or another’, with tensions ratcheting up as leaders from Greenland and Denmark condemned the US approach as ‘aggressive’.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister this month declared ‘enough is enough’ in response to Trump’s threat to dispatch soldiers to annex the island. \n\n‘We have a couple of bases on Greenland already and we have quite a few soldiers. May be you will see more and more soldiers go there,’ Trump threatened on March 13. ‘We have bases and we have quite a few soldiers on Greenland.’ \n\nMute Egede summoned fellow political leaders to discuss a plan to beef up their rejection of Trump’s plan. \n\n‘The US president has once again aired the thought of annexing us,’ Egede said in a statement. He added: ‘Enough is enough.’\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, who will be the next prime minister after his Demokraatit party won Greenland’s parliamentary election, also turned on Trump. \n\n‘Trump’s statement from the US is inappropriate and just shows once again that we must stand together in such situations,’ he said.\n\n‘It’s obvious that the United States will continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic,’ Putin said as he said Russia would expand its operations in Greenland.\n\nPutin vowed to boost his military presence in the region. He also wanted to see an expansion of tourism in the Arctic, where he has plans to exploit vast mineral wealth.\n\nPutin, who is keen to ramp up commerce via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through Arctic waters as Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe because of Western sanctions, said Russia had never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but was prepared to defend its interests.\n\nForeign partners prepared to cooperate with Russia in the region would be guaranteed a good investment return, he said in a major speech in the northern city of Murmansk.\n\nPutin called for an expansion of Russia’s northern ports and the building of a merchant fleet in the Arctic, supported by new-generation icebreakers including nuclear-powered ones.\n\nBut he said Russia’s domestic capabilities were insufficient for this at the moment, and that it would also require buying vessels and interacting with foreign shipbuilders.\n\nThe Arctic holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the seabed that could become more accessible with global warming. \n\nIt is also an area of military competition, where defence analysts say Russia has built up its presence much faster than the West by reopening Soviet-era bases and modernising its navy.\n\nGreenland, which is seeking independence from Denmark, is strategically located between North America and Europe at a time of rising US, Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, where sea lanes have opened up because of climate change.\n\nDenmark has rebuffed Trump’s calls to take over the island and says the people of Greenland have shown they do not want to be part of the United States.\n\nBy acquiring Greenland, Trump said he would ensure continued US access to Pituffik Space Base – despite there being no current threat to stop access.\n\n‘We need Greenland for national security purposes,’ Trump repeatedly said after declaring he would not rule out the use of military force or economic pressure in the form of brutal tariffs on Denmark to seize control of the island.\n\nGlobal warming is causing the ice in Greenland to retreat, opening up shipping lanes and access to incredible riches, making the region a new geopolitical and economic asset, with the US, Russia, China and others wanting in. \n\nGreenland boasts valuable rare earth minerals needed for telecommunications, as well as uranium, billions of untapped barrels of oil and a vast supply of natural gas that used to be inaccessible but is becoming less so as the ice is retreating. \n\nMany of the same minerals are currently being supplied mostly by China, so other countries such as the United States are interested, Ohio University security and environment professor Geoff Dabelko said. \n\nThree years ago, the Denmark government suspended oil development offshore from the territory of 57,000 people.\n\nThe world’s largest island is now ‘central to the geopolitical, geoeconomic competition in many ways,’ partly because of climate change, Dabelko said.\n\nOff Greenland’s shores, the US Geological Survey estimates there could be 17.5 billion undiscovered barrels of oil and 148 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, though the remote location and harsh weather have limited exploration. \n\nAround the Arctic Circle, there’s potential for 90 billion barrels of oil.\n\nAside from oil, gas or mineral, there is a ‘ridiculous’ amount of ice in Greenland that plays a key role in regulating global weather, according to climate scientist Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine.\n\nIf that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns in such a dramatic manner that the threat was the basis of a Hollywood disaster movie.\n\nGreenland holds enough ice that if it all melts, the world’s seas would rise by 24 feet (7.4 meters). Nearly a foot of that is so-called zombie ice, already doomed to melt no matter what happens, a 2022 study found.\n\nSince 1992, Greenland has lost about 182 billion tons (169 billion metric tons) of ice each year, with losses hitting 489 billion tons a year (444 billion metric tons) in 2019.\n\n‘Think of Greenland as an open refrigerator door or thermostat for a warming world, and it’s in a region that is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe,’ said New York University climate scientist David Holland. \n\nGreenland will be ‘a key focus point’ through the 21st century because of the effect its melting ice sheet will have on sea levels, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nSerreze added: ‘It will likely become a bigger contributor in the future.’ That impact is ‘perhaps unstoppable,’ Holland said.\n\nGreenland is part of the Danish realm along with the Faeroe Islands, another semi-autonomous territory, and has its own government and parliament. \n\nGreenland’s 57,000 residents got extensive home rule in 1979 but Denmark still handles foreign and defense policies, with an annual subsidy of $670 million. \n\nIts indigenous people are not wealthy, and vehicles, restaurants, stores and basic services are few.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen addressed Trump’s intent to buy Greenland in January, saying that she did not believe that the US will use military or economic power to secure control over the island.\n\nShe also called the US Denmark’s ‘most important and closest ally’ and repeated that she welcomed the US taking a greater interest in the Arctic region, but that it would ‘have to be done in a way that is respectful of the Greenlandic people’.\n\n‘At the same time, it must be done in a way that allows Denmark and the United States to still cooperate in, among other things, NATO,’ Frederiksen said.\n\nBut this it not the first time an American president suggested buying the island.\n\nThere were two failed attempts by US to purchase it: President Harry Truman tried to buy it for $100 million in 1946 and the State Department inquired about it in 1867.","summary":"Vladimir Putin is threatening an Arctic war as tensions grow ahead of US&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/putin-warns-of-potential-conflict-in-the-arctic-as-us-vice-president-vance-prepares-for-visit-to-greenland-and-accuses-nato-of-using-the-area-to-spark-tensions/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:34:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":304960706,"title":"Trump executive order on Smithsonian targets funding to programs with 'improper ideology'","text":"President Donald Trump revealed his intentions to reshape the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order Thursday that targets funding to programs with “divisive narratives” and “improper ideology.”Trump said there has been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”He signed an executive order putting Vice President JD Vance in charge of an effort to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Trump hosts Black History Month celebration amid DEI rollbacksTrump's order specifically names the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Women's History Museum, which is in development.“Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,” the order said.Representatives for the Smithsonian did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.IN OTHER NEWS | Entertainers cancel shows at Kennedy Center after President Trump's takeoverThe Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex.

Similarly, the administration has stirred up controversy by classifying drug traffickers as terrorists.\n\nCan it be the case that drug traffickers are terrorists carrying out a form of irregular warfare — and if so, how could the U.S. military address this at a strategic level?\n\nCan drugs be weapons of war?\n\nThe word “terrorism” has taken on new meaning in recent years. Although arguments can be made as to what signifies a terrorist activity, the concept of terrorism is most often associated with those who choose to do harm against civilians through acts of extreme violence or by mass casualty.\n\nThe attacks on the USS Cole, the World Trade Center and Benghazi usually come to mind when referring to acts of terrorism. Yet it is the subtle terrorist attacks that often go unnoticed.\n\nThe correlation between drugs and terrorist organizations is not new. In fact, most terrorist organizations rely heavily on criminal conduct to support their activities, such as the illicit drug trade, human trafficking, sex trafficking and money laundering. While it is true that illegal drugs finance terrorist and criminal groups, the situation today has changed.\n\nIt has become well known that the primary killer of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45 is fentanyl. In 2019 it was reported that fentanyl death rates had risen by over 1,000% within just six years.\n\nUnlike in the past, when the goal of illicit drug trade was to increase profits to fund terrorist attacks, fentanyl not only increases criminal profits but is a means of destruction — harming a large portion of the U.S. population and causing over 100,000 deaths per year. Mexican cartels have been identified as being responsible for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which led Trump to designate them as terrorist organizations.\n\nCan drugs like fentanyl accurately be described as weapons of war? Although it may seem surprising, history shows us the answer is often yes.\n\nOrganized crime groups have often deliberately flooded drugs into the U.S. with the goal of inflicting mass casualties on civilians. In 2005, Afghan drug lord Haji Baz Mohammed was extradited to the U.S. and convicted after having orchestrated attempts to use heroin as a form of “jihad,” stating that he and his colleagues were “taking the Americans’ money and the heroin was killing them,” according to court documents.\n\nState actors and corruption\n\nPolitical entities wishing to undermine the United States often have deep ties to the drug trade and use it to cause harm. One example is the conviction and sentencing of Juan Orlando Hernandez, who served as president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022, and was eventually sentenced to 45 years in prison in June 2024 for what U.S. prosecutors described as “state-sponsored drug trafficking.”\n\nThe case made history as Hernandez became the first former president sentenced in the U.S. for narcotics trafficking. According to the Justice Department, Hernandez’s co-conspirators benefited not only from political protection but military-style weaponry, including AK-47s, AR-15s and grenade launchers.\n\nMexico presents a unique challenge in terms of its geographic proximity to the U.S. and its role as a major international trading partner. Due to deep corruption, it has proved problematic in the past for U.S. law enforcement to put a stop to cartel activities affecting American citizens.\n\nRecently, the Mexican government extradited 29 drug lords to the U.S., including Rafael Caro Quintero, a Sinaloa cartel leader responsible for the murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in 1985. Camarena was kidnapped, brutally tortured and killed at the hands of the Sinaloa cartel in one of many tragedies experienced by the DEA while it was operating in Mexico for over 40 years.\n\nQuintero evaded justice for decades, a demonstration of the the difficulties of taking on cartels as well as the problem corruption has posed in stifling their illicit activities.\n\nTo take on the cartels who are responsible for the deaths of American civilians will take more than military or law enforcement action alone.\n\nThe need for joint solutions\n\nWhile turning its attention to Mexico, the current administration has deployed U.S. military forces to establish control of the border. However, such efforts will require combined experience, knowledge and the integration of expertise beyond the armed forces.\n\nSince the illicit drug trade is a major activity for the Mexican cartels, the model for a solution can be replicated based on the Afghanistan-based partnership between the Defense Department and a foreign-deployed advisory support team, or FAST.\n\nThis highly successful joint effort saw the U.S. military work with DEA agents on the ground to target Taliban heroin traffickers. What brought success then was options and the ability to target narco-terrorists through an array of authorities that could be used on the battlefield.\n\nThe same concept could be used to address the threats from Mexico by exploiting DOD assets and combining them with DEA expertise. Alongside vetted Mexican authorities, this partnership would yield shared intelligence gathering, training and joint operations.\n\nFAST drew its methodologies from U.S. special operations by merging small unit tactics, operational planning and tactical combat casualty care with DEA’s investigative techniques, evidence processing and handling of informants to create an unprecedented approach to effectively extinguish threats from criminal groups.\n\nIn a few short years, FAST became a valuable resource for the Special Operations Command to target Taliban principals and remove terrorist leaders from the battlefield. It remains a partnership highly valued by those who served on DEA’s FAST program.\n\nAlthough the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have since ended, the lessons learned from this cooperative approach still hold value. This strategy may be revisited as a method of unconventional warfare aimed at dismantling the most nefarious criminal organizations.\n\nNeither the U.S. military nor federal law enforcement acting alone are enough to deal with the complex problem of cartels. Forging a new partnership between DOD and DEA using the FAST model could prove to be the most efficient solution.","summary":"The author of this op-ed discusses how DOD-DEA partnerships, like those that targeted Taliban heroin traffickers, could be a model for stifling cartels.","url":"https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/2025/03/28/drug-trafficking-as-irregular-warfare-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/","image":"https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/OX5MEPRTZFENHEB7AN45NDQKYE.jpg?width=1200&auth=e91a77fdec798368dc8c1fbaa572c962d2df07a4dcecbe0d42b6beef4e6aec2d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:30:00","author":"Zita Fletcher","authors":["Zita Fletcher"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":304955110,"title":"DHS Official Placed on Leave After Adding Reporter to Sensitive Email Chain","text":"It turns out there are consequences for mistakenly leaking information about sensitive government operations to journalists.\n\nA longtime Department of Homeland Security employee was placed on administrative leave after accidentally sending unclassified details of an immigration operation to a journalist in late January, according to current and former DHS officials who spoke to NBC News.

Border czar Tom Homan earlier blamed media leaks for fewer-than-expected arrests in an operation targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe DHS employee was placed on leave pending an investigation and asked to take a polygraph test, officials said. She was reportedly notified that the agency intended to revoke her security clearance, which could lock her out of future homeland security jobs. She has 30 days to appeal.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the Trump administration’s response to a massive intelligence leak involving top national security officials who were discussing a military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen without knowing that The Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg got inadvertently added to the group chat.\n\nNone of the officials in the group chat—including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Vice President JD Vance—have faced repercussions over the leak. President Donald Trump has assigned Waltz to probe his own mistake of adding Goldberg to the group chat.\n\nFormer ICE chief of staff Jason Houser told NBC that the DHS employee was known for being “mission-focused” and “apolitical.” He called it a “staggering hypocrisy” that national security officials did not face the same consequences.\n\n“Targeting a career official who dedicated her service to protecting public safety and enforcing the law while excusing political appointees who leaked sensitive war plans shows this administration punishes integrity and protects recklessness,” he said. “This isn’t just a double standard—it’s reckless and dangerous.”\n\nMary McCord, a national security analyst who used to work in the Justice Department, told NBC that the DHS and group chat incidents should be handled the same way.\n\n“Both of these are examples of carelessness in the handling of highly sensitive information, the disclosure of which could put U.S. government employees or military members in danger,” she said. \n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to DHS and the White House for comment.","summary":"Eric Thayer/Getty ImagesIt turns out there are consequences for mistakenly leaking information about sensitive government operations to journalists.\n\nA longtime Department of Homeland Security employee was placed on administrative leave after accidentally sending unclassified details of an immigration operation to a journalist in late January, according to current and former DHS officials who spoke to NBC News.

The White House projects it will generate $100 billion annually, yet analysts warn it could disrupt global supply chains and inflate retail prices, particularly for automakers reliant on international parts, or almost all of them.\n\nPresident Trump has defended the policy, dismissing current cross-border supply chains as ‘ridiculous’ and insisting the tariffs be ‘permanent’ so as to revive US manufacturing. This position is in line with his administration’s move away from bodies like the WTO, the World Health Organisation, and the United Nations, as well as cuts to foreign aid.\n\nWill human rights organisations say they are aligned as Trump stops paying WTO?\n\nIn a shockingly ironic twist, the move is almost perfectly aligned with human rights campaigns like 100 Million, Transform Trade, and scores of others who demonstrated at the 1999 Seattle and Prague protests against globalisation. Campaigning for an end to first-world manufacturing companies circumventing domestic workers’ rights legislation by outsourcing to much cheaper countries with much lower levels of safeguarding, Trump is seemingly on their side.\n\nThe move has drawn sharp criticism from key US trading partners. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it ‘a very direct attack’, vowing to defend Canadian workers, companies, and the nation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen labelled the tariffs ‘taxes – bad for businesses, worse for consumers’.\n\nThe WTO could impose penalties if the US fails to resume payments within a year, according to its rules, with ‘administrative measures’ rising every year. As global trade tensions rise, the suspension heralds a bold, contentious chapter in America’s economic strategy under Trump’s leadership.","summary":"The United States has suspended its financial contributions to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), according to sources in Washington.

The law, which takes effect with its approval, requires public buildings, including the state Capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded domestic violence shelters, to provide separate spaces for men and women. Also Read | Donald Trump Places 25% Tariff on Imported Autos, Expecting to Raise USD 100 Billion in Tax Revenues. It defines the sexes in state law based on a person's chromosomes and reproductive biology, even as a district court ruling earlier this year declared the definitions unconstitutional. Attorneys for the ACLU of Montana filed a legal challenge to the law within hours of it being signed. They asked a state judge in Missoula to block Gianforte and Monana Attorney General Austin Knudsen from enforcing the law. Also Read | US Shocker: Former Middle School Principal Allegedly Raped Student for 4 Years in Delaware, Arrested. The new law declares that there are only two sexes, male and female, going against a judge's 2024 ruling that struck down that same definition. Under the law, transgender people cannot use public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping areas that align with their gender identity. The law does not explain how people in charge of public facilities should verify someone's sex. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, the Republican sponsor, said it was not meant to be exclusionary but to preserve safe spaces for women. A transgender man who has undergone a medical transition to develop more masculine features such as facial hair, muscle definition and a deeper voice is now required by law to use the women's restroom. Republican lawmakers swiftly approved the measure despite vocal opposition from Democrats who worried it would complicate daily life for two fellow lawmakers who are transgender and nonbinary. Among them was Zooey Zephyr, the Missoula Democrat who was silenced and sanctioned by her Republican colleagues in 2023 for comments she made on the House floor. Zephyr warned it would embolden some to police another person's gender in public, which she said could create hostile situations for everyone. The law allows people to sue a facility for not preventing transgender people from using a certain restroom or changing room. They can recover nominal damages, generally $1, and the entity could be required to pay the plaintiff's legal fees.

Future prices for the base metal’s most traded contract rose to $5.24 per pound on Wednesday. Prices are up about 30% so far this year, following modest gains over the last several years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to impose a tariff of up to 25% on all copper imports and has called for increasing U.S. production. China, the world’s largest importer of copper, is embarking on a stimulus program that could further increase demand for the base metal.\n\n“Tariff threats, tightening supply, and stimulus-fueled optimism for an economic rebound in China have underpinned a rally in copper.” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nCopper is critical to energy infrastructure around the world. It goes into cords for electronic devices, transmission lines, batteries, and LED lights. A global shift to cleaner energy technology, such as solar power, had already been boosting demand, which is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid.\n\n“When you look at the uses of copper in today’s economy, those uses and the intensity of use of copper in today’s economy are growing,” said Kathleen L. Quirk, President and CEO of mining giant Freeport-McMoRan, at a recent conference for the global metals industry.\n\nThe International Energy Agency expects demand for the base metal to rise 20% to 31,128 kilotons by 2030 and by 41% to 36,379 kilotons by 2040. The U.S. mined about 1.1 million tons of copper in 2024. It currently lags the top producers, including Chile, Peru and China.\n\nCopper mining companies are gaining ground amid rising demand. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan, which operates most of its open-pit copper mines in the U.S., are up 9% this year. Southern Copper, which has operations in Mexico and Peru, is up 8% for the year. The broader market has been slipping, with the S&P 500 down 2.9%.\n\nThe rising price of copper has a potential downside for some businesses and consumers.\n\nThe construction industry, including homebuilders, could face a tighter financial squeeze because of copper’s rising cost as demand fails to keep pace with supplies. Stubborn inflation has already pushed home construction costs higher. Total construction costs for a single-family home rose just under 9.2% in 2024 from the previous year, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. Higher copper prices, coupled with higher prices for other key building materials such as lumber, could worsen inflation for the sector.\n\nAppliances, electronics and other products containing copper could become more expensive, also fueling inflation and prompting consumers to cut back on spending for certain items.

But we can’t let them drag this out while they continue prosecuting their illegal invasion.”\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday evening that Washington is pushing for a new minerals deal with Ukraine which would give the US a greater say over Kyiv’s minerals and energy resources such as oil and gas.\n\nUK officials are of the view that it is up to Ukraine to decide on any agreement it enters with regards to sovereign natural resources.\n\nThe FT reported that it is a new draft deal, recently sent to Ukraine by the US.\n\nLast month Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky had been expected to sign a minerals deal at the White House, but the Ukrainian leader left after a public confrontation with the US president in the Oval Office.\n\nThe meetings in Paris came after Ukraine and Russia agreed to pause hostilities in the Black Sea following talks with the US in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr Trump has been pressing European nations to up their defence spending in recent months, and there have been questions over what this means for the transatlantic relationship on security.\n\nA senior Cabinet minister admitted on Thursday that the US president is “of course” a “part of the change” that ministers have referred to in recent weeks.\n\nAhead of her spring statement earlier this week, Rachel Reeves said the “world has changed” as she pledged to keep to her spending rules.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Pat McFadden said: “The international security position has obviously changed.\n\n“We’ve been asked to step up in a very direct way on European security as part of the backdrop for the increase in defence expenditure that the Government announced a couple of weeks ago.”\n\nPushed further on whether Mr Trump was the changing factor given the war in Ukraine started several years ago, Mr McFadden added: “Of course he’s part of the change.”\n\nHe said: “He’s not all the change… he’s said that Europe needs to step up in its security. He’s not the first US president to say this but the question has definitely become sharper in recent weeks.”\n\nThe so-called “coalition of the willing” meeting in Paris also agreed there should be no easing of sanctions against Russia.\n\nEarlier this week, the Trump administration appeared to signal its intent to ease sanctions on Russian agricultural goods and improve Moscow’s access to maritime insurance, ports and payment systems as part of a deal.\n\nBut Ukraine and its European allies have firmly pushed back against any suggestion of lifting sanctions, agreeing instead to increase measures to bring Russia to the negotiating table.\n\nSir Keir said there had been “complete clarity that now is not the time for lifting of sanctions”, while Mr Zelensky said sanctions were “one of the few real tools the world has to pressure Russia into serious talks”.\n\nThursday’s meeting also saw Sir Keir update the group of 30 nations, plus Nato and the EU, with the outcomes of a series of military planning talks for a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine.\n\nOfficials and defence chiefs have been holding talks at London’s Northwood military headquarters throughout the week, drawing up a strategy to support Kyiv and deter future aggression from Moscow.","summary":"The Ukrainian president posted a message on

I have to wonder whether the real intention might not be to force Zelensky to reject it.”\n\nUnder the latest proposals, all of Ukraine’s mineral and energy assets – and related infrastructure, such as ports, railways, roads and production facilities – would be placed under the control of a new United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, based in Delaware.\n\nThree of the new fund’s five board members would be chosen by the US, handing Washington full veto power over resource sales to any third parties.\n\nThe US would receive all royalties from the fund until Ukraine has paid off at least $100bn of war debt, plus 4 per cent interest, after which point Kyiv would receive just 50 per cent of the royalties.\n\nWashington would receive a “right of first offer” on investments in all infrastructure and natural resources projects, while Ukraine would be prevented from intervening in the fund’s day-to-day management, Bloomberg reported.\n\nProfits from the fund would be converted directly into foreign currency, with Ukraine to be held liable for compensation in the event of delays or disputes, according to the FT.\n\nThree senior Ukrainian officials told the outlet that a deal is unlikely to be signed next week, contrary to claims in Washington. One is reported to have labelled the new US draft proposal “unfair”, while another described it as “robbery”.\n\nA third official was quoted as saying that Kyiv has enlisted a team of legal advisers to help examine the document – which was reportedly delivered to Ukraine last weekend – as they prepare a counter-offer.\n\nDescribing it as an “expropriation document”, Mr Riley said: “There are no guarantees, no defence clauses, the US puts up nothing. The Americans can walk away, the Ukrainians can’t. I’ve never seen anything like it before.”\n\nNoting that the new proposals are “not compatible with EU membership”, the trade expert added: “Perhaps that is part of the purpose.”\n\nFollowing a meeting of Ukraine’s European allies in Paris on Thursday to discuss a possible peacekeeping force, Mr Zelensky said the US had been “constantly” changing the terms of the proposed minerals deal with Ukraine – but added that he did not want Washington to think Kyiv was against the deal.\n\n“We support cooperation with the US, we don’t want to give a single signal that can prompt the US to stop aid to Ukraine,” Mr Zelensky said, highlighting the pressure being leveraged by Washington over an ally trapped in an existential war against Russia.\n\nWhile the US said on Tuesday that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to a Black Sea and energy ceasefire, Ukrainian officials accused Russia on Thursday of damaging energy infrastructure in Kherson with artillery strikes.\n\n“Two days ago, there was a night when there were no strikes on the energy sector, today energy infrastructure in the city of Kherson was damaged by Russian artillery,” Mr Zelensky said in Paris. “I believe that the US should respond with actions.”\n\n“Our side, as long as no one understands who is monitoring what,” he said. “All this [evidence] will be prepared and transferred to the US, and after that we are waiting for America’s reaction, since they told us that they will respond to violations.”\n\nMr Zelensky and his Western allies previously accused Russia of “manipulation” over the deal, after Moscow demanded that the Black Sea truce – which will disproportionately benefit Russia – could only begin once Western sanctions on food and agriculture exports were lifted and a key bank reconnected to the Swift messaging system.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington is reported to be holding talks with the Kremlin over plans to restore Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine and later through the Nord Stream pipelines, while handing a major stake to US firms.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-pushes-control-ukraine-mineral-234732701.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C9jzuuaoQ5lkjpDQ8CVv6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/360c57a286c77d9a500dd2e4bd097e9e","video":"","publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:03:52","author":"Andy Gregory","authors":["Andy Gregory"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":304954014,"title":"Billions wiped off UK and European car giants in wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs","text":"BILLIONS of pounds were wiped off the value of European car giants yesterday as shares slid in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs. \n\nThe President triggered a car crash for the industry by announcing a 25 per cent blanket tariff on all foreign-made vehicles. \n\nThe move also impacts British car makers with the US accounting for 16.9 per cent of all exports, worth £6.7 billion. \n\nBritish luxury car brands Range Rovers, Bentleys, Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Lotus and Minis are all popular with American drivers. \n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves yesterday said that there were “intense negotiations” with the US amid hopes that the UK can still wangle some exemptions from the tariffs. \n\nLondon-listed James Bond favourite Aston Martin, which shipped 1,928 cars to the US last year, skidded to a record low after losing 6.6 per cent \n\nShares in Vauxhall owner, Stellantis, dropped by 4.2 per cent while German manufacturers Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen all dropped. \n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow trade secretary, said: “This auto tariff announcement is concerning.

With their already slim majority dwindling, passing Trump’s top priorities is becoming increasingly challenging. \n\nRight now, the GOP holds a razor-thin five-seat majority in the House—218 Republicans to 213 Democrats—with four vacancies, making every vote crucial. The situation has become so precarious that Rep. Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, has lost her nomination to Trump’s Cabinet.\n\nCBS News reported Thursday that Stefanik’s nomination for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was pulled following pressure from her party to decline the role. With margins this tight, Republicans are hesitant to lose another seat, leading party leaders to withdraw her nomination altogether. \n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho shared the news with reporters on Wednesday.\n\nBut what he failed to mention is that Stefanik is the ultimate loser in this debacle. By having her stick around in Congress instead of taking the U.N. ambassadorship, she’s now been relegated to the sidelines—just another backbencher with no real influence. She gave up a potential leadership role and still hasn’t been assigned to any subcommittees.\n\nFor someone who spent years climbing the GOP ranks, this is a humiliating fall from grace. Instead of elevating her status on the world stage, Stefanik is now stuck in a Congress where she has no power, no platform, and—thanks to Republican infighting—no clear path forward.\n\nBefore the news broke, The Hill reported earlier this month that Stefanik’s confirmation could be postponed until at least April. House Speaker Mike Johnson was reportedly responsible for the delay—which his office has disputed—and believes that Stefanik is far more valuable in Congress than in Trump’s administration.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Johnson was well aware of the internal conflict surrounding Stefanik’s nomination. Notably, unlike some of her former colleagues, she did not preemptively resign from Congress ahead of the Senate confirmation process.\n\nIn some cases, Republicans are even delaying special elections in strong Democratic districts, seemingly to avoid further weakening their majority. \n\nFor example, The Texas Tribune reported Wednesday that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has yet to call a special election to replace the late Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner, who passed away more than three weeks ago.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called attention to Abbott’s delay on Tuesday. \n\n“Congressman Sylvester Turner sadly passed away on Wednesday, March 5. Why hasn’t the Texas Governor called a special election to fill this vacant seat?” he wrote on X.\n\nWith the current vacancies, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes while still maintaining their majority on the House floor. And considering their growing internal divisions, their power may be even more tenuous than it seems. \n\nRepublicans appear to be counting on two Florida special elections to bolster their numbers. The April 1 races will determine who replaces former GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Mike Waltz—the latter of whom is currently serving as Trump’s national security adviser (and making a mess of it). \n\nWhile both seats lean Republican, Democratic challengers are putting up a strong fight. In the contest to replace Waltz, Democrat Josh Weil has already raised an impressive $10 million compared to his opponent’s $1 million.\n\nThe fact that Republicans withdrew Stefanik’s nomination signals desperation and reflects a party in full-blown panic mode. It shows that they’re terrified they can’t advance Trump’s agenda in Congress without resorting to questionable tactics, and it suggests an even deeper fear: another Democratic upset. \n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats flipped a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a deeply red district that had previously never elected a Democrat, and that Trump carried by 15 points in the 2024 election. \n\nIf Florida’s special elections come down to the wire, as some Republicans apprehend, the GOP might start worrying about Stefanik’s district next.\n\nWhile the Florida seats are expected to stay red, Stefanik’s seat isn’t guaranteed for the GOP. Sure, she won reelection by 24 points in November, but Democrats have held the district before, with Bill Owens in the seat from 2009 to 2015. If next week’s special elections are close, Republicans will need to worry that her district could be the next to flip. \n\nAnd Democrats sense the opportunity. Before news of Stefanik’s nomination withdrawal, they had planned to target her seat—just as they are in Florida. Seemingly scared of what might happen if increasingly dissatisfied voters have a say, Republicans clearly didn’t want to risk it.\n\nThe irony is almost too rich. Republicans, once so confident about their grip on power, are now scrambling to rig the game just to keep their fragile majority intact.","summary":"House Republican leadership is hanging on by a thread, struggling to maintain control as members either resign or accept positions in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

US President Donald Trump's threatened reciprocal tariffs announcement is expected that day against trading partners who, he says, have been ripping off his country by imposing high levies. The government is now drawing up a list of products that are very specific to the US as this round of cuts, outside of the proposed trade agreement, will be on most favoured nation (MFN) basis, implying the reduced duty would apply to all MFN imports of those products. The government wants to make sure that the beneficiary products are made in the US. The list could cover four to five products, including certain kinds of electronics, chemicals and plastics, besides aircraft, parachutes and cruise ships.

Multiple strategies are being examined, said an official.Digital Services, Data Localisation DiscussedAccording to World Trade Organization rules, changes to customs tariffs have to be on MFN basis, unless under a trade agreement with another nation. A country's trade policies apply equally to all MFN partners.A final call on the proposed cuts will be taken at the highest levels of the government after taking into account all scenarios and the progress that's been made on the proposed India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), another official said. 119613149Besides tariffs, issues related to digital services and data localisation are also being discussed.The local industry wants to avert or delay Trump's tariffs and has written to the government for intervention.

India's simple average tariff rate is 17%, with the simple average agricultural tariff, which includes textiles, at 39%.

The levies on fully assembled vehicles take effect on April 3 - a day after Trump's threatened reciprocal tariffs - and will widen to cover auto parts from May 3. The US is India's second-largest export market for auto parts after Europe, thus posing a challenge for India's component exports worth an estimated $6.79 billion to that country. That's about a third of India's total auto part exports of $21.2 billion in FY24. Trump says tariffs will force companies to set up factories in the US and, therefore, lead to more jobs. 119613318Indian executives said the US President's decision doesn't make economic sense. The move is untenable, said an executive at an auto component firm. 'US Expensive Production Base' It will stoke inflation and slow auto sales in the US, said the executive at an auto component firm. Since production and labour costs in the US are much higher, automakers will continue to import at 25% duty, eventually jacking up vehicle prices there, said another executive. Earlier, the US levied zero duties on auto parts imported from India. The assumption behind raising tariffs is it will encourage local manufacturing in the US but the US is an expensive production base, the executive said. Auto and component stocks fell on the tariff news. The BSE Auto index dropped nearly 1% as the Sensex rose 0.4%. Tata Motors fell the most, declining 5.6%. Ashok Leyland shed 2.9%, while Mahindra & Mahindra dropped 0.4%. Among auto component makers, Sundaram Fasteners and Samvardhana Motherson International fell 4% and 2.2%, respectively.Nearly half of all vehicles sold in the US are imported, and about 60% of the parts used in vehicles assembled there come from overseas, according to a White House factsheet.In FY24, India exported auto components worth $6.79 billion to the Americas, up 4.5% year-on-year, according to the Auto Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) grouping. About 80% of these are engine and transmission-related parts. About a fifth of the revenue of India's auto component sector is derived from exports. Of this, 27% is to the US.

Gleason was not part of the group.Gleason, according to her LinkedIn profile when she was announced acting DOGE administrator, was a senior adviser at the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) since January.

Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, according to two Republican sources with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nTrump’s frustration is two-fold, the sources said. The president is angry that Waltz fumbled a Signal group chat created to coordinate among senior national security officials. According to screenshots published by The Atlantic, a Signal user with Waltz’s name added Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazine’s editor in chief, to the group chat. The episode has created a multi-day controversy for the White House.\n\nBut Trump is also annoyed that the race to replace Waltz in Congress seat is shaping up to be more competitive than it should be for Republicans — and next week’s special election in Florida only opened up because Trump selected Waltz for his post in the administration.\n\nEven though GOP leaders are confident the Republican candidate in that special election, Randy Fine, will pull off a win, Trump is still worried that the optics are fueling a negative narrative and making the party look bad, the sources said. Trump is holding tele-town halls Thursday night for Fine and another Republican candidate in a second Florida special election. Had Stefanik been confirmed as U.N. ambassador, it would have created another special election and removed a Republican from the tightly divided House amid efforts to pass Trump’s legislative agenda.\n\nThe White House did not comment on questions about Trump’s conversations Thursday.\n\nTrump’s frustration with Waltz comes as a chorus of allies have called for Trump to fire the national security adviser Waltz as a fall guy for the group chat fiasco.\n\nBut while Waltz comes in for criticism because Goldberg’s inclusion in the chat ultimately resulted in its publication, others have scrutinized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth more closely, because he shared details of military plans over a commercial app instead of using traditional government channels for sensitive information.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday asked the Defense Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into the Signal chat and, specifically, whether department policies on classification and sharing sensitive information were broken. Wicker the ranking member on the panel, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., sent the letter to the inspector general together.\n\n“The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified,” Wicker told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nYet Hegseth has gotten full-throated backing from Trump and others.\n\n“Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this. Hegseth? How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do,” Trump said Wednesday in response to questions from reporters.\n\nIn the same media availability, Trump said of Waltz, “Mike Waltz, I guess he said he claimed responsibility,” before adding, “But again, the attacks were unbelievably successful, and that’s ultimately what you should be talking about.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Trump “continues to have confidence in his national security team.”\n\nHegseth has defended himself by telling reporters there was “no classified information” in the chat, a refrain the administration and many other Republicans have adopted as well.\n\n“There’s no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information,” Hegseth said Wednesday.\n\nOther MAGA allies have come to Hegseth’s defense, too.\n\n“We dare the media and these radical Democrats to come after Pete Hegseth,” said Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally and aide in his first administration, who said attacks on Hegseth We have his back.”\n\nStill, one House Republican lawmaker with experience in national security matters told NBC News Thursday that Hegseth should resign, saying that if Biden-era Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had done what Hegseth did, “we would have already drawn up, you know, impeachment and asked for his resignation.”","summary":"President Donald Trump expressed frustration with national security adviser Michael Waltz Thursday&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-expresses-his-frustration-with-michael-waltz-in-private/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 23:57:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":304954508,"title":"Will Trump’s Gulf of America Power Trip Break the White House Press Corps?","text":"On Thursday morning, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, held a hearing in the A.P.’s lawsuit to block the President’s latest and arguably most flagrant ever transgression of the First Amendment in his effort to control coverage of himself. I would have liked to stay in my office to await the latest updates on Signalgate, which will surely rate as one of the capital’s other most stupidly revealing scandals, given that it was set off by Trump’s national-security adviser inadvertently inviting the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to join a text-message group chat about bombing Houthi rebels in Yemen. But Thursday’s hearing struck me as a good opportunity to watch one of the signature events in Trump’s Washington—a government lawyer embarrassing himself in defense of an almost laughably indefensible case.\nTrump, in justifying his attack on the A.P., had left little room for avoiding the truth about his ban: it was pure retaliation for the organization making its own decisions about how to report on him. “We’re going to keep them out. Until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America,” Trump said last month. He called the A.P.—the all-American, middle-of-the-road, nonpartisan, always-there A.P.—a collection of “radical-left lunatics.” Perhaps even more worrisome, Trump has not confined his vengeance to the wire service; in seizing control of the press pool, Trump is challenging a prerogative of the White House press corps that goes back more than a century. It’s power he wants, not just petty retribution. As an unnamed Trump adviser summed up the case in an interview with Axios: “The AP and the White House Correspondents Association wanted to f--k around. Now it’s finding out time.”\nFinding-out time is a good way of putting it; the bully in the White House is going to bully. The question is who, if anyone, is going to stop him. The A.P. made the quote the epigraph in its brief to Judge McFadden, seeking an emergency injunction.\nIn the hearing itself, nobody said anything about radical-left lunatics or the President’s absolute right to redraw the map of the world if he so chooses. Appearing for the government, Brian Hudak offered a subdued, if at times obtuse, defense. “There is no First Amendment right to access facilities by the press,” he said. I never heard him mention anything about the Gulf of Mexico, or the Gulf of America, for that matter. The A.P.’s lawyer, Charles Tobin, opted for a more straightforward point about what he called “viewpoint discrimination.” Trump’s White House has thrown up “unconstitutional retaliatory roadblocks” against the news agency, he said, which, if allowed to stand, will have a “chilling effect on the entire journalism industry.”\nPerhaps the most perfectly Trumpian moment came when Tobin held up a large coffee-table-size book. On the cover was a photograph from Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer, when he was nearly killed by an assassin’s bullet and thrust his fist in the air, shouting “Fight! Fight!” before being rushed off the stage. Evan Vucci, the A.P.’s chief White House photographer, was testifying at the time. Tobin asked Vucci to identify the book—“Save America,” by Donald J. Trump—before asking him if he recognized the photo. Vucci said it was his own award-winning picture of that historic moment. “He used your photo on the cover?” Tobin asked. Yes, Vucci replied. “He used my photo on the cover.”\nCould there be anything more on-brand for this President than banning the A.P. from the Oval Office for refusing to grant him veto power over their editorial standards, while, at the same time, marketing himself with one of their pictures? The book, published last September, currently retails for $92.52 on Amazon. I suppose it should be noted that Vucci, an earnest twenty-one-year veteran of the A.P., who speaks of his work as a “public service,” was no more a radical-left lunatic when he took the photograph than he was on the stand Thursday, testifying about how Trump’s campaign against America’s premier news agency has left it “basically dead in the water on major news stories.” And, even if he were, who cares? Isn’t that the whole point about the First Amendment?\nAt Thursday’s hearing, I noticed one of Politico’s ace legal reporters, Kyle Cheney, sitting on one of the hard wooden benches behind me. He later posted a list of all the court cases he was tracking that day:\n\n-Preliminary injunction hearing on WH effort to exclude AP from press pool\n\n-Emergency hearing on grant cut to USAGM programs\n\n-Boasberg hearing on Signalgate\n\n-Ruling this evening by Seattle judge on military transgender ban\n\n-Filings on removal case of Rumeysa Ozturk, Tufts student, and whether ICE moved her to La. In violation of court order.\n\n-Potentially appeal to SCOTUS or DC Circuit en banc re: Alien Enemies Act\n\nTalk about a busy day at the office.\nThe theme of it all is about much more than any single principle, even one as foundational to the Republic as freedom of speech. It’s about Trump’s power—about a vision of the Presidency so sweeping that it does not recognize the basic precedents that the courts have created over decades of legal battles seeking to define the contours of the executive’s authority.\nBut it’s also no accident that many of these tests of the American system from Trump involve the media. In his first term, Trump tried—and failed—to have a reporter he didn’t like, CNN’s Jim Acosta, banned from the White House. As a politician, his default setting is to blame the “fake news” and demean journalists as the “enemies of the people.” In the 2024 campaign, he sued news outlets such as CBS over their coverage. In a speech at the Department of Justice earlier this month, Trump denounced reporting he did not like from independent news outlets as “illegal” and said that CNN and MSNBC were “corrupt.” And all this week, Trump’s White House has savaged the reputation and impugned the integrity of Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, whose accidental inclusion on the national-security adviser’s group chat became the basis of Signalgate.\nAs I was on my way to the federal-court building on Thursday morning, a news alert flashed across my screen: the BBC’s correspondent in Turkey, Mark Lowen, had been thrown out of the country while covering mass protests over the arrest of Istanbul’s mayor, a leading opposition figure standing up to Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “Press freedom and impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy,” Lowen said in a statement. In a tweet, he added, “Journalism is not a crime.”\nThe timing could not have been more sadly appropriate. America once had grandiose—if often unsuccessful—dreams of exporting its model of rule-of-law democracy abroad to countries such as Turkey. No more. It’s got less attention than it should amid all the other crises, but Trump has also acted swiftly to gut America’s foreign-aid programs that promote democracy and the rule of law abroad, seeking to effectively eliminate the Voice of America, the National Endowment for Democracy, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. As with his assault on the A.P., all of those decisions are the subject of lawsuits, too. Radio Free Europe’s example shows that going to court can produce results—after the Administration lost a ruling earlier this week, it abruptly restored funding for the network on Thursday.\nBut, even if he loses all of his cases in court, and let’s hope he does, Trump has communicated something all too clearly: he wants to emulate the world’s autocrats, not undermine them. What really is the difference between Erdoğan’s thugs throwing the BBC’s correspondent out of Turkey and the Trump Administration snatching a Tufts University student off the street and seeking to deport her because the Administration does not like what it calls her “pro-Hamas” views about the war in Gaza? I don’t recall the provision in the Constitution that says the First Amendment is just for stuff that Donald Trump agrees with. ♦","summary":"The Associated Press had its day in court on Thursday, but free speech in this Presidency is already a big loser.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/will-trumps-gulf-of-america-power-trip-break-the-white-house-press-corps","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/67e5c6c1e6cd759d0d0398e7/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Glasser_March27_2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 23:55:50","author":"Susan B.

He has frequently used the phrase \"fake news\" to dismiss unfavorable coverage and has been outspoken in his support for and criticism of specific outlets.The ruling also finds common ground among parties, which have been increasingly divisive in recent weeks.What To KnowTrump appointees Allen Dickerson and James \"Trey\" Trainor III joined two Democrats in a 4-0 FEC ruling which disagreed with the then-Republican presidential campaign's claim that The Washington Post conducted a \"dark money corporate campaign in opposition\" to Trump, \"using its own online advertising efforts to promote Kamala Harris's presidential candidacy.\"Trainor, who specializes in election law and campaign finance law and ethics, previously served as Trump's 2016 campaign attorney. He was nominated to the FEC post in 2020.The ruling was determined on February 24 but was released publicly today.The complaint, which was originally filed on October 31, 2024, just ahead of the election, asserted that \"a reasonable interference that The Washington Post made, and Harris for President accepted, an illegal corporate contribution in the form of coordinated communications.\"The Post has repeatedly maintained its innocence, with a November filing on behalf of The Post stating that the \"allegations in the complaints are speculative and demonstrably false\" and arguing, \"The Post's promotion of its political coverage is protected by the First Amendment.\"Acting general counsel Lisa Stevenson said in a January 31, 2025, report, \"This matter is rated as low priority for Commission action after application of these pre-established criteria.

Some large universities can get well over $1 billion a year in total revenue from the federal government.”\n\nThe interviewer asked, “Did any leaders in higher education recognize ahead of this the vulnerabilities that came with this dependence on the federal government?”\n\nKelchen’s answer was basically, “no.”\n\nEven if the Trump approach has been more aggressive than anticipated, it shouldn’t be news that federal money comes with strings. \n\nUniversities already had to make all sorts of commitments to the feds to tap into funding. A University of Florida website says that among the assurances it has to make to the federal government are that it is in compliance with:\n\nfederal discrimination regulations\n\nfederal lobbying regulations\n\nfederal regulations regarding promoting objectivity in research\n\nfederal regulations regarding research misconduct\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nNational Occupational Safety and Health Act\n\nFDA Good Laboratory Practices Act\n\nDrug-Free Workplace Act\n\nSmoke-Free Workplace Act\n\nOn top of this, the Obama and Biden administrations used federal dollars as the lever to coerce educational institutions into adopting their preferred policies on the handling of sexual-assault cases and trans students. \n\nProgressives put Chekhov’s proverbial gun on the table, assuming that it would be used only against someone else. \n\nThe minimalist “night-watchman state” wouldn’t be able to do what Trump is doing (and not just with universities, but with disfavored law firms and with corporations beholden to woke ideas), or what his predecessors did in the other direction. \n\nProgressives can’t say they weren’t warned, even if it’s been a long time coming.\n\nIn “God and Man at Yale” in 1951, Bill Buckley wrote of the issue of public funding.\n\nHe warned that Yale was “working toward her own destruction, i.e. to the day when some future Yale president, fedora in hand, will knock at the door of some politician with palm outstretched. This day, of course, means the end of Yale as a private institution.”\n\nIf the academic establishment is now fully realizing the power that its federal patron has over higher education, maybe it should have made a little more time for libertarian critiques of government power all along.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"None of the mechanisms the president is using to push his agenda were put in place by conservatives for leverage against progressive institutions. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/27/opinion/how-trump-caught-big-government-fans-in-their-own-trap/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-uz4kexo4y-1743115688664.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743101685&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 23:49:03","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":304957734,"title":"Trump executive order on Smithsonian targets funding to programs with 'improper ideology'","text":"President Donald Trump revealed his intentions to reshape the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order Thursday that targets funding to programs with “divisive narratives” and “improper ideology.”\n\nTrump said there has been a “concerted and widespread” effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing “objective facts” with a “distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”\n\nHe signed an executive order putting Vice President JD Vance in charge of an effort to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.\n\nTrump's order specifically names the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Women's History Museum, which is in development.\n\n“Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,” the order said. \n\nRepresentatives for the Smithsonian did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. \n\nThe Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex.
