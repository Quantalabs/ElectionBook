She should stay solid with Philly, that’s where she’s from,’ one fan told DailyMail.com at Friday’s Super Bowl parade.\n\nHowever, he did show some sympathy admitting that the songstress isn’t the only one to feel the wrath of the omni-passionate Philadelphia fans. \n\n‘I don’t know if she necessarily deserved it but at the same time it just happens, I mean Eagles fans boo their own players when they’re doing bad,’ he added.\n\n‘It’s not necessarily a whole thing about her. It just had to be expected, she was an Eagles fan and then she traded that in to go with the Chiefs. You can’t expect anything less. I don’t think it was anything personal, it just happened to be about the team she was rooting for that day.’\n\nAnother woman agreed, claiming the incident was a repercussion of betraying Philadelphia.\n\n‘She switched over, so I feel like she deserved the boos just as little bit. No hard feelings though, we still love you Taylor,’ she said.\n\nPresident Trump, who has a longstanding hatred of the 14-time Grammy Award winner, had reveled in the booing, twisting the knife on Truth Social where he claimed the taunting had sent her fleeing from Caesars Superdome.\n\nWhile Trump’s jab was unfounded – Swift in fact stayed for every depressing minute of the Chiefs’ nightmare – a group of young men warned that she may not have survived the in-stadium attack if it had come at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\n‘She deserved it even more,’ they said. ‘If she came to Philly, she’d get booed out of the stadium.’\n\nMeanwhile, others insisted that Swift wasn’t a special case. She was just another victim of the intense Philadelphia fan culture.\n\n‘Here’s the deal, we boo everybody,’ one man explained to DailyMail.com. ‘And the fact of the matter is she was with her boyfriend Travis Kelce who’s a Chiefs player, so she’s affiliated with the Chiefs.’\n\nHis wife claimed that the ‘I Can Do It With A Broken Heart’ singer would have shaken it off by now – despite DailyMail.com’s report that the booing broke Kelce’s heart.\n\n‘I think she knew what she was getting herself into to be honest. She’s so strong willed, she didn’t care,’ she chimed in.\n\nA handful appeared to defend both Swift and their own fanbase, pointing the finger at someone else entirely.\n\n‘I don’t think it was her fault; I think it was the NFL’s fault because they’re the ones who put her on the camera. She’s just there supporting her boyfriend,’ one man told DailyMail.com.\n\n‘I feel it’s not necessary. It’s this new station that puts her on the screen. That’s not her fault,’ another young woman agreed.\n\n‘But I think it was fair fun that she’s rooting for the other team, so they’re going to boo. They would have moved anyone’s girlfriend.\n\n‘It’s not nice, but it’s football, not singing. It’s like when people ask him [Kelce] questions about Taylor Swift, like ‘are you gonna propose?’ No, this is about football. Leave that out. She’s taking away from football.’\n\nWhile Swift may not have been in the direct firing line during the Eagles’ Super Bowl parade Friday, her fans were.\n\nCJ Gardner-Johnson mocked Swifties with a custom-made sweatshirt worn on a wild day with the words: ‘Swifties can LIX my balls’.\n\nLIX are the roman numerals for the number 59, which was the number of the recent Super Bowl that the Eagles won. It follows his taunting of Kelce, which sparked a war with the singer’s loyal fanbase.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTaylor Swift may want to steer clear of her hometown after her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Philadelphia residents criticize Taylor Swift, a local artist, as they explain why the Super Bowl experience could have been even more negative for the perceived &#8220;traitor.&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/philadelphia-residents-criticize-taylor-swift-a-local-artist-as-they-explain-why-the-super-bowl-experience-could-have-been-even-more-negative-for-the-perceived-traitor/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95234983-0-image-a-41_1739576433403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 01:04:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":290663142,"title":"Kentucky Senate Passes Bill to Lower Water Pollution Standards","text":"A bill lowering water pollution standards passed through the Kentucky Senate on Friday. If passed into law, the bill will decrease state regulation to the federal standard.Newsweek reached out to the Kentucky Coal Association by email for comment.Why It MattersThe bill comes amid a flurry of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump in his first weeks in office, including pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement and directing federal agencies to halt clean-energy spending and pause some new permits for wind and solar projects.Senate Bill 89 passed on Friday with a vote of 30-5, garnering the support of all Republicans in the chamber, as well as one Democrat.What to KnowThe bill proposes to decrease Kentucky's regulation of water pollution to federal standards, which are weaker than the state's current regulation. It is an attempt to remove permitting barriers and \"unnecessary red tape\" for the state's coal mining industry, which are currently caused by clean water laws, the bill's sponsor Senator Scott Madon said.In 2021, 71 percent of Kentucky's energy production was from coal, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported. Kentucky is also among the nation's largest coal producers, alongside Wyoming and West Virginia.Earlier this week when Madon presented the bill to the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, he referenced a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2023 that imposed limits on federal government regulation of wetlands and other bodies of water that aren't connected to larger waterways, Kentucky Lantern reported.\"The effects of this decision was that small, [ephemeral] drains and many wetlands — places that are not really waters but rather are just wet when it rains — are no longer subject to federal permitting. This decision was huge, was a huge win for industries and the private landowners,\" Madon said during his testimony.About 65 percent of Kentucky's streams and rivers are considered ephemeral, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said.And although the Senate's approval is seen as a win for the coal mining industry, environmental experts are concerned about the impacts the decreased regulations could have on the quality of Kentucky's drinking water.What People Are SayingMadon, according to a report from the Kentucky Lantern, said: \"I just think we need to let our coal companies go to work and put our coal miners back to work and let's harvest our coal.\"Kentucky Waterways Alliance Executive Director Michael Washburn told Newsweek: \"There are a number of reasons to be alarmed by this disastrous bill, but I think what is top of mind for Kentucky Waterways Alliance is how SB89 will imperil the drinking water supplies of over a million Kentuckians. That many residents of the Commonwealth get their drinking water from groundwater, and SB89 removes all permitting and protections from our groundwater. That's just one of the reasons we are staunchly opposed to this anti-Kentucky, anti-family, and anti-public health bill. I haven't done an exhaustive search, but I feel safe saying that precisely zero times in human history has industry been granted permission to pollute and then decided not to act on it. SB89 is an attack on the well-being of the state.\"Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Energy and Environment Cabinet, told the Kentucky Lantern in an email: \"We are in the process of reviewing [the bill] and the many impacts it will have on the quality of Kentucky's drinking water, the costs to individual communities and public water departments and the possible effects to public health and the environment.\"Senator Keturah Herron, a Democrat who voted against the bill, said: \"I hope that we can work together to find solutions that are a little bit more narrow that will assist and help the energy, the coal industry but will also make sure that all waters in Kentucky are protected.\"What Happens NextSenate Bill 89 will now appear before the Kentucky House.","summary":"The bill would cut \"unnecessary red tape\" for the coal mining industry if it becomes law, but it first must pass the House.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kentucky-senate-passes-bill-lower-water-pollution-standards-2031636","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589193/coal-industry-kentucky.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 01:03:57","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":290663554,"title":"AOC, Homan clash as border czar suggests lefty Rep could ‘be in trouble’ over webinar advising migrants on dealing with ICE","text":"President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan on Friday clashed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., over a webinar she hosted advising migrants about how to handle an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n“Let’s pray that she is not ‘educating’ the next murderer of a young college nursing student on how to evade arrest by ICE,” Homan told Fox News Digital on Friday. \n\n“How many more young women have to be raped, murdered and burned alive until she wakes up?”\n\nHoman had first said on “The Ingraham Angle” that he had emailed the deputy attorney general asking whether Ocasio-Cortez’s hosting of a “Know Your Rights with ICE” event on her Facebook page could count as an impediment to federal law enforcement.\n\n“Is that impeding our law enforcement efforts?” Homan said. \n\n“If so, what are we going to do about it? Is she crossing the line? So I’m working with the Department of Justice and finding out. Where is that line that they cross? So maybe AOC is going to be in trouble now.”\n\nDuring the event, viewers were informed of how to deal with ICE search requests. \n\nMigrants were also warned of “ruses” they allege ICE agents employ to get people to comply with searches, while the hosts also touted “trends” in how ICE conducts its searches, which have ramped up in recent weeks under the Trump administration. \n\nPeople were also recommended to record such searches and how to differentiate between different warrants ICE agents are likely to carry.\n\nOcasio-Cortez did not take part in the webinar but did upload tips to Instagram — via posters in both English and Spanish — and called on her followers to share the posters widely and study them. \n\nShe also called on her followers to print out the posters and “tape them up in your workplace or keep them by your door.” \n\n“So if ICE comes to your workplace or home, whether you are a citizen or noncitizen – YOU can defend your community and our constitution by exercising your right,” she wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez took to X to mock Homan for suggesting she could be in trouble.\n\n“MaYbe shE’s goiNg to be in TroUble nOw,” she posted.\n\n“Maybe he can learn to read. The Constitution would be a good place to start,” she said.\n\nIn comments to Fox News Digital, Homan said that he was asking the Justice Department for their interpretation of the law regarding impeding and obstruction, and that he is “well aware of the Constitution, but I am also aware that DOJ gives legal interpretations on issues like this to ensure ICE acts in accordance of the law.”\n\nHe then suggested Ocasio-Cortez read Title 8 USC 1324 and 8 USC 1325, “statutes enacted by Congress, of which she is a part of.”\n\n“It’s not OK to be in the U.S. illegally. It’s a violation of federal law to enter this country illegally. It is not OK to assist those in the U.S. illegally in furtherance of their illegal entry and unlawful presence. I thought I educated her on this several years ago during congressional testimony.,” he said, referencing a viral clash from the first Trump administration at a congressional hearing.\n\n“She can call it ‘advising those who are illegally in the U.S. of their constitutional rights.’ But we all know it’s really about evading ICE and how not to get arrested and how not to adhere to a federal judge’s order to leave after receiving due process at great taxpayer expense,” he said.\n\n“She obviously believes that we should not enforce laws enacted by Congress. By working against ICE, she is putting those that committed a crime entering this country illegally and those that committed asylum fraud and those who ignored a federal court order of deportation over those that enforce our laws and risk their lives every day trying to keep our communities safe.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded, telling Fox News Digital: “I am glad Mr. Homan is checking with the Department of Justice to familiarize himself with the limits of his agency’s authority in entering the homes of everyday Americans without a warrant. And I am proud to offer civil education to everyday Americans to ensure ICE’s compliance with the law, given the numerous reports of agents providing incorrect paperwork in their attempts to enter and search private homes.” “Since Mr. Homan seems to be vaguely familiar with U.S. immigration law, we also remind him that according to Congressional statute, becoming undocumented in the United States is a civil offense and not a criminal one. I look forward to continuing our work in ensuring the safety of everyday New Yorkers while keeping families together,” she said.\n\nThe clash comes as many left-wing Democrats continue to raise objections to the mass deportation operation launched by the Trump administration. \n\nHowever, some Democrats have also expressed support, with New York City Mayor Eric Adams meeting with Homan on Thursday and agreeing to let ICE agents on to Rikers Island. \n\nWhile New York City is a “sanctuary” city, Adams has expressed openness to deporting criminal illegal immigrants.\n\nFox News Digital reported earlier on Friday that ICE interior arrests have skyrocketed under the Trump administration compared to the same period during the Biden administration last year, with a 137% increase over last year. \n\nArrests of aliens with criminal histories have soared by nearly 100% from 4,526 in the same period in 2024 to 8,993 under Trump this year. \n\nFox News’ Michael Dorgan contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan clashed with Rep.

The order, which also prohibits the use of \"invented pronouns\" and bans what it describes as “transgender ideology” within the armed forces, marks a significant policy shift.\nArmy Statement on Policy Change\nIn a post on social media platform X, the U.S. Army confirmed the new directive, stating, “The U.S. Army will no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and will stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members.”\nThe statement emphasized that while individuals with gender dysphoria would still be treated with dignity, all gender-affirming medical care for current service members would be indefinitely suspended.\n“Effective immediately, all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for service members are paused,” the Army’s statement read.\nTrump’s Justification for the Ban\nThe executive order, signed on January 27, outlines the administration’s rationale for the policy change. President Trump stated that identifying with a gender different from one’s assigned sex at birth is inconsistent with the discipline and commitment expected from military personnel.\nThe order argues that the presence of transgender individuals in the military could negatively impact military readiness. “A soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life, is crucial to the strength of our armed forces,” the order states.\nA Return to Trump-Era Military Policies\nThis decision reinstates restrictions that were previously lifted under President Barack Obama’s administration in 2016. Trump had initially attempted to reimpose a ban on transgender service members during his first term, but the policy was later reversed under President Joe Biden.\nAt a Republican retreat in Miami, Florida, Trump reiterated his stance, declaring, “To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military.”\nThe announcement has sparked strong reactions from advocacy groups and political leaders, with critics arguing that the ban discriminates against qualified individuals willing to serve their country. Supporters, however, claim it is necessary to maintain military effectiveness and cohesion.\nAlso Read: Justice Department Moves to Drop Corruption Charges Against NYC Mayor Eric Adams","summary":"The United States Army has officially announced new restrictions barring transgender individuals from joining the military, following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/u-s-army-halts-transgender-recruitment-and-gender-affirming-care-following-executive-order/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trans.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 01:00:41","author":"Swastika Sruti","authors":["Swastika Sruti"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":290662506,"title":"Justice Department Moves to Drop Corruption Charges Against NYC Mayor Eric Adams","text":"The U.S. Justice Department has formally requested the dismissal of corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a move that has sparked significant controversy within federal legal circles.\nFederal Prosecutors Resign in Protest\nThe decision, submitted in court filings on Friday, follows allegations that Adams had cultivated a close relationship with former President Donald Trump—an assertion Adams denies.

Click here to watch\n\nIt’s a problem that a former Illinois Governor foresaw more than a decade prior, and tried to warn about.\n\nIn the week after President Donald Trump was sworn into office, immigration agents flooded across the Chicago metro area, making arrests for deportation or removal from the country.\n\nThose arrested include Jefry Estrada-Pastrana, who was arrested in the Chicago area on Jan. 26, according to court records.\n\nEstrada-Pastrana was accused of re-entering the country after he was deported years prior to Honduras.\n\nAccording to an affidavit submitted to the court, ICE agents said the path to Estrada-Pastrana’s arrest started this past November, when he was pulled over by Chicago police for a traffic stop and fingerprinted.\n\nThose fingerprints “were electronically provided to Homeland Security Investigations,” where an analysis was performed and verified Estrada-Pastrana was the same person who was fingerprinted and deported from the United States in 2015.\n\nDespite the Chicago Welcoming City ordinance, and the Illinois Trust Act that are in place to keep local law enforcement from collaborating with federal immigration agents, fingerprints gathered by local police are still leading to arrests like Estrada-Pastrana’s.\n\n“That’s standard operating procedure,” said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.\n\n“For better or worse, there are back channels that do exist that enable ICE to receive information from police authorities, and one such avenue is the Secure Communities program,” Tsao told the I-Team.\n\nThe Secure Communities program was first piloted in 2008 by former President George W. Bush, and it was later expanded in 2011 by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe program provides a direct link for immigration agents into data gathered by local and state law enforcement nationwide, despite any sanctuary city or state policies in place.\n\nThe way in for immigration agents is through the FBI.\n\nSince 1924, when local law enforcement scans a person’s fingerprint, the departments automatically share those fingerprints with the FBI’s Identification Division to check to see if they match suspects wanted on out-of-state warrants, or to learn more about a suspect’s criminal history.\n\nBut in 2008, the Secure Communities program created a pipeline from ICE into the FBI’s database, giving immigration agents unlimited access to the data sent to and collected by the FBI.\n\nWhen the program was expanded in 2011, it led to anger and protests in Chicago and across the nation.\n\nICE officials at the time said they only took action when local fingerprints matched a fingerprint of someone already wanted in their system.\n\n“They had to have a previous record,” said Jon Gurule, an ICE official who helped set up Secure Communities in 2011. “They had to have had previously been arrested by immigration, a previous criminal conviction… They have to have something that their fingerprints are [ICE’s] system already.”\n\nFormer Illinois Governor Pat Quinn had warned of potential problems, and even requested in 2011 that Illinois counties be disconnected from the Secure Communities program.\n\nIn a letter addressed to ICE Director John Morton, dated Aug. 2011 and obtained by the I-Team, Quinn’s General Counsel wrote, “Governor Quinn remains deeply troubled that Secure Communities has the opposite effect of its stated purpose. Rather than making our communities safer, the program’s flawed implementation divides communities and families and makes the people of Illinois less inclined to reach out to law enforcement.”\n\nBut Quinn’s attempt to disconnect Illinois’ data from entering ICE’s hands was unsuccessful.\n\nTsao explained, “Governor Quinn tried to withdraw Illinois from the program, and he was told by the director of ICE at the time that once the jurisdiction is in, you can’t get out.”\n\nAcademic professors who have studied the Secure Communities program told the I-Team the only way to stop the flow of fingerprints would be for law enforcement to stop sending fingerprints to the FBI altogether, a move that’s very unlikely.\n\nAnd since ICE is accessing the data through the FBI, and not going to local or state law enforcement directly, local and state agencies said there is no violation of any local sanctuary ordinances.\n\nABC7 police affairs consultant and former suburban police chief Bill Kushner said it’s out of local law enforcement hands.\n\n“When you arrest somebody… you don’t care what his immigration status is. You’re not going to ask him what his immigration status is,” Kushner said. “He’s fingerprinted, and those prints are sent electronically. Now it comes out that there’s an immigration hold on him? That’s not up to the Chicago police department to enforce.”\n\nFor Jefry Estrada-Pastrana, the magistrate Judge overseeing his case, the Honorable Gabriel Fuentes, ordered him to be released three days after his arrest, as Fuentes concluded Estrada-Pastrana was not a serious flight risk.\n\nThe decision by Judge Fuentes was near identical to a decision made on another recent immigration arrest the ABC7 I-Team covered.\n\nBut ICE detainer records show after he was released, Estrada-Pastrana was immediately arrested again by ICE agents but this time, he was sent to a detention facility in Indiana.\n\nThat is until last week, when Estrada-Pastrana was no longer listed in custody, meaning he was likely either released, or deported to Honduras.\n\nHave a story tip for the ABC7 I-Team?

No, not the one between Donald Trump and Elon Musk – although that is interesting in all kinds of ways – but the one between Musk and his son X, who is four years old.\n\nYoung X, full name X Æ A-Xii, was brought to the Oval Office by his proud father this week.\n\nIntroduced by President Trump as a ‘high IQ individual’, X proved, happily, to be very much a normal four-year-old, with no outward signs of genius. \n\nHe told the President, ‘Excuse me, but I need to pee’, adding, as Trump continued with important state announcements, ‘I want you to shush your mouth’.\n\nHe also picked his nose then wiped his finger on the priceless Resolute desk – all while wearing a thick gold neck chain and long camel coat, like a mini Mafioso.\n\nMusk’s officially sanctioned biographer, Walter Isaacson, says X, one of 12 children of the uber tech guru, has been a non-negotiable part of Musk’s entourage for some time. \n\n‘X had an otherworldly sweetness that calmed and beguiled Musk, who craved his presence. He took X everywhere,’ Isaacson wrote when X was a baby.\n\nAs the boy has grown, that close bond has only deepened. Musk, 53, is convinced that the child is a genius and says his first words were ‘car, rocket and daddy’.\n\nX riding on his father Elon Musk's shoulders in the Oval Office at the White House\n\nThe tech billionaire has been accompanied by his eldest son on countless meetings \n\nX sat on his father’s lap when he was named Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2021, having flown into New York with his dad on his private jet. He’s been to countless meetings and so many rocket launches that Musk jokes he can only count backwards.\n\nHe was there when Musk met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in September 2023 and, in April 2024, X went on a trip to New York with his father to attend a documentary screening.\n\nThe child, then three, attended a late-night after-party at the Lobster Club, where guests sipped cocktails and ate sushi as he wandered around the restaurant in a Tesla T-shirt.\n\nBy the end of last year, X was living with his father in a cottage on the Mar-a-Lago estate in the run-up to Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSince then, according to Musk’s wishes, the little boy has become a part of Trump’s court, too.\n\nThis much was vividly illustrated by a Trump post in December on Truth Social, his social media site, that seemed intended as a private communication to Musk. It ran: ‘Where are you? When are you coming to the “Centre of the Universe” Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates asked to come, tonight. We miss you and x! New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!! DJT.’\n\nThe back story to this relationship, though, is both fascinating and troubling. For X is one of three children born to Musk and Canadian singer Grimes. Real name Claire Elise Boucher, she is the 36-year-old daughter of a criminal prosecutor and banker.\n\nThe two younger children appear to be largely in her custody after an unpleasant legal battle – while Musk has apparently not been willing to part with X, and stands accused of keeping him away from his mother and her family, an allegation he has not responded to.\n\nBut the distance between mother and son was evident when Grimes wrote on social media after her son’s visit to the Oval Office: ‘He should not be in public like this. I did not see this, thank u for alerting me. But I’m glad he was polite. Sigh.’\n\nX and his father Elon with President Trump during an executive order signing in the Oval Office\n\nMusk with Grimes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The pair have three children, although while the two younger children appear to be in her custody, Musk stands accused of keeping X from his mother\n\nWho are Elon Musk's twelve kids? Inside the Tesla CEO's huge brood\n\nIndeed, there are signs of serious conflict between X’s parents, even though legal filings have been sealed for the good of the children. There are also multiple reports which suggest that Musk has been a mostly absent father to his other children. \n\n‘He is not a doting, cuddly father, but he craves the presence of his children,’ Isaacson said. ‘He told me he’s never sadder than when his kids don’t want to hang around him.’\n\nThe death of his son Nevada, by first wife Justine Wilson, from sudden infant death syndrome in 2002, wounded him deeply, as did the decision by his second child, who was born Xavier but transitioned to Vivian, to disown him upon turning 18.\n\nVivian has since said of her father: ‘He was cold, quick to anger… uncaring and narcissistic... he doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there, and in the little time that he was, I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness.’\n\nGrimes was the woman who eased Musk’s heartache after a ‘toxic’ on/off relationship with Johnny Depp’s ex Amber Heard.\n\nX (incidentally, it was Grimes who chose the name) arrived in 2020. At the time, Grimes called her lover ‘a super-interesting goddamn person’.\n\nBut there were inklings of Musk’s radical transformation this year, as he declared ‘pronouns suck’ and said ‘cis’, meaning someone whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth, was a ‘slur’.\n\nGrimes, appalled, wrote: ‘I cannot support hate. Please stop this. I know this isn’t your heart.’\n\nBut it was. Musk started to espouse Right-wing views and fathered more children by a co-worker, without Grimes’s knowledge. In fact, Shivon Zilis, a director of operations at Musk’s Neuralink project, had twins with him via surrogacy in November 2021, a month before his daughter with Grimes, Exa Dark Siderael, was born – also via surrogacy.\n\nWith a lack of feeling you might judge as appalling, he said on Twitter: ‘Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.’ \n\nAt this point, Grimes and Musk had broken up, but the relationship remained ‘fluid’. During an off period in April 2022, Grimes filed a petition to ‘determine parental relationship’ with Musk.\n\nIn another interview that year she remarked that Musk was very close to X. She said: ‘I think E is really seeing him as a protege and bringing him to everything.’\n\nThey finally split within weeks of the birth of their third child, Techno Mechanicus – nicknamed Tau – in 2022.\n\nMusk then sued Grimes to ‘establish a parent-child relationship’ with the three children after he learned the youngest two would not be returning to his home in Texas and that Grimes was keeping them in California. He kept X.\n\nGrimes counter-sued Musk in San Francisco, asking for primary physical custody of all three children. Shortly after that, Grimes publicly pleaded for parental access to X after seeing a photo of Musk with Zilis and their two children. Apparently, she’d only learned of the birth of those children in a report on US news site Business Insider.\n\n‘Tell Elon to let me see my son or (please) respond to my lawyer,’ Grimes wrote on social site X, formerly Twitter, which Musk renamed after he bought it in 2022. \n\nBut son X remained with his father. Indeed, when President Erdogan asked: ‘Where’s his mother?’ Musk replied: ‘She’s back in California. I mostly look after him.’\n\nMusk with his three children leaving Blair House after a meeting. The Tesla founder 'craves' the presence of his children, Musk's biographer Walter Isaacson said\n\nMusk's son X shakes hands with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi while meeting him with his father in Washington\n\nElon Musk's father Errol's heartless claims about death of Tesla founder's baby son\n\nAt an August 2024 hearing to determine custody, Musk said the children were settled in Austin, Texas, and attending school.\n\nGrimes talked about the legal battle in a post on X, saying she hadn’t had time to work on creative projects because ‘the threat of losing ur kids while going bankrupt fighting for them is not very conducive to creative thoughts. I just slept and cried every minute I wasn’t explicitly fighting for my kids during that year,’ she wrote.\n\nShe added: ‘Spent a year locked in battle in a state with terrible mothers’ rights having my instagram posts and modelling used as reasons I shouldn’t have my kids and fighting and detaching from the love of my life as he becomes unrecognizable to me, with a fraction of his resources (or IQ/strategy experience), all the while I didn’t see one of my babies for 5 months.’\n\nJudging by X’s Oval Office outing on Wednesday, she will see more of Elon’s princeling in the months to come – perhaps just not in person.\n\nAdditional reporting: Barbara McMahon\n\nElon MuskDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nThe tragedy behind Elon's special relationship with his Mini-Musk... and why the billionaire's four-year-old son X is a non-negotiable part of his entourage\n\nAdd comment","summary":"You might call it a special relationship.

It's just a shame that the ex islanders pick who goes, I'd be interested to see who got the least public votes. I can't call it'; \n'Been the worst series for dumpings. Should have dumped the bottom two and had the returning islanders choose another. Don't think they should do another all stars after this'; \n'I guess this not a reality show You choose who you give screen time and that’s unfair to others'; 'How about our votes should of dumped a couple from the island? Otherwise what we voting for?' \nElsewhere in the episode, Casey O'Gorman was praised by Love Island viewers as he roasted his fellow islanders.\nDuring the latest ITV2 show, the stars in the South African villa took part in the annual talent show which saw Curtis Pritchard show off his dancing moves, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Elma Pazar display their musical skills and Gabby Allen performing a tap dance routine. \nHowever, it was Casey who stole the show with his ventriloquist act, Salty, as he impersonated his fellow islanders and stirred the pot by bringing up old drama. \nLeaving the islanders in hysterics, he poked fun at Elma and Sammy's nine year age gap and then moved on to Curtis having his head turned for Danielle before going back to Ekin. \nLove Island viewers branded the skit as 'TV gold' as they loved the fact Casey hid behind the 'puppet to express his real feelings'. \n\nElma and Sammy (pictured), Catherine and Omar, and Harriett and Ronnie were revealed to be vulnerable following the public vote\n\nBut fans were all left saying the same thing as they urged producers to ditch the 'pointless' system and let the final decision be made by the public \n\nElsewhere in the episode, Casey O'Gorman was praised by Love Island viewers as he roasted his fellow islanders \n\nDuring the latest ITV2 show, the stars in the South African villa took part in the annual talent show which saw Ekin-Su and Elma Pazar show off their musical skills \nThey wrote: 'Not Casey using the puppet to TERROR the whole villa!; Nah Casey saying Elma used to babysit Sammy is hilarious; I am CRYING ...this is full on tv GOLD, give Casey the crown NOW.'\nDuring the talent show Harriett kicked things off, wowing as a cheerleader with her acrobatic display, with viewers impressed with her signature move - the splits.\nNext up was Omar who inexplicably donned a cowboy hat to show off some balloon art.

He is going back to India to face justice.”A joint statement following the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump emphasised the need for Pakistan to ensure that its territory is not used for cross-border terrorism.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to combating global terrorism and eliminating terrorist safe havens. They pledged to strengthen cooperation against terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba to prevent future attacks like the 26/11 Mumbai massacre. The statement also referenced the August 26, 2021, Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan.Additionally, Modi and Trump committed to working together to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, ensuring such capabilities do not fall into the hands of terrorists or non-state actors.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JOANNA CRAWLEY FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:19 GMT, 15 February 2025 |Updated:00:46 GMT, 15 February 2025 \n\nA brand new reality show plans to see how nepo babies cope on a desert island without the trappings of fame.\nAccording to telly insiders, the Channel 4 show, titled Nepo Island, is hoping to sign up Amanda Holden and her model daughter Lexi, 19, as well as Radio 2 star Vernon Kay and his eldest Phoebe, 20 and Spice Girl Mel B and her daughter Phoenix Brown, 25.\nA source has explained of the show format: 'Stars and their kids will be flown over to an island where they will be separated.\n'The parents will be watching how their kids cope and will be setting tasks,' with the insider adding to The Sun that the show hopes to prove 'these kids don't need their famous parents to do well'.\nAmanda has previously been outspoken about her kids appearing on TV, insisting that she had banned Lexi from Love Island.\nSpeaking in 2023 the TV personality, 52, declared she doesn't want the model 'anywhere near' the ITV2 dating show despite admitting that Lexi is 'obsessed' with the series.\n\nA new reality show plans to see how nepo babies cope on a desert island without the trappings of fame. The Channel 4 show is hoping to sign up Amanda Holden and her daughter Lexi, 19\n\nRadio 2 star Vernon Kay and his eldest Phoebe, 20, are also on Channel 4's radar for Nepo Island\nSpeaking on her Heart Radio Breakfast Show, Amanda said: 'It's just another way of being famous, isn't it really? It's not really about love. It's just about looking hot and just getting involved.'\nAmanda previously explained how she and her husband Chris Hughes insisted Lexi finished her education before embarking on her modelling career.\nLast year the proud mother revealed Lexi had passed her A-Levels, landing her a spot at her first choice of university.\nAmanda made sure to take the teenager out for a celebratory meal when it emerged that she had been successful in her exams.\nShe wrote on Instagram: 'Congratulations to our @lexi.hughes__ we couldn't be prouder. All the grades and 1st choice uni what a bl**dy relief.'\nThe former Wild At Heart actress - who has been married to Chris Hughes since 2008 and also has Hollie, 12, with him - also shared a photo of an emotional Lexi in front of a cake that read 'Lexi congratulations' and 'OMG I did it!'. \nVernon Kay's daughter Phoebe, who he shares with Strictly presenter Tess Daly has frequently been spotted at glamorous events with her famous parents in recent months as she makes a name for herself in the industry.\nSince turning 18, Phoebe has started creeping into the public eye, making her red carpet debut alongside her father at the John Wick Chapter 4 premiere last March.\n\nSpice Girl Mel B and her daughter Phoenix Brown, 25, are also names in the frame. A source has explained: 'Stars and their kids will be flown over to an island where they will be separated.\n\nAmanda has previously been outspoken about her kids appearing on TV, insisting that she had banned Lexi from Love Island \nWhile TV presenter Vernon was on hand to support his daughter, he previously revealed that he and Tess insist his children don't live off their fame and must form 'their own careers.'\nIt's an important factor for the celebrity duo, who both fell into fame after being scouted as models and then turning to television.\nSpeaking to MailOnline in 2022, Vernon said he and his wife believe it's important for their offspring 'to find themselves' and not be given their 'life on a plate', crediting the pair's Northern backgrounds for shaping their parenting beliefs.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNepo baby island!

His remarks, as well as support for tariffs on Canadian imports, have strained relations with Washington's neighbor to the north.What to KnowMay, who leads the Canadian Green Party, suggested at a press conference in January that those three states could become Canadian provinces, rather than Canada becoming part of the U.S. She said the three states, all of which are viewed as safely Democratic, would receive universal health care and stricter gun laws.\"Hey, Donald, have we got a deal for you? You think we want to be the 51st state huh? But maybe California would like to be the 11th province. How about it? California? Oregon? Washington?\" she said.Although such a change would be highly unlikely to actually happen, the proposal would have the support of 35 percent of Canadians, according to a new poll from YouGov, which surveyed 1,030 Canadian adults from January 22 to January 28 but was published on Friday.Residents of British Columbia, the province located directly north of Washington, were more likely than not to support the proposal—43 percent said they'd support letting the three states join, compared to 41 percent who opposed the idea.Quebec residents were the least likely to support the proposal, with only 25 percent backing it.Americans, including residents of those states, were less likely to back the proposal. Twenty-three percent of Americans said they'd support those three states joining Canada, compared to 29 percent of people who live in the three states.Among Americans, the idea wasn't polarized on partisan lines. Twenty-seven percent of those who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris supported it, while 26 percent of Trump voters said they'd support those three states joining Canada.What People Are SayingCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during a press conference on Wednesday: \"Let's be very clear. Conversations around the 51st state are a nonstarter. It's never going to happen. But we have to take seriously what the president is saying and fold that into our thinking as we continue to stand up for Canada.\"Trump, during a press conference on Thursday: \"Canada, their taxes would come down greatly. Their security would go up greatly. Amazing things happened to Canada. Why would we pay $200 billion a year in subsidies to Canada when they're not a state? You do that for a state, but you don't do that for somebody else's country.\"What Happens NextWhile most experts cast doubt that borders will change between the countries either way during the foreseeable future, relations between the two countries are likely to remain chilled amid tariff threats.Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel last weekend, though the 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian imports went on a 30-day pause starting February 3.","summary":"Americans were less supportive of the three states joining Canada, according to the YouGov poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/canadian-accepting-three-states-poll-2031663","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589157/35-percent-canadians-support-3-states-joining.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:44:19","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":290661856,"title":"Why a political earthquake will hit Germany next week: A failing economy, creaking infrastructure and an asylum seeker's horrifying attack. ROBERT HARDMAN beholds the AfD's growing momentum","text":"The hideous news breaks as I am walking through the snow in the small town of Furstenwalde in what used to be East Germany. \n\nYet another asylum seeker has just launched a deranged attack out of nowhere on innocent members of the public.\n\nThis time, the horror is unfolding in Munich, where 28 people have been injured, some critically, by a car crashing into a modest trade union demonstration near the main station.\n\nMercifully, no one has been killed outright but a small child is among those in a critical condition, having sustained life-changing injuries.\n\nIn next to no time, it emerges that the driver was a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, already well-known to the police. \n\nIn other words, Thursday’s outrage represents yet another disturbing failure in Germany’s grip on its growing population of asylum seekers and migrants.\n\nYet what I find so striking here in Furstenwalde is the lack of shock. There is visceral anger.\n\nBut no one seems unduly surprised. As in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, the response is not so much ‘How on earth?’ as ‘Not again?’\n\nRight now, the only thing which will actually shock the people I have met in Germany this week is if there is not a thumping, record-breaking surge towards the Hard-Right in next Sunday’s German general election.\n\n‘You see – it has happened again,’ says Florian Wiese, pointing to the breaking news on the television in his insurance office on the main road running through Furstenwalde. \n\nIt only reinforces his view that the hard-Right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party will sweep the board in this part of Germany come polling day.\n\nNo one expects them to end up in government (not this time, at least) with the centre-Right Christian Democrats (CDU) as favourites to lead some sort of coalition. \n\nBut it’s highly likely that they will come a comfortable second and they have their sights fixed on the election after that (even if they are not singing ‘Tomorrow Belongs To Me’ quite yet).\n\nFlorian’s colleague, Guido Hornig, offers one explanation of sorts: ‘We used to have a lovely country. But now people won’t walk through the centre of this town after 8pm because they feel it is too dangerous.’\n\nFurstenwalde has a five-storey block of flats on the edge of town which is home to an unspecified number of asylum seekers. \n\nHalf a mile away, an existing accommodation centre is being renovated and will soon house 750 more.\n\nEach fluchtlingsheim (refugee home) has fences and cameras to monitor those going in and out (media are not allowed). However, the asylum seekers come and go freely, mainly in the evenings.\n\nEvery local offers a story of petty crime or noisy gangs gathering round the station. \n\nSome gangs emanate from neighbouring Petersdorf where a small village of 500 residents has just seen its population double with the addition of a new complex for 200 asylum seekers bolted on to the former East German army barracks housing 300. \n\nWhat has enraged the locals has been the tactics of the state and federal authorities. It is not just that residents were not consulted. \n\nWhat also rankles is the fact that the contracts for these substantial building projects were handed to outside workers for fear of plans leaking out.\n\nHere in the former East Germany, that stirs up old memories.\n\n‘The state always used to tell you what to think and to be quiet,’ Petersdorf pensioner Margit Wunderich tells me. ‘Well, now this is a democracy and the AfD is the only party that represents us. \n\nWe have criminals we cannot deport and all these people are sending the money they get to Africa. Well, we have an identity too and we are not going to go on feeling guilty about the Second World War.’\n\nLike almost everyone I talk to in these parts, she points to a pivotal moment when she thinks the old Germany began its decline from the confident, solid society of yesteryear to today’s fractious bundle of insecurities: the late summer of 2015 when former chancellor Angela Merkel opened the country to more than a million migrants and refugees poured across Europe’s eastern borders.\n\nTen years on, that historic humanitarian gesture – for which Merkel was lauded across the West – has set the agenda which will shape the next German government.\n\nThe fragile state of Germany’s once-mighty economy is clearly a major factor, too. Having relied for so long on cheap Russian gas and a global appetite for their petrol-powered cars, Germans suddenly find the world has moved on.\n\nInfrastructure is creaking, be it the roads, trains or internet access, while one national obsession remains as healthy as ever: bureaucracy. \n\nYet all the opinion polls are clear that immigration is the number-one issue in this election – and that was before Thursday’s outrage in Munich.\n\nThis week’s car attack is horribly reminiscent of the carnage five days before Christmas in Magdeburg, where a former Saudi refugee, granted asylum in 2016, drove a Mercedes into a Christmas market, killing six and injuring 300. \n\nI arrived there hours later to find a town in mourning and, yes, shock – but not total surprise.\n\nLess than a month ago, in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, another (Afghan) asylum seeker wielding a knife attacked a party of children in a park in scenes reminiscent of last summer’s Southport atrocity. \n\nA child and an adult lay dead, with many injured. The suspect should have been deported months earlier but for a series of bureaucratic blunders.\n\nI visited that shattered town this week to find mounds of candles and flowers at either end of the park – but no answers.\n\nAfter those murders, the CDU proposed plans to close the borders to new asylum seekers. It passed narrowly but only with help from the votes of AfD MPs. \n\nOther parties accused the CDU of tearing up the long-standing ‘firewall’, a hallowed convention whereby all parties refuse to work with the AfD on anything. \n\nTwo days later, those other parties, aided by CDU rebels, narrowly defeated the same plans.\n\nAt least everyone can agree on one thing. This campaign is breaking the mould. \n\nA German national election is traditionally a dull, complex and earnest exercise in number-crunching. \n\nThis one is anything but. ‘I have been fighting elections since 1999 and there has never been one like this,’ says Lisa Paus, a Green Party MP and minister for family affairs in the last coalition government. \n\n‘We are facing huge challenges and that is difficult for the German angst.’ (When Germans talk of ‘angst’, they mean a sense of dread and anxiety).\n\nI meet Ms Paus at a hustings in the capital, Berlin, before a packed conference hall of business people. \n\nUp on stage, the most interesting thing about this evening is the figure standing on the far right – in every sense. Beatrix von Storch, 53, is a former banker, a lawyer and an aristocrat (a granddaughter of a Grand Duke, she is technically ‘Her Highness’ and is distantly related to the Royal Family). \n\nYet for many years, she would find herself shunned in polite society. That is because she has been deputy leader of the AfD for ten years, and one of its MPs for the last eight.\n\nTonight, she stands alongside six candidates from the other main parties, all of which have sworn to have no dealings with a party still designated a ‘suspected extremist’ organisation by Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (which thus has formal powers to monitor its activities, including the use of informants and wire-taps).\n\nFor all its slick branding and TikTok appeals to a growing youth base, the AfD is still dogged by charges of anti-Semitism and furtive neo-Nazi inclinations among some members.\n\nLast year, party co-founder Bjorn Hocke was fined for using a favourite Nazi warcry – ‘Everything for Germany!’ – at a public rally, having been fined for the very same thing in 2021.\n\nYet this audience of business executives treats Mrs von Storch with the same respect which they accord to the rest. \n\nThere is even applause for some of her remarks, such as her accusations that the ‘crazy’ energy policies of the Greens have caused German infrastructure to ‘fall apart’.\n\n‘People might hate us but what is changing is that they know they can’t ignore us,’ she tells me afterwards. ‘It’s step by step. In the beginning, they said we would disappear but we did not. \n\nIt will take a while but, in the end, we will end up like all the other Right-wing populist parties in Europe who also fought back.’\n\nShe points to the political landscape in Italy, France and Holland, and observes that this very week her party’s leader, Alice Weidel, has received an official welcome from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. \n\nThe most high-profile endorsement has been that of Elon Musk, Donald Trump’s billionaire efficiency tsar, who has declared ‘only the AfD can save Germany’, before appearing on screen at the party’s campaign launch.\n\nHowever, I cannot help noticing that Mrs von Storch is the only candidate at this debate followed everywhere by two beefy bodyguards with earpieces. \n\nThey are not party heavies but have been assigned to her by the state. ‘It always feels better when they are around,’ she says. It’s a reminder of the simmering tensions running through this election.\n\nEarly the next morning, I watch the AfD’s candidate in the Pankow district of Berlin, Ronald Glaser, handing out leaflets to commuters at his local station. \n\nHe tells me that his campaign vehicle was torched in last summer’s European election and that his office only avoided a similar fate because it is next to a fire station. Recently, his windows have been smashed again.\n\nHowever, he is in a buoyant mood, noting that opinion polls for this seat, a comfortable Green stronghold for years, have him firmly in the lead, propelled by local opposition to yet another migrant complex going up down the road.\n\n‘The interesting change is in schools,’ he says. ‘Students used to be very Left-wing. Now a lot of them ask for our pencils and stickers. \n\nMaybe they are trying to annoy their teachers!’ Even implicit association with the AfD has risks. The Dresden office of the CDU was attacked following the breach of the ‘firewall’ convention.\n\nThat episode is seen as yet another step on the AfD’s long path to some sort of acceptability, even if the CDU insists it is nothing of the sort. ‘We haven’t done anything. \n\nThere was no cooperation with the AfD,’ says MP Dr Marcus Reichel, whose office was attacked. ‘The AfD just approved a good motion from us and that was it.’\n\nDr Raphael Bosson, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, suspects it is a sign of things to come. \n\n‘I think you will have a categorical denial from the CDU that there will be any deal but then there will be this constant shadow of the AfD saying: “You can’t stop us voting with you.” And then it becomes normalised.’\n\nI travel to the city of Erfurt, which the AfD actually won in the last regional elections. It is also home to Europe’s oldest synagogue. It is now a museum, while the 800-strong Jewish population meet in a post-war synagogue nearby.\n\nThe AfD’s vocal warnings about Islamic fundamentalism and its recent support for Israel in its war with Hamas cut no ice with community leader and Holocaust survivor Professor Reinhard Schramm. \n\n‘Those who are anti-Muslim today will be anti-Jewish tomorrow,’ he says. ‘The AfD is a danger to society, not just Jews.’\n\nHe is also very critical of some on the Far-Left, notably Sahra Wagenknecht, leader of the new BSW party. Formerly of the socialist Die Linke party, she is pro-Russia, anti-Ukraine war, anti-Israel and takes a Corbynite view on the economy. \n\nHer hard line on immigration, however, sounds a similar tune to that of the AfD.\n\nI drop in on her rally in Erfurt. Trim, smartly dressed and eloquent, she delivers a passionate, note-free denunciation of further military involvement in Ukraine to a packed house, several of them in Palestinian keffiyehs.\n\nA year ago, some wondered whether her anti-immigration stance would dilute the appeal of the AfD. Now, the general sense is that she may struggle to cross the 5 per cent threshold to win any seats in Parliament.\n\nIt is the AfD which has the momentum. Beneath the grand cathedral in the former East German city of Halle, I talk to Lena Martini, 27, who is shopping with engineer husband, Jason, and their two small boys. \n\nShe works in recruitment, has lived abroad for years (including a spell studying in Manchester) and speaks perfect English. \n\nA worldly, educated professional, she should surely be a prime target for the centre-Left SPD or the centre-Right CDU? Her response speaks volumes.\n\n‘I don’t know who to vote for. The price of everything is going crazy and no one is offering much hope,’ she says. ‘I know a lot of people who are picking the AfD and some of their points are cool. It’s rubbish to say they are Nazis.\n\n‘I am not someone who is racist but I have lived in a lot of countries and I just don’t feel safe here now. \n\n'Why is it that I don’t feel safe at a Christmas market? But everywhere we find gangs of people who don’t speak German and that makes me uncomfortable.’\n\nBack in Aschaffenburg, amid the candles and teddy bears in memory of that poor murdered two-year-old, support for the AfD may be more muted. \n\nThis is prosperous West Germany, just an hour from Frankfurt’s banking district. ‘I hope the AfD don’t get a majority,’ says pensioner Elfriede Reck. ‘But it’s the politicians who caused this. \n\n'Officials knew about that killer before he did it, yet two people had to die before anything happened.’\n\nNow, they are saying exactly the same in Munich this weekend. Germany’s political class has not felt this nervous in living memory.","summary":"ROBERT HARDMAN: Yet another asylum seeker has just launched a deranged attack out of nowhere on innocent members of the public.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14399397/Germany-economy-asylum-seekers-ROBERT-HARDMAM.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/20/95230645-0-image-m-34_1739566423438.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:43:47","author":"Editor,Robert Hardman","authors":["Editor","Robert Hardman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.613},{"id":290663520,"title":"Yellowjackets co-stars Kevin Alves and Alexa Barajas confirm romance with a Valentine's Day red carpet debut","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Feb 15th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRob Burrows' wife reveals the devastating moment her former Rugby star husband gave her a sign he couldn't go on as she held him in his final moments hours after watching their wedding video together one last time\n\nHorror as female tourist's hands are bitten off by shark yards from Caribbean beach after she 'tried to engage the 6ft predator to take a picture'\n\nDonald Trump says Sir Keir Starmer demanded a meeting... but says he isn't sure what they'll talk about\n\nLiam Payne asked me to be his best man.

Are there no depths to which Hermer would not stoop if he eyed an opportunity to lambast the British State?\n\nEvery criminal, every murderer, every terrorist is, of course, entitled to legal representation – that is a vital hallmark of a civilised society.\n\nBut what becomes unacceptable is when the lawyers who repeatedly keep this kind of company in their professional lives then become a linchpin of the Government.\n\nAs we have set out many times before, this kind of pernicious clientele formed a mainstay of Hermer's career at the Bar.\n\nHis Left-wing worldview poses a liability to the British people and he is unfit for high office.\n\nThe Prime Minister's judgment is brought further into question with every day he permits Hermer to remain within the corridors of power.\n\nTime to bite the bullet\n\nThe President of the United States, the secretary general of Nato and the EU president have spoken in chorus: European defence spending must increase.\n\nTo their shame, those not yet fully subscribed to this inescapably correct position include a range of European leaders and our own Prime Minister.\n\nLabour is nowhere near setting out a timescale for its manifesto commitment to spend 2.5 per cent of GDP on our military, and yet is already facing calls for double that amount from an ebullient Donald Trump.\n\nAt the same time there appears, thankfully, to be serious talk about ending the war in Ukraine. Once that highly challenging negotiation is complete, the peace that – hopefully – follows will present equally difficult military challenges.\n\nAs Boris Johnson sets out in these pages today, it is time for Europe to 'step up' and ensure Ukraine is impregnable to further attack. Europe and the UK can no longer expect a blank cheque from Mr Trump's White House – and nor should we.\n\nOne of the main reasons, if not the main reason, why Britain voted to leave the EU was to be the captain of our own destiny.\n\nThat was not just in relation to matters such as immigration, even though that is a critical issue as correctly identified by US Vice President JD Vance yesterday.\n\nIt was so we could live up to the greatest achievements of our past and lead from the front. Despite the straitened economic landscape, the Government must find a way to boost our defence spending.\n\nSolutions are there to be had. Cancel the disastrous and costly Chagos Islands deal. Ensure some of the new defence spending is with US firms, to help alleviate Mr Trump's threat of tariffs. Slash the bloated foreign aid budget, Whitehall bureaucracy and the gargantuan benefits bill.\n\nThe time for action is now.","summary":"DAILY MAIL COMMENT: The disclosure that Lord Hermer advocated for a 9/11 terror suspect in a battle against the British authorities is enough to rouse even the most jaded observer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14399789/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Hermer-9-11-terror-case.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95234201-0-image-m-93_1739574263979.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:41:38","author":"Daily,Editor","authors":["Daily","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":290663510,"title":"Fatal mistake from air traffic control that may have led to Black Hawk helicopter crashing into DC plane","text":"The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair with an American Airlines jet may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, investigators said on Friday.\n\nThe crew on board the chopper may also not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers to move behind the plane. \n\nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the soldiers without understanding how it should shift position just before the January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were killed.\n\n'That transmission was interrupted - it was stepped on,' she said, leaving them unable to hear the words 'pass behind the' because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment.\n\n'At 8:47:42 - or 17 seconds before impact - a radio transmission from the tower was audible on both CVRs directing the Black Hawk to pass behind the CRJ,' Homendy told reporters.\n\n'CVR data from the Black Hawk indicated that the portion of the transmission that stated 'pass behind the' may not have been received by the Black Hawk crew.'\n\nHomendy said the helicopter was on a 'check' flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. \n\nInvestigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight and that there was nothing to suggest that the crew had removed them.\n\nShe said that testing was underway to establish what both crews were able to see at the time of the collision. \n\nShortly before the collision, a controller got an alert that the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. \n\nThe military pilot said yes and asked for 'visual separation' with the jet - allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn't see the plane. Controllers approved the request.\n\nRoughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.\n\nSince the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board has recovered all the flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac. \n\nLast week it was revealed how vital tracking technology inside the helicopter was turned off for 'no compelling reason' when it collided.\n\nThe Black Hawk was performing a routine training mission in an effort to renew 28-year-old Captain Rebecca M. Lobach's annual certification.\n\nWhen the chopper went down, the Black Hawk's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast was disabled - a system which shares an aircraft's position, altitude and speed, Sen. Ted Cruz told the New York Times.\n\nThe technology also includes a display that shows pilots the location of other aircrafts both in the sky or on a runway, and allows air traffic controllers to not just rely on radar tracking - which could have a delay of a few seconds.\n\nMilitary helicopters can turn off the ADS-B during 'continuity of government' missions so that nobody can track where government officials are being flown.\n\nIt will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being probed.\n\n'We're only a couple weeks out,' from the crash, she said. 'We have a lot of work to do.' \n\nLast week the Federal Aviation Administration revealed how it is set to reduce the number of arrivals at Washington Reagan National Airport in DC, following the deadly accident. \n\nThe FAA said there would be reduction from a maximum of 28 to 26 arrivals per hour would reduce future risks - but would also increase average delays from 40 minutes to 50 minutes. \n\nAn email explained how investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board 'have expressed concern for our tower personnel on duty, who have an increased level of stress while also having a front row view of the accident recovery.'\n\nThe email added that reducing the rate from 28 to 26 'will reduce risk and allow a little space for extra coordination.'\n\nChris Rocheleau was appointed as acting head of the FAA by Donald Trump the morning after the disaster - and on January 30, the President signed a memorandum in the Oval Office, ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety.\n\nReagan National Airport is notoriously crowded, and the crossover in the air space between jets and helicopters is routine - but has caused pilots issues for decades. \n\nBut since the catastrophe, aviation experts have sounded the alarm over the dangerous airspace over Reagan International Airport as they described last week's American Airlines crash as a 'disaster waiting to happen.' \n\nData from the FAA found there were over 30 reports of 'near-midair collisions' over the airport as far back as 1987, with at least 10 involving military aircraft, according to NPR. \n\nThe collision was he deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.\n\nThe collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for that location.\n\nCockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter's pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot saying it was 400 feet. \n\n'We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,' she said.\n\nThat generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters - one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. \n\nHelicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter's black box captures its radio altitude.\n\nThe radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at 278 feet, Homendy said.\n\n'But I want to caution, that does not mean that's what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit,' she said. 'We are seeing conflicting information in the data.'\n\nThe Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced, and accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation's capital.\n\nInvestigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet's flight recorder showed a change in its angle, though they did not say whether that indicated the pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash. \n\nAside from Captain Lobach of Durham, North Carolina; the other two crew members on the chopper were Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O'Hara was the crew chief and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.\n\nLobach's friends and fellow soldiers called her deeply meticulous, 'brilliant and fearless.'\n\nThe American Airlines jet, which was flying from Wichita, Kansas, and preparing to land at the time of the crash, was piloted by 34-year-old Jonathan Campos, whose relatives said had dreamed of flying since he was 3.\n\nThe passenger plane recorded its altitude at 313 feet two seconds before collision.\n\nA few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach. \n\nThe jet's passengers ranged from a group of hunters to students and parents from northern Virginia schools to members of the Skating Club of Boston. \n\nThey were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.\n\nAlmost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump publicly faulted the helicopter for flying too high. \n\nHe also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. \n\nWhen pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, Trump placed the blame on what he called an 'obsolete' air traffic control system.","summary":"Investigators believe the Army helicopter crew involved in the midair collision near Washington, DC may have had inaccurate altitude readings and missed key air traffic control directions.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14399657/Fatal-mistake-air-traffic-control-Black-Hawk-helicopter-crash.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95232247-0-image-a-26_1739576184828.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/30/8422155181228932630/1024x576_MP4_8422155181228932630.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:38:57","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.606},{"id":290660592,"title":"Rebellion at Trump's DOJ Over Eric Adams Cheered by Conservative Attorney","text":"President Donald Trump's Department of Justice (DOJ) is grappling with mass resignations following the department's push to drop New York City Mayor Eric Adams' corruption case, and the rebellion is being cheered by conservative attorney Ed Whelan.Why It MattersEarlier this week, the DOJ moved to drop bribery charges brought against Adams last year, citing concerns that the ongoing case was compromising the Democratic mayor's ability to assist the Trump administration with its crackdown on illegal immigration and November's mayoral election.The move caused fierce criticism by some who saw it as a quid pro quo, as acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon and several other DOJ officials have resigned, refusing to comply with the DOJ's order to dismiss Adams' charges.Adams denied allegations of a quid pro quo in a Fox & Friends interview alongside Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Friday, calling them \"silly.\" The mayor also reiterated his support for going after \"dangerous people\" on the streets of New York City, which he said he's been talking about since 2022. The DOJ has also denied offering a dismissal of criminal charges for Adams' help with immigration enforcement.Newsweek reached out to the DOJ via online form for comment on Friday.What To KnowHagan Scotten, lead prosecutor in Adams' corruption case, was among those who quit following the DOJ's order, and he did not hold back in his resignation letter sent on Friday.\"Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way,\" Scotten, assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, wrote.He added: \"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to me.\"Whelan, a distinguished senior fellow and Antonin Scalia chair in constitutional studies at the Ethics & Public Policy Center, wrote in the National Review on Friday that Scotten \"should get a prize for Awesome Resignation Letter.\"Who Is Scotten?Scotten is a Harvard Law School graduate. He was awarded two bronze stars as a troop commander while serving in Iraq. He has also handled several high-profile corruption cases in New York, including against three associates of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and against Bishop Lamor Whitehead. Scotten was also previously a clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts.Details of Adams' CaseAdams was indicted in September on charges of bribery, fraud and illegal solicitation of campaign contributions, dating to his days as Brooklyn Borough president, a position he was elected to in 2014. He was accused of accepting more than $100,000 in luxury travel gifts and campaign contributions from foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish official, as well as pressuring the New York City Fire Department to open a consulate in New York without a fire inspection. Adams has denied all allegations leveled against him.What People Are SayingEric Columbus, former senior counsel to the deputy attorney general for the administration of former President Barack Obama, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday: \"This is an incredible resignation letter from SDNY prosecutor Hagan Scotten. It's the type of thing you show your kids as an example of how to be.\"What Happens NextReuters reported on Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter, that federal prosecutor Ed Sullivan agreed to dismiss the charges against Adams to spare his colleagues from potentially being fired for refusing to obey the DOJ's order.","summary":"Ed Whelan said on Friday that federal prosecutor Hagan Scotten had an \"awesome\" resignation letter.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/eric-adams-doj-resignation-letter-hagan-scotten-2031640","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589145/eric-adams.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:38:05","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.172},{"id":290661362,"title":"India, US to review laws on transfer of military technology","text":"India and the US on Friday agreed to review their laws to allow the transfer of military technology to India and also widen ties in the fields of space, artificial intelligence and semi-conductors.The details of the talks between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington DC were shared in a joint statement.

She should stay solid with Philly, that's where she's from,' one fan told DailyMail.com at Friday's Super Bowl parade.\n\nHowever, he did show some sympathy admitting that the songstress isn't the only one to feel the wrath of the omni-passionate Philadelphia fans. \n\nPhiladelphia Eagles fans labeled Taylor Swift a 'traitor' as they explained why they booed her\n\nSwift was viscerally booed in New Orleans when she appeared on screen at the Superdome\n\nEagles fans boo Philadelphia mayor off the stage with brutal chant during Super Bowl parade\n\n'I don't know if she necessarily deserved it but at the same time it just happens, I mean Eagles fans boo their own players when they're doing bad,' he added.\n\n'It's not necessarily a whole thing about her. It just had to be expected, she was an Eagles fan and then she traded that in to go with the Chiefs. You can't expect anything less. I don't think it was anything personal, it just happened to be about the team she was rooting for that day.'\n\nAnother woman agreed, claiming the incident was a repercussion of betraying Philadelphia.\n\n'She switched over, so I feel like she deserved the boos just as little bit. No hard feelings though, we still love you Taylor,' she said.\n\nPresident Trump, who has a longstanding hatred of the 14-time Grammy Award winner, had reveled in the booing, twisting the knife on Truth Social where he claimed the taunting had sent her fleeing from Caesars Superdome.\n\nWhile Trump's jab was unfounded - Swift in fact stayed for every depressing minute of the Chiefs' nightmare - a group of young men warned that she may not have survived the in-stadium attack if it had come at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\n'She deserved it even more,' they said. 'If she came to Philly, she'd get booed out of the stadium.'\n\nMeanwhile, others insisted that Swift wasn't a special case. She was just another victim of the intense Philadelphia fan culture.\n\nThe booing from the fans was particularly brutal for Swift given she has Philadelphia roots\n\n'Here's the deal, we boo everybody,' one man explained to DailyMail.com. 'And the fact of the matter is she was with her boyfriend Travis Kelce who's a Chiefs player, so she's affiliated with the Chiefs.'\n\nHis wife claimed that the 'I Can Do It With A Broken Heart' singer would have shaken it off by now - despite DailyMail.com's report that the booing broke Kelce's heart.\n\n'I think she knew what she was getting herself into to be honest. She's so strong willed, she didn't care,' she chimed in.\n\nA handful appeared to defend both Swift and their own fanbase, pointing the finger at someone else entirely.\n\n'I don't think it was her fault; I think it was the NFL's fault because they're the ones who put her on the camera. She's just there supporting her boyfriend,' one man told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I feel it's not necessary. It's this new station that puts her on the screen. That's not her fault,' another young woman agreed.\n\nCJ Gardner-Johnson mocked Swift and her fans with his outfit at the Super Bowl parade\n\n'But I think it was fair fun that she's rooting for the other team, so they're going to boo. They would have moved anyone's girlfriend.\n\n'It's not nice, but it's football, not singing. It's like when people ask him [Kelce] questions about Taylor Swift, like 'are you gonna propose?' No, this is about football. Leave that out. She's taking away from football.'\n\nWhile Swift may not have been in the direct firing line during the Eagles' Super Bowl parade Friday, her fans were.\n\nCJ Gardner-Johnson mocked Swifties with a custom-made sweatshirt worn on a wild day with the words: 'Swifties can LIX my balls'.\n\nLIX are the roman numerals for the number 59, which was the number of the recent Super Bowl that the Eagles won. It follows his taunting of Kelce, which sparked a war with the singer's loyal fanbase.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\n'Traitor' Taylor Swift deserved Super Bowl boos, say Eagles fans... who warn singer it could have been worse\n\nAdd comment","summary":"ISABEL BALDWIN IN PHILADELPHIA: Swift had a miserable evening in New Orleans, not only having to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Chiefs lose but also getting booed by the fans.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14399819/Taylor-Swift-deserved-Super-Bowl-boos-Eagles-fans.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95234889-0-image-m-44_1739576434215.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:34:32","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":290662102,"title":"Letters: Could houseboats be a homelessness solution?","text":"Could houseboats be\nhomelessness solution?\n\nI was walking near Horatio’s restaurant at the marina in San Leandro and saw the work being done to clear the structures in the water. I thought, “What a great place to have houseboats.” Then I thought what a great place to have houseboats for the homeless. There are dozens of berths that are basically unusable for sailboats and other boats because of shallow water, but perfect for houseboats.\n\nSo how about it Alameda County? Houseboats for the homeless?\n\nSan Leandro\n\nBurden of groundwater\ncost should be shared\n\nRe: “Fears rise as farmland values sink” (Page A1, Jan. 28).\n\nThe Jan. 28 article raises the issue of the cost of groundwater for farmers due to “California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.” Groundwater has become very expensive.\n\nGroundwater has been mined like there’s no tomorrow. The major fault is climate change. This is the underlying reason for the problem. The state has tried to mitigate the damage to the aquifers with the Sustainable Groundwater Act. This should have been made clear in the article from the start, not buried many paragraphs later.\n\nIt is good to raise the issue, however. Farmers need financial help. The costs should be shared across the state. We all need the food the farmers produce.\n\nLouise Neal\n\nAuthoritarian drift\nanimates opponents\n\nTo Trump supporters who wonder why his opposition is so upset, an explanation:\n\nThe president of the United States has one job as stated in the oath he took: “to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” The Constitution says that it is Congress’s job to make the laws and provide a budget. It is the president’s job to see that laws are carried out — all of them, not just the ones he likes. So when a president decides not to abide by some laws, it goes against the Constitution he swore to protect. It is the job of the judiciary to decide which laws and actions are illegal. Several federal judges have said that some of the president’s actions are illegal.\n\nPlainly put, if a president doesn’t follow the law, then he is a dictator. We don’t want a dictator, and that’s why we’re upset.\n\nJudy Hammon\n\nVote for leaders who\nprioritize equality\n\n Before working at NUMMI, the only time as a woman my pay was truly on par with my male peers was when I worked in a union job for General Motors. This disparity underscores a larger issue — women and minorities still face systemic barriers to financial equality in the workplace.\n\nWhen Toyota applied for and received Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE) status, it transformed the hiring and promotion landscape for all races and genders. Suddenly, there was a noticeable shift — opportunities were opening up for those who had previously been overlooked. However, now that Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives are being unjustly scapegoated, what will happen to the progress that was made?\n\nVote for policies and leaders who prioritize equal opportunity for all.\n\nKaren Moore\n\nDemocrats make\nmost of limited hand\n\nRe: “When will Democrat voters wake up?” (Page A6, Feb. 7).\n\nWith Republican majorities in Congress and the Supreme Court, Democrats have limited options to oppose the hostile takeover by Elon Musk and his youthful cyber mob at the behest of Donald Trump. They can turn to the courts and stage protests. I laud the efforts of California Attorney General Rob Bonta suing to prevent DOGE from illegally accessing and disseminating our private information.\n\nGwenlyn Gibson","summary":"Also: Groundwater burden &#124; Authoritarian drift &#124; Prioritize equality &#124; Limited hand.

For Liberals, Now They're Anything But","text":"Owning a Tesla was once the ultimate status symbol for the environmentally conscious, forward-thinking, tech-savvy crowd. Now? Not so much. Thanks to CEO Elon Musk's recent political stances and public behavior, Tesla has found itself in an awkward free fall—both in sales and in public perception.The numbers tell the story. In January, Tesla's sales in France plummeted by 63.4 percent, Germany saw a 59.5 percent drop, and even the United Kingdom, a slightly more forgiving market, reported a 12 percent decline, according to EV Magazine, a specialized publication on electric vehicles.Musk's once-coveted electric vehicles, which were practically a prerequisite for Silicon Valley parking lots, are now being ditched for alternatives like BMW's iX and Polestar models.Newsweek reached out to Tesla's press team for comment.Tesla Owners Are Getting CreativeMusk's public persona has transformed from eccentric billionaire genius to an internet provocateur with a penchant for aligning himself with conservative figures. His support for President Donald Trump during the 2024 election and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been labeled a far-right extremist organization, has not played well in Europe.With sales declining in some of the most important markets in Europe, it turns out that endorsing a party that thrives on nationalist rhetoric, unlike in the U.S., doesn't exactly sell well in places like France, Spain, and Germany, where the wounds of history remain fresh.Also, not only is he serving as a \"free speech\" advocate, turning Twitter into X, but he's also championing deep budget cuts as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), targeting institutions that many liberals hold dear.Disillusioned Tesla owners are getting creative. Bumper stickers on Etsy reading, \"I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy\" and \"Anti-Elon Tesla Club\" are trending, with both selling in the thousands. As one former enthusiast bluntly said to WIRED, driving a Tesla in certain circles today \"feels like wearing a MAGA hat on wheels.\"Competitors Are Having a Field DayThe EV market is changing, and Tesla is no longer the untouchable behemoth it once was. Volvo's EX30 is flying off the shelves, Chinese BYD's presence in Europe has surged by 550 percent, and Volkswagen has posted a 20 percent jump in EV sales. Meanwhile, Tesla's European market share continues to shrink, with overall sales in the region down 50.4 percent year-over-year.To make matters worse, Tesla's product lineup is getting outdated according to insiders. While competitors are churning out sleek new models with cutting-edge features, Tesla hasn't introduced a new vehicle in Europe since the Model Y in 2021. As Philip Nothard, an automotive industry strategist, put it: \"It's looking a little bit samey.\"Stocks NosediveBeyond the numbers in France, Germany and the U.K., the trend continued across Europe, with Tesla registrations slumping over 40 percent in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, according to electric vehicle-focused outlet Electrek, with Spain seeing the steepest decline of 75 percent.Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33 percent year-on-year in January, while in China, Tesla's second-largest market behind the U.S., sales were down 11 percent over the same period, and down 33 percent from December, according to the China Passenger Car Association.Tesla's fourth-quarter results, released in late January, came in below analysts' estimates. While overall revenue saw a slight increase, operating income dropped 23 percent year-over-year to $1.6 billion. Additionally, Tesla's 1.8 million deliveries for the year marked the first annual decline in the company's history.\"Boycott\"Tesla's image is taking a severe beating. European activists have gone as far as projecting an image of Musk's controversial salute onto Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory, complete with the word \"Heil\" next to the illuminated Tesla logo.Two left-wing activist groups, Led By Donkeys from the United Kingdom and Germany's Center for Political Beauty, claimed responsibility for the projection on X, formerly Twitter.Another message, displaying the word \"Boycott\" alongside the Tesla logo, was also projected onto the factory headquarters.Vandalism against Tesla vehicles and showrooms is on the rise, with dealerships in multiple countries being defaced with graffiti condemning Musk.Even some Tesla shareholders are calling for a leadership shake-up. Karen Róbertsdóttir, a long-time Tesla investor from Iceland, expressed frustration over Musk's impact on the company.\"I've defended you guys so much over the years, and you make great products, but even I can't stick up for you anymore,\" she stated on Tesla's YouTube channel.And the financial repercussions are starting to stack up. Tesla's stock, which surged following Trump's 2024 election victory, has since taken a 13 percent nosedive over the past month. Some analysts are already whispering about a \"Musk discount\"—a phenomenon where his controversial public persona is actively dragging down the company's valuation.","summary":"Elon Musk's political stances and public behavior have put Tesla in an awkward free fall, both in sales and public perception.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/teslas-used-cool-liberals-now-theyre-anything-2031655","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589163/i-bought-this-before-we-knew-elonwascrazy.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:29:25","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.059},{"id":290660058,"title":"Trump is ‘likely to win’ in legal challenges to agenda, attorney predicts","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit February 14, 2025 03:44 \n\n Trump is ‘likely to win’ in legal challenges to agenda, attorney predicts \n Attorney Julian Epstein breaks down the legal challenges facing President Donald Trump’s agenda on ‘The Evening Edit.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE EVENING EDIT | LATEST EPISODESTHE EVENING EDITV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Attorney Julian Epstein breaks down the legal challenges facing President Donald Trump’s agenda on ‘The Evening Edit.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6368855541112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/2bc5f94c-0eb5-40a5-8ed0-4b6d5c1a77f9/c6cd83b9-2d7f-4bb0-875a-8bb27067068f/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:28:25","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":290660392,"title":"At least 600 workers to leave BPA, spurring concerns about transmission grid","text":"The Bonneville Power Administration, the region’s largest transmission grid operator, will lose at least 600 workers under President Donald Trump’s sweeping efforts to reduce the federal workforce, including essential positions like dispatchers who control the electric grid. \n\nPoliticians and experts in Oregon said such a large number of workers leaving could undermine BPA’s ability to operate the grid and lead to blackouts in the region.","summary":"The Bonneville Power Administration, the region’s largest transmission grid operator, will lose at least 600 workers under President Donald Trump’s sweeping efforts to reduce the federal workforce.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2025/02/at-least-600-workers-to-leave-bpa-spurring-concerns-about-transmission-grid.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/YFPV5SYPJRAPPKO5OUOE6LA6QE.jpg?auth=8c6dd83623a31d0567d36524c0a2a04c6b248c6987ea0380c1d76cb20f3fa63b&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:27:33","author":"Gosia Wozniacka","authors":["Gosia Wozniacka"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":290660938,"title":"Sheryl Crow Waves Goodbye to Her Tesla, Pledges Money to NPR","text":"Sheryl Crow has had enough of Elon Musk. The singer shared a new Instagram post on Friday waving goodbye to her Tesla, confirming that she sold her car following Musk and President Donald Trump‘s efforts to gut government programs through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with,” Crow wrote in her post, accompanied by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman’s “Time to Say Goodbye.” She added, “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla.”\n\n Crow shared that the money she made selling the car would go to NPR, which she said was “under threat by President Musk.” The singer said she was donating to the radio network “in hopes that the truth will continue to find its way to those willing to know the truth.”\n\n Crow’s support of NPR comes as the Trump administration continues to fight the press, as evidenced by Trump’s move to block the Associated Press from the Oval Office over the news outlet’s refusal to change its editorial style to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.”\n\n Crow’s decision comes as Musk and Trump have spent the first month of the president’s second term dismantling the federal government. DOGE laid off thousands of government workers and in the past two weeks, Musk and DOGE have gone after the U.S. Agency for International Development as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \n\n Speaking with Rolling Stone earlier this week, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who originally proposed the creation of the CFPB, said the Administration’s actions have put the country on the brink of a “constitutional crisis.”\n\n “Come fight it out here in Congress,” Warren said. “But you have to be willing to stand up and defend your ideas and persuade people to vote for them. You don’t get to slither around in the dark and put a handful of teenage hackers into the middle of [America’s] payments systems, as a way to give yourself control of the functioning of our government. “\n\n Crow has been vocal of her disapproval of Trump and far-right politics for years.

A judge still has to approve the request.The formal move to end the prosecution came days into an epic showdown between Justice Department leadership in Washington and its office in New York, which has long prided itself on its independence.At least seven prosecutors in New York and Washington quit rather than carry out Bove’s directive to halt the case, including the interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan and the acting chief of the public integrity section.The Justice Department's three-page motion sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning the charges could be revived in the future.RELATED STORY | Prosecutor who quit after refusing to drop case says she's confident NYC Mayor Adams 'committed the crimes'The filing capped another whirlwind day of recriminations and another resignation.Earlier, Bove conferred with prosecutors in the department’s public integrity section and instructed them to decide among themselves who would sign the dismissal motion.After they were told that their jobs were at risk if no one stepped forward, one agreed to do it, according to a person briefed on the discussions who insisted on anonymity to speak about a private meeting.As Justice Department officials worked to seize control of the case and end it, another Manhattan prosecutor involved in the Adams case resigned — and blasted Bove in the process.Hagan Scotten wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a “fool” or a “coward” to meet his demand to drop the charges.Scotten, along with other prosecutors in the case against Adams, was suspended with pay on Thursday by acting deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said would determine whether they kept their jobs.Bove, who had represented Donald Trump against criminal charges before he was reelected as president in November, on Monday directed Danielle Sassoon, a Republican and the interim U.S. attorney in New York, to drop the charges against Adams.Instead, she resigned on Thursday, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington, a day after she sent a letter to Trump's new attorney general, Pam Bondi.In response to her resignation, Bove wrote a scathing and scolding letter back.Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts.In a resignation letter to Bove, Scotten said he was “entirely in agreement” with Sassoon's refusal to seek dismissal of charges that the mayor had accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor.Among reasons for seeking to have charges dropped, Bove said the mayor was needed in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts and to decrease violent crime. He also said the charges were brought too close to this year's mayoral contest and could be reinstated after the election.In her letter, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering what amounted to a “quid pro quo” on immigration when they met with Justice Department officials in Washington last month.Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a “total lie.”“We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Spiro said in an email to reporters. “We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did.\"On Friday, Adams denied there was any deal to make the case go away.“I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" the mayor said in a statement.In his resignation letter, Scotten wrote: “No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives.\"The prosecutor said he was following “a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake.”He said he could see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and politics, “might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal.”But Scotten said any prosecutor “would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.”He added: “If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.”Adams, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty to the charges in September but has recently bonded at times with Trump, who has criticized the case against Adams and said he was open to giving Adams, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s, a pardon.","summary":"The Justice Department formally asked a court Friday to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/justice-department-asks-court-to-dismiss-corruption-charges-against-new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11d68e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F91%2Fbb%2F4101c59f4d28bbf880ef776a35f5%2F1710804835-vxcptz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:24:37","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":290661368,"title":"India gives list of 8 wanted: Headley, Goldy part of it","text":"India has reiterated its demand for the extradition of David Coleman Headley, prime accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, from the US, which today announced the extradition of another 26/11 convict, Tahawwur Rana.“We are giving a very violent man (Rana) back to India immediately.

Everybody knew it. Madigan was investigated over and over again, but nothing ever came of it.\n\n“This was a guy they wanted to go after, and they gathered as much as they could against him and something stuck,” the Madigan/McClain jury foreman told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAfter the now-pardoned Rod Blagojevich was arrested by the feds in a pre-dawn raid on unseemly corruption charges and was impeached by Madigan’s House, then-Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn appointed a blue-ribbon committee to recommend ethics changes, chaired by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, who’d helped put George Ryan in prison.\n\nMadigan had been convinced that Blagojevich was a crook for several years. The House speaker, for instance, would never agree to a major capital plan because he believed the governor and his pals would try to put their grubby paws on every dollar.\n\nBut instead of focusing mainly on the executive branch — which had seen the indictments of two governors in a row by that time — former prosecutor Collins’s commission focused quite significant attention on the General Assembly, and on Madigan in particular.\n\nMost folks just figured that Madigan had avoided the long arm of federal law by being extra careful. And he may have been. But the arrogance of immense power apparently overrode his sense of self-preservation.\n\nHe paid a big price last week — two days after Blagojevich received a full pardon from President Donald Trump. Try to put that in a movie and they’d tell you it just wasn’t believable.\n\nThe jury believed the prosecution’s (persuasive) arguments that Madigan knew of the move to put the speaker’s cronies into do-nothing ComEd-related jobs (four counts). Madigan’s insanely unwise decision to associate himself with the widely known scumbag Danny Solis got him guilty verdicts on six more counts.\n\nMadigan was convicted on ten of 23 charges. It’s possible that Madigan, 82, could spend the rest of his life in prison, while Blagojevich may end up serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Serbia.\n\nA few more points:\n\n• The federal government’s much-ballyhooed RICO charge against Madigan and Mike McClain was rejected by jurors 11-1, the jury foreman told some Chicago news media outlets. The foreman told the Tribune that it was part of a “government overreach” against Madigan. The feds almost never lose racketeering cases, but most jurors apparently bought the defense argument that the U.S. attorney was prosecuting the Madigan “myth” instead of Madigan the man.\n\n• I really thought the government had Madigan cold on the Chinatown thing. They had Madigan on tape numerous times talking with Solis and his consigliere McClain about a land-transfer bill to help a favored developer buy a Chinatown parking lot and build a hotel and how that would result in a new law firm client.\n\nBut 10 out of 12 jurors apparently bought the argument that Madigan’s longtime property tax law partner Bud Getzendanner had the final say over who would become a client, and that he would never approve a new client with state land transfer issues before the House.\n\n• Two federal trials have now directly addressed the AT&T charges. Both trials have resulted in hung juries on this topic.\n\nBack in October 2022, AT&T paid $23 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement “to resolve a federal criminal investigation into alleged misconduct involving the company’s efforts to unlawfully influence (Madigan),” the Justice Department declared at the time.\n\nThe feds put former AT&T Illinois president Paul La Schiazza on trial, but the jury was unable to convict.\n\nMadigan and McClain were also charged with participating in a bribery scheme in which La Schiazza hired former state Rep. Eddie Acevedo, D-Chicago, for a no-show job to help the company pass a bill to exempt the company from having to provide universal landline service. The jury hung 10-2 in favor of acquittal.\n\nThe AT&T provision was included in an omnibus bill that had been painstakingly devised over a period of years, had bipartisan support and backing from organized labor, and, most importantly, was part of a 2017 effort to test whether Republicans would help break the notorious Bruce Rauner budget impasse, because the bill also included a 911 call center service fee increase. The bill passed, Rauner’s veto was overridden, and a budget was approved shortly thereafter.\n\nOn this point, the feds truly did go after the myth and not the facts.\n\nRich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nGet Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

In early January, the multi-billionaire Elon Musk – one of Trump’s trusted lieutenants – made a gesture in public that closely resembled the Nazi salute, sending shock waves around the world.\nMusk has denied that it was a Nazi salute.\nFor a decade from the mid-1930s onwards, Germans from all walks of life greeted each other using the Nazi salute, especially on formal occasions. Nazi symbols and gestures have been banned in Germany and several other countries since the end of the second world war, and rightfully so. Today, Germans shake hands or hug when they meet.\n\nWhen Chinese people meet, how do they exchange salutations?\nMost present-day Chinese – unlike the Japanese, who bow, or the Thais, who press their palms together in front of them to make the wai gesture – do not greet each other in any way that is discernibly “Chinese” on formal occasions.\nMany shake hands or even hug, in line with Western custom.\nThis was not always the case, but waves of foreign invasions, domestic strife, revolutions and tumultuous political movements, which began in the early 19th century and went on for most of the 20th, fundamentally changed the way the Chinese people behave, the clothes they wear and how they see themselves in the world.\nIn recent years, many young people in China have rediscovered long abandoned aspects of their culture and made attempts to resurrect them.\nThe hanfu movement to revive clothing once traditionally worn by Chinese of the dominant Han ethnicity is the most visible manifestation of this, and closely associated with it has been a revival of the yi greeting.\n\nThis involves stretching your arms out in front of you, joining both hands together and bowing. The distance of your hands from your body, how high you hold them, the manner in which you arrange your palm and fingers and how deep you bow are determined by social cues such as the rank and seniority of the people involved, the degree of formality warranted and nature of the occasion.\nThe yi greeting dates back more than 3,000 years, to when the Zhou people replaced the more technologically advanced Shang people as overlords of the multiple ethnic groups that formed the nascent Chinese nation.\nFrom their ancestral homeland in present-day Shaanxi province in northwest China, the Zhou people introduced norms governing social organisation and manners which would have a profound influence on Chinese civilisation and are still felt today.\nAmong the many rituals for social and personal conduct was the yi greeting.\nThe details of it have changed over the course of thousands of years, but the basics have remained unchanged.\n\nOn very rare occasions we still see a version of it in which the person making the greeting balls one hand into a fist and wraps the palm of the other hand over it, places both hands close to his or her chest, and gives them a few shakes as one would a cocktail shaker but with much less vigour.\nThis gesture, however, is less formal than the outstretched arms and bow of the traditional yi.\nMany would instinctively sneer at what they perceive to be contrived resuscitations of long-dead Chinese cultural markers, but they should bear in mind that many of the revered, “age-old” traditions and customs practised all over the world today are recent resuscitations, reinterpretations and even inventions.\nDonning hanfu and making the yi greeting are harmless gestures that speak of pride and ownership. But there is one gesture, and the foul ideology that goes with it, that should never be revived. Ever.","summary":"Some historical gestures should never be revived. The yi greeting, once common in ancient China, is thankfully not one of them.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/chinese-culture/article/3298332/nazi-salute-or-no-elon-musks-gesture-reminds-us-when-and-when-not-celebrate-culture","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/12/eb43f50a-ce0f-4935-ad37-8dffcd991a64_0c6f84e7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:15:08","author":"Wee Kek Koon","authors":["Wee Kek Koon"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.329},{"id":290657454,"title":"Zelenskyy’s Alarm on Ukraine’s Future: Politics Update","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Friday and happy Valentine’s Day to you and yours. In today’s edition, “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker sits down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich. Plus, we have a look back at the week that was for President Donald Trump in the courts. And Jonathan Allen writes the recent upheaval at the Justice Department is reminiscent of the “Saturday Night Massacre” during the Nixon administration.\n\nProgramming note: We’re taking a break for Presidents’ Day on Monday and will be back in your inbox on Tuesday, Feb. 18.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Adam Wollner\n\nZelenskyy: ‘Very difficult’ for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support\n\nBy Alexander Smith and Alexandra Marquez\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” Friday that it would be “very, very, very difficult” for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support, both now as it tries to repel Russia’s invasion and in the future after the current war ends.\n\n“Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “But we will have low chance, low chance, to survive without support of the United States. I think it’s very important, critical.” \n\n“I don’t want to think about” fighting against Russia without American support, Zelenskyy said, adding, “I don’t want to think that we will not be strategic partners.”\n\nZelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a ceasefire deal that would lift certain international sanctions on Russia and would allow the Russian military to regroup.\n\nThe backdrop: Zelenskyy’s comments came during a fractious summit in Germany, where Vice President JD Vance criticized European leaders on a host of issues unrelated to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including failing to stand up for “values shared with the United States of America.” \n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his own unvarnished view in response, saying that the Trump administration had “no regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust.”\n\nThe widening gulf between Europe and the United States comes at an especially delicate time for Zelenskyy and an exhausted and depleted Ukraine. While the war appears to have descended into a quagmire, Russian forces have been making slow if painful progress. Russia controls some 20% of the country, which is in dire need of weapons and soldiers.\n\n And watch the full interview Sunday morning on “Meet the Press.”\n\nWhat to know from the Trump presidency today\n\nThe Trump administration carried out mass firings Thursday and Friday across the federal government, affecting thousands of workers who had been on the job for less than two years.A judge temporarily blocked mass terminations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, dealing a blow to Trump’s efforts to dismantle the agency. (Read more on Trump’s legal challenges below.)Trump signed two executive orders: one on ending federal funding to schools that require Covid vaccines and another that establishes a new panel called the “Energy Dominance Council.”Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he was “puzzled and disturbed” by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s comments asserting that a return to Ukraine’s 2014 borders was “unrealistic.” Trump defended Hegseth’s speech, saying he knew “generally” what would be in it.\n\nFollow live updates →\n\nA week of legal setbacks — and one big win — for Trump’s agenda\n\nTrump’s effort to reshape the federal government through a series of sweeping executive orders ran into a number of roadblocks in the courts this week, but he also scored a major legal victory.\n\nDareh Gregorian has a wrap-up of Trump’s week in the courts:\n\nThe setbacks:\n\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., signed off on a temporary restraining order blocking the blanket freeze on federal grant money to perform foreign assistance work. Another federal judge in D.C. also further halted plans to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development.A federal judge in Rhode Island said the administration had violated his order halting a sweeping federal funding freeze. It was the first time a judge accused the administration of violating a court order.A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the move to pause grants from the National Institutes of Health to almost two dozen states.A federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order aimed at restricting transgender health care for anyone under 19 for at least two weeks.\n\nThe victory:\n\nA federal judge in Boston allowed the administration’s massive “deferred resignation” program for federal employees to move forward, ruling the labor unions that brought the suit lacked standing.\n\nThe next round of challenges:\n\nDemocratic attorneys general in 14 states sued over the constitutionality of the Department of Government Efficiency.A coalition of unions and civil rights groups filed suit seeking to block Trump’s plans to disable the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.A group of religious organizations challenged the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind guidance barring immigration raids at or near places of worship except in emergency situations or with prior written, high-level supervisory approval.A coalition of immigrant rights groups is arguing the administration is denying immigrants being sent to Guantanamo Bay their right to a lawyer.\n\nHow the latest order from Trump’s DOJ compares to the ‘Saturday Night Massacre’\n\nAnalysis by Jonathan Allen\n\nRichard Nixon had his “Saturday Night Massacre,” and now Donald Trump has his Valentine’s Day massacre.\n\nLike any good Valentine’s story, this one is taking more than just the one day to play out. It started on Monday, when Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and former Trump lawyer, ordered the top federal prosecutor in New York, Danielle Sassoon, to drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nTrump wants Adams to help deport more migrants — putting political pressure on other mayors to do the same — and Adams, presumably, did not want to risk going to prison himself. \n\nSassoon did not go to court to pull the prosecution. Instead, she resigned on Thursday, revealing that top Justice Department officials met with Adams’ defense lawyers to map out what she said amounted to a quid pro quo. Several of her deputies also quit. \n\nAdams and his lawyers have denied a quid pro quo, but the Trump administration has done little to dissuade the public from reaching a similar conclusion. In an unfortunate turn of phrase, Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan touted the deal in a joint Fox News interview with Adams Friday. “If he doesn’t come through,” Homan said, “I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, ‘Where the hell is the agreement we came to?’”\n\nThe episode is reminiscent of the Saturday Night Massacre. In October 1973, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox — the man investigating Nixon. Richardson resigned instead. So did Richardson’s deputy, William Ruckelshaus. Finally, Solicitor General Robert Bork executed on Nixon’s order.\n\nThat act of fealty to president and party no doubt contributed to Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan more than a decade later — and to the Senate’s refusal to confirm Bork.\n\nPublic outrage over the Saturday Night Massacre led to a reform law and to decades of efforts by Nixon’s successors to either distance themselves from prosecutorial decisions or give the appearance of distance. \n\nTrump chafed at the norm during his first term, when he soured on — and eventually fired — Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate any Trump ties to Russia.\n\nBut in the current case, unlike the Watergate and Russia probes, the president is not a target of investigation or prosecution. There’s no law preventing the president from directing prosecutions from the White House. Even if there were, the Supreme Court made clear last year that the president can’t be prosecuted for official actions anyway.\n\nAdams does not enjoy such immunity, and it will be interesting to see whether state charges are brought against him in New York.\n\nBut what’s more interesting is what the episode reveals about Trump, his long-standing complaints about the politicization of the Justice Department, and his oft-repeated promise to clean up corruption in the federal government. He does not apply the same standards to himself, and there’s no indication that he intends to.\n\nThat’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

But the President yesterday said the call included the pair agreeing to meet and expected it to happen in the next few weeks. \n\nThe spur of the moment call came as Mr Trump was also reported to want Europe to buy more US energy as a condition for long lasting security guarantees.\n\nLast night, defence sources confirmed Mr Trump could attempt to leverage US commitment to Nato against European defence spending and purchases of American weapons. \n\nDonald Trump's bid to boost US weapons sales by aligning them to foreign policy was repeated by aides at the Nato defence ministers' summit in Brussel\n\nBETTER CALL KEIR: Sir Keir Starmer speaking by phone to President Trump during a dinner with US special envoy to the UK Mark Burnett\n\nUS national security spokesman Brian Hughes said: 'President Trump and his administration are engaging our Nato allies to ensure all members carry their share of the burden and meet their defence spending obligations. Getting our allies to meet those obligations strengthens Nato.'\n\nAmerica is expected to emphasise that if European states buy more US equipment, it will improve 'interoperability' between different Nato members.\n\nBut Nato countries – Britain, France, Germany and Italy in particular – want to preserve their own defence industries which are worth billions of pounds to each of their economies.\n\nIn recent years, US weapons sales to Nato states have been slowed by red tape, leading to allies buying equipment from other countries instead. \n\nRecently, Poland signed a multi-billion-pound deal to buy hundreds of tanks, planes and long-range artillery from South Korea, in a major blow to the US.\n\nThe main delays with US equipment are said to be around the contract process and shipments of the goods.\n\nNato Secretary General Mark Rutte has called on the US to reduce the bureaucratic complications so that European armies can grow faster in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nNato Secretary General Mark Rutte (pictured) has called on the US to reduce the bureaucratic complications so that European armies can grow faster\n\nGerman MP Jurgen Hardt said: 'There is a lot of potential. It could reduce political disputes with Nato. We could convince Trump with an economic argument.\n\n'It is only sensible because we do not produce enough.'\n\nThe US embassy in the UK posted a photo of the Prime Minister's call with Mr Trump last night, showing Sir Keir at a dinner table with Mark Burnett, the US's special envoy.\n\nIt is understood Mr Trump rang Mr Burnett who then handed his phone to the Prime Minister. Mr Burnett has close ties with Britain as his mother worked as a waitress in Downing Street more than 30 years ago.\n\nBrusselsNATODonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump urges Europe to buy more American weapons as insiders fear he could attempt to leverage US commitment to Nato against country's economic prosperity\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Trump's bid to increase US weapons sales by aligning them to foreign policy was repeated by aides at the Nato defence ministers' summit in Brussels, according to news organisation Bloomberg.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14399881/Donald-Trump-Europe-buy-American-weapons-commitment-Nato-against-economic-prosperity.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95235163-0-image-m-85_1739577467232.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:05:47","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":290657376,"title":"Pro-Palestine groups to stage large protest in central London","text":"A pro-Palestine protest billed by organisers as one of the largest since war broke out between Hamas and Israel will take place in central London on Saturday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said it is prepared for a “significant policing presence” to halt clashes with counter-demonstrators amid claims by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) that hundreds of thousands of people will attend.\n\nThe PSC, along with demonstrators from five other groups, will gather in Whitehall at noon before going to the US embassy in Nine Elms Lane, south-west London, where speeches will be made.\n\nThe protest comes after a proposal by President Donald Trump earlier this month for the United States to consider taking ownership of the Gaza Strip.\n\nMr Trump suggested the US could redevelop the war-torn territory into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.\n\nMeanwhile, a counter-protest by Stop The Hate will take place at the junction of Grosvenor Road and Vauxhall Bridge, along the march route.\n\nScotland Yard said a “significant policing presence” is expected to be in place to ensure the groups do not physically come together.\n\nThe force has been in touch with the organisers and it has imposed conditions under the Public Order Act in relation to routes, assembly areas and start and finish times, to ensure disruption is minimised, it said.\n\nCommander Glen Pavelin said breaching conditions, or inciting others to do so, is a criminal offence.\n\nThe pro-Palestine march must set off by 1pm, stick to the designated route, and speeches must finish by 4pm, police said.\n\nStop The Hate demonstrators must disperse by 3.30pm, they said.\n\nThe PSC said it was “expected to be one of the largest shows of solidarity for Palestinians” since October 2023.\n\nIt will be the 24th major pro-Palestine protest in the UK since war broke out following the October 7 attack in Israel by Hamas-led militants which killed some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting around 250 people – dozens of whom remain in captivity awaiting release under a ceasefire deal.","summary":"The Metropolitan Police said it is prepared for a ‘significant policing presence’ to halt clashes with counter-demonstrators.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/metropolitan-police-london-donald-trump-whitehall-pimlico-b1211332.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/15/00/56a61994ed26bfc2d22f37b28263888fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM5NjY0MDk1-2.78328234.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:02:35","author":"Pa Reporter","authors":["Pa Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":290656484,"title":"Trump, Musk shut down media attempts to 'drive us apart' amid DOGE efforts","text":"President Donald Trump is shutting down the latest criticism from mainstream media and the punditry class regarding his relationship with Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk. \"It's just so obvious.

But we need real security guarantees,” he told broadcasters.\n\nMr Lammy discussed the conflict in a separate meeting with Mr Vance.\n\nSpeaking to broadcasters after the meeting he said “we are some way from a negotiated peace” and pledged the UK’s continued support for Ukraine.\n\nHe said he and the vice president “share the view that there has to be an enduring peace” and agreed that Ukraine would “have to be part of that negotiated deal”.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary also described his meeting with Mr Vance as “very good” and that they built on “the special relationship that the United States and the UK enjoy”.\n\nHe added: “Negotiations have not yet begun. These are talks, if you like, about talks, and we will continue to support Ukraine.”\n\nMr Vance sought to play down the prospect of a split between Washington and Westminster, saying at the start of the meeting the “special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will remain very strong”.\n\nThe US has suggested that Kyiv must accept it will have to give up some territory to the Kremlin, and that the country joining Nato was unrealistic.\n\nA former Nato secretary general estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 troops could be needed as part of a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, including Britons.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC’s Newsnight on Friday night, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Nato membership would be the “most efficient and […] the least expensive way to ensure the future security of Ukraine”.\n\nOn the US’ stance on Ukraine and Nato, he said: “We should create a coalition of the willing under the leadership of France and the UK, to provide security guarantees for Ukraine and deploy troops on Ukrainian soil.”\n\nEarlier on Friday the Prime Minister spoke to Mr Zelensky and reiterated the UK’s position on a Nato spot for Ukraine, in an intervention that contrasts with Washington’s position that membership for Kyiv is not a realistic prospect.\n\nIn a readout of his conversation with Mr Zelensky, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “The Prime Minister began by reiterating the UK’s concrete support for Ukraine, for as long as it’s needed.\n\n“He was unequivocal that there could be no talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine.\n\n“The Prime Minister reiterated the UK’s commitment to Ukraine being on an irreversible path to Nato, as agreed by allies at the Washington Summit last year.”\n\nThe leaders agreed it was an “important moment to demonstrate international unity and support for Ukraine” and “agreed to stay in close contact”, and that Kyiv needs further lethal aid and a sovereign future, the statement added.","summary":"The Foreign and Defence Secretaries called on the UK and Europe to ‘do more’ to ‘share the burden’ of regional security","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/john-healey-vladimir-putin-ukraine-david-lammy-jd-vance-b1211331.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/15/00/c21cd46ed00f3e35f44ee53e403f2976Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM5NjYyNDAz-2.78505694.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 00:01:30","author":"Caitlin Doherty","authors":["Caitlin Doherty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.43},{"id":290656536,"title":"Mexico will not rule out suing Google over Gulf of Mexico name change","text":"Mexico will not rule out filing a lawsuit against Google if it continues to call the sea between the northeast of the country and the southeastern United States the “Gulf of America”.\n\nThe area has long been named the Gulf of Mexico across the world but US President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf’s name after taking office in January.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the president’s decree is restricted to the “continental shelf of the United States” because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf.\n\n“We have sovereignty over our continental shelf,” she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where a potential lawsuit would be filed.\n\nApplying name changes from ‘official government sources’\n\nGoogle reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a “long-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources”.\n\nAs of Thursday, how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps was dependent on the user’s location and other data.\n\nIf the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as the Gulf of America.

The incident comes just days after a high-profile prisoner exchange between Moscow and Washington, which the White House had hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough and a step toward de-escalating the conflict in Ukraine.\nArrest at Moscow Airport\nAccording to Russia’s Federal Customs Service, the 28-year-old American traveler was detained at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport after arriving from Istanbul last Friday. Authorities claim he attempted to smuggle a \"significant amount\" of drugs into the country, Russian news agency Interfax reported.\nRussian Telegram channel Mash, which has ties to the country’s security services, identified the detainee only as \"K. Byers\" and stated that he could face up to seven years in prison if convicted under Russia’s strict drug laws.\nThe U.S. State Department has not yet issued an official comment on the arrest.\nOngoing Tensions Amid Recent Prisoner Swap\nThis latest detention comes in the wake of a recent prisoner swap between the United States and Russia. Earlier this month, Moscow released American teacher Marc Fogel, who had been serving a 14-year sentence for possessing what he claimed was medically prescribed marijuana. In exchange, Washington returned Russian cryptocurrency expert Alexander Vinnik, who had faced fraud charges related to Bitcoin transactions in the U.S.\nFogel’s release was widely viewed as a diplomatic victory, with the Biden administration having designated him as “wrongfully detained” in December. However, the arrest of another U.S. citizen so soon after the exchange could complicate future negotiations between the two nations.\nShifting U.S.-Russia Relations\nThe arrest also comes amid a sudden shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Former President Donald Trump made headlines on Wednesday by announcing that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to start negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The claim, made after what Trump described as a lengthy phone call with Putin, marks a significant departure from Washington’s stance over the past three years.\nAs tensions between the U.S. and Russia continue to fluctuate, the fate of the newly detained American remains uncertain. Observers will be watching closely to see whether this case further strains diplomatic efforts or becomes part of a future negotiation between the two governments.\nAlso Read: Danielle Sassoon Resigns After Refusing to Drop Corruption Case Against NYC Mayor Under Trump Administration Pressure","summary":"Russia has arrested another American citizen after customs officials reportedly discovered cannabis-infused marmalade in his luggage, Russian media reported on Friday.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/russia-detains-another-u-s-citizen-over-alleged-drug-smuggling/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/putin.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:58:23","author":"Swastika Sruti","authors":["Swastika Sruti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":290659650,"title":"Donald Trump’s rosy Valentine’s Day card to illegal migrants","text":"The faces of President Donald Trump (left) and his border czar Tom Homan (right) are on the Valentine’s Day card (Pictures: MEGA/X/@WhiteHouse)\n\nPresident Donald Trump shared a Valentine’s Day card to a group of people in America he feels the opposite of love towards.\n\nThe pink and white digital love day card was posted on The White House’s official X (formerly Twitter) account on Friday morning with the caption, ‘Happy Valentine’s Day’ and a red heart emoji.\n\nIt read: ‘Roses are red, Violets are blue, come here illegally, And we’ll deport you.’\n\nThe stern faces of Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, were surrounded by small pink hearts. \n\n A pink Valentine’s Day card with the faces of President Donald Trump and his border czar Tom Homan (Picture: X/@WhiteHouse)\n\nIt had garnered more than 180,000 likes and 12million views by the evening.\n\nTrump started his second term a few weeks ago by immediately ordering deportations and arrests of migrants who entered the US illegally. \n\nAs of February 3, agents had arrested 8,768 undocumented immigrants, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nAnd the New York Post reported that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 11,000 illegal migrants in the first 18 days.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"The White House shared a 'Happy Valentine's Day' card addressed to illegal migrants.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/14/donald-trump-valentines-day-card-illegal-migrants-22563792/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/5504375_Donald_Trump_s_Valentine_s_Day_card_to_migrants-19d9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:58:19","author":"Jessica Kwong","authors":["Jessica Kwong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":290661618,"title":"'We are blind': Urgent data on influenza and bird flu revealed missing as outbreaks escalate","text":"Sonya Stokes, an emergency room physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, braces herself for a daily deluge of patients sick with coughs, soreness, fevers, vomiting, and other flu-like symptoms.\n\nShe’s desperate for information, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a critical source of urgent analyses of the flu and other public health threats, has gone quiet in the weeks since President Donald Trump took office.\n\n“Without more information, we are blind,” she said.\n\nFlu has been brutal this season. The CDC estimates at least 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths from the flu since the start of October. At the same time, the bird flu outbreak continues to infect cattle and farmworkers. But CDC analyses that would inform people about these situations are delayed, and the CDC has cut off communication with doctors, researchers, and the World Health Organization, say doctors and public health experts.\n\n“CDC right now is not reporting influenza data through the WHO global platforms, FluNet [and] FluID, that they’ve been providing information [on] for many, many years,” Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness at the WHO, said at a Feb. 12 press briefing.\n\n“We are communicating with them,” she added, “but we haven’t heard anything back.”\n\nOn his first day in office, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the WHO.\n\nA critical analysis of the seasonal flu selected for distribution through the CDC’s Health Alert Network has stalled, according to people close to the CDC. They asked not to be identified because of fears of retaliation. The network, abbreviated as HAN, is the CDC’s main method of sharing urgent public health information with health officials, doctors, and, sometimes, the public.\n\nA chart from that analysis, reviewed by KFF Health News, suggests that flu may be at a record high. About 7.7% of patients who visited clinics and hospitals without being admitted had flu-like symptoms in early February, a ratio higher than in four other flu seasons depicted in the graph. That includes 2003-04, when an atypical strain of flu fueled a particularly treacherous season that killed at least 153 children.\n\nWithout a complete analysis, however, it’s unclear whether this tidal wave of sickness foreshadows a spike in hospitalizations and deaths that hospitals, pharmacies, and schools must prepare for. Specifically, other data could relay how many of the flu-like illnesses are caused by flu viruses — or which flu strain is infecting people. A deeper report might also reveal whether the flu is more severe or contagious than usual.\n\n“I need to know if we are dealing with a more virulent strain or a coinfection with another virus that is making my patients sicker, and what to look for so that I know if my patients are in danger,” Stokes said. “Delays in data create dangerous situations on the front line.”\n\nAlthough the CDC’s flu dashboard shows a surge of influenza, it doesn’t include all data needed to interpret the situation. Nor does it offer the tailored advice found in HAN alerts that tells health care workers how to protect patients and the public. In 2023, for example, a report urged clinics to test patients with respiratory symptoms rather than assume cases are the flu, since other viruses were causing similar issues that year.\n\n“This is incredibly disturbing,” said Rachel Hardeman, a member of the Advisory Committee to the Director of the CDC. On Feb. 10, Hardeman and other committee members wrote to acting CDC Director Susan Monarez asking the agency to explain missing data, delayed studies, and potentially severe staff cuts. “The CDC is vital to our nation’s security,” the letter said.\n\nSeveral studies have also been delayed or remain missing from the CDC’s preeminent scientific publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Anne Schuchat, a former principal deputy director at the CDC, said she would be concerned if there was political oversight of scientific material: “Suppressing information is potentially confusing, possibly dangerous, and it can backfire.”\n\nCDC spokesperson Melissa Dibble declined to comment on delayed or missing analyses. “It is not unexpected to see flu activity elevated and increasing at this time of the year,” she said.\n\nA draft of one unpublished study, reviewed by KFF Health News, that has been withheld from the MMWR for three weeks describes how a milk hauler and a dairy worker in Michigan may have spread bird flu to their pet cats. The indoor cats became severely sick and died. Although the workers weren’t tested, the study says that one of them had irritated eyes before the cat fell ill — a common bird flu symptom. That person told researchers that the pet “would roll in their work clothes.”\n\nAfter one cat became sick, the investigation reports, an adolescent in the household developed a cough. But the report says this young person tested negative for the flu, and positive for a cold-causing virus.\n\nCorresponding CDC documents summarizing the cat study and another as-yet unpublished bird flu analysis said the reports were scheduled to be published Jan. 23. These were reviewed by KFF Health News. The briefing on cats advises dairy farmworkers to “remove clothing and footwear, and rinse off any animal biproduct residue before entering the household to protect others in the household, including potentially indoor-only cats.”\n\nThe second summary refers to “the most comprehensive” analysis of bird flu virus detected in wastewater in the United States.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, said delays of bird flu reports are upsetting because they’re needed to inform the public about a worsening situation with many unknown elements. Citing “insufficient data” and “high uncertainty,” the United Kingdom raised its assessment of the risk posed by the U.S. outbreak on dairies.\n\n“Missing and delayed data causes uncertainty,” Nuzzo said. “It also potentially makes us react in ways that are counterproductive.”\n\nAnother bird flu study slated for January publication showed up in the MMWR on Feb. 13, three weeks after it was expected. It revealed that three cattle veterinarians had been unknowingly infected last year, based on the discovery of antibodies against the bird flu virus in their blood. One of the veterinarians worked in Georgia and South Carolina, states that haven’t reported outbreaks on dairy farms.\n\nThe study provides further evidence that the United States is not adequately detecting cases in cows and people. Nuzzo said it also highlights how data can supply reassuring news. Only three of 150 cattle veterinarians had signs of prior infections, suggesting that the virus doesn’t easily spread from the animals into people. More than 40 dairy workers have been infected, but they generally have had more sustained contact with sick cattle and their virus-laden milk than veterinarians.\n\nInstead, recently released reports have been about wildfires in California and Hawaii.\n\n“Interesting but not urgent,” Nuzzo said, considering the acute fire emergencies have ended. The bird flu outbreak, she said, is an ongoing “urgent health threat for which we need up-to-the-minute information to know how to protect people.”\n\n“The American public is at greater risk when we don’t have information on a timely basis,” Schuchat said.\n\nThis week, a federal judge ordered the CDC and other health agencies to “restore” datasets and websites that the organization Doctors for America had identified in a lawsuit as having been altered. Further, the judge ordered the agencies to “identify any other resources that DFA members rely on to provide medical care” and restore them by Feb. 14.\n\nIn their letter, CDC advisory committee members requested an investigation into missing data and delayed reports. Hardeman, an adviser who is a health policy expert at the University of Minnesota, said the group didn’t know why data and scientific findings were being withheld or removed. Still, she added, “I hold accountable the acting director of the CDC, the head of HHS, and the White House.”\n\nHardeman said the Trump administration has the power to disband the advisory committee. She said the group expects that to happen but proceeded with its demands regardless.\n\n“We want to safeguard the rigor of the work at the CDC because we care deeply about public health,” she said. “We aren’t here to be silent.”\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nThis article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.","summary":"Sonya Stokes, an emergency room physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, braces herself for a daily deluge of patients sick with coughs, soreness, fevers, vomiting, and other flu-like symptoms.\n\nShe’s desperate for information, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a critical source of urgent analyses of the flu and other public health threats, has gone quiet in the weeks since President Donald Trump took office.\n\n“Without more information, we are blind,” she said.\n\nFlu has been brutal this season.

Its VAT rates are lower than those in the UK.\n\nSome experts estimate it could deal a £24billion blow to Britain's faltering economy – severely damaging the Government's drive for growth.\n\nMr Trump has already declared 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.\n\nExperts have warned that Donald Trump's newest trade war could actually prove more costly for the UK than China\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has labelled trade wars nonsensical\n\nBirkin to pass on costs to shoppers \n\nWealthy shoppers will have to fork out more for their luxury handbags after the firm behind Birkin said it would pass on the cost of US tariffs.\n\nThe bags with a starting price of £10,000, a favourite of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, could be hit if Donald Trump follows through with threats to whack charges on European exports.\n\nYesterday Hermes executive chairman Axel Dumas said: ‘We’ll adapt to tariffs, and raise prices accordingly.’\n\nBut the brand believes customers will be happy to pay more for its ‘must-have’ status accessories\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer UK business policy adviser Allie Renison said: 'It's the EU that Trump is thinking about in targeting VAT, but the UK risks getting caught up in the crosshairs.'\n\nBut Labour ministers are refusing to criticise the plans or announce any retaliation.\n\nCabinet Office minister Pat McFadden insisted that the Government would not 'overreact' but 'wait and see' whether the tariffs 'actually come to pass'.\n\nScience Secretary Peter Kyle replied when pressed by Sky News on whether the Government would respond with retaliatory measures: 'What I said is that we will have a cool, clear look at what's in the national interest, and we will respond accordingly, based on what we actually have in fact.'\n\nBy contrast the EU hit back angrily at Mr Trump's vow to impose reciprocal tariffs.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said 'trade wars and punitive tariffs make no sense', warning that 'unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered'.\n\nMinisters will be hoping Sir Keir Starmer can allay the threat of high tariffs when he visits the White House later this month.\n\nHe had a phone call with Mr Trump on Thursday night just as the President was announcing his latest move.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to visit the White House later this month\n\nThe PM was hosting America's new Special Envoy to the UK, Mark Burnett, in Downing Street when he was handed a phone with Mr Trump on the end on the line.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister was pleased to host President Trump's special envoy...during which he took a call from President Trump and discussed his forthcoming visit to the US.'\n\nNo 10 said the PM and the envoy also discussed the special relationship between the two countries.\n\nDonald TrumpChina\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump's VAT tariff war 'could hit Britain harder than China' as experts fear move could cost UK economy £24billion\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Economic experts have warned that the UK could actually be hit harder than China by Donald Trump's new trade war tariffs, with some estimating a potential cost as high as £24billion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14399821/Donald-Trumps-VAT-tariff-war-hit-Britain-harder-China.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/14/23/95234579-0-image-m-107_1739575472642.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/14/6382211049476082072/1024x576_MP4_6382211049476082072.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:53:24","author":"Editor,Martin Beckford Policy","authors":["Editor","Martin Beckford Policy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":290660998,"title":"'Russian' drone smashes hole in Chernobyl shield and starts fire","text":"A drone with an explosive warhead has smashed a hole in the radiation shield at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. The plant's chief engineer, Alexander Titarchuk, said there was a \"possibility of a leak of radioactive substances, but the situation is under control\". \"The barrier which was supposed to prevent the spread of radioactive substances has ceased to function according to its original design,\" he added. Ukraine war latest: Anger after Vance's Munich speech Emergency crews were seen scaling the roof to repair the damage after a fire briefly broke out. However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels hadn't increased after Friday's incident. The agency also said there was no damage to the plant's inner containment shell. Mr Zelenskyy told the Munich Security Conference the strike was a \"very clear greeting from Putin and Russian Federation to the security conference\". Chernobyl was famously the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, with radioactive fallout spewing over a large part of Europe. Its reactors are now encased in a huge protective structure resembling an aircraft hangar. Ukraine blamed Russia for the drone strike - but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the claim, saying \"our military doesn't do that\". The IAEA did not attribute blame and only said its team stationed there had heard an explosion. It has not been possible to independently confirm who was behind the strike. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, has also been occasionally hit by drones during the war - but fears of a major accident have so far not materialised. The Chernobyl strike came a few days after Donald Trump said he would meet Vladimir Putin to start peace negotiations after talking to the Russian leader on the phone.

But he said he didn't believe the US had a clear way forward yet. He also said he thinks his country should have an army of one and a half million, with modern weapons, if its ambition to join NATO is denied.","summary":"A drone with an explosive warhead has smashed a hole in the radiation shield at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine.","url":"https://news.sky.com/story/russian-drone-smashes-hole-in-chernobyl-protective-shield-and-starts-fire-13309629","image":"https://e3.365dm.com/25/02/2048x1152/skynews-chernobyl-drone-attack_6829094.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:52:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.589},{"id":290654852,"title":"Map Shows States to Get Hit Hardest by Trump's Tariffs","text":"After President Donald Trump signed a memorandum initiating a new reciprocal tariff system, some states are slated to feel the effects more than others, according to a new report.Why It MattersTrump implemented the memorandum after promising to evoke tariffs in an effort to put America first throughout his campaign.\"I have decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,\" Trump announced from the Oval Office on Thursday.Previously, Trump announced tariffs of up to 25 percent on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports.What To KnowSome states are more likely to feel the hit from Trump's tariffs than others, according to a new LendingTree report.Eight states, in particular, will see at least two-thirds of their imports impacted by a blanket tariff on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.The LendingTree report analyzed which states had the highest percentage of imports and exports to these countries and found that 10 states would be particularly vulnerable if Trump's promised tariffs were enacted.That includes Montana, New Mexico, Vermont, Michigan, Maine, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Iowa and South Dakota.Forty-four percent of Americans say tariffs will impact their finances negatively, according to the report, with only 28 percent thinking they will have a positive impact.Overall, 74 percent said tariffs will lead to an uptick in prices.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump, Thursday on Truth Social: \"For many years, the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other Countries, both friend and foe. This System will immediately bring Fairness and Prosperity back into the previously complex and unfair System of Trade. America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly – A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.\"Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: \"The most startling fact about this list is how many of the top states are ones that President Trump won in the 2024 presidential election. Then again, looking at the high percentages of voters who expect these potential tariffs to affect both the price of certain items and their personal finances, many of these same voters may have been aware of the risks and voted for the current administration regardless of concerns.\"The past few years of rampant inflation on everyday items and increasing interest rates on big purchases like cars and houses have left many Americans looking at who or what to point their fingers at for this economic distress. Even if tariffs produce short-term pain, clearly there are many living in these states who feel it's a valid action to improve the long-term economic outlook of the United States.\"Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: \"The U.S. has an overwhelming reliance on Chinese imports, with many states sourcing a large percentage of their total imports from China. In some cases, these imports exceed those from our neighbors to the north or south.\"Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek: \"What's fascinating (and honestly a bit heartbreaking) is how the biggest impact lands on states that are already walking an economic tightrope. These states often have less diverse economies and fewer cushions to absorb economic shocks.\"HR consultant Bryan Driscoll told Newsweek: \"Trump's tariffs are nothing short of an economic grenade, and the states getting hit the hardest are, ironically, the ones often voting for him. These states and citizens are going to learn a hard lesson—tariffs aren't a tax on foreign countries; they're a tax on Americans.\"When those tariffs hit, businesses in these states will face higher costs, which means job losses, price hikes, and economic instability. Meanwhile, states with diversified trade portfolios will largely dodge the direct fallout.\"What Happens NextThe Trump administration is still determining the exact tariff rates for each country under the new tariff policy.\"To prepare for higher prices, people should focus on building a stronger financial cushion,\" Thompson said.\"During the pandemic, I advised having an emergency fund covering at least six to nine months of expenses. Given the possibility of spending slowdowns leading to layoffs, I now suggest extending that to 12 months,\" he said. \"Adjusting spending habits is also key. More people are cutting back, living on less, and shopping with more intent. Being mindful of how money is spent now will help ease the burden of rising costs in the months ahead.\"","summary":"Some states are more likely to feel the hit from Trump's tariffs than others, according to a new report.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/map-states-hit-hardest-trumps-tariffs-2031630","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589136/map.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:51:10","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":290656882,"title":"Trump's tariffs raise alarms for Illinois farm industry","text":"Tariffs announced by President Donald Trump and the possibility of a trade war have raised alarms for agriculture industries in Illinois and across the U.S. \n\nThe state is the nation’s second leading exporter of both soybeans and feed grains and related products, said the Illinois Department of Agriculture. About 44% of grain produced in Illinois is sold for export.\n\nThe U.S. is the world’s largest food exporter. Illinois ranks fifth in the country for agricultural product exports worth $10.6 billion, according to the Illinois Agriculture Department. Overall, marketing of the state’s agricultural products generates more than $51.1 billion annually. Crops account for 40% of that total.\n\nThe Illinois Farm Bureau is concerned about harm to the state’s farmers from potential tariffs on the United States’ top three agricultural trading partners: Mexico, Canada and China. The three countries, as well as others, have warned they will impose retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. in response to Trump’s orders.\n\n“Our farmers simply cannot afford the uncertainty of a potential trade war. Farm income has declined for a second straight year,” Brian Duncan, Illinois Farm Bureau president, said in a statement last week. “Uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the potential for retaliation makes it difficult to plan for the future.”\n\nZippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau in Washington, D.C., said, “Tariffs and tariff retaliation often hit farmers and ranchers hard, which make it more difficult for them to pay their bills and grow the food America’s families rely on.”\n\nConsistency is key\n\nEvan Hultine is a sixth-generation farmer near Princeton, more than two hours west of Chicago. He grows corn, soybeans and seed corn with his parents on a 1,300-acre farm.\n\n“Farmers always face a lot of uncertainty. We expect it from the weather, but we really need consistent trade approaches. Consistency is really key,” Hultine said.\n\nFarmers can spend decades building up trade partners and agreements that are threatened by tariffs and trade wars. “It’s hard to get new partners to work with you if you have constantly fluctuating trade positions,” he said.\n\nHultine isn’t certain of the exact destination of his crops because he sells to grain merchandisers who distribute to various markets. But he said much of it is exported, such as soybeans to Europe and corn that’s turned into ethanol and ends up in Canada.\n\nRural economies would be hit hard by retaliatory tariffs, Hultine said. “The stress to the whole system is something we’re hoping to avoid.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs\n\nLast week, Trump ordered an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. In addition, he has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect in early March, after being suspended for 30 days. On Monday, he also removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs, meaning all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. Trump also hiked his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10%.\n\nCanada and Mexico have both announced they would impose retaliatory measures. Other countries would likely follow. On Friday, the European Union’s executive branch vowed to “take firm and immediate action” against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tariffs resulted in approximately $27 billion in lost exports for U.S. agricultural producers, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report. Soy and pork producers suffered the most significant economic damage.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from major trading partners, as well as on a broad range of imports from China. In response, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico and Turkey responded with retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agricultural exports, said the USDA.\n\nDuvall, of the American Farm Bureau, said in February, “We know from experience that farmers and rural communities will bear the brunt of retaliation. Harmful effects of retaliation to farmers ripple through the rest of the rural economy.”\n\nIn addition to crops, agricultural inputs and equipment are affected by tariffs. More than 80% of the United States’ supply of potash — a key fertilizer ingredient — comes from Canada, the AFB said. “Tariffs that increase fertilizer prices threaten to deliver another blow to the finances of farm families already grappling with inflation and high supply costs,” Duvall said.\n\nContributing: AP","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/02/14/trump-tariffs-becoming-concern-illinois-farm-agriculture-industry","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa6d70f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1802x1029+0+79/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2F2e%2Fcd300cb94bfba89a0c8ac5452db8%2Fcr-05","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-14 23:49:27","author":"Amy Yee","authors":["Amy Yee"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.148}]}
