Wilbon didn't specify why he felt Pearl was so divisive, but the reigning AP co-Coach of the Year has voiced his support for both President Donald Trump and Israel's military response to the October 7, 2023 attacks.\n\n'Tony, he had become a divisive person it seems to me, intentionally, and I hope there was just pressure to get him out,' Wilbon said.\n\nAfter initially questioning Wilbon, PTI co-host TonyKornheiser replied: 'I always liked him. He was such a great guest. Yeah, we're on the other side with him.'\n\nBoth Wilbon and Kornheiser faced online criticism after the exchange, including one scathing social media post from Barstool's Dave Portnoy.\n\n'What an idiotic comment from Wilbon,' said Portnoy, who, like Pearl, has supported Trump and Israel. 'Kornheiser shouldn't have rolled over. Apparently Wilbon only likes athletes/coaches who speak on social issues if they align with his views. Otherwise you are divisive. What a narrow minded small view #brucepearl.'\n\nAnd Portnoy wasn't alone. Former ESPN college basketball analyst and current Wisconsin-Green Bay head coach Doug Gottlieb also took a shot at Wilbon.\n\n'Wilbon cmon man,' Gottlieb wrote on X. 'How was BP divisive?'\n\nBut not everyone was as diplomatic as Gottlieb. Another critic called Wilbon 'disgusting,' while one person even accused him of anti-Semitism.\n\n'I have to ask, does Wilbon feel that way just because Pearl is Jewish?' asked a self-described 'conservative' on X.\n\nAnother respondent asked if Pearl would be running of senate, as many have suggested he might.\n\nHowever, the outgoing Tigers coach put an end to that talk this week.\n\n'Many of you know that I thought and prayed about maybe running for United States Senate, maybe to be the next great senator from the state of Alabama,' Pearl said after ending his coaching career. \n\n'That would have required leaving Auburn, and instead the university has given me the opportunity to stay here and be Auburn's senator. I need to focus now on being a great husband, being a great father, being the best grandfather I possibly can be.'\n\nPearl reached a pair of Final Fours with the Tigers, including last year's, where the Tigers fell to Florida. \n\nHe and and St. John's Rick Pitino shared The Associated Press men's college basketball coach of the year award. \n\nPearl had a 246-125 record at Auburn, but the school recognizes only 232 of those wins after vacating games from the 2016-17 season because of NCAA infractions involving former assistant coach Chuck Person. Pearl received a two-game suspension for failure to monitor his assistant and adequately promote compliance.\n\nTennessee had fired Pearl in 2011 after the NCAA charged him with unethical conduct and then additional violations surfaced. He was 145-71 and made the NCAA Tournament all six seasons with the Volunteers from 2005-11, getting to the Sweet 16 three times, and advancing to their first regional final in 2010.\n\nAuburn hired Pearl in March 2014, when he was in the final months of his show-cause penalty, to take over a program that hadn't been to the NCAA Tournament since 2003. The Tigers went six times, all in the past seven seasons.\n\nBefore his two SEC stops, Pearl won an NCAA Division II national championship in 1995 with Southern Indiana while going 231-46 in his first head coaching job from 1992-01. He then was 86-38 in four seasons at Milwaukee, going to the NCAA Sweet 16 in 2005 before getting hired by Tennessee.\n\nSteven Pearl played 101 games for his father at Tennessee from 2007-11. He was a medical sales representative for three years before joining the Auburn staff in 2014, and was promoted to associate head coach before the 2023-24 season.\n\n'There is nobody more qualified or in a position to maintain our culture of faith, family and doing it the Auburn way than Steven,' Bruce Pearl said. 'He's actually tougher than I am, and just as competitive. Out of loyalty to Auburn and me, Steven passed on several previous chances to pursue head coaching opportunities, choosing instead to invest in our men's basketball program and help it reach unprecedented heights.'\n\nWhen Bruce Pearl served his two-game suspension early in the 2021-22 season, Steven Pearl was the acting head coach in a pair of lopsided wins.\n\nAuburn AD John Cohen said when he took the job three years ago, Bruce Pearl made it clear he was nearing the end of his career. Cohen said there was an internal national search to prepare for when that happened.\n\n'Throughout our detailed process, it became obvious to me and our staff that Steven Pearl was clearly the best fit for Auburn,' Cohen said. 'His expertise in coaching defense, his skills as an evaluator, recruiter, teacher and motivator, and his relationships with our student-athletes and staff were paramount.","summary":"Bruce Pearl's retirement as head basketball coach at Auburn was met with shock by Tigers fans - and some relief from one long-time ESPN host.

That’s something that drives me every day, that’s the reason why I’m able to do what I do every day. … Whatever backlash comes is OK, I feel strong about my faith that was meant to be.”\n\nWithout Shaw, the Cubs, who had already locked up a postseason birth, lost to the Reds, 1-0. He said it was important to have the “support” of his teammates before choosing to leave.\n\n“I made sure that everybody I talked to, I had their support, that they knew why I was going, that I wasn’t leaving just to leave, that it was something that was really important to my faith,” Shaw said per the Chicago Tribune. “It was really nice to see how everyone was able to support me in that moment.\n\n“I felt as though it was something that was really important for me to do. … I was very thankful for how the team responded, allowing me to do that was really special.”\n\nHe was back in the lineup against the Mets on Tuesday, hitting eighth and playing third base. Shaw added that he and Kirk texted frequently about the Cubs’ progress this season.\n\n“[Kirk] was one of the biggest Cubs fans I’ve ever met,” Shaw said. “He texted me after every game, ‘Great win for the Cubbies.’ He was super, super, super supportive of us and obviously someone who was very faithful, so we connected on that front as well.”","summary":"Matt Shaw isn't worried if he faces any backlash after he left the Cubs on Sunday to attend Charlie Kirk's memorial.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/23/sports/cubs-matt-shaw-not-concerned-about-backlash-for-attending-charlie-kirk-memorial/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-oskated5u-1758669905182.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758655533&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 00:13:17","author":"Andrew Battifarano","authors":["Andrew Battifarano"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":362948684,"title":"Trump needs Israel-Palestine peace to win Nobel Prize – Macron","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron has said that US President Donald Trump could only win the Nobel Peace Prize if he brings an end to the war in Gaza, pushing back against Trump’s repeated claims that he already deserves the award.\n\nMacron made the remarks on Tuesday during an interview with French broadcaster BFMTV on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\n“I see a US president who is active, who wants peace… who wants the Nobel Peace Prize. But the Nobel Peace Prize is possible only if you stop this war,” Macron said, urging Trump to put pressure on Israel to halt its military operations and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMacron also dismissed Trump’s assertion that France’s recognition of the Palestinian state amounted to rewarding Hamas, arguing instead that the move helps strengthen the Palestinian Authority and isolate the militant group.\n\nTrump, in his own address to the General Assembly earlier on Tuesday, repeated his longstanding view that he should already have won the Nobel Peace Prize. He cited his record of having “ended seven un-endable wars” and said, “everyone said I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\nTrump also condemned the states recognizing Palestine as “a reward for these horrible atrocities, including Oct. 7,” when Hamas carried out its deadly incursion into southern Israel, which killed more than 1,200 people. He insisted he was “deeply engaged” in seeking a Gaza ceasefire but argued that Hamas had repeatedly rejected “reasonable offers to make peace.”\n\nMacron used his General Assembly speech to defend the United Nations, declaring that “more than ever” the world needs the UN’s ‘spirit of cooperation.’ Trump, by contrast, dismissed the body as ineffective and even mocked its broken escalators and malfunctioning teleprompters.\n\nMacron acknowledged that despite France’s recognition of Palestinian statehood, Washington held the decisive leverage: “There is only one person who could do something in the current situation – the American president.”\n\nThe Israeli military is currently pushing to fully seize Gaza City, which it has threatened to destroy unless Hamas surrenders. Gazan health authorities say the death toll in the enclave has surpassed 65,300, though some observers believe it could be significantly higher, given that many bodies are likely buried under rubble from Israeli strikes.","summary":"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his US counterpart could only win the Nobel Peace Prize if he brings an end to the war in Gaza \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/625162-macron-trump-nobel-prize/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.09/article/68d332e0203027067540d75d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 23:54:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":362953088,"title":"‘Fired and investigated’: White House fury over Trump UN escalator fail","text":"New York: US President Donald Trump suffered a number of awkward tech difficulties during his visit to the United Nations headquarters, including a broken escalator and a faulty teleprompter.\n\nThe day was beset with technical problems for him after it was reported that UN workers had been overheard joking about switching off the power to an escalator.\n\nAccording to The Times, “figures inside the UN” were swapping ideas of pranks they could pull to highlight budget holes in the organisation after the Trump administration withheld funding.

A nearly half-century-old theory, long discredited, held that “refrigerator mothers” — cold or distant figures — were responsible for their children’s autism.\n\nTrump’s advice “took me straight back to when moms were blamed for autism,” said Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation. “He basically said, if you can’t take the pain, if you can’t deal with the fever, then it’s your fault.”\n\nTrump’s “tough it out” advice is familiar to Mary E. Fissell, a professor of medical history with Johns Hopkins University. “It’s the classic blame-the-mother …over and over again,” she said. The “maternal imagination,” for example, was a principle once thought to influence the way a baby forms.\n\n“It’s the idea that what a pregnant woman desires or feels or imagines will shape the form of her unborn child,” said Fissell, who focuses on 17th- and 18th-century medical history.\n\nTrump offered at least one moment of introspection during his news conference, acknowledging the awkward nature of his directive.\n\n“You know, it’s easy for me to say tough it out,” the president allowed. “But sometimes in life or a lot of other things, you have to tough it out also.”","summary":"“For decades, women have endured a paternalistic tone in medicine.\"","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/23/trump-tough-it-out/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/APTOPIX_Trump_92061.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 23:47:42","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":362949522,"title":"Trump says he doesn’t think Argentina needs a bailout, but US will help","text":"By FATIMA HUSSEIN, ALMUDENA CALATRAVA and DEBORA REY\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump stopped short Tuesday of promising Argentina’s President Javier Milei a financial bailout from the Latin American country’s economic turmoil.\n\n“We’re going to help them.

We need to be calm, clear and prudent - and act appropriately,\" he told reporters in Berlin after a meeting with his Swedish counterpart.\n\nAt alliance headquarters in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the Russian jets over Estonia had not been shot down as they had been assessed not to pose an immediate threat.\n\nBut he said NATO commanders had the authority to \"take the ultimate decision\" if they assessed that intruding aircraft did pose such a threat.\n\nNATO's Article 4 states that allies will \"consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security\" of a member is threatened.\n\nIt is only the ninth time in NATO's 76-year history that the article has been invoked - and two of those occasions have come this month in response to the incidents over Poland and Estonia.\n\n\"We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive. So we see what is happening,\" Rutte said.\n\n\"If it is not intentional, then it is blatantly incompetent. And of course, even if it is incompetence, we still have to defend ourselves.\"\n\nRussia said on Monday that Estonia's assertion that Russian jets violated Estonian airspace was unfounded and accused Tallinn of seeking to ratchet up East-West tensions.\n\nOn the Polish incident, Russia said its drones had carried out a major attack on military facilities in western Ukraine that night but had not planned to hit targets in Poland.\n\nIn its statement, NATO also said its members would not be deterred from continuing to support Ukraine \"in the exercise of its inherent right to self-defence against Russia's brutal and unprovoked war of aggression\".","summary":"NATO has warned it will defend European nations against threats, saying Moscow's recent actions 'endanger lives' and commanders will take action if necessary.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/conflict/nato-warns-russia-to-stop-escalatory-actions-c-20124124","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20124124/8d4dda0a23a2116e292c1307c8125ead790c523a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 23:33:07","author":"Andrew Gray","authors":["Andrew Gray"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":362950298,"title":"Brisbane news live: RACQ accused of ‘misleading’ customers over price hikes; Public to get first sneak peek of new Adelaide Street tunnel; Does Brisbane need a larger rectangular stadium?","text":"Thousands of people will today get a sneak peek of the new Adelaide Street tunnel, beneath Brisbane’s CBD.Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner has described the new Adelaide Street tunnel as the “biggest boost to underground infrastructure we’ve seen since the Queen Street bus station”, which was built for Expo ’88.LoadingHe said the new tunnel would take a lot of pressure off the Queen Street bus station, “which does a lot of the heavy lifting”.More than 1400 bus and Metro trips will traverse the 213-metre tunnel each weekday, which the council promises will reduce congestion in the CBD and create capacity for more services.The Adelaide Street tunnel is part of the Brisbane Metro project, which was first proposed by former lord mayor Graham Quirk in 2016.This will be the public’s only chance to experience the tunnel before it opens as a busway, with registration essential and open here.Latest postsLatest postsKeeping with Trump-related news for a moment … Health Minister Mark Butler has responded to US President Donald Trump’s claims yesterday that paracetamol use by pregnant women caused autism and that the childhood MMR vaccine should be “taken separately” rather than as a combined shot, after concerns that parents may refrain from getting their children vaccinated because of his claims.“I was really worried when those comments first started being reported … that’s why I asked the TGA, our medicines regulator, to look urgently at what the Americans were putting out to see if that was any reason to review our advice,” Butler said on Nine’s Today show this morning.“The advice of our regulator is that Panadol, which is our equivalent to paracetamol, is safe for pregnant women to use, not to overuse, but to use, particularly in the case of fever because we know untreated fever to be particularly dangerous for a pregnant woman and for her fetus as well.“The TGA reaffirmed the advice that’s been long-standing that [it] is a safe drug to take for pregnant women, particularly in the case of fever, that’s the same thing that other regulators have done very quickly after the president’s comments over the past couple of days.

I don’t want pregnant women right now to feel unsure about what to do. I don’t want women who were pregnant in the past to feel unsure or even guilty about the fact that they took a treatment that was advised to them as being safe.”On Trump’s childhood vaccination claims, Butler said, “I was really worried about that... I cannot say strongly enough: MMR is a free vaccine on the childhood immunisation program. It provides really strong protection against what are potentially very serious diseases.”Turning to world news for a moment … French President Emmanuel Macron likes to say that he can get US President Donald Trump on the phone any time he wants. In New York for the UN General Assembly, he proved it.Blocked on Monday night (US time) by police officers when he sought to cross a New York street – they told the French president the road was closed to let a VIP motorcade pass – Macron fished out his phone and dialled his US counterpart.“How are you?” Macron said. “Guess what? I’m waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you!”French media that filmed the scene said Trump was, in fact, on the other end of the line, which a French official confirmed to The Associated Press.Macron told the officers that he was trying to make his way on foot to France’s diplomatic mission in New York.“I have 10 people with me,” Macron said, trying to negotiate passage across the street.“I’m sorry president, I’m really sorry, it’s just that everything’s frozen right now,” one of the police officers told Macron.But since he had Trump’s ear, Macron took the opportunity to keep chatting. “I would love this weekend [to] have a short discussion with Qatar and you on the situation in Gaza,” he said.AP\n\nBrisbane Broncos and Maroons great Wally Lewis has revealed his desire to be buried at Suncorp Stadium.The NRL immortal, nicknamed The King and The Emperor of Lang Park, made the revelation in an interview with The Australian on Saturday.His intention is now gaining traction, with Queensland Rugby League boss Ben Ikin saying he could “certainly see Wally being buried out the front of the stadium under his statue”.

After that initial fill, Oracle expects each of the eight buildings to need another 12,000 gallons per year, which it describes as a “remarkably low figure for a facility of this scale.”\n\n“These data centers are designed to not use water,” Magouyrk said. “All of the data centers that we’re building (in) this part of Stargate are designed to not use water. The reason we do that is because it turns out that’s harmful for the environment and this is a better solution.”\n\nThe closed-loop system shows that the developer is “taking its impact on local public water supplies seriously,” but the overall environmental effect is more nuanced because such systems require more electricity, which also means higher indirect water usage through power generation, said Shaolei Ren, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied AI’s environmental toll.\n\nIndeed, the data center complex includes a new gas-fired power plant, using natural gas turbines similar to those that power warships. The companies say the plant is meant to provide backup power for the data halls and is a better option than traditional diesel generators. Most of the power comes from the local grid, sourced from a mix of natural gas with the sprawling wind and solar farms that dot the windy and sunny region.\n\nRen said that “even with emission-reduction measures, the health impacts of essentially turning the data center site into a power plant deserve further study for nearby communities.”\n\nArlene Mendler, a Stargate neighbor, said she wished she had more say in the project that eliminated a vast tract of mesquite shrubland, home to coyotes and roadrunners.\n\n“It has completely changed the way we were living,” said Mendler, who lives across the street. “We moved up here 33 years ago for the peace, quiet, tranquility.

Residents must follow a two-day-a-week outdoor watering schedule, trading off based on whether their address numbers are odd or even.\n\nOne million gallons of water from the city’s municipal water systems provides an “initial fill” for a closed-loop system that cools the data center’s computers and keeps the water from evaporating. After that initial fill, Oracle expects each of the eight buildings to need another 12,000 gallons per year, which it describes as a “remarkably low figure for a facility of this scale.”\n\n“These data centers are designed to not use water,” Magouyrk said. “All of the data centers that we’re building (in) this part of Stargate are designed to not use water. The reason we do that is because it turns out that’s harmful for the environment and this is a better solution.”\n\nThe closed-loop system shows that the developer is “taking its impact on local public water supplies seriously,” but the overall environmental effect is more nuanced because such systems require more electricity, which also means higher indirect water usage through power generation, said Shaolei Ren, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied AI’s environmental toll.\n\nIndeed, the data center complex includes a new gas-fired power plant, using natural gas turbines similar to those that power warships. The companies say the plant is meant to provide backup power for the data halls and is a better option than traditional diesel generators. Most of the power comes from the local grid, sourced from a mix of natural gas with the sprawling wind and solar farms that dot the windy and sunny region.\n\nRen said that “even with emission-reduction measures, the health impacts of essentially turning the data center site into a power plant deserve further study for nearby communities.”\n\nArlene Mendler, a Stargate neighbor, said she wished she had more say in the project that eliminated a vast tract of mesquite shrubland, home to coyotes and roadrunners.\n\n“It has completely changed the way we were living,” said Mendler, who lives across the street. “We moved up here 33 years ago for the peace, quiet, tranquility. After we got home from work, we could ride horses down the road. It was that type of a place.”\n\nNow, she doesn’t know what to do about the constant cacophony of construction sounds or the bright lights that have altered her nighttime views. The project was essentially a done deal once she found out about it.\n\n“They took 1,200 acres and just scraped it to bare dirt,” said her husband, Fred Mendler.\n\nThe first time most residents heard of Stargate — at least by that name — was when Trump announced the project shortly after returning to the White House in January. Originally planned as a facility to mine cryptocurrency, developers had pivoted and expanded their designs to tailor the project to the AI boom sparked by ChatGPT.\n\nThe partnership said at that time it was investing $100 billion — and eventually up to $500 billion — to build large-scale data centers and the energy generation needed to further AI development. More recently, OpenAI signed a deal to buy $300 billion of computing capacity from Oracle. It’s a huge bet for the San Francisco-based AI startup, which was founded as a nonprofit.\n\nOpenAI and Oracle invited media and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tour the site for the first time Tuesday.\n\nCruz called Texas “ground zero for AI” because if “you’re building a data center, what do you want? No. 1, you want abundant, low-cost energy.”\n\nOf the other five Stargate data center projects announced Tuesday, Oracle is working with OpenAI to build one just northeast of Abilene, in Shackelford County, Texas, and another in New Mexico’s Doña Ana County. It also said it is working to build one in the Midwest.\n\nSoftbank said it has broken ground on two more in Lordstown, Ohio, and in Milam County, Texas.\n\nThe projects offer OpenAI a way to break out from its longtime partnership with Microsoft, which until recently was the startup’s exclusive computing partner. Altman told The Associated Press his company has been “severely limited for the value we can offer to people.”\n\n“ChatGPT is slow. It’s not as smart as we’d like to be. Many users can’t use it as much as they would like,” Altman said. “We have many other ideas and products we want to build.”\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.","summary":"This expansion is part of a $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/23/openai-stargate/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OpenAI_Stargate_43284-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 23:09:05","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":362946578,"title":"To pretend Trump's meeting with PM doesn't matter ignores AUKUS reality","text":"Anthony Albanese finally has an answer to the question he's thoroughly sick of being asked. He will meet Donald Trump at the White House on October 20.\n\nUnless he cancels again, of course. This time, however, the Australian side wisely waited for the White House to announce the meeting.\n\nWhen the prime minister spoke to the president on the phone three weeks ago, both sides apparently agreed a face-to-face was \"necessary\".\n\nA proper sit-down\n\nSources familiar with the conversation say the White House made it clear they wanted it to be a proper sit-down in the Oval Office, rather than a catch up on the sidelines of a summit, where it could be squeezed or cut altogether, should something come up.\n\nThe date wasn't fixed, but for three weeks the Australian side was confident the meeting would finally happen. It explains why Albanese was so relaxed and even dismissive whenever pressed about it.\n\nThe meeting is necessary and matters. To pretend it's not ignores the reality of Australia's increasing reliance on the US under AUKUS.\n\nHence, the hair-pulling anxiety of some in the security establishment over how long it's taken.\n\nFor the US, Australia matters too. Or at least it should. Australia may not be top of mind for Trump, or even in his mind at all, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nA laundry list of grievances\n\nIf the president's rambling 58-minute address to the United Nations was an insight into his worldview, it was also a reminder of how little Australia occupies his thinking.\n\nTo put it mildly, he has a lot of global grievances and had a lot to get off his chest in this lecture to world leaders.\n\nThe speech began with the obligatory list of Trump's amazing achievements, before a detour into faulty teleprompters and escalators at the UN. He missed out on a renovation contract for the building years ago and bemoaned the lack of marble flooring (\"You walk on terrazzo, did you know that?\").\n\nBut this was nothing compared to his dim view of the rest of the world.\n\nHis attitude was summed up in one line: \"I'm really good at this stuff, your countries are going to hell.\"\n\nGermany, Greece, Austria and Switzerland all came in for criticism for \"uncontrolled\" migration.\n\nThe UK and others copped it for building too many wind and solar farms. Part of the \"green energy scam\" Trump described as \"the greatest con job on the world ever perpetrated\".\n\nBrazil was accused of \"targeting political critics in the United States\".\n\nVenezuelan drug cartels were in the firing line.\n\nChina and India were blamed for being \"primary funders\" of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nNoticeably, there was no criticism of Israel over the ongoing crisis in Gaza, and only a relatively mild rebuke for \"some\" countries moving to recognise Palestinian statehood and delivering a \"reward\" to Hamas. There was stronger criticism of the UN escalators.\n\nNo mention of Australia\n\nOn all these issues, there was no mention of Australia. Not one.\n\nTrump clearly disagrees with Albanese on Palestine and the reality of climate change, but it's not on the scale of the beef he has with other countries, including some US allies.\n\nThe prime minister will need to navigate these differences when he buckles up for his Oval Office meeting. These encounters on Trump's home turf, televised live, can be a wild ride.\n\nHe will also need to register a complaint about Trump's tariffs, but not too loudly. The tariffs on Australia, as the government likes to point out, are as low or lower than any other country.\n\nThe main purpose of the meeting will be establishing a personal relationship, locking in support for AUKUS and trying to get a sense of how Trump views the ongoing role of the US in the Asia-Pacific region. How far he's willing to go to maintain America's position remains a mystery.\n\nFor now, at least, Albanese has an answer to that pesky question. He's finally booked in for a White House meeting.\n\nDavid Speers is national political lead and host of Insiders, which airs on ABC TV at 9am on Sunday or on iview.","summary":"Trump clearly disagrees with Albanese on Palestine and the reality of climate change, but it's not on the scale of the beef he has with other countries.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-24/anthony-albanese-donald-trump-meeting/105801298","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e36765cae3b0f306c04c71396648af3e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2073&cropW=3685&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 23:07:13","author":"David Speers","authors":["David Speers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":362948756,"title":"Blake Lively Is Changing Her Story NOW!

He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nBut then the president laid into his hosts. The UN, he said, had not helped his peace-making. He questioned the organisation's purpose, saying it had tremendous potential but was not living up to that. All it did, he claimed, was write strongly worded letters that it did not follow up on. Empty words, he said, did not end wars.\n\nHe also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying, \"The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.\" The president even attacked the UN for a broken escalator and teleprompter that disrupted his visit and speech.\n\nOn one level, he has a point. Many analysts question the effectiveness of the UN in resolving conflicts these days, pointing in particular to gridlock in the Security Council and the body's unresponsive bureaucracy.\n\nBut on another level Trump can be seen himself a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness; for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn much of its UN funding, leaving the body forced to cut its humanitarian work around the world.\n\nTrump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration.\n\n\"Europe is in serious trouble. They have been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody has ever seen before… Both the immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,\" he said.\n\nClimate change, he claimed to audible gasps, was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and was lumbering European countries with expensive energy costs compared to fossil fuels. He criticised in particular the UK government for imposing new taxes on North Sea oil.\n\n\"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" he said.\n\n\"I love Europe. I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake… you want to be politically correct and you are destroying your heritage.\"\n\nNote that last point. It echoes what the president said during his state visit to the UK last week when he spoke of the importance of defending the values of what he called \"the English-speaking world\".\n\nThere is a cultural edge to Mr Trump's criticism of Europe, a sense that he believes uncontrolled immigration is threatening what he sees as Europe's Judeo Christian heritage. Not for nothing is Trump the leader of an administration that wears its religion firmly on its sleeve. \"Let us protect religious liberty,\" he told the UN, \"including for the most persecuted religion on the planet today – it's called Christianity.\"\n\nOn a specific point of policy, the most substantive warning Trump gave related to Russia's war on Ukraine. He said President Putin's refusal to end the conflict was \"not making Russia look good\". He said the US was prepared \"to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs\" to end the bloodshed. But he said European nations had to stop buying Russian energy, claiming he only found out two weeks ago that some were doing so.\n\nIn practice, Hungary and Slovakia are the only substantive European buyers of Russian oil. Diplomats say Mr Trump is hiding behind this so he does not have to impose secondary sanctions on India and China, which are both buying huge amounts of cheap Russian energy, both of whom were cited by Trump.\n\nPerhaps more important than his speech was Trump's social media post a short while later, where he asserted for the first time that Ukraine could be in a position to win back all of its territory.\n\nHis dismissal of Russia as a \"paper tiger\" and not a \"real military power\" will hurt President Putin, who is sensitive to any suggestion his country is not a global player. Diplomats said this was the latest example of Mr Trump's journey towards a position that is more critical of Russia.\n\nBut one should always treat Trump's words with a pinch of salt. He was being optimistic only moments after meeting Ukraine's President Zelensky at the UN.\n\nAnd he said Ukraine could win back territory with EU and Nato support; there was no mention of the US involvement. All the evidence of the last few years is that this is a war of slow attrition, and Ukraine would not retake land from Russia without massive US military support.\n\nSo this was undiluted Trump: a defence of America and the nation state, an assault on multilateralism and globalism, a stream of consciousness with questionable assertions.\n\nSix years ago, Trump's audience at the UN laughed at his at times unfactual assertions; this year, they listened largely in silence.\n\n\"I am really good at this stuff,\" he told world leaders. \"Your countries are going to hell.\"","summary":"Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/six-years-ago-trumps-un-audience-laughed-this-year-they-were-silent/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1950.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:53:30","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 53pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 53pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":362939890,"title":"‘Don’t verbal me’: PM erupts at Aussie journo over Trump","text":"The PM tussled with The Nightly’s Latika Bourke on Tuesday, US time, at the New York office of Aussie investment bank Macquarie.\n\nShe had questioned him about a comment he made in April during a pre-election debate when Channel 7’s Mark Riley asked Mr Albanese if he had Donald Trump’s phone number.\n\n“No. I’m not sure that he has a mobile phone, the US President. Or Joe Biden. It’s not the way it works… with any global leader.\n\n“There’s people taking notes from either side, it’s not a casual relationship.\n\n“I don’t have Donald Trump’s number”. \n\nYet, in New York, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly called Mr Trump directly when he got stuck in traffic around the UN to see if the US leader could help in through the jam. Although it’s not confirmed he had Mr Trump’s phone number either or if he called one of his entourage.\n\nWhen Bourke brought up his comments about not having Mr Trump’s digits, Mr Albanese jumped in before she could even get the full question out.\n\n“Don’t verbal me, don’t verbal me,” he said\n\n“I didn’t say that, but anyway, keep going.\n\n“If I did (say it), it’s called a joke, humour.\n\n“Obviously he has a mobile phone.\n\n“The point I was making was between leaders of nations. You organise phone calls, you have note takers, you do it in rooms where mobiles aren’t allowed. That’s the point”.\n\nMeeting confirmed\n\nThe White House has confirmed that Mr Albanese will finally meet President Trump in person for a formal meeting. \n\nBut it won’t be while Mr Albanese is in the US on his current trip that coincides with the United Nations General Assembly — rather, it will be next month in Washington DC.\n\nThat will necessitate Mr Albanese flying to the US for the third time in five months. \n\nThe ABC reported that a White House official confirmed a meeting in the US capital on October 20. It is expected to be a substantial meeting, potentially with an Oval Office audience with the president. \n\nMr Albanese has been trying for months to get a sit down audience with Mr Trump. \n\nA meeting was supposed to happen at the G7 summit in Canada in June. But Mr Trump left the summit a day early, leaving Mr Albanese – and a number of other leaders – without their promised face-to-face.\n\nThere were expectations they might have met this week as world leaders gathered in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. \n\nBut the memorial of Charlie Kirk on Sunday meant there was little time to shoehorn in a meeting with Mr Trump.\n\nNonetheless, a number of world leaders have secured bilateral meetings with Mr Trump, including the head of the EU and the presidents of Argentina and Ukraine. \n\nMr Albanese may yet meet Mr Trump at a reception on Tuesday evening, US time. But that meeting would be very informal and little more than a quick chat.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has told an Aussie reporter “don’t verbal me” after she questioned him over an eye-opening Donald Trump assertion he made in April.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/white-house-confirms-pm-albanese-will-meet-us-president-donald-trump/news-story/7a37eaa44f8682125d32fa0411a13d8a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b413cf75a1b21a91ff96ba05d69d953c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:50:52","author":"Benedict Brook In The Us","authors":["Benedict Brook In The Us"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":362945332,"title":"Evening Edition: President Trump Calls Out The U.N.

They point to rising temperatures, stronger storms, and melting ice as clear signs. \n\nGroups like the UN have warned that waiting too long to act could cause serious damage to the planet and people.\n\nTrump spoke for several minutes out of his neator-hour speech on climate change during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, warned that ountries that have invested heavily in renewable energy that their economies will suffer.\n\n'All green is all bankrupt. That's what it represents. And it's not politically correct, I'll be very badly criticized for saying it, but I'm here to tell the truth.'\n\n'It's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,' Trump told the General Assembly. \n\n'All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong.'\n\nHe added: 'They were made by stupid people that have cost their country's fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.'\n\n'And I'm really good at predicting things, you know?… I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything. \n\n'And I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.

President Trump gave a speech – he's entitled to give his views,' he says.\n\n'I don't think that they are any views that he hasn't said before.'\n\nThe Prime Minister last week said the target of between 62 to 70 per cent emissions reduction by 2035 would be bolstered by an additional $2 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and a new $5 billion Net Zero Fund to help industries decarbonise.\n\n'Our government knows that climate change is real and we want to continue to seize the economic opportunity that the energy transition offers our nation,' he told reporters in Sydney. \n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen said the climate target would be ambitious and achievable.\n\n'The global shift to clean energy is the biggest economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution and it presents Australia with our best ever economic opportunity if we get this right,' he said.\n\n'We can use these advantages to power hundreds of thousands of jobs and new investment to set us up for a bright economic future.'\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement signed a decade ago, members must increase their emissions reduction targets every five years and cannot water them down.\n\nNations that signed up must submit their new targets by the end of September.\n\nThe commitment builds on the existing 2030 target to cut emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 levels and serves as another stepping stone on the way to net zero by 2050.\n\nEnvironment groups, unions and social services organisations were among those calling for an ambitious target.\n\nThe business community was more cautious, warning that emission cuts above 70 per cent would risk more than $150 billion in exports and send companies offshore.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, which Australia and 195 other parties adopted in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAnthony Albanese\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump issues urgent warning for Australia about Anthony Albanese's green vision for the country\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Donald Trump has a message for Australia.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15127473/Donald-Trump-issues-urgent-warning-Australia-Anthony-Albaneses-green-vision-country.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/23/23/102392577-0-image-a-1_1758666567559.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:42:24","author":"Cameron Carpenter,Editor","authors":["Cameron Carpenter","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":362938230,"title":"Schumer blames Trump for shutdown after he backs out of meeting with Democrats","text":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that President Donald Trump would bear the blame for a government shutdown after he backed out of a meeting with Democratic leaders that had been set for later this week.\n\n\"Donald Trump is causing the shutdown.

Democratic leaders have for weeks said Republicans must negotiate with them in order to secure the necessary Democratic support to pass a package.\n\nIn his post, Trump said, \"After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\"\n\nSchumer mocked Trump's reputation as a negotiator.\n\n\"This is not what the American people want or deserve.

But Democrats, who faced blowback in March for providing the votes necessary to keep the government open, say now is the time to fight for health care priorities.\n\n\"We Democrats are ready to work together to keep the government open for the good of the country and the good of the American people, but Donald Trump is simply ducking his responsibility as president,\" Schumer said. \"He says Democrats have a radical agenda.

And the reason he can do more than us, is because we do not supply weapons that allow the war in Gaza to be waged. We do not supply equipment that allows war to be waged in Gaza. The United States of America does,” Macron told France’s BFM TV from New York.\nEarlier in the day, Trump in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly rejected the moves by Western allies to recognise Palestine state, saying that would be a reward for Hamas militant group.\nReacting to the speech, Macron said: “I see an American president who is involved, who reiterated this morning from the podium: ‘I want peace. I have resolved seven conflicts’, who wants the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Peace Prize is only possible if you stop this conflict.”\nAccording to Reuters, several countries, including Israel, Pakistan and Cambodia, have nominated Trump for the annual prize for brokering peace agreements or ceasefires.

This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service, Department of Florida Law Enforcement, and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime, and acted by following him, and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff’s Office, IMMEDIATELY, which led to his arrest and conviction. What incredible instinct and foresight this person had — A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” he added.\nMeanwhile, Routh likely tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was read, a person in the courtroom told CNN. Authorities stopped him from doing so. His daughter also had an emotional outburst in the courtroom after the verdict was read.\nRouth’s attempt to kill Trump on September 15, 2024, came nine weeks after then presidential candidate narrowly survived a previous attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In the earlier case, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired eight shots at Trump, with one bullet grazing his ear, before being killed by Secret Service counter-snipers, The Guardian reported.","summary":"Ryan Routh was found guilty of attempting to kill Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Club.

The person could not publicly disclose specific details of the incident and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAs marshals were dragging him from the courtroom, Routh’s daughter Sara Routh began screaming, “Dad I love you, don’t do anything. I’ll get you out. He didn’t hurt anybody.”\n\nShe continued screaming as her father was taken from the courtroom, saying the case against him was rigged. She was escorted from the courtroom and later waited outside with her brother Adam Routh for the motorcade that took their father away.\n\nBack inside the courtroom, Routh was brought before the judge, no longer wearing a jacket and tie. During the trial, Routh, who was representing himself, was not shackled. But when he was brought before the judge after the attempted stabbing, he wore shackles.\n\nThe judge announced Routh will be sentenced on Dec. 18 at 9:30 a.m. He faces life in prison.\n\nRouth’s standby defense attorneys did not have a comment following the verdict.\n\nRouth had been charged with attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges and defended himself in court.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Trump told reporters in New York that the case was “really well handled.”\n\n“It’s very important. You can’t let things like that happen. Nothing to do with me, but a president — or even a person, you can’t allow that to happen,” Trump said. “And so justice was served. But I very much appreciate the judge and jury and everybody on that.”\n\nProsecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club.\n\nRouth told jurors in his closing argument that he didn’t intend to kill anyone that day.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled,” Routh said. He pointed out that he could see Trump as he was on the path toward the sixth-hole green at the golf course and noted that he also could have shot a Secret Service agent who confronted him if he had intended to harm anyone.\n\nRouth, 59, exercised his constitutional right not to testify in his own defense. He rested his case Monday morning after questioning just three witnesses — a firearms expert and two character witnesses — for a total of about three hours. In contrast, prosecutors spent seven days questioning 38 witnesses.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that the guilty verdict “illustrates the Department of Justice’s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence.”\n\n“This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation,” Bondi said.\n\n“This verdict sends a clear message. An attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is an attack on our Republic and on the rights of every citizen,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement. “The Department of Justice will relentlessly pursue those who try to silence political voices, and no enemy, foreign or domestic, will ever silence the will of the American people.”","summary":"The man who was charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course last year tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen shortly after being found guilty of all counts on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/23/jury-convicts-would-be-trump-assassin/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25249058754277.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:33:08","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":362935594,"title":"Trump says he will help Argentina, World Bank to accelerate support","text":"Donald Trump shares a light moment with Argentine President Javier Milei during their meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. (AP pic)\nUNITED NATIONS: President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States would help Argentina but he did not think a financial bailout was needed as the World Bank said it would accelerate US$4 billion in previously planned public-private investments for Argentina.\nTrump spoke alongside Argentine President Javier Milei as the two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, a day after treasury secretary scott Bessent said all options were on the table for stabilising the Latin American nation's financial markets.\n\"We're going to help them. I don't think they need a bailout,\" Trump told reporters in New York.\n\"Scott is working with their country so that they can get good debt and all of the things that you need to make Argentina great again,\" Trump added. He offered his endorsement for Milei's re-election bid so that his counterpart has another term \"to complete the job.\"\nAsked for more detail on the US efforts, Trump said, \"We are giving the president of Argentina our full backing and endorsement.\"\nBessent said on Monday that all options were on the table for the US to stabilise Argentina's financial markets, including tapping the US$219.5 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund to buy pesos or Argentine dollar-denominated debt, or opening currency swap lines with Latin America's third-largest economy.\nBessent had said any decision on specific US actions would come after he and Trump met with Milei, but there were no announcements by late Tuesday afternoon. A treasury spokesperson did not respond to a Reuters query about the meeting.\nThe US pledge of support for Trump's right-wing ally Milei extended Monday's rally in Argentina's markets, as international bonds rose and the peso strengthened almost 5% against the dollar.\nWorld Bank investments \nSeparately, the World Bank Group said it was accelerating its US$12 billion support plan for Argentina by deploying up to US$4 billion of the total over the coming months through public-sector financing and private-sector investment.\nThe development lender will prioritise projects in key areas such as mining, energy and tourism for early consideration by the bank's executive board, a World Bank spokesperson said. The bank did not disclose specific projects to be funded.\nDemocratic US senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday accused Bessent of offering to bail out Argentina's financial markets with American taxpayer funds, asking him in a letter to explain the move and to provide details of any expected costs.\n\"At a time when Americans are struggling to afford groceries, rent, credit card bills, and other debt payments ... it is deeply troubling that the president intends to use significant emergency funds to inflate the value of a foreign government’s currency and bolster its financial markets,\" wrote Warren, the top Democrat on the senate banking committee.","summary":"The US leader sees no need for a bailout, offering full backing while keeping all measures to support Latin American markets.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/09/24/trump-says-he-will-help-argentina-world-bank-to-accelerate-support","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/350a6dd3-donald-trump-milei.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:31:32","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":362949518,"title":"Trump’s Tylenol and vaccine warnings leave some pregnant women concerned, others angry","text":"By LAURA UNGAR\n\nFaith Ayer had no qualms about taking Tylenol for chronic migraines and COVID-19 during her pregnancy, and grew disappointed and angry as she watched President Donald Trump rail against the pain medicine.\n\n“A lot of the claims that were shared have just not been backed by evidence,” said Ayer, a nurse practitioner in Jacksonville, Florida, who is about 17 weeks pregnant with her first child. She said Trump’s words have implications “for patients across the country and even across the world.”\n\nDuring a White House news conference on Monday, Trump repeatedly warned pregnant women not to take Tylenol because of the risk of autism in their children. He also fueled debunked claims that ingredients in vaccines or timing shots close together could contribute to rising rates of autism. Trump’s comments left some pregnant women angry and others with questions.\n\nDr. R. Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, said he’s already heard from a few patients and expects to get a lot more questions in the coming weeks.\n\n“People are concerned,” he said. “But what I’m doing is reassuring patients that there is no causation that has ever been proven.”\n\nMoms have mixed reactions to Trump’s announcement\n\nAs a nurse, Ayer knew she didn’t have a lot of options for treating her migraines and a fever she spiked during a bout of COVID-19.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has long considered Tylenol, also known by the generic name acetaminophen, one of the only safe pain relievers during pregnancy. Five years ago, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin or ibuprofen might cause rare but serious kidney problems in a fetus.\n\n“Weighing benefits and risks, I had no reservations when taking Tylenol,” the 30-year-old Ayer said, especially since she knew that untreated fevers in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, increase the risk for miscarriages, preterm birth and other problems.\n\nDespite her medical knowledge, she had a conversation with her doctor about taking Tylenol “and kind of got the all clear on their end, too.”\n\nWhen she gives birth, she plans to give her baby all the vaccines that medical experts recommend.\n\nBut other pregnant women are not so sure about things.\n\nDr. Stella Dantas, an OB-GYN in Portland, Oregon, said she was starting to get questions through her patient email system.\n\n“I anticipate we’re going to have a lot of anxiety about using acetaminophen, which we counsel them is OK to use if they have a headache, if they have a fever,” she said. “There are a number of reasons patients will need to take it, and patients already feel anxious about taking any medication in pregnancy.”\n\nDoctors reassure patients that Tylenol and vaccines are safe\n\nDr. Clayton Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina, is drafting up standard responses for the nursing team to give out to Tylenol inquiries.\n\nThe main message: Tylenol has been around for decades, is safe, and has not been shown to cause autism.\n\nAcetaminophen use during pregnancy hadn’t increased in recent decades like autism rates have, according to the Coalition of Autism Scientists.\n\nSome studies have raised the possibility that taking acetaminophen in pregnancy might be associated with a risk of autism — but many others haven’t found a connection. One challenge is that it’s hard to disentangle the effects of Tylenol use from the effects of high fevers during pregnancy.\n\nScience has shown autism is mostly rooted in genetics. Experts say different combinations of genes and other factors — such as age of the child’s father and whether the mother had health problems during the pregnancy — can all affect how a fetal brain develops.\n\nBesides letting patients know “there has been no causal link established or proven” between Tylenol use in pregnancy and autism, Dantas said she’s also advising patients against “toughing it out” if they have fever or pain.\n\n“A healthy pregnancy starts with a healthy mom,” Dantas said. “So I would ask patients if they are concerned to consult their physicians. And trust in the medical advice given to them.”\n\nDoctors said much the same about advising patients to get their newborns vaccinated.

After Admitting She was 'Concerned' About Their Skills","text":"Kamala Harris has revealed she had \"concerns\" with some of Joe Biden's campaign advisers when she first took over his doomed presidential run just months before the election, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nThe former vice president brought in her own staff after worrying about Biden's \"dog-and-pony bulls---.\"In her explosive new memoir recounting her rushed campaign, 107 Days, Harris admits there were questions during those early days over how the campaign \"needed to be reshaped.\" Namely, which staff members should stay and which should go.\n\nHarris writes that some of Biden's top advisers saw things differently than she did. \n\n\"I had my concerns,\" she writes. \"Some, like Mike Donilon, one of Joe's closest advisers, had moved from the West Wing to the campaign because he was an expert in channeling Joe; he knew Joe's every whim and inflection.\n\n\"It was unclear how that expertise could work for me. In fact, he left the campaign and returned to the West Wing less than two weeks later.\"'Fixing the Problem'Harris complained the campaign lacked a specific direction and was only interested in \"(fixing) the problem by throwing money at it.\"\n\nShe was also surprised by how gently Biden was treated.\n\nThe former candidate explains: \"For several months, the Biden-Harris campaign team had been holding meetings in what's called the 'tennis hut,' a pavilion on the grounds of the White House. These political briefings often made no sense to me. \n\n\"Mike Donilon would filter the data from the polls and present the numbers in soothing terms: that the razor-thin, within-the-margin-of-error results were no cause for hair on fire; that really there was nothing to see here.\" \n\nShe continues: \"My chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, turned to me as we left one of these meetings and said, 'If I ever organized that sort of dog-and-pony bulls--- for you, you'd have my head on a platter.\"Harris Tells-AllHarris packed her book with accusations and revelations about her former boss, detailing just how big a role former First Lady Jill Biden played in her husband's decision to run again.\n\n\"'It's Joe and Jill’s decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness?\" the 60-year-old writes.\n\n\"In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"Loyal Until the EndHarris argues that Biden was simply getting more tired with age, while refusing to refute published reports that he was suffering from severe cognitive decline.\n\n\"Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity. Here is the truth as I lived it. Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president,\" the former U.S. senator explains in the book.\n\n\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired. That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles,\" Harris claims.\n\n\"I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so.

In it, Harris recounts her belief that selecting Buttigieg could have posed too great a political risk.\n\n“I guess I’d ask you to just elaborate on that a little bit. It’s hard to hear,” Maddow told her, noting that Harris herself broke barriers as the first woman and first black and South Asian American elected vice president. “To say that he couldn’t be on the ticket effectively because he was gay, it’s hard to hear.”\n\nHarris denied dismissing Buttigieg solely on those grounds. \n\n“That’s not what I said, that he couldn’t be on the ticket because he is gay,” Harris said.\n\nInstead, she argued that the short campaign timeline and the stakes of running against Trump made it too risky to pair a black woman and a gay man on the same ticket.\n\n“My point is … it made me very sad. But I also realized it would be a real risk,” Harris said, emphasizing that she has always supported LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 107 Days, Harris wrote that Buttigieg “would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight White man.”\n\nShe ultimately chose Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), though his candidacy later drew scrutiny over questions about his military service record, his relationship with China, and various progressive legislative actions as governor.\n\nButtigieg, asked about the book’s account, said he was surprised. \n\n“I just believe in giving Americans more credit than that,” he told Politico. “My experience in politics has been the way that you earn trust with the voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories.”\n\nPolitical observers are already eyeing Buttigieg as a likely contender in the 2028 Democratic primary.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, told Maddow she may have been “too cautious” but stood by her decision: “Maybe I was … but that’s the decision I made.”\n\nGrenell, however, dismissed her defense as nothing more than political convenience.\n\n“Don’t pick us because it might hurt you — hypocrite,” he said.","summary":"Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell slams Kamala Harris over her explanation for passing on Pete Buttigieg as a running mate in 2024, accusing her of hypocrisy and political convenience. “Typical Lefty.

General Assembly on Tuesday. \"Now they want to go to sharia law ... Both their immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe.\"While Mr. Trump used the word \"they\" without clarifying if he meant Khan and London, his comments echoed long running far-right conspiracy theories online linking Khan, who is the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London, to Islamic fundamentalism. There is no evidence that Khan has advocated for London to officially adopt Sharia, a system of religious laws that is used in some Muslim countries but not by the U.K. government.\"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response,\" a spokesperson for London's mayor told CBS News in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. \"London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.\"CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.A number of politicians in Britain came to Khan's defense following Trump's comments, including members of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Khan is a member of Starmer's ruling, left-leaning Labour party. \"Sadiq Khan is not trying to impose Sharia Law on London,\" U.K. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a post on X Tuesday. \"This is a Mayor who marches with pride, who stands up for differences of background and opinion, who's focused on improving our transport, our air, our streets, our safety, our choices and chances.\"Mr. Trump's remarks — made within a wider context of criticizing the immigration policy of European countries — revived a spat between Khan and the president that stretches back nearly a decade. In 2015, Sadiq Khan roundly condemned then-candidate Donald Trump after he called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" on national security grounds, following a terrorist attack in California. Early in his first term, Mr. Trump moved to restrict travel to the U.S. by residents of several mostly Muslim countries, though it did not explicitly ban entry to the U.S. by all Muslims.That initial criticism has led to a colorful back-and-forth between the two over the years. Just last week, Mr. Trump said Khan was \"among the worst mayors in the world,\" and told reporters that he asked that Khan not be present at the banquet hosted by King Charles III during the president's state visit to the U.K. Mr. Trump has also often claimed that crime in London has risen dramatically during Khan's tenure, including in last week's comments to reporters, when he said crime in London was \"through the roof.\" Overall recorded crime in London has increased by 31.5% over the past 10 years, with violent crime increasing by 40%, according to U.K. office for National Statistics data cited by CBS News' partners at the BBC. Khan first took office as London's mayor in May 2016. But data from the Metropolitan Police shows that London had a homicide rate of 11.8 per million people in 2024. That makes the homicide rate in England's capital lower than in a number of major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., according to data cited by the White House.","summary":"President Trump suggested Tuesday that London officials want to \"go to sharia law,\" a comment London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office called \"bigoted\" and \"appalling.\"","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-trump-sharia-law/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/14/d76280ed-433b-428b-9a9d-62346b1bc430/thumbnail/1200x630/f603a7c6466bc27e40983703475a7ef3/gettyimages-2183359538.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:27:07","author":"Emmet Lyons","authors":["Emmet Lyons"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":362951090,"title":"After turbulent year, Penn climbs to No. 7 in U.S. News rankings of universities","text":"After a tumultuous year that included a number of battles with the Trump administration, the University of Pennsylvania was ranked No. 7 in U.S. News & World Report's annual analysis of America's colleges and universities, which was published Tuesday. \n\nThe West Philly institution bounced back from last year when it fell to 10th — its lowest ranking since 1997. In the national universities category, which measures 1,700 schools across the country, Penn was behind only Princeton, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale and Chicago, and it was tied with Duke, Johns Hopkins and Northwestern. \n\nIn other metrics, Penn was tied with MIT for the top spot in business programs and landed as No. 13 for best value schools with a $25,315 price tag (cost after receiving grants). \n\nU.S. News, which has seen its fair share of criticism over the years for its methodology, used 17 factors to determine the 2026 rankings, including graduation rates, first-year retention rates, borrower debt and peer assessment. To qualify, schools need to grant bachelor's degrees, hold regional accreditation, accept applicants for first-year, full-time students and offer an on-campus-based education. \n\nThe release of the report comes during a combative year between the White House and universities. Within a few days of taking office in January, President Donald Trump said schools receiving federal funding needed to end diversity, equity and inclusion programming. As a result, Penn eventually scrubbed diversity mentions from its website, closed its office of equal opportunity in the Carey Law School and paused the Sadie Alexander scholarship for students studying racial justice, although it recently launched a fellowship named after the prominent alumnus. \n\nA few months later, Trump paused $175 million in federal funding to Penn after the Department of Education said the school violated Title IX for allowing transgender graduate Lia Thomas to compete on the women's NCAA swimming and diving team during the 2021-2022 school year. Penn later agreed to restore Division I records and titles to female athletes who lost to Thomas, and the school banned transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.\n\nOther local schools\n\nIn the U.S. News rankings for national universities, Villanova was the next highest Philly-area school at No. 57. Drexel also cracked the top 100, rising six spots to No. 80, and Rutgers University in Camden was No. 97. Meanwhile, Temple fell four slots to No. 102, a further drop from its high of No. 89 in 2023, Thomas Jefferson University was No. 132, and La Salle tied for No. 257. \n\nSchools were also ranked based on groupings for National Liberal Arts Colleges, Regional Universities and Regional Colleges. Locally in those categories, Saint Joseph's University was ranked No. 6 in Regional Universities North, and Swarthmore College in Delaware County was fourth in National Liberal Arts Colleges.","summary":"The University of Pennsylvania climbed to No. 7 in U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of America's colleges and universities.

The American’s team-mates appear to be kinder, however, with Xander Schauffele going as far as to call him a ‘golfing gladiator’ on Tuesday.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to learn Keegan Bradley’s side view the LIV rebel as their rabble-rouser-in-chief and expect to leverage a significant advantage from his propensity to inspire bedlam.\n\nThat would be a legacy of his vast popularity on social media, which allied with a quirky personality and cavalier playing style has made him the pied piper of US golf. Where he goes, the galleries follow, his friend Donald Trump included.\n\nSchauffele, in particular, has noted that this week’s Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black will place DeChambeau in his element and believes the histrionics will be worth their weight in points.\n\n‘I was telling Keegan, I feel like Bryson could be like the difference for us in a strange way from the standpoint of feeding into these fans, the style of golf he plays,’ said Schauffele.\n\n‘I'll make a putt, and you won't see too much of a reaction. That's just who I am. That's kind of how I operate. Maybe it might change this week, who knows - these Ryder Cups bring out the best in you at times.\n\n‘But Bryson, this is his arena. If he views himself as a gladiator golfer, this is as good as it gets.\n\n‘He's been awesome here. He's been awesome in the team room. I'm excited to sort of see what he can do, and hopefully get a lot of points up on the board because his points might hit harder than maybe my points, for example, just because of how he might celebrate and get these fans into this tournament quickly.’\n\nIf that was a way of tapping into the point that DeChambeau is an attention-seeker, then it was a more subtle and flattering route than the one chosen by McIlroy recently. \n\nOwing to their history, which included McIlroy’s choke to DeChambeau’s benefit at the US Open last year and then the world No 2 blanking the American in the final round of the Masters, McIlroy was withering in his depiction of the 32-year-old, saying: ‘I think the only way he gets attention is by mentioning other people. That is basically what I think of that. To get attention he will mention me or Scottie [Scheffler] or others.’\n\nFormer US golfer-turned-pundit Brandel Chamblee, a fierce critic of LIV, went further this week in painting DeChambeau as a ‘circus barker’ whose social media popularity has been enhanced by bot accounts. He also called him an ‘odd duck’ and ‘captain’s nightmare’ in a team environment.\n\nCertainly, the American’s presence will be divisive and box office. It will also be fascinating to see if he can handle the hoopla he brings his own way – the emotion he whipped up in the Masters final round appeared counter-productive as he was soundly beaten in his head-to-head with McIlroy. Scottie Scheffler is among those who see only an upside, saying the US look forward to ‘unleashing him’, as if this corner of New York needed any further invitation to get rowdy.","summary":"RIATH AL-SAMARRAI: There are a great many ways to describe Bryson DeChambeau, and Rory McIlroy, for one, has tended towards the incendiary of late.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-15127035/Bryson-DeChambeau-Team-USA-Ryder-Cup.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/23/23/102392213-0-image-a-84_1758666024601.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:20:56","author":"Editor,Riath Al-Samarrai","authors":["Editor","Riath Al-Samarrai"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.255},{"id":362935006,"title":"Trump Has Declared Antifa a 'Major Terrorist Organization,' but Experts Say It Isn't an Actual Group","text":"President Donald Trump has designated \"antifa\" as a \"major terrorist organization.\"\n\n In a Sept. 17 post on Truth Social, the president said he was \"pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.\"\n\n \"I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,\" he added.\n\n Then, on Sept. 22, Trump officially signed an executive order titled \"Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.\"\n\n In the executive order, the Trump administration defined antifa as \"a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.\"\n\n \"It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals,\" the order claimed.\n\n Trump previously announced plans to make such a proclamation during his first presidential term in 2020, though nothing officially came of the threat. He resurrected the campaign against antifa in the days following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, tying the political organizer's death to hatred from his political opponents, despite the unclear profile of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect who has been arrested and charged with killing Kirk.\n\n Other supposed examples of antifa violence commonly referenced by the right include the 2017 shooting of Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, the assassination attempts on Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign, the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024, the 2025 anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles and more.\n\n However, experts say \"antifa\" isn't an official organization.\n\n What is antifa? \n\n The word \"antifa\" is a portmanteau of \"anti-fascist.\" Protests against fascism have existed in the United States, and around the world, for nearly a century, dating back to when the far-right nationalist movement began to gain power in Europe in the early 20th century.\n\n For the Trump administration to call antifa an \"organization\" or \"enterprise\" in 2025 America, though, is a mischaracterization, according to experts. Unlike other terror organizations targeted by the U.S. government, it has no centralized leadership structure or headquarters, and is instead depicted by the political right as a bogeyman-like shadow group that orchestrates violent acts of opposition.\n\n In a Sept. 18 New York Times article, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an American University professor who studies domestic extremism, compared \"antifa\" to ideologies like “White supremacy” and “Islamist extremism,” as opposed to specific groups like the Aryan Brotherhood or Al Qaeda.\n\n “There may be little groups organized around antifa in a neighborhood or community that meet up and share that stance, but it would be very hard to see that as connected in an organizational form that could be tackled,” she said, adding, “There is no expert I’ve ever heard of who has identified antifa as an actual organization.”\n\n Gary LaFree, a criminology professor at University of Maryland who formerly led the school's terrorism research center, told PolitiFact that \"multiple independent reviews of incidents from the past decade — including analyses of FBI and Department of Homeland Security reporting, the Global Terrorism Database, and congressional testimony — show zero terrorist attacks attributed to Antifa.\"\n\n LaFree added in an email to the outlet that terrorist acts are \"overwhelmingly carried out by far-right extremists, jihadist-inspired actors, or — less frequently — other movements.\"\n\n Why label antifa a terrorist organization? \n\n Democrats have expressed concerns that the administration's new battle against a loosely defined movement could clear a path for labeling any Americans who are perceived as political opponents as antifa terrorists.\n\n Trump's executive order explicitly describes the antifa \"campaign\" as one that involves \"coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists.\"\n\n The order accuses antifa of a wide range of actions, and enables Trump's administration to target anyone they believe to be \"recruiting,\" \"training,\" or \"radicalizing\" young Americans to engage in \"violence and suppression of political activity.\"\n\n \"Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech,\" the order claims. \"This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.\"\n\n Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed: “Designating Antifa, which has no defined organizational structure or leadership, as a domestic terrorism organization is not only incorrect, it serves no purpose other than an excuse for the Trump administration to stifle dissent, investigate anyone, or any group, they don’t like, punish their enemies, and potentially label any American they want as a terrorist.”\n\n Hasan Piker, a left-wing political commentator who was scheduled to debate Kirk on Sept. 25 at Dartmouth College, reacted to the news of Trump's antifa censure by posting on X, \"I don’t think liberal media is aware of how bad things will get for all of us.\"\n\n Is the executive order enforceable? \n\n The U.S. government's executive branch is empowered to prosecute foreign terrorists connected with organizations like Hamas, al-Qa’ida and ISIS. Once the group is officially designated as a terrorist organization, the federal government can freeze its assets and deny its members entry to the U.S.\n\n But there is no precedent or executive power that allows the U.S. government to designate an American group as a terrorist organization — due to concerns over First Amendment rights — which may minimize the impact of the order.\n\n “Trump can declare whatever he wants to declare, but there is no legal authority to actually designate a domestic group as a terrorist organization even assuming that antifa is an organization and not just an ideology,” Mary McCord, former acting head of the Justice Department’s national security division, told The New York Times.\n\n “That means his declaring this has no legal impact,\" she suggested. \"Certainly it does not trigger criminal terrorism charges, like providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.”\n\n What the order does do, though, is direct all federal agencies to \"investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations,\" making antifa a higher priority than before for law enforcement.\n\n Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News that while left-wing activists cannot be prosecuted for their \"ideology\" alone, some could be targeted for other charges, adding that being labeled a domestic terrorist by the federal government can lead to harsher sentences in court.\n\n The idea of revoking or overturning Trump's executive order is complex, as well. The easiest way would be for a successor or future president to revoke \"Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.\"\n\n A federal judge could also invalidate the order or hinder its execution by diverting funds aimed at its intended actions.\n\n What happens next? \n\n For now, Trump's executive order is just one action amid a flurry of threats against the political left.\n\n Since Kirk's death, the Trump administration has suggested bringing racketeering charges against left-wing groups who they allege are working together to target conservatives. The president has also floated the idea of revoking liberal nonprofits' tax-exempt status, CNN reports.\n\n “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people,” homeland security adviser Stephen Miller vowed in a recent conversation with Vice President JD Vance.","summary":"Trump has frequently attributed left-wing protests and public acts of violence to the work of \"antifa,\" a loosely defined movement with no centralized leader","url":"https://people.com/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation-11814988","image":"https://people.com/thmb/RXJ7ovvqiHWfMalZpdZTzJCj66k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x340:755x342)/donald-trump-Antifa-Explainer-092325-55e323a23a77433ea83b63847ff5668b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 22:19:06","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.269}]}
