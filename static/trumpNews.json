Otti (September 26, 2025) \n\nThe quote above by Governor Alex Otti of Abia State, during the September 2025 two-day visit by the United States of America (U.S.) Ambassador to Nigeria, Ambassador Richard Mills alongside U.S. Embassy officials to Abia State, provides some context on how the state government’s education sector reforms can align the state with contemporary global economic opportunities, if strategically matched. Given the contemporary changes in U.S. foreign policy on the continent from development assistance to more commercial diplomacy, as well as changes in the domestic environment, there also exists an opportunity for Gov. Otti to nudge the people and economy of the state towards a more intellectually driven and rewarding pathway.\n\nBut what were key points of U.S. Ambassador’s visit to Abia State? \n\nWhile acknowledging the positive outcomes from Gov. Otti’s governance approach, as well as the high value the U.S. places on its partnership with Abia and the Southeast zone of Nigeria, Ambassador Mills emphasized that he was in the state to explore existing opportunities in the state, and deepen partnerships. In his words, ‘there are tremendous opportunities here for our business, our commercial interests, and Nigeria’s’.\n\nAnd some of the key points of the visit demonstrated this focus on economic diplomacy, in line with foreign policy goals of U.S. President, Donald Trump. The delegation visited the Aba Independent Power Project (IPP), developed by Geometric Power, Nigeria’s only integrated electric power company. Facilities inspected by the American delegation included Geometric Power turbines produced by U.S. firm General Electric (GE), the world’s biggest and oldest electricity equipment manufacturing firm, as well as the Aba IPP digital SCADA facilities.\n\nWhat then does this pattern of economic diplomacy and focus on technology-based products and services have to do with Otti’s education sector reforms in Abia State?\n\nThe recent mid-2025 reports by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), Deloitte and Mckinsey on global semiconductor labour gaps, provide global economic opportunities that Gov. Otti’s education sector reforms can strategically harness, for efficient return on investment (ROI). The high points of the reports are that by 2030, the global semiconductor industry will require additional one million skilled workers, which by current trends, are not available. The reports highlight a shortage of 67,000 workers in the U.S. , a shortage of over 100,000 engineers in Europe, and a shortfall of over 200,000 engineers in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, the industry will require at least 100,000 middle-tier managers and 10,000 higher-tier leaders—many of whom must come from outside the industry, all by 2030.\n\nWhile U.S.-based companies hold roughly 46.3 percent of global semiconductor market share, they handle 12 percent of global manufacturing, with Taiwan handling 65 percent, China 15 percent, and South Korea 12 percent, as demonstration of manufacturing concentration. This concentration is also as each global region has developed different skill sets, making it challenging for human resource mobility across markets. The industry also competes with other tech sectors for talent, and 92 percent of tech leaders report challenges finding skilled workers. Essentially, while markets are expanding, with global semiconductor sales rising to $627.6 billion in 2024, and demand continues to rise to an expected $2 trillion in 2032, the talent pool is shrinking.\n\nIt is this challenging but viable human resource gap that provides avenues for closer economic partnerships with the U.S., as well as global economic opportunities for the people and economy of Abia State, if Gov. Otti is able to strategically align his education sector reforms accordingly. For a bit of context, China had $438.7 billion, Taiwan $116.3 billion and South Korea $131.6 billion worth of exports respectively to the U.S. in 2024, consisting largely of semiconductor-based and high-tech products such as integrated circuits, computers, electronic accessories, machine parts, broadcast equipments, electricals, motor vehicles & accessories. These countries are able to attract the type of significant investment and access to U.S.$30 trillion economy that Gov. Otti desires for Abia, because it has the human resource and subsequently industrial base that competitively manufactures high-tech products for the U.S.\n\nIn principle, aligning the state’s educational sector towards producing some of the skilled human talent required by the global semiconductor industry by 2030, is a viable proposition. As it is with such tasking propositions, there can be short, medium and long term approaches. For short-medium term, the Core Curriculum Minimum Academic Standard (CCMAS) and Trans-National Education (TNE) policies of 2023 by the National Universities Commission (NUC), provide the policy framework for training and international linkages that allow for training of tertiary education students in Abia, with skill set at the level required by semiconductor industry.\n\nAs CCMAS allows universities to enhance their curricula with some level of specialization, the Abia government can pool resources with public and private universities in the state, and modify relevant curriculum in engineering and computing, to meet the training standards of global semiconductor industry. With the TNE policy, the state government can establish cost-effective partnerships with foreign universities such as the National Taiwan University (NTU), whereby qualified students from Abia are also enrolled in the Global Undergraduate Program in Semiconductors (GUPS) at NTU, for joint-degrees. Virtual labs can be deployed for training.\n\nAlso, bulk negotiation with NTU on GUPS for Abia students will bring discount, as Taiwan, encourages educational diplomacy. Furthermore, provision can be made for the trade test certification of skilled tech talent involved in tech repairs, to be converted to some level of academic credit as prior learning, for efficient enrollment into the GUPS.\n\nGiven the costs involved, a more feasible short-medium term approach may require pooling the engineering, computing, mathematics and physics students with the best test scores from Abia State University (ABSU), Rhema University, Clifford University, Spiritan University and Gregory University – established by the founder of Skill ‘G’, a leading science, technology and innovation firm, at a central hub possibly provided by Skill G. At this location, training will be provided in chip design, silicon assembling, packaging, testing and other determined fields of semiconductor. The students selected via test scores from their first two years of study, can spend most of the remaining 2-3 years of study on practical learning and industrial attachment at this up-scaled facility, after which they will be awarded their degrees.\n\nSkill G has a good record in tech training, development and deployment. Its partnership with Israeli firms comes in handy, given that Israel is one of the leading countries in semiconductors, especially in chip design, R&D and manufacturing equipment. Annapurna Labs, which is the semiconductor arm of Amazon Inc, is originally an Israeli company that was acquired by the $2.4 trillion U.S. tech giant, and is a demonstration of Israel’s strength in the global semiconductor industry. Gov. Otti’s hosting of Israeli Ambassador to Nigeria Michael Freeman in May 2024 in Abia, where partnership opportunities for Abians and Israelis were explored, provides an official platform for cost-effective upgrading of existing Skill G facilities with equipment and training pathways for the training of Abia students in semiconductor areas, and work placement for the graduates.\n\nAbia has experienced semiconductor and technology professionals who can coordinate this proposition. There is Prof. Ndubisi Ekekwe, academic, engineer, founder of the Intel FGPA certified semiconductor firm FASMICRO, who has supported other countries in semiconductor development, and holds industry patents. There is also Chinenye Mba-Uzoukwu, former Microsoft General Manager (Anglophone West Africa) overseeing a seven-country portfolio as a member of the Microsoft EMEA executive management team, who is currently Principal Secretary and Chief Strategy Officer to Governor Otti. Though Gov. Otti had both appointed them to the leadership of Abia State Technological Skills Acquisition Center in September 2025, a lot more can be done with their skills and experience.\n\nAs sustainable long-term pathways requires reforms at feeder system, the May 2025 recruitment of 5,300 teachers and lecturers, and plans announced by the state in July 2025 to recruit 4,000 more teachers due to a surge in education demand, should be strategically aligned with some emphasis on producing semiconductor talent. An exchange program can be infused into both the recruitment and education system that enables a minimum of 10 percent of teachers to be recruited from Taiwan, Israel, South Korea, Vietnam, India and China, i.e from countries that have functional semiconductor industry. There are people from these and other educationally advanced countries that desire international teaching and gap year life experience, to support knowledge sharing and train-the-trainers opportunities. \n\nDr. Kalu Idika Kalu (KIK), Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, can support the Abia government in establishing official and economic linkages with some of these strategic Asian countries. He served as the World Bank Country Economist in the East Asia and Pacific Programme Department covering the Division that included China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In his almost a decade stint, he supported the economic policy and governance initiatives of these countries that enhanced their integration and economic partnerships with the U.S.- similar to what Gov. Otti is aiming for.\n\nAnd ‘culture eats strategy for breakfast’, as popularly emphasized in business strategy. Semiconductor education and training are very competitive, and require an educational culture that is already competitive to be feasible. Abia’s high national cutoff mark for national examinations is one of the indicators of its competitive education culture. Abians have similar intense work, study ethic and business acumen (hustle culture) as Taiwanese, South Koreans, Indians, Chinese, so it is a viable concept. The founders and CEOs of leading semiconductor and tech firms TSMC, Nvidia, AMD, Google, IBM and Microsoft, such as Dr. Morris Chang, Jensen Huang, Dr. Lisa Su, Sundai Pichai, Dr. Arvind Krishna and Satya Nadella, have origins from Taiwan and India. \n\nOtti has the expanded worldview and experience to lead in this new vision and iteration for Abia. The Geometric Power Project that was one of the key events during USA Ambassador visit to Abia was a project Otti was involved in its financing during his banking career. Similar to how he evaluated business plans as a banker, his educational policy should be a social investment that targets certain market gaps, in this case global semiconductor industry, for sufficient ROI. Similar to how certain trade and economic patterns evolved among for example Abiriba businesses that gave them a profitable worldview, Otti’s strategic education policy can lead to an iteration of new worldview on semiconductors and advanced technologies that are more rewarding.\n\nAnd Gov. Otti should be able to personally relate to pathways. The BOFID Decree 25 of 1991 was part of structural economic policies designed by Dr. KIK and others. This policy framework created Nigeria’s current liberal financial industry for the likes of Zenith Bank, Fidelity Bank, UBA, Access and Diamond Bank, where Otti was CEO. Otti continued his trajectory in founding Signature Bank, which launched operations on November 21, 2022. Similar to how Signature Bank had the 40 million unbanked and underbanked Nigerians as its market gap, the one million semiconductor industry human resource gap by 2030, is a market gap Otti should prepare Abia residents to harness.\n\nAs Tim Cook, the CEO of U.S. tech giant Apple Inc explained, the manufacturing and supply chain investment of America’s second largest company in China is due to the large talent pool of engineers and technology specialization in China, not necessarily because of cheap labor. This talent pool was developed through the strategic education and socioeconomic policies of Deng Xiaoping as leader of China, and sustained by successors. The pattern is similar for South Korea, Taiwan and other countries, who have billions in positive trade relations with the $30 trillion U.S. economy. This is largely through semiconductor-based supply chain products such as integrated circuits, computers, electronic accessories, machine parts, broadcast equipment, electricals, motor vehicles & accessories. Therefore, one of the major avenues for Gov. Otti to achieve his desired increased U.S. investment in Abia is through strategic education policy and programs, that develop a quantum of high skilled tech talent. With the recent Semiconductor Industry Association report identifying a human resource gap of one million by 2030, the onus is on Gov. Otti to align his current education policies to produce talent that meets global semiconductor needs. That way, his aspiration of attracting more investment from major U.S. companies- not foreign aid, becomes more feasible.\n\nDr. Uwanaka writes from African University of Science and Technology, Abuja. chukweks@yahoo.com","summary":"Otti’s&#160;strategic education policy can lead to&#160;refining of&#160;semiconductors and advanced technologies that&#160;is&#160;more rewarding, argues &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;CHUKWUEMEKA UWANAKA &#160; “In terms of partnership, we don’t believe in grants and aid, rather we seek","url":"https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/12/17/ottis-education-reforms-and-global-economic-opportunities/","image":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Alex-Otti-7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 23:40:13","author":"Adeyinka Salami,Governor Alex Otti","authors":["Adeyinka Salami","Governor Alex Otti"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.083},{"id":387314142,"title":"Rob Reiner’s son Nick Reiner to be charged with murdering his parents","text":"Nick Reiner will be charged with murdering his parents, Hollywood director Rob and his photographer wife Michele, Los Angeles County district attorney Nathan Hochman said.\n\nThe pair were found dead from apparent stab wounds in their home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, on Sunday.\n\nTheir son Nick, 32, was arrested on suspicion of the killing and taken into custody later that night.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Hochman said: “Today, I’m here to announce that our office will be filing charges against Nick Reiner, who is accused of killing his parents, actor director Rob Reiner and photographer producer Michele Singer Reiner.\n\n“These charges will be two counts of first degree murder with a special circumstance of multiple murders.\n\n“He also faces a special allegation that he personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon, that being a knife.\n\n“These charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility parole or the death penalty.\n\n“No decision at this point has been made with respect to the death penalty.”\n\nHe added: “Currently, Nick Reiner is being held without bail.”\n\nMr Hochman said once the charges are filed on Tuesday afternoon and after he has gone through medical clearance, Nick Reiner will be brought to court where he will be arraigned and will enter his pleas.\n\nHe added: “Now, prosecuting these cases involving family members are some of the most challenging and most heart-wrenching cases that this office faces because of the intimate and often brutal nature of the crimes involved.”\n\nPaying tribute to the victims, Mr Hochman said: “Rob Reiner was a brilliant actor and director, an iconic force in our entertainment industry for decades.\n\n“His wife, Michele Singer Reiner was an equally iconic photographer and producer.\n\n“Their loss is beyond tragic, and we will commit ourselves to bringing their murderer to justice.”\n\nReiner, who turned 78 in March, has long been one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood and his work includes some of the most memorable films of the 1980s and 1990s, including This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride.\n\nNick worked with his father on the 2016 film Being Charlie, which was loosely inspired on Nick’s experience of addiction and attending rehab.\n\nThe film, which he co-wrote, was directed by Rob and follows the son of a US governor, Charlie, played by Nick Robinson, as he battles with drug abuse.\n\nIn an interview with US publication People Magazine, Nick explained that the film was not about him, however parts of the story he had experienced himself including going to rehab throughout his teenage years and his own experiences of homelessness and spending “weeks” on the streets for refusing to return to a rehab facility.\n\nTributes have poured in for the couple including from former US president Barack Obama, former US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, and singer Sir Elton John, who featured in the sequel to his 1984 mockumentary film Spinal Tap, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, released in September this year.\n\nFormer US first lady Michelle Obama has said she and her husband Barack were meant to see the couple the night they were killed.\n\nSpeaking on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Ms Obama said: “We’ve known them for many, many years, and we were supposed to be seeing them that night.\n\n“Let me just say this, unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know.”\n\nShe added: “They were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about, and they cared about their family, and they cared about this country, and they cared about fairness and equity, and that is the truth.

He helped shape California politics","text":"This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nThe rest of the country may remember Hollywood legend Rob Reiner for his work in front of and behind the camera, but in California, he leaves behind a political legacy that endures beyond his films and movie and television roles.\n\nReiner, a longtime Democratic activist, donor and fundraiser, played a critical role in the legalization of same-sex marriage in California, and he was a driving force behind California’s signature early-childhood development program, First 5. \n\nReiner, 78, was found stabbed to death along with his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, inside their Brentwood home Sunday. \n\nPolice investigators announced Monday that their son Nick Reiner, 32, had been arrested and was being held on suspicion of their murder. Rob and Nick Reiner once worked together on a semi-autobiographical film about Nick Reiner’s lifelong struggles with addiction.\n\n“I can’t believe it,” former California Gov. Gray Davis told CalMatters on Monday in a phone interview. “I mean, Rob and Michele have been part of Sharon and I’s life for over 30 years.” Sharon Davis is the former governor’s wife.\n\nDavis said he’ll never forget when Rob Reiner in 1991 invited him — then California’s elected controller — to hang out on the set of Reiner’s “A Few Good Men.” Davis got to watch for hours as actors such as Tom Cruise, Kevin Bacon, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson did their scenes.“I thought: I am so proud to live in a state where quality filmmaking takes place,” Davis said. \n\nBut a few years later, the two became something akin to coworkers. Davis was elected governor the same night in 1998 that Reiner’s Proposition 10 ballot initiative passed. The initiative created a new tax on tobacco that funded the programs for children younger than 5 that are now in every California county.\n\nDavis said the two were at the same Election Night party in 1998 as the results came in. Davis said he and his administration later worked with Reiner to ensure the First 5 program got implemented. Davis appointed Reiner to chair the program’s California Children and Families Commission, a position he held until 2006. Reiner resigned amid allegations he was using taxpayer funds to promote his Proposition 82, an unsuccessful ballot initiative that sought to tax the wealthy to fund preschool for all children.\n\n“Rob was not just a talker. He was a doer,” Davis said. “A lot of other people would give a nice speech, they would come to a press conference and then they thought their job was over, and certainly we appreciate that. I mean, they have other things to do. But the difference was Rob called you up and said, ‘What can I do next?’ ”\n\nMike Roos, a former California legislator, political strategist and lobbyist, worked closely with Reiner on the Prop. 10 campaign. He said they got to know each other, and it was clear to Roos that Reiner loved his children dearly.“This has been just one of the most horrible things I could ever imagine, knowing him and knowing his love and the investment that he made in every one of those kids in that family,” Roos said, “but particularly how he cared and talked so thoughtfully about the struggles that Nick had in that period of time when I knew him.”\n\nLater, Reiner would help found the American Foundation for Equal Rights. The group paid for the legal fight against Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage in California. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Prop. 8 in 2013. \n\nKris Perry, the former executive director of First 5 and a lead plaintiff in the case that got Prop. 8 overturned, said Rob and Michele Reiner also stood by her and her wife, Sandy Stier, as they and the other plaintiffs defended their right to marry in the landmark case. \n\n“They continued over a five-year period to champion the cause by speaking out themselves, bringing more support to the case, doing media interviews, and, more importantly, being kind and generous … year after year after year,” Perry said. “They cared about us as people throughout that entire process. They left this indelible impression on all of us of what it means to be a real leader, to not only make something possible, but to stand beside people during the fight.”\n\nShe said Reiner wasn’t just a figurehead at First 5, either. He attended Children and Families Commission meetings every month and was deeply involved in discussions of “how to invest, where to get results, how to hold people accountable,” she said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom over the weekend said Reiner’s impressive body of professional work, which included “When Harry Met Sally,” “Stand By Me” and “The Princess Bride,” taught “generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others — and (encouraged) us to dream bigger.”“That empathy extended well beyond his films,” Newsom said in a statement. “He made California a better place through his good works. Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.”\n\nThe Reiners donated about $2.7 million to help Democrats over their lifetime, The New York Times reported, including $100,000 to support then-President Joe Biden’s 2024 reelection. He later joined actor George Clooney in urging Biden to drop out, saying, “We need someone younger to fight back.”\n\nNot everyone had nice things to say about Reiner. President Donald Trump, whom Reiner frequently criticized, called Reiner a “tortured and struggling but once very talented movie director and comedy star” in a social media post. He claimed Reiner’s death was linked to a “mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” \n\nDemocratic U.S Rep. Laura Friedman, who represents the Hollywood area, said in an interview she “really felt sick over seeing Donald Trump’s post about this terrible murder.” \n\nFriedman, a former film and television producer, said Reiner’s art reflected his politics. She said he advocated for being decent to each other and against bigotry — unlike Trump who she said has a “unique ability to divide Americans and make people angry.”\n\nReiner, she said, often used humor to “bring us together … and do it in a way that was somehow gentle and loving at the same time.”\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.","summary":"Rob Reiner may be best known for his Hollywood films, but he was also a Democratic political force in California.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/12/16/rob-reiner-hollywood-legend-helped-shape-california-politics/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP12020703692-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 22:22:34","author":"Damian Dovarganes,Ryan Sabalow • CalMatters","authors":["Damian Dovarganes","Ryan Sabalow • CalMatters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.007},{"id":387312764,"title":"Vance gives economy an ‘A+++’ as unemployment hits four-year high","text":"Vice President JD Vance went to Pennsylvania on Tuesday with a mission: Sell the administration's economic agenda in a way that resonates with Americans’ lived experience — even as his boss has derided affordability concerns as a “hoax.” \n\nDoing so required reconciling President Donald Trump’s messaging on the economy, which he has repeatedly celebrated as the “hottest” on Earth, with a disappointing jobs report showing unemployment rising to the highest level in more than four years and recurring polling showing most Americans are struggling with the economy.\n\nVance oscillated between touting what he characterized as an “economic comeback” courtesy of the Trump administration — including lower costs of gasoline and the president’s policies not to tax tips or overtime work — and urging Americans to be patient as they wait for more money in their pockets. \n\n“Rome was not built in a day, but we are committed every single day to making every single American who works hard and played by the rules, we want them to get a little bit richer every single day,” Vance said.\n\nHe also dismissed the Democrats’ focus on affordability and sought to lay blame for the economy on them: “When I hear the Democrats talk about the affordability crisis that they created, it's a little bit like Charles Manson criticizing violent crime,” Vance said. “Look in the mirror, my friend, you are the cause of the problem, and Donald J. Trump's administration is the solution to the problem that you created.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has repeatedly called affordability a “hoax” — including in his own Pennsylvania speech last week, which was supposed to focus on the economy but wound up being a meandering set of remarks in which he attacked his political opponents and waited 15 minutes before first saying the word “affordable.” That same day, Trump also told Politico that he would grade the economy under his leadership “an A+++++.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked on Thursday, Vance gave the economy similar marks: an “A+++.”\n\n“What I will say is that given how bad things got under the Biden administration, we are going to keep on working every single day to make sure that Americans feel the benefits of the Trump economy,” Vance added.\n\nHis efforts to tout those benefits, though, relied largely on claims that lack supporting evidence or have been disputed by experts. \n\nVance repeatedly claimed the Biden administration “took $3,000 out of your pocket, and in just 10 months of the President’s leadership, we have put $1,000 back in your pocket.” It was ostensibly a reference to inflation under Biden and projected tax refunds courtesy of the Trump-backed \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" but experts have said that the refunds will not impact all families equally. Plus, that bill also enacted historic cuts to both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which many low-income families rely on to afford health care and groceries.\n\nThe vice president also blamed rising home prices on undocumented immigrants — a claim economists and housing experts reject. They point instead to housing shortages and elevated mortgage rates as the primary drivers of rising costs. Some warn that mass deportations could worsen the problem by further delaying the construction of new homes. \n\n\"If you have fewer people, fewer illegal aliens, trying to buy homes, that means American citizens are going to finally be able to afford a home again,\" Vance said. \"It's very, very simple economics.\"\n\nVance delivered his speech hours after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed November jobs report showing that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November — the highest rate in more than four years — and added just 64,000 jobs.\n\nThe vice president argued that rising unemployment was actually a positive sign, claiming people who stopped looking for work under Biden are now re-entering the job market under Trump.\n\n“What you're seeing as wages go up, as more investment comes into our country, is that people who weren't looking for work under Biden's administration are getting out there and looking for work in the Trump administration,” the vice president said.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the jobs report “strong,” and said it “shows how President Trump is fixing the damage caused by Joe Biden.” \n\nVance also skirted a question about the impact of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which would leave more than 20 million low- and middle-income Americans with skyrocketing health care premiums if Congress does not extend the subsidies by the end of the year.\n\n\"We're working with Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, to come up with a solution,\" Vance said. \"You talked about premium support. We think everything should be on the table, but Democrats and Republicans, they got to work together and put something on the President's desk to sign.\"\n\nIn his speech, Vance encouraged Americans to “count your blessings this holiday season, because there is a lot of good out there,” adding, “there's a lot that we're still working to fix.” \n\nPrior to the speech, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro predicted in a post on X that Vance would “try and convince Pennsylvanians that the rising prices, health care cuts, and chaotic trade wars hurting our farmers are just... made up.” \n\n“I talk to Pennsylvanians every single day,” Shapiro added. “We're smarter than JD Vance gives us credit for.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/vance-gives-economy-an-a-as-unemployment-hits-four-year-high","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765912030/251216-vance-pa-economy-speech-pi/251216-vance-pa-economy-speech-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 20:39:59","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":387314086,"title":"Delayed Jobs Report Slams Trump’s Optimism as Labor Market Cracks Show","text":"The government finally coughed up the jobs numbers, weeks late and right on time to ruin Donald Trump’s day. \n\nAfter the 43-day government shutdown froze parts of the federal statistical machinery, the Department of Labor released a two-month snapshot on Thursday that landed with a thud, a sharp loss in October, a weak bounce in November, and a jobless rate drifting higher.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the economy shed 105,000 jobs in October and added just 64,000 in November, a combined reading that left Washington parsing whether the labor market is cooling gently or starting to slip. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent in November, up from 4.4 percent in September, the highest since September 2021. No unemployment rate was produced for October because the shutdown disrupted the household survey used to calculate it.\n\nThe topline numbers also undercut the idea that the economy is gliding along on autopilot.

The AP reported federal employment fell by 162,000 in October, a shock to the system big enough to swamp otherwise steady gains in parts of the private sector.\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, tried to reframe that jump in unemployment as a temporary artifact of those departures. “Probably what’s going on is the 250,000 federal government workers who took the buyout are staying in the labor force and looking for work,” Hassett told reporters, meaning they are counted as unemployed until they land somewhere else.\n\nBut even if you set the federal churn aside, hiring has slowed, and people can feel it. The AP noted job creation has averaged about 35,000 per month since March, down from roughly 71,000 in the year ended in March. Wages also showed less snap, with average hourly earnings up just 0.1% from October, and up 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the lowest pace since May 2021.\n\nThe report also arrives as President Trump keeps selling a sunnier story.\n\nAt a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania last week, Trump argued his policies were “creating jobs” and said, “I have no higher priority than making America affordable again.” In an interview excerpt released the same day, he was asked what grade he would give the economy. “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus,” Trump replied.\n\nThe polling, though, has not matched that confidence. A new AP-NORC poll published last week found just 31 percent of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40 percent in March.\n\nEven the Federal Reserve has been signaling unease about what it is seeing in the labor data. After the Fed’s most recent move, Chair Jerome Powell said hiring may have been overcounted by about 60,000 jobs a month since spring, and added, “You can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, maybe just a touch more gradually than we thought.”\n\nIn other words, the late jobs report did not just fill in the blanks left by the shutdown. It delivered a headline the White House did not want.","summary":"Two months of jobs data arrive late, and land hard for the White House.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/delayed-jobs-report-slams-trumps-optimism-as-labor-market-cracks-show","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donald-Trump-Job-Cuts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 20:30:54","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":387312756,"title":"Trump’s aura of invincibility has broken","text":"This is an adapted excerpt from the Dec. 15 episode of “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell.”\n\nA lot of Donald Trump’s power has to do with the perception that he is powerful — that he is unstoppable, that everybody will bend the knee. But once the appearance of unstoppability is broken, he becomes more vulnerable.\n\nThat aura of invincibility was dealt a huge blow last week when Republicans in Indiana firmly rejected Trump’s redistricting push. State lawmakers refused to cave to his pressure campaign and voted with Democrats against a proposed congressional map that would have given Republicans an advantage in the state ahead of next year’s midterms.\n\nThat is something we haven’t seen before in the Trump era: collective action against the president from members of his own party.\n\nIt’s no secret that Republicans in Washington are coming up on a tough election. Trump’s approval rating is at a record low, and he’s refusing to pivot from some of his most unpopular policies — like tariffs and the administration’s brutal immigration crackdown.\n\nIt's very easy for Trump to pick off one or two representatives who buck him, but when they stand shoulder to shoulder, we see what they can accomplish. \n\nAccording to a new AP-NORC poll, just 36% of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president. When it comes to the economy and immigration, only 31% and 38% of voters, respectively, have a favorable view of the president’s actions. \n\nA normal politician would look at those numbers and pivot. But not Trump. \n\nThis is the dilemma that Republicans have. They are stuck with Trump. As he always does, he will demand absolute loyalty. But he’s going to take them into a place they don’t necessarily want to be.\n\nThat’s why what happened in Indiana is so important. Republicans in D.C. should learn from their fellow lawmakers. It’s very easy for Trump to pick off one or two representatives who buck him, but when they stand shoulder to shoulder, we see what they can accomplish. \n\nWe’re already starting to see trickles of that in Congress. Republicans publicly broke with Trump over the Epstein files, and in recent days he’s received backlash from members of his own party over his reaction to the brutal death of actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife. \n\nNow, we’ve been through this before. We know how powerful Trump’s hold on the Republican Party is. But we are getting these whiffs, this sense that there’s a little bit of blood in the water. \n\nSome Republicans may see this as a moment to carve their own way and separate themselves from the White House. That’s dangerous for Trump.\n\nAllison Detzel contributed.","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/news-analysis/trumps-aura-of-invincibility-broken-republicans-indiana-tariffs-economy-immigration","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765913714/251216-donald-trump-es/251216-donald-trump-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 20:27:24","author":"Hayes Brown","authors":["Hayes Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":387312796,"title":"I was Donald Trump’s lawyer. Jack Smith should be celebrated, not vilified.","text":"Former special counsel Jack Smith is scheduled to appear on Wednesday for a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, despite his request to testify in an open and public hearing. In my opinion, Republicans are depriving the American people of the opportunity to hear from a career prosecutor who investigated serious allegations that President Donald Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election and unlawfully retained classified documents. \n\nI am not a newcomer to high-profile and politically charged investigations. Over a legal career spanning six decades, I prosecuted mobsters and politicians, and I defended both Republican and Democratic senators and House members. More recently, I represented President Trump during his first term in the special counsel’s investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. \n\nRepublicans are depriving the American people of the opportunity to hear from a career prosecutor who investigated serious allegations against the president.\n\nJack Smith was once my adversary in a high-profile investigation of a Republican client. In that investigation, Smith proved himself to be fair, impartial and fearlessly committed to the facts and the law. He was unmotivated by partisan politics. But recent attacks on Smith are motivated by partisan politics, and they are untethered to the facts or the law.\n\nAs a prosecutor, I have experienced the pressure applied to attorneys pursuing high-profile investigations. During my time in the Department of Justice in the 1970s, I oversaw the federal investigation into Pennsylvania Democrat Dan Flood, a House appropriations subcommittee chairman. The attorney general’s office received some 300 phone calls from members of Congress urging us to drop the investigation. Then-President Jimmy Carter never pressured us to back down — despite some lawmakers threatening that if Carter did not get the Justice Department to drop the investigation, his legislation would go nowhere.\n\nThat’s how the Justice Department is supposed to work. You follow the facts and the law, and you don’t let politics pollute decision-making. You swear an oath to the Constitution and put country first; you do not swear an oath to the person temporarily occupying the presidency. And you do not put the private interests of one man over the interests of every United States citizen. \n\nThat commitment to the rule of law is what I experienced from Jack Smith when I represented Rep. Don Young of Alaska, one of the highest-ranking Republicans in Congress at the time. Smith inherited this investigation when he became chief of the Public Integrity Section — the Justice Department unit that oversaw public corruption cases from 1976 until the Trump administration effectively dismantled it this year. Back then, the FBI had been investigating the congressman for years, but he had done nothing wrong. When Smith took over the case, I asked to meet with him and discuss the investigation of my client.\n\nThat’s how the Justice Department is supposed to work. You follow the facts and the law, and you don’t let politics pollute decision-making.\n\nSmith met with me for more than three hours. He had clearly read the case and asked thoughtful, probing questions. A few days after the meeting, Smith called to inform me that he was declining to prosecute. \n\nIn all of my interactions with him, Smith demonstrated that he was a straight shooter, open-minded and a man of integrity. He did not let politics influence an investigation, and he did not care whether my client was a Republican or a Democrat. That is the Jack Smith I know. I cannot stand silent while he is vilified by people who do not know him. \n\nJack Smith should be celebrated for courageously pursuing justice. I say this not as a member of any political party but as a lawyer, prosecutor, defense attorney and former Marine who cares more deeply about the rule of law and the well-being of our country than I do about the whims of a former client.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/jack-smith-testimony-trump-lawyer-house-republicans","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765905809/20251216-jack-smith-pi/20251216-jack-smith-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 20:18:59","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":387314284,"title":"Government sets out plans to reform licence fee in BBC royal charter review","text":"The Government will look at reforming the licence fee and consider more commercial revenue options for the BBC in plans outlined in its royal charter review.\n\nIt comes amid disruption at the BBC following resignations from top executives and a lawsuit from US president Donald Trump, who is seeking up to 10 billion US dollars (£7.5 billion) in damages in response to the editing of a speech he made before the 2021 attack on the Capitol that was featured in a Panorama episode.\n\nThe charter sets out the BBC’s public purpose and is the constitutional basis for the corporation, which is predominately funded through the licence fee, paid by UK TV-watching households.\n\nIn today’s Green Paper, the Government also says it will explore how changes to the licence fee “will impact different household budgets”. It notes a new funding system “that better accounts for different household situations” would reduce concerns about enforcement action being taken against individuals who couldn’t afford the £174.50 annual fee.\n\nThe report goes on to state: “Internationally, several of the models chosen to replace the licence fee for funding public service broadcasters account for household or individual income.\n\n“In Germany, for example, concessions are available to individuals who receive social benefits and to some students and people undertaking vocational training.”\n\nThe Culture Secretary has published a Green Paper, setting out potential reforms of the BBC, which “consults on a wide range of options being considered for the future of the BBC”, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said.\n\nThe Government will look at whether licence-fee concessions should be updated, options for the BBC to generate more commercial revenues, and options for funding the World Service to support sustainable funding for minority-language broadcasting.\n\nLisa Nandy, who launched the once-in-a-decade review on Tuesday, said: “We want the BBC to continue to enrich people’s lives, tell Britain’s story and showcase our values and culture at home and overseas, long into the future.\n\n“My aims for the charter review are clear. The BBC must remain fiercely independent, accountable and be able to command public trust. It must reflect the whole of the UK, remain an engine for economic growth and be funded in a way that is sustainable and fair for audiences.\n\n“As a Government, we will ensure that this charter review is the catalyst that helps the BBC adapt to a rapidly changing media landscape and secures its role at the heart of national life.”\n\nAccording to the DCMS, the charter review will focus on three objectives: the public’s trust, sustainable funding, and driving growth and opportunity.\n\nThe Government will consider, strengthening the BBC’s independence, giving it new responsibilities to counter disinformation, and introducing specific duties around workplace conduct.\n\nThis includes “new responsibilities for the BBC board to ensure action is taken against workplace misconduct”, which comes months after an independent report into allegations of misconduct against former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace.\n\nIt also says it could update the BBC’s mission and public purposes statement to give accuracy equal importance alongside impartiality, citing a need to improve transparency of editorial decision-making, something which was questioned by Michael Prescott who wrote the leaked memo raising concerns about the Panorama episode featuring Mr Trump.\n\nIn terms of growth the Government could look at encouraging the BBC to invest more in research, development and collaborations, also placing a new obligation on the BBC to drive economic growth.\n\nOutgoing BBC director-general Tim Davie said: “We welcome the publication of the Government’s Green Paper and the start of the public consultation on the future of the BBC.\n\n“We urge everyone who cares about the success of the UK’s world-leading creative industries to have their say.\n\n“At the BBC, we want change, so we can continue to deliver for the UK for generations to come.\n\n“We want to secure a public service BBC that is independent, sustainably funded for the long term, and meets our audience’s needs.”\n\nThe BBC’s current charter, which runs for 10 years, ends in December 2027.\n\nThe annual licence fee faced years of scrutiny under the Conservative government, with it being frozen for two years at £159 before it was increased in April 2024 and once again in April 2025 by about £5 to £174.50, in line with inflation.\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy has previously said she could be open to replacing the flat licence fee with a sliding payment scale.\n\nThe charter review has been informed by a poll, launched in March, the BBC called its “biggest-ever public engagement exercise”.","summary":"The charter details the BBC’s public purpose and is the constitutional basis for the corporation.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/bbc-donald-trump-government-tim-davie-panorama-b1262752.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/16/11/c75c77b91d4bac398a627317a3d36a75Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY1OTY5NzYy-2.82816314.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 20:14:21","author":"Hannah Roberts","authors":["Hannah Roberts"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.229},{"id":387312762,"title":"Hegseth refuses to release ‘double-tap’ boat strike video, despite Trump’s earlier vow","text":"The Trump administration’s policy of conducting deadly U.S. military strikes against civilian boats in international waters has been a global controversy for months, but the burgeoning scandal took on even greater significance a few weeks ago when The Washington Post reported that the administration killed a pair of survivors after an initial strike in early September.\n\nAlmost immediately after the allegations reached the public, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a challenge to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “[R]elease the full, unedited tapes of the strikes so the American people can see for themselves,” the New York Democrat wrote in an online statement. “Your recklessness demands full transparency.”\n\nThe release of the video quickly became a key point of contention in the larger debate over the alleged war crime.\n\nIt’s also a video the beleaguered Pentagon chief intends to keep hidden from public view.\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ma4khmf54q2f\n\n“In keeping with long-standing Department of War policy, Department of Defense policy, of course we’re not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth told reporters after a classified briefing with senators. “Appropriate committees will see it, but not the general [public].”\n\nIt was a mere two weeks ago when a reporter asked Donald Trump about releasing the full video of what transpired in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The president replied, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release, no problem.”\n\nThree days later, however, Hegseth hedged. “We’re reviewing the process, and we’ll see,” the secretary said at a public forum when pressed on whether he’d choose transparency.\n\nEarly last week, Trump pretended he never said what he was filmed saying days earlier, and this week, the defense secretary’s position is that Americans will “of course” not have access to the video. What’s more, the administration hasn’t even endorsed showing the video to all members of Congress.\n\nFor context, remember that Hegseth didn’t have any qualms about releasing the video of the initial Sept. 2 strike soon after it happened. Now, however, he’s apparently opposed to releasing the part of the footage that could make the operation appear more scandalous.\n\nImagine that.\n\nTo the extent that substantive details are relevant to the political debate, no one in the administration has even hinted at legitimate reasons for secrecy on this. The video is unlikely to disclose confidential sources or methods or expose any national security secrets. By all accounts, it shows shipwrecked individuals clinging to parts of a destroyed boat before they were executed by a U.S. military strike.\n\nThe only reason to keep that hidden is to avoid further public embarrassment.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hegseth-refuses-to-release-double-tap-boat-strike-video-despite-trumps-earlier-vow","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765913767/251216-pete-hegseth-zz/251216-pete-hegseth-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 19:58:15","author":"Julianne McShane","authors":["Julianne McShane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":387312778,"title":"The Tea, Spilled by Morning Joe: ‘Being president of this country is entirely about character’","text":"This is the Dec. 16 edition of “The Tea, Spilled by Morning Joe” newsletter.

While Wiles posted denials on social media this morning, her words carry an unmistakable ring of truth — because, well, they were recorded by Whipple himself. \n\nI’ve been saying for some time that President Trump’s volatile behavior is not hurting Democrats — far from it. For the first time since 2018, Democrats now hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in the generic-ballot test. Trump’s own poll numbers have also collapsed. \n\nThose in the GOP who are finally speaking out against the increasingly erratic behavior coming from the West Wing are not doing so in pursuit of a Profile in Courage Award. They’re starting to cross Donald Trump because his indefensible conduct is becoming toxic to a growing number of exhausted voters. \n\nAs Moore wrote yesterday, this generation will be judged harshly for enabling such hatefulness and cruelty for so long.\n\n“Did I agree with [Rob Reiner’s] politics? I did not. Did I love him as a friend, as an artist, as an icon of Hollywood and as a patriot? I most certainly did. And I am just absolutely devastated by this terrible event, especially for his family.”\n\nMAGA supporter and actor James Woods, breaking with President Trump’s reaction to Reiner’s death\n\nSUSIE WILES LETS LOOSE\n\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nVanity Fair is out this morning with a striking new interview in which Susie Wiles, President Trump’s chief of staff, calls his most loyal allies her “junkyard dogs” and delivers a blunt inside account of Trump, his governing style and the people closest to him — words few in the White House are willing to say out loud.\n\nON PRESIDENT TRUMP\n\n“Trump … has an alcoholic’s personality.” He “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do.

Comprising candid conversations with Wiles over the course of the year, the two-part article features insights from one of Trump’s most powerful staffers on his agenda, the scandals that have consumed the administration and various other top Trump officials.\n\nWiles quickly condemned the article as “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff and Cabinet in history.”\n\n“Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,” she said in a post on X. “I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the president and our team.”\n\nThe White House also expressed support for Wiles. \n\n“President Trump has no greater or more loyal adviser than Susie,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The entire administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.”\n\nHere are some of the most striking details from the story:\n\nTrump’s ‘alcoholic’s personality’\n\n“Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities,” Wiles said, alluding to her late father, Pat Summerall, the NFL player-turned-famed broadcaster whose struggle with alcoholism was well documented.\n\nTrump, a known teetotaler, has “an alcoholic’s personality,” Wiles said. He “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”\n\nHours after the Vanity Fair story was published, Trump defended Wiles to the New York Post, calling her “fantastic” and suggesting he was not offended by her description of his personality.\n\n“I don’t drink alcohol. So everybody knows that — but I’ve often said that if I did, I’d have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It’s a very possessive personality,” he said. \n\nElon Musk’s drug use\n\n“The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him,” Wiles told Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple about the world’s wealthiest man, whom Trump appointed as a “special government employee” tasked with slashing government waste. Musk left Washington earlier this year after a falling-out with Trump and recently said he wished he’d stuck to running his companies.\n\n“He’s an avowed ketamine [user],” she said, adding that Musk is “an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are.”\n\n When I asked her what she thought of Musk reposting a tweet about public sector workers killing millions under Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, she replied: ‘I think that’s when he’s microdosing.’\n\nIn May, Musk denied a New York Times report about his drug consumption, posting on X, “I am NOT taking drugs!” He wrote that he tried prescription ketamine “a few years ago” but “[hadn’t] taken it since then.”\n\nWiles denied to the Times that she spoke to Whipple about Musk’s drug use. “That’s ridiculous,” she told the newspaper this week. “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” Whipple, however, played the Times a recording of Wiles saying it.\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein files\n\nWiles told Vanity Fair she did not expect the blowback that the Epstein files have generated. She said Trump is in the documents, which she said she has read, but “he’s not in the file doing anything awful.” The president and the convicted sex offender, she said, were “young, single playboys together.”\n\nWiles also said there was nothing incriminating about former President Bill Clinton in the documents, contrary to what Trump has said. “The president was wrong about that,” she said.\n\nWiles said FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino “really appreciated what a big deal this is ... because they lived in that world.” As did Vice President JD Vance, “who’s been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,” she said.\n\nWiles said she and Trump weren’t consulted on the transfer of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell to a minimum-security facility after Maxwell’s jailhouse interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\n“The president was ticked,” Wiles said. “The president was mighty unhappy. I don’t know why they moved her. Neither does the president.”\n\nVenezuela boat strikes\n\nWiles said Trump wants U.S. forces to continue destroying small boats the administration accuses of ferrying drugs until Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is ousted. Despite widespread speculation, that marks the first time anyone in the administration has acknowledged that that is the aim.\n\n“He wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will,” she said.\n\nPete Hegseth’s Signal debacle\n\nWiles said she is “not horrified” by the defense secretary discussing military attack plans in a group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, that inadvertently included The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who then published portions of the exchanges.\n\n“The burden’s on us to make sure that [national security] conversations are preserved,” she said. “In this case, Jeff Goldberg did it for us.”\n\nThe Pentagon’s inspector general determined this month that Pete Hegseth violated Defense Department policy by discussing those plans in a nonsecure setting.\n\nMarco Rubio and JD Vance’s transition into Trump loyalists\n\nWiles said she believed Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s change of heart about Trump was sincere. Derided by Trump as “little Marco,” Rubio called Trump a “con artist” and a “third-world strongman” while challenging him for the 2016 GOP nomination, among other deeply personal attacks that gained renewed attention during the 2024 election amid reports that Rubio was being considered as Trump’s running mate.\n\n“Marco was not the sort of person that would violate his principles. He just won’t,” Wiles said.\n\nVance, however, became pro-Trump “when he was running for the Senate,” she said. “And I think his conversion was a little bit more, sort of political.”\n\nTrump’s sexist insults\n\nAsked about the president's recent attacks on female reporters, Wiles said, “He’s a counterpuncher. And increasingly, in our society, the punchers are women.”\n\nA third term\n\nWiles denied that Trump will be running for a third term, as he has suggested.\n\n“But he sure is having fun with it,” Wiles said, adding that he knows it’s “driving people crazy.”\n\n“Sometimes he laments, ‘You know, gosh, I feel like we’re doing really well. I wish I could run again.’ And then he immediately says, ‘Not really. I will have served two terms and I will have gotten done what I need to get done, and it’s time to give somebody else a chance.’ So, you know, any given day, right? But he knows he can’t run again,” she said.\n\nHis political enemies\n\nWiles told Vanity Fair in March that she and Trump “have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.”\n\nAsked again about Trump’s “retribution tour” in August, she said, “I don’t think he’s on a retribution tour.

According to reports, Bongino may not be sticking around the bureau for much longer.\n\nIn a report on the FBI prepared for Congress last month by active-duty and retired agents, Bongino is referred to as “something of a clown.”\n\nSome reports say he has cleared out his FBI office already. Another says his office is not empty but he is planning to decide about his future in the coming weeks, whatever that means.\n\nBut it would not be all that surprising if Bongino were on his way out. He is the first FBI deputy director with zero experience at the bureau, unless you count his podcasts about how the agency should be disbanded.\n\nSince taking the job, Bongino has not sounded super happy with his life at the FBI, nor has the FBI appeared especially happy with him.\n\nIn a report on the FBI prepared for Congress last month by active-duty and retired agents, Bongino is referred to as “something of a clown.”\n\nThe White House even installed a kind of babysitter for Bongino, appointing an unprecedented co-deputy director to share the job with him, which was widely seen as the first step in replacing him.\n\nThen there’s Bongino’s boss, Kash Patel, a fellow former right-wing podcaster who is now director of the FBI. MS NOW has reported that Trump is considering firing him as well, because of the “unflattering headlines Patel has recently generated.”\n\nThat includes reporting that Patel diverted members of an elite FBI SWAT team to provide security for his girlfriend. Reportedly, Patel directed that team to drive his girlfriend’s allegedly drunk friend home, more than once.\n\nAccording to reports, Patel is also using his government jet to visit that girlfriend, to take a golfing trip to Scotland with his buddies and to visit a Texas hunting resort called the Boondoggle Ranch.\n\nThen there was the time he bragged on social media about the FBI busting up a terror plot in Michigan before investigators even had a chance to file charges. According to The Wall Street Journal, some of the suspects’ friends caught wind of the arrests and moved up their plans to leave the country. One of them was intercepted at the airport only at the last moment.\n\nPremature social media posts have kind of become Patel’s thing as FBI director.\n\nIn September, hours after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot, Patel posted on social media that “the subject” in the killing was “in custody.” But roughly 90 minutes later, Patel had to walk that back when the person was released. That was a correction Patel may have posted from his dinner that night at a trendy New York restaurant, according to reporting from NBC News.\n\nPatel now appears to have done it again. The morning after a shooter killed two people and injured nine more at Brown University on Saturday, Patel proudly posted on social media that, as a result of the FBI’s tireless efforts, a person of interest had been taken into custody.\n\nHours later, that person was released. As of Tuesday afternoon, the suspected shooter is still at large, and the FBI has released new photos of a person of interest, who they warn is armed and dangerous. They are offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information on the suspect.\n\nIt’s clear that, right now, the FBI is a mess. \n\nCould that chaos at the top of the agency hurt its ability to perform its mission — like finding the Brown University shooter, who is still on the loose?\n\nAllison Detzel contributed.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-chaos-dan-bongino-kash-patel-trump","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765907226/251216-rachel-maddow-dan-bongino-zz/251216-rachel-maddow-dan-bongino-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 19:44:07","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":387314082,"title":"‘Shame of Our Nation,’ Evangelical Preacher Blasts Trump After Reiner Murder Remarks","text":"President Donald Trump’s reaction to the brutal murder of Rob Reiner and his wife has drawn condemnation from all sides of the political aisle, and an Evangelical preacher offered the strongest rebuke. \n\nTrump responded to news of the killings by posting on Truth Social, where he appeared to tie the crime to Reiner’s outspoken opposition to him. In the post, Trump blamed what he described as Reiner’s “massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME,” claiming the director’s politics had driven others “CRAZY” and framing the tragedy as a byproduct of his criticism of the president.\n\nRussell Moore, the editor in chief of Christianity Today, shared Trump’s post and let the president have a piece of his mind. Moore, an evangelical preacher and former senior official at the Southern Baptist Convention, wrote, “How this vile, disgusting, and immoral behavior has become normalized in the United States is something our descendants will study in school, to the shame of our generation.”\n\nMoore has previously criticized Trump when he believes the president’s words or actions conflict with Christian teaching. In 2023, Moore published Losing Our Religion: An Altar Call For Evangelical America, a book focused on the influence of partisan politics within evangelical culture. \n\nHow this vile, disgusting, and immoral behavior has become normalized in the United States is something our descendants will study in school, to the shame of our generation. pic.twitter.com/U2KCiI1yqo\n— Russell Moore (@drmoore) December 15, 2025\n\nIn interviews promoting the book, Moore said pastors have described resistance from congregants when preaching messages centered on compassion and restraint. “And what was alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the pastor would say, ‘I’m literally quoting Jesus Christ,’ the response would not be, ‘I apologize,’” Moore said, “‘The response would be, ‘Yes, but that doesn’t work anymore. That’s weak.’”\n\nMoore was not alone in criticizing Trump’s remarks, as several conservative commentators and elected officials also objected to the president’s decision to inject politics into a double murder. “Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” said Rep. Thomas Massie, continuing, “I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.”\n\nFormer Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said of Reiner and his wife’s tragic murder that “a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”\n\nThe criticism did not prompt a retreat as Trump followed up by repeating the same framing in later comments, again emphasizing Reiner’s opposition to him and dismissing objections to his original post. He was asked: “Republicans have denounced your statement on Rob Reiner. Do you stand by it?” Then responded, “I wasn’t a fan of his. He was a deranged person.”\n\nThe continued remarks extended the controversy well beyond the initial post, keeping Trump’s response in the headlines as reactions continued to mount. Religious leaders, media figures, and politicians continued to respond throughout the day, with Moore’s condemnation becoming one of the most widely shared critiques from within the evangelical community.","summary":"A double murder sparks a political firestorm, and an evangelical rebuke of Trump goes viral.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/shame-of-our-nation-evangelical-preacher-blasts-trump-after-reiner-murder-remarks","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TrumpReiner-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 19:30:21","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":387312794,"title":"Trump administration’s latest battle for presidential power: defending his White House ballroom","text":"President Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by epic legal disputes over presidential power. On Tuesday afternoon, his administration will be in court defending Trump’s power to build a ballroom.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit against Trump and other government officials, arguing that their renovations run afoul of legal requirements. “No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the nonprofit said in its complaint.\n\nThe group said the government demolished the East Wing to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom “without seeking approval from Congress; without requesting review and approval from the federal commissions charged with oversight of development in the nation’s capital; without conducting the required environmental studies; and without allowing the public any opportunity for input.”\n\nThe National Trust filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to halt construction, arguing that government officials have “violated the law in many separate ways” and that its “illegal activity continues today,” as “ready-to-install construction materials and heavy construction machinery have been moved onsite to begin active building.”\n\nIn a court filing Monday ahead of the hearing, government lawyers cite the Constitution’s provision that the president “receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers.” To do so, they wrote, the White House must be equipped for that purpose but isn’t, in light of “modern needs.” So, they wrote, “To rectify that untenable situation, President Trump set about to adapt the White House to the evolving needs of the presidency.”\n\nThe administration argued that the plaintiff’s legal claim must fail because the East Wing is already demolished — making that aspect of the litigation moot — and that the bid to halt future construction isn’t ripe to decide yet because the plans “are not final” and there won’t be above-ground construction until April.\n\nOfficials noted that “below-grade demolition and excavation is still ongoing” but argued that it should continue due to “security concerns inherent in leaving the East Wing foundation area unfinished.” A Secret Service official submitted a sworn declaration stating that “improvements to the site are still needed before the Secret Service’s safety and security requirements can be met.”\n\nTuesday’s hearing is set for 3:30 p.m. ET in Washington before U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, a George W.

According to Bloomberg, a spokesman for the firm said, “Because meaningful projects should unite rather than divide, and out of respect for the people of Serbia and the City of Belgrade, we are withdrawing our application and stepping aside at this time.” \n\nJared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has withdrawn his private equity firm from a $500 million luxury hotel project in Serbia hours after four senior government officials were charged with bribery by prosecutors.https://t.co/hdFRRjbkhs\n— Ⓜ️Ⓜ️ Lauren Ashley Davis – OG Meidas Might 🇺🇲🦅 (@Meidas_LaurenA) December 16, 2025\n\nThe plan had called for transforming a bombed-out military complex in central Belgrade, a site widely regarded as a protected cultural heritage area, into a Trump-branded hotel, apartments, offices and shops. But, according to ABC News, the project became deeply controversial after prosecutors filed criminal charges related to the removal of the site’s protected status. \n\nSerbia’s Public Prosecutor’s Office for Organized Crime said it charged Culture Minister Nikola Selaković and three other officials with abuse of office and falsifying official documents for allegedly helping clear the way for the redevelopment.\n\nJust a few hours after the Serbian prosecution filed an indictment proposal against Minister of Culture Nikola Selaković, Jared Kushner’s company, Affinity Partners, confirmed that it was withdrawing from the planned project in Serbia’s capital.https://t.co/Gwu0SZdAAG\n— European Western Balkans 🇪🇺 (@EWB_eu) December 16, 2025\n\nPresident Aleksandar Vučić, who is close to Selaković, has publicly defended the controversial development in the past.

But, according to Reuters, the legal troubles and public backlash made it difficult to move forward with the deal.\n\nThe site that Kushner wanted to develop was the former headquarters of the Yugoslav army.

This decision sparked protests in Belgrade. Those who believed that the site should remain intact as a part of their history and culture were particularly upset.\n\nThe indictment was brought as part of an organized crime inquiry, with prosecutors accusing Selaković and others of “illegalities when removing a status of cultural heritage site” to favor the development project.\n\nSelaković denied wrongdoing.

When asked if Zohran Mamdani ever thought of joining films, Mira Nair said, “I literally offered him the role of the suitable boy – the main role in A Suitable Boy.”\n\nThe filmmaker added during the interaction, “And again, like with many of my things, if I need an actor to read opposite an actress or something, and if he’s home, he’s always been willing. But for A Suitable Boy – I really wanted him to play that role. And he didn’t.”\n\nMira Nair revealed the reason her son rejected the main role in A Suitable Boy. “He said, ‘A lot of people die to be offered these things, but I don’t.’ He was the most reluctant actor. He never wanted it, and I had to accept that. And I was also grateful, because he knew he didn’t need it – that need people have to be an actor – he didn’t have that,” she revealed.\n\nThe legendary director continued, “But he’s got the goods. I always saw the charisma and the ability he has to actually make joy, to connect with people on a very direct and unfettered level. I’ve always loved that.”\n\nA little backgrounder for those who require one – Mira Nair’s adaptation of A Suitable Boy was about the story of Rupa Mehra (Mahira Kakkar), who wishes to find a suitable boy for her 19-year-old daughter Lata (played by Tanya Maniktala).\n\nThe show featured Tabu, Ishaan Khatter, Namit Das, Ram Kapoor, Vijay Raaz, Vijay Varma, Sharvari Deshpande, Manoj Pahwa, and Shahana Goswami in key roles. The series, which was released in 2020, was directed by Mira Nair, and it was written by Andrew Davies.\n\nThe closest Zohran Mamdani got to appearing on the silver screen was in the Queen of Katwe. “But I’ve got no chance of getting him into a movie.

After last summer’s one big, beautiful bill act, members now sound like a conference searching for its next mission.\n\nOne House Republican summed up the problem with the GOP, stating, “Right now, we don’t have a focused agenda that we’re moving towards like we did with the one big, beautiful bill. That brought all of our energy together in a focused manner.”\n\nRep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga. didn’t blame Johnson specifically but argued Republicans “did nothing” on healthcare when they took power earlier this year, and now they are stuck “scrambling” as health insurance premium hikes loom early next year. House Republicans unveiled a bill aimed at lowering healthcare costs on Friday evening, but even supporters seem unsure whether it can clear the internal hurdles to pass.\n\nFor many in the GOP, the frustration keeps circling back to Johnson, and not in vague terms.\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., ticked through a list that sounded less like a policy critique and more like an indictment of leadership misfires. “I think there’s a lot of concerns about the way things have been handled the last several months, starting with leadership, let this redistricting war break out, which is gonna upend the districts of dozens of our members. And then the fact we just weren’t here for two months,” Kiley said. “And then the way that the House is really not in the driver’s seat on a lot of the key issues around here, I think all of that is pretty frustrating to a swath of the conference.”\n\nOthers say their issues with Johnson are more personal as Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News she believes the speaker is blocking her push for a National Women’s Museum, despite what she described as support from President Donald Trump. “It’s been stalled by the speaker, in committee, despite having 165 sponsors from both parties,” Malliotakis said.\n\nRep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., leveled his own complaint after the latest wrangling over the National Defense Authorization Act. “We’re getting shoved, and we just have to eat it, or, you know, vote against increasing pay to our military service members. It’s a very unfortunate situation to be in, that the speaker keeps putting us in,” Steube said.\n\nEven lawmakers who praise the party’s big legislative win are describing a post-victory hangover that is quickly turning toxic. “I think getting Trump’s signature piece of legislation through is excellent, and everybody should be commended for that, because that was just a huge accomplishment, and it’ll do great things for the country next year. Now that we’ve gotten over that, now you’re kind of, like, what can we do next?” Steube said.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., went public in a New York Times op-ed and slammed the GOP leadership: “Here’s a hard truth Republicans don’t want to hear: Nancy Pelosi was a more effective House speaker than any Republican this century.” She added, “Speaker Mike Johnson is better than his predecessor. But the frustrations of being a rank-and-file House member are compounded as certain individuals or groups remain marginalized within the party, getting little say.”\n\nMace later told Fox News she had spoken with Johnson the same week the op-ed ran, and while she declined to detail the conversation, she said she did not feel heard.\n\nPerhaps the most telling line came from a second House Republican who spoke anonymously, asked whether the irritation with Johnson is bigger than a few loud voices. “Yeah, I would say so. Especially rank-and-file people.”\n\nAs the year comes to a close, it appears the GOP is imploding with concerning midterm polling only adding to the frustration.","summary":"House Republicans are fighting over what comes next, and who to blame.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/house-gop-meltdown-erupts-as-republicans-turn-on-mike-johnson","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-and-Mike-Johnson-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 18:30:18","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":387314122,"title":"Trump ‘Woke’ College Accreditation System Overhaul Begins","text":"President Donald Trump has long-promised crackdown on what conservatives describe as the “woke takeover” of America’s college campuses is now moving from rhetoric to reality, as his administration begins a sweeping overhaul of the college accreditation system — a powerful but little-known mechanism that determines which colleges receive federal funding and legitimacy.\n\nFor years, critics have argued that “woke” college accreditation agencies have quietly imposed ideological requirements on universities, rewarding schools that embrace diversity, equity and inclusion mandates that align with progressive ideology while sidelining institutions and students who dissent from the liberal orthodoxy. Donald Trump reform seeks to reverse that dynamic, shifting the focus back to academic quality, free inquiry and outcomes for students rather than political compliance.\n\n“This is about ending indoctrination and restoring education,” Donald Trump said during remarks outlining the initiative. “Our colleges should teach students how to think, not what to think. No student should be punished, silenced or graded down for expressing their beliefs.”\n\nUnder the plan, Donald Trump has empowered the Department of Education to reconsider recognition of accrediting bodies that enforce ideological litmus tests or pressure institutions to adopt race-based or viewpoint-based policies. Accreditors would instead be evaluated on whether they protect intellectual diversity, academic freedom and fair treatment of students.\n\nSupporters of the move by Donald Trump say the “woke” college overhaul addresses a long-simmering problem on campuses nationwide, where conservative students report feeling intimidated in classrooms, targeted by peers and faculty, or fearful that voicing dissenting views could affect their grades or standing. Numerous surveys have shown that many students self-censor in class discussions, particularly on issues involving politics, gender or race.\n\nDonald Trump administration Education Secretary Linda McMahon has defended the reform as a necessary reset, saying universities should once again become places of open debate rather than ideological enforcement. “Higher education should be a marketplace of ideas,” she said. “Students should never be afraid to speak honestly or submit work reflecting their views. Accreditation should never be used as a weapon to enforce political conformity.”\n\nThe efforts by the Donald Trump administration also aim to loosen what conservatives call an accreditation monopoly, encouraging competition among accrediting bodies and allowing states and institutions greater flexibility to choose accreditors aligned with academic rigor rather than activism. Several public university systems have already begun exploring alternative accrediting models, signaling that the shift may have lasting impact beyond Washington.\n\nHarvard’s Woke Wake-Up: Trump’s Trade School Triumph pic.twitter.com/BeuN972pZe\n— Gutfeld! (@Gutfeldfox) October 4, 2025\n\nPredictably, the overhaul has sparked backlash from academic leaders and progressive advocacy groups, who argue the reforms politicize education. But Donald Trump allies counter that the system was already politicized — just in one direction.

The question was how much he’d seek in his civil lawsuit.\n\nA month ago, the president said he expected to ask for $1 billion. Soon after, the Republican suggested the figure could be $5 billion. Evidently, he and his lawyers decided to double that figure. The New York Times reported:\n\nPresident Trump sued the BBC for $10 billion on Monday evening over the editing in a documentary that the British broadcaster said had left the ‘mistaken impression’ that he called for violent action before the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a 46-page lawsuit filed in federal court in Miami, Mr. Trump accused the BBC of defaming him and violating Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. He demanded $5 billion for each offense.\n\nThe Republican’s legal team condemned the BBC as a “disgraced” news organization, which coincided with Trump telling reporters that the network “literally put words in my mouth.”\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3ma2l2cprbz2q\n\nHe added, “I guess they used AI. ... They actually put terrible words in my mouth having to do with Jan. 6 that I didn’t say.”\n\nAs is too often the case, the president’s comments were wrong. For one thing, the BBC didn’t use artificial intelligence. For another, the network did air a program that edited Trump’s Jan. 6 speech, connecting two clips that were delivered roughly 50 minutes apart, but the news outlet didn’t manufacture words and phrases out of whole cloth.\n\nNevertheless, the editing has sparked a broader controversy that has led to an internal investigation. That, in turn, generated some firings among senior BBC officials as well as a written apology.\n\nTrump, however, apparently doesn’t want an apology. He wants $10 billion.\n\nFor its part, the BBC’s legal counsel vowed to defend itself from the defamation litigation, and as NBC News’ report noted, the network’s willingness to fight back raises the possibility “of a legal battle over whether the edit of the speech caused harm to the president’s reputation.”\n\nAs this legal process advances, let’s not lose sight of the pattern that’s developed in recent years.\n\nThe Trump campaign’s 2020 case against CNN failed. Trump’s 2021 case against The New York Times failed. Trump’s 2023 case against Bob Woodward failed. The Trump campaign’s case against The Washington Post failed. Trump’s so-called class-action lawsuit against social media giants also failed. A separate Trump case against CNN failed. The most recent Trump lawsuit against the New York Times is off to a humiliating start.\n\nI mention this in part because Americans have never had a sitting president who sued independent news organizations or individual journalists for publishing reports the White House disapproved of — until now.\n\nBut the same pattern also includes a lesson. When the Republican filed a dubious case against ABC News, the network and its corporate parent agreed to a $16 million settlement. When he filed an even weaker case against CBS News, its corporate parent, Paramount, also struck a $16 million deal.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, Trump repeatedly pointed to these controversial settlement agreements as evidence of his targets’ culpability, even as those networks denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, news organizations that have stood up for themselves and pushed back against the attempts at intimidation prevailed.\n\nThe only way to lose in a fight against Trump is to pursue a course rooted in appeasement. It’s true when it comes to law firms; it’s true when it comes to higher education; and it’s true in his court fights against news organizations — a point that hopefully isn’t lost on the BBC or its defense counsel.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-sues-bbc-for-10-billion-over-edited-clips-of-his-jan-6-speech","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765906192/251216-BBC-zz/251216-BBC-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:55:08","author":"Erum Salam","authors":["Erum Salam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":387314106,"title":"Joe Biden Makes Rare Public Appearance at Eagles Game – And Fans Can’t Stop Comparing Him to Trump","text":"Joe Biden has kept a relatively low profile ever since President Donald Trump began his second term in January.

The remarks were drawn from more than ten conversations over the past year with author Chris Whipple.\n\nThe line drawing the most attention is also the most personal. Wiles said Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality,” despite the president’s long-publicized status as a teetotaler. Her comment was not about drinking, she suggested, but about temperament and impulse. Trump, she said, governs with a belief that there are no real limits on his power. “He has a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing,” Wiles said.\n\nShe described the observation based on her own background, growing up with an alcoholic father, the late sportscasting legend Pat Summerall. “High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,” she said. “And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.”\n\nThe interviews also touched on the belief that Trump is seeking retribution with many of his legal battles against his perceived enemies. Wiles acknowledged that many of the president’s second-term actions have been motivated partly by retribution.\n\nAsked whether prosecutions of Trump’s political opponents could be seen as vindictive, Wiles did not dismiss the idea. “I mean, people could think it does look vindictive,” she said. “I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.” When it came to the mortgage fraud accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James, she replied, “Well, that might be the one retribution.”\n\nShe added that Trump does not necessarily wake up each day plotting payback, but when the chance presents itself, he rarely hesitates. “I don’t think he wakes up thinking about retribution,” she said, continuing: “But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it.”\n\nWiles also opened up about Trump’s foreign policy and seemingly contradicted the official narrative. She suggested Trump was effectively pursuing regime change in Venezuela through a controversial campaign targeting boats near Venezuelan waters.\n\nShe also described moments when Trump brushed aside her advice, including on deportations and pardons, reinforcing the image of a chief of staff who manages the president’s impulses rather than trying to restrain them.\n\nUnlike several of the men who cycled through the role during Trump’s first term, she is widely seen inside the White House as a careful operator with few internal enemies. Trump himself frequently refers to her as the “most powerful woman in the world,” praising her ability to influence events with a single phone call.\n\nHer historically low public profile made the interviews all the more striking because until now, Wiles had largely avoided the media, making her conversations with Whipple, whose book, The Gatekeepers, is considered a definitive account of the chief of staff role, especially notable.\n\nWiles responded to the backlash from the interview, writing on X, that the interview was a “disingenuously framed hit piece,” claiming that key context was omitted to paint a distorted picture of chaos inside the administration.\n\nThe White House quickly rallied behind her with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying Trump “has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,” adding that the administration is united behind her leadership.\n\nRegardless of walking back her comments, it paints a picture most would imagine with Trump’s eccentricities, chaotic speeches, and midnight ramblings on Truth Social.","summary":"A rare on-the-record profile exposes how Trump’s closest aide really sees his power and his grudges.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-chief-of-staff-says-president-has-an-alcoholics-personality-and-a-taste-for-revenge","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Susan-Wiles-and-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:30:00","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.177},{"id":387314092,"title":"That 2.8% Social Security Raise in 2026 Sounds Nice – Until You Do the Math on an $1,800 Check","text":"If your monthly Social Security check is $1,800, you probably already know how fast that money can disappear. Groceries, utility bills and medical costs have a way of adding up faster than you expect. So when the government announces a raise (though it is officially called a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA), most people get way too excited and for good reason.\n\nThe good news is that Social Security has announced that its benefits are going up in 2026. But the number you think you’re getting and the number that actually lands in your account may not be the same. Let’s break down what we mean by that, shall we?\n\nFor 2026, Social Security recipients will receive a 2.8% COLA, based on inflation data from the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). That percentage is automatically applied to all beneficiaries.\n\nSo, on a $1,800 monthly benefit, a 2.8% increase works out to $50.40 more per month. That pushes your gross benefit to $1,850.40. You’ll first see that increase in the January 2026 payment, which also reflects your December 2025 benefit.\n\nBREAKING: Social Security benefits to rise 2.8% for recipients in 2026 pic.twitter.com/VfqvVjuGcL\n— Fox News (@FoxNews) October 24, 2025\n\nRELATED: December Social Security Payments — Who Gets Paid Next and How Much to Expect\n\nOn paper, that sounds solid, but the reality is messier.\n\nThe reason is simple. At $1,800 a month, your annual Social Security income is $21,600. But after the COLA, the new amount will be $1,850.40, which will add up to $22,204.80 for the year. That’s an increase of about $604.80 before deductions.\n\nNow, we might mentally budget around this exact number, but it’s not the one that matters. For context, the average retired worker benefit is lower than many of us assume. In 2025, it’s about $2,015 per month, after the 2.8% COLA, which rises to $2,071, or about $56 more per month and annually around $672. That means increase is very much in line with what most retirees will see.\n\nThis brings us to the fact that most retirees have their Medicare Part B premiums deducted from their Social Security checks. And in 2026, the standard Part B premium is jumping from $185 to $202.90 per month. So, then, for someone with a $1,800 benefit, that Medicare hike eats up roughly a third of the COLA increase! After the Part B deduction, your net deposit would be about $1,647.50, so your take-home increase is closer to $32.90 per month, not $50.40.\n\nI just got my 2026 healthcare premium in the mail.\nIt’s going up 46%. ($746 to $1069)\nThanks Donald Trump and House Republicans! This is what Democrats warned you about. The government is shutdown because Republicans wanted this! pic.twitter.com/34XCBSYmCO\n— Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) October 28, 2025\n\nA higher benefit can push some retirees closer to Social Security taxation thresholds as well. Depending on your combined income, up to 50% or even 85% of your benefits can be taxable. But are you collecting Social Security before full retirement age while still working? In 2026, earning more than $24,480 could reduce your checks, even with COLA.\n\nSo it is best to know how much you will actually receive by logging into your “my Social Security” account. Your COLA notice will now show your new gross benefit, Medicare deductions and tax withholding. Plus the final amount deposited each month.\n\nIf anything looks off, contact the SSA.\n\nNEXT UP: You Can Now Draw $5,108 Monthly Social Security Check in Retirement—But Only If These 3 Conditions Are Met!","summary":"Your $1,800 Social Security check is getting a raise, but here’s the catch.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/that-2-8-social-security-raise-in-2026-sounds-nice-until-you-do-the-math-on-an-1800-check","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/A-Social-Security-COLA-increase-arrives-in-2026-but-Medicare-costs-may-shrink-the-real-gain.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:27:48","author":"Sohini Sengupta","authors":["Sohini Sengupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":387313832,"title":"Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles dishes on Elon Musk's time at DOGE","text":"One of President Donald Trump&apos;s top aides has some thoughts on Elon Musk.In a series of interviews with Vanity Fair published on Tuesday&comma; White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles weighed in on Musk&apos;s time as the de facto leader of DOGE&comma; her thoughts on the Musk-led shuttering of USAID&comma; and Musk&apos;s personality quirks.\"The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him&comma;\" Wiles told the outlet&comma; calling Musk an \"avowed ketamine\" user who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag\" in an office building adjacent to the White House during the daytime. \"He&apos;s an odd&comma; odd duck&comma; as I think geniuses are.

According to the official tally, there have now been 25 such strikes since early September, with a collective death toll of 95 people.\n\nThe announcement from the Defense Department coincided with another announcement from Donald Trump.\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3ma2khq6nkw2q\n\n“With this historic executive order I will sign today, we’re formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,” he declared at a White House event.\n\nObservers would be forgiven for feeling a sense of déjà vu: Americans saw a Republican president, with an apparent interest in foreign oil, pitching suspect claims about WMDs.\n\nTo be sure, Trump’s announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. Two months ago, White House border czar Tom Homan told Axios that designating illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction should “at least be a discussion.” Looking back further, the Department of Homeland Security began a related analysis as far back as 2019.\n\nThat discussion has now advanced to a signed presidential executive order.\n\nHistorically, the “weapons of mass destruction” label been limited to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week described “narco-terrorists” as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere,” purportedly responsible for spreading “narcotics so lethal they’re tantamount to chemical weapons.”\n\nWhat’s more, as The New Republic noted, The Wall Street Journal reported last month “that a classified legal brief justified the Trump administration’s extrajudicial execution of alleged drug smugglers by referring to fentanyl as a potential chemical weapon.”\n\nThe executive order is the start, not the end, of a broader policy discussion.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-fentanyl-weapon-mass-destruction","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765903964/251216-donald-trump-zz_1125807ed3ba/251216-donald-trump-zz_1125807ed3ba.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:14:27","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":387310998,"title":"Peace proposals for Ukraine &apos;to be presented to Russia&apos;","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says proposals being negotiated with US officials for a deal to end the fighting in Russia&apos;s nearly four-year-old invasion of his country could be finalised within days. US envoys will then present the plans to the Kremlin before possible further meetings in the United States next weekend, Zelenskiy said on Tuesday. A draft peace plan discussed with the US during talks in Berlin on Monday is \"not perfect\" but is \"very workable,\" Zelenskiy told reporters hours after the discussions. He cautioned, however, that some key issues - notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces - remain unresolved. US-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But as the spotlight shifts to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin may baulk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from the US, Ukraine and western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskiy said after the Berlin talks, \"we are very close to (a deal on) strong security guarantees\". The security proposal will be based on allies&apos; help in keeping the Ukrainian army strong, an official from a NATO country said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \"Europeans will lead a multinational and multi-domain force to strengthen those troops and to secure Ukraine from the land, sea and air, and the US will lead a ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, with international participation,\" the official said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated on Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce. If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" he said. \"We want peace - we don&apos;t want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\" US officials said on Monday there was consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90 per cent of the US-authored peace plan. US President Donald Trump said: \"I think we&apos;re closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement. Zelenskiy reiterated that Ukraine ruled out recognising Russian control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. \"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskiy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a &apos;free economic zone&apos; (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a &apos;free economic zone&apos; does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\" Ukraine needs \"legally binding commitments,\" Zelenskiy said after talks with acting Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof. \"There are many questions about how we can obtain protection without being a NATO member,\" Zelensky said. \"We must receive support, and it is important for us to have all security guarantees.\" Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia claimed to annex in 2014, to be recognised as Russian territory. Zelenskiy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased international pressure on Russia including tougher sanctions and additional military support, such as enhanced air defence systems and long-range weapons. Zelenskiy said that what is driving Ukrainian officials in the negotiations is for Russia to be \"held accountable for what it has done - for this war, for all the killings, for all the suffering\". Ukraine and the US are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskiy said. He was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" Zelenskiy said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the US, Europe and Ukraine.\" with DPA Australian Associated Press","url":"https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/9135628/peace-proposals-for-ukraine-to-be-presented-to-russia/","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/be1ea118-3366-4e5e-9df3-06e243399742.jpg/r0_0_800_600_w800_h600_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:07:42","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":387314306,"title":"Donald Trump sues BBC for up to £7.5bn over Panorama speech edit","text":"The US president has filed a lawsuit against the BBC and is seeking up to 10 billion dollars (£7.5 billion) in damages in response to the editing of a speech he made before the 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nDonald Trump’s lawyers argue the depiction of him given in the edit, which aired in a Panorama documentary a week before the results of the 2024 US election, “was false and defamatory” and they also said “the BBC intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers around the world”.\n\nIn the Panorama programme, a clip from Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 was spliced to show him saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol… and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking five billion dollars (£3.7 billion) in damages on two counts: for an allegation of defamation, and for a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: “As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\n\nThe Panorama programme was not broadcast in the US, but the lawsuit says it can be watched on the BritBox subscription streaming platform and also claims “millions of Florida citizens use a virtual private network (VPN) to view content such as the Panorama documentary”.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges a Canadian third-party media group, Blue Ant Media Corporation, had licensing rights to the documentary outside the UK and distributed the programme “in North America, including Florida”, though the BBC has not yet responded to these claims.\n\nIn a response to the Press Association, Blue Ant said: “Blue Ant acquired the rights to distribute the documentary internationally, but none of Blue Ant’s buyers have aired it in the US.\n\n“The version we received for distribution did not include the edit in question, as the international version delivered to Blue Ant had been cut down in a number of places for time.\n\n“It is important to note that Blue Ant is not named a defendant in the lawsuit.”\n\nThe complaint from Mr Trump’s legal team alleges there is “substantial evidence” that demonstrates the BBC and its leadership “bore President Trump ill will, wanted him to lose the 2024 presidential election, and were dishonest in their coverage of him”, before the publication of the Panorama documentary.\n\nThe document also repeats statements by UK politicians including Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and former prime minister Liz Truss, the latter of whom discussed “the BBC’s pattern of actual malice”.\n\nIain Wilson, who is a managing partner at law firm Brett Wilson LLP, has suggested the BBC could “bring an early motion to dismiss”.\n\nHe told the Press Association: “This would be an application to a judge (rather than a jury) that, even when taking Trump’s case at its highest, the claim should fail as a matter of law.\n\n“Perhaps the BBC’s strongest argument is that the Florida court does not have jurisdiction to hear a claim concerning a publication that was not broadcast in the US (and geo-blocked on the BBC’s iPlayer service).\n\n“Trump’s team has sought to pre-empt this argument by asserting the programme could have been accessed on the BritBox streaming service or a VPN.\n\n“This seems a relatively weak argument, as BritBox is run by a separate legal entity to the one being sued, and the BBC has no control over Florida citizens who choose to use VPNs to access its news services – if indeed any such individuals exist.\n\n“Thus, the claim could be dismissed on the basis the programme did not target viewers in Florida and, as such, there is no real connection to the state.”\n\nThe scandal unfolded earlier this year after a leaked memo, written by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee, highlighted concerns about the Panorama episode.\n\nShortly after the leak, Mr Trump threatened a billion-dollar legal action and litigator Alejandro Brito demanded that “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” made about the president must be retracted immediately.\n\nThe president said the lawsuit was imminent when he spoke at a press conference on Monday afternoon in Washington.\n\nHe said: “In a little while, you’ll be seeing I’m suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth literally. They had me saying things that I never said.\n\n“We’ll be filing that suit probably this afternoon or tomorrow morning.”\n\nAfter the report was leaked, BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised on behalf of the BBC over an “error of judgment” and accepted the editing of the 2024 documentary gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action”.\n\nThe fallout from the report also led to the resignation of both director-general Tim Davie and head of BBC News Deborah Turness.\n\nBBC News reported lawyers for the BBC had given a lengthy response to the president’s claims before Mr Trump filed the lawsuit and said “there was no malice in the edit and that Trump was not harmed by the programme, as he was re-elected shortly after it aired”.\n\nThe complaint was filed at the US district court for the southern district of Florida, and names BBC, BBC Studios Distribution and BBC Studios Production as defendants.\n\nMr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US and is engaged in legal action with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Blue Ant Media Corporation, the BBC, BBC Studios Distribution and BBC Studios Production have all been approached for comment.","summary":"The US president’s lawyers argue part of the documentary was ‘false and defamatory’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/donald-trump-panorama-florida-liz-truss-tim-davie-b1262734.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/16/09/b49424feb3fd1d51bd1dedf20778ad31Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY1OTU4MDMw-2.81658509.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 17:00:22","author":"Hannah Roberts","authors":["Hannah Roberts"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":387312776,"title":"Immigration has always been a Trump card. That might not work anymore.","text":"Since he came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower a decade ago, President Donald Trump has leaned into immigration as a core issue.\n\nBut as he heads into next year’s midterm elections, it may not be giving him the boost he wants.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has pushed hard to restrict immigration, ramp up deportations and expand border enforcement, even as polls show voters list the economy as their top concern. “I always felt the border was first,” he told House Republicans in January. \n\nTrump has even acknowledged that his own aides are trying to get him to shift focus, claiming that the issue has lost salience with voters because his administration has been so effective.\n\n“Before I was running, that’s all they talked about: the border, the border, the border,” Trump said last week at a rally in Pennsylvania. “Now I fixed it, nobody wants to talk about it. Even my people, they say, ‘Sir, don’t put it in your speech.’”\n\nVoters aren’t just naming other priorities, mainly the cost of living, but polls show that they are increasingly opposed to the president’s heavy-handed approach to mass deportations and feeling more positive about the contributions of immigrants.\n\nA record share of Americans considered immigration a “good thing” for the country this year, according to a Gallup survey analyzing more than two decades of history. An AP-NORC nationwide poll conducted in early December found that Trump’s approval rating on immigration generally hit its lowest point of 2025 — falling 11 points since the survey started in March.\n\nOnly 38% of Americans now endorse his handling of immigration. Of that cohort, just 26% of independent voters — a coveted voting bloc— approved of Trump’s oversight of immigration, according to AP-NORC data shared with MS NOW. \n\nTrump’s approach still has overwhelming support among Republicans, though that has dropped eight points, to 80%, since May.Trump notably received the endorsement of half of participants in the survey for his management of border security, which the president said that he “campaigned very, very strongly on.” On Monday, Trump gave out the first-ever “Mexican Border Defense Medal” to service members in the Oval Office. \n\nWhile the president tends to blur immigration and border security, polls show that voters have a more nuanced take\n\nWhile the president tends to blur immigration and border security, polls show that voters have a more nuanced take, treating them as separate issues. \n\nJennifer Benz, the director of the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, told MS NOW that Trump’s approval rating on border security has held “fairly steady” this year. However, “looking specifically at immigration and the tactics around deportation,” Benz continued, “there’s signals of decline.”\n\nTrump’s decision to empower U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport millions of immigrants has played a role as well. \n\nOver the past year, ICE agents have detained people across the country in front yards and school parking lots in videos that have gone viral online. A number of American citizens have been stopped and even detained by ICE agents, leading to allegations of racial profiling, which Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has strongly denied.Closing the border is “arguably one of the only issues that the president and this administration have done a fine job of,” said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and Trump appointee from the first administration. “That does not necessarily mean that the issues of illegal immigration, and ICE’s posture or actions, are going to continue to be as widely acclaimed as the border.”\n\n53% said the administration is doing \"too much\" to deport immigrants\n\nAnother survey published Monday by the Pew Research Center revealed that 53% of participants said the administration is doing “too much” to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. The majority of Hispanic adults, especially compared with other racial groups, indicated being worried that a family member or a close friend could face deportation.“I will concede that we’ve got to look harder at our process for deportation,” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair as part of a series of interviews published Tuesday. “I think our process has to lean toward a double-check.”\n\nA sizable portion of Hispanic voters moved to Trump’s coalition during the 2024 election, likely driven by frustrations with inflation, according to Republican strategists. However, continued concerns about affordability, compounded “with the tactics of ICE,” could cause Hispanic voters to swing back to Democrats, Barlett noted.Earlier this month, the White House significantly heightened restrictions on legal pathways to entry to the U.S. in the aftermath of a shooting in Washington on two National Guard troops. The alleged shooter, who killed one of those soldiers, was an Afghan national granted asylum in April.The president initially said his deportation effort would target the “worst of the worst,” vowing to prioritize undocumented people with criminal records. But data published by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse in November showed that 73% of those detained by ICE in 2025 had no criminal convictions.\n\nWhen asked about those statistics, Trump officials typically push back by arguing that living in the U.S. without proper documentation is a crime, although it is often a civil offense or, when criminal, a misdemeanor.\n\nThe president has also ramped up harsh and at times derogatory rhetoric against immigrants, particularly from certain ethnic groups, such as Somali immigrants. \n\nHe’s likely to continue to tout his work on border control, but that’s unlikely to give Republicans much of a boost next November, said Steve Cortes, a former Trump adviser who consults on Republican campaigns. \n\n“With the economy as issue No. 1, 2 and 3, immigration is helpful, but I don’t think it’s decisive,” he said.\n\nThis is a preview of MS NOW’s Project 47 Newsletter.

Mark Kelly of Arizona sent a letter to Secretary of the Navy John Phelan this week that condemned an ongoing Pentagon investigation into the senator in no uncertain terms.\n\n“To be clear: there is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” the letter read.\n\nAt about the same time, the Defense Department said it’s advancing its probe into Kelly anyway. The Washington Post reported:\n\nThe Pentagon said Monday night that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is ‘escalating’ his review of Sen. Mark Kelly’s involvement in a video he and other Democratic lawmakers made reminding service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders — an unprecedented use of the military justice system to investigate a political adversary.\n\nIn a statement, the Defense Department said it was elevating what had been a ‘review’ to an ‘official Command Investigation’ to be carried out at least in part by the Pentagon general counsel’s office.\n\nIf anyone needs a refresher, it was almost a week after several Democratic military veterans urged service members to reject illegal orders when Hegseth announced an investigation into Kelly, a decorated Navy veteran. The Arizona Democrat is the only member of the group who retired as a captain and served long enough to receive a military pension.\n\nAs a result, the senator is not only still required to follow the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but he can also be punished in a variety of ways: The Pentagon could lower his rank, target his pension or, as Hegseth emphasized a few weeks ago, recall Kelly to active service in order to face a court-martial.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that any such efforts to punish Kelly would be ridiculous under the circumstances. All the senator did was remind service members to follow the law and the UCMJ, echoing comments Hegseth himself made before he joined Donald Trump’s Cabinet.\n\nAnd yet, the Pentagon’s effort isn’t just ongoing, it’s intensifying, even as the Democratic target of this obviously political campaign receives support from his Republican colleagues.\n\nTime will tell where this goes — though it’s worth emphasizing that building any kind of credible case against Kelly, who didn’t do anything wrong, would be practically impossible — but the senator’s attorney sent an unsubtle rhetorical shot across the Pentagon’s bow in his correspondence with the Navy secretary.\n\n“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” the lawyer wrote.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pentagon-hegseth-investigation-mark-kelly","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765900928/251215-pete-hegseth-mark-kelly-zz/251215-pete-hegseth-mark-kelly-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 16:30:27","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":387308870,"title":"Killings of Rob Reiner and his wife stun Hollywood as decision on charges for their son looms","text":"By CHRISTOPHER WEBER and MIKE BALSAMO\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles police are set to present a case to prosecutors Tuesday following Nick Reiner’s arrest in the killings of his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, which stunned their communities in Hollywood and Democratic politics, where both were widely beloved.\n\nProsecutors are set to decide whether and how to charge 32-year-old Nick Reiner, who is being held in jail without bail. He was arrested several hours after his parents were found dead in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday, police said.\n\nRob Reiner was the Emmy-winning star of the sitcom “All in the Family” who went on to direct films including “When Harry Met Sally…” and “The Princess Bride.” He was an outspoken liberal activist for decades. Michele Singer Reiner was a photographer, movie producer and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. They had been married for 36 years.\n\nRepresentatives for the Reiner family did not respond to requests for comment, and it wasn’t clear if Nick Reiner had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Police haven’t said anything about a motive for the killings.\n\nInvestigators believe Rob and Michele Singer Reiner died from stab wounds, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official, who was briefed on the investigation, could not publicly discuss the details and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe killings were especially shocking given the warm comic legacy of the family. Rob Reiner was the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, who died in 2020 at age 98.\n\nKathy Bates, who won an Oscar as the star of Rob Reiner’s 1990 film “Misery,” was among those paying tribute to the couple.\n\n“I loved Rob,” Bates said in a statement. “He was brilliant and kind, a man who made films of every genre to challenge himself as an artist. He also fought courageously for his political beliefs. He changed the course of my life. Michele was a gifted photographer.”\n\nBill Clinton called the couple “good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better.”\n\n“Hillary and I are heartbroken by the tragic deaths of our friends Rob and Michele Reiner,” he said in a statement. “They inspired and uplifted millions through their work in film and television.”\n\nThree months ago, Nick Reiner was photographed with his parents and siblings at the premiere of his father’s film “Spinal Tap 2: The End Continues.”\n\nHe had spoken publicly of his struggles with addiction, cycling in and out of treatment facilities with bouts of homelessness in between through his teen years. Rob and Nick Reiner explored — and seemed to improve — their relationship through the making of the 2016 film, “Being Charlie.”\n\nNick Reiner co-wrote and Rob Reiner directed the film about the struggles of an addicted son and a famous father. It was not autobiographical but included several elements of their lives.\n\n“It forced us to understand ourselves better than we had,” Rob Reiner told the AP in 2016. “I told Nick while we were making it, I said, ‘You know it doesn’t matter, whatever happens to this thing, we won already.’”\n\nRob Reiner was long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and ’90s, including “This is Spinal Tap” and “A Few Good Men.”\n\nHe met Michele Singer Reiner on the set of “When Harry Met Sally…,” and their meeting would inspire the film’s shift to a happy ending, with stars Billy Crystal — one of Reiner’s closest friends for decades — and Meg Ryan ending up together on New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe Reiners were outspoken advocates for liberal causes and major Democratic donors.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday blamed Rob Reiner’s outspoken opposition to the president for the actor-director’s killing, delivering the unsubstantiated claim in a social media post that seemed intent on decrying his opponents even in the face of a tragedy.\n\nBalsamo reported from Washington.

His remarks faced massive criticism, even from celebrities.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg, who is a known Trump critic, wrote, “I don’t understand the man in the White House. He spoke at length about Charlie Kirk and about caring, and then this is what he puts out. Have you no shame? No shame at all? Can you get any lower? I don’t think so.”\nJimmy Kimmel, who was previously engaged in a dispute with Donald Trump over a comment he made following Charlie Kirk’s death, also reacted to the POTUS’s recent statement.\n\nJimmy Kimmel addressed Donald Trump’s reaction to Rob Reiner’s death:\n“What we need in a time like this is compassion and leadership.

The host added, “What we need in a time like this, besides common sense when it comes to guns and mental healthcare, is compassion and leadership.”\n\n“We did not get that from our president because he has none of it to give. Instead, we got a fool rambling about nonsense, we got a brief moment of respect for our friends in Australia, we got a brief moment of condolence followed by a ‘thing happened’ for the students at Brown and for Rob and Michele Reiner,” said Kimmel.\n\nMeanwhile, Piers Morgan had a suggestion for Trump. “Delete it, Mr President,” he said. Condemning the Republican leader’s remarks, Morgan said, “This is a dreadful thing to say about a man who just got murdered by his troubled son.”","summary":"Donald Trump made some brutal claims about Rob Reiner, and not many like it.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/celebs-erupt-after-trump-claims-rob-reiner-had-a-mind-crippling-disease-following-his-shocking-death","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donald-Trumps-Comments-About-Rob-Reiner-Met-with-Criticism-From-Celebrities.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 16:23:31","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.42},{"id":387311040,"title":"‘Bombshell’: Biden officials knew Mar-a-Lago raid against Trump was illegal, but did it anyway","text":"Under Joe Biden’s administration, the FBI staged a SWAT-style raid on President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\nNow a report is revealing his administration was told there was no basis for probable cause, meaning the raid was illegal and they knew it.\n\nAnd they did it anyway.\n\nNow Congress is expected to act on the knowledge of that politicization and weaponization by Biden of the federal government against his political foe.\n\nA report at Just the News explains Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have documents and are giving them to Congress.\n\nThey include “bombshell emails showing the FBI warned that the Biden Justice Department did not have probable cause to raid President Donald Trump‘s home at Mar-a-Lago, but prosecutors proceeded anyway,” the report said.\n\nThe revelations come just as Jack Smith, the failed special prosecutor assigned to carry the burden of Democrat lawfare cases against Trump who lost the cases when Trump was re-elected, is expected to testify to Congress about the lawfare.\n\n“The memos show the FBI’s Washington field office ‘does not believe they established probable cause’ prior to raiding Trump’s Florida home, according to one source with direct knowledge of the memos about to be turned over to Congress,” Just the News confirmed.\n\nThat raid became a flashpoint in the battle between Trump and Biden and triggered indictments against Trump that later were dismissed.\n\nThe FBI, at the raid, staged government documents on the floor of Mar-a-Lago and released images in what could only be seen at the time as an attempt to make Trump look guilty.\n\nSmith was ordered by the House Judiciary Committee to deliver a closed-door deposition to provide evidence for the committee’s investigation of the weaponization of government.\n\nEx-Attorney General Merrick Garland claimed he authorized the raid personally:\n\nGarland: “I personally approved” the Mar-a-Lago raid. pic.twitter.com/qw8HJOcsGZ\n— Greg Price (@greg_price11) August 11, 2022\n\nBut there long have been discussions about how the raid actually wasn’t legitimate:\n\nREMINDER: Even senior FBI agents thought the plan from Biden’s AG to use heavily armed agents to raid Mar-A-Lago was absolutely insane. pic.twitter.com/JNdY1XQezL\n— Mollie (@MZHemingway) May 22, 2024\n\nAnd Patel has confirmed the FBI had no reason to pursue the raid:\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel confirmed there was no legal basis for the Mar-a-Lago raid:\n“There was no predicate to go and invade Donald Trump’s home.” pic.twitter.com/4Hv96V9Csu\n— Fox News (@FoxNews) August 20, 2025\n\nAt Not the Bee was the comment: “If true, it means Biden’s people did not only ignore the law and violate Trump’s constitutional rights, but they knew they were violating the law and did it anyway.”\n\nThe report said:\n\n“The raid was conducted in order to find classified documents that Trump had allegedly failed to turn over when his first term ended.

They said that Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nTwo US officials, speaking to the Reuters news agency, described the proposed protections as “Article 5-like”, a reference to NATO’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge – meaning an attack on one is an attack on all.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Berlin, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv needed a clear understanding of the security guarantees on offer before making any decisions on territorial control under a potential peace settlement.

Kyiv received security assurances backed by the US and Europe after gaining independence in 1991, but those did not prevent Russia’s invasions in 2014 (Crimea) and 2022.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Washington had offered “considerable” security guarantees during the Berlin talks.\n\n“What the US has placed on the table here in Berlin, in terms of legal and material guarantees, is really considerable,” Merz said at a joint news conference with Zelenskyy.\n\nRussia has yet to comment on the proposals.\n\n“We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it [the war] ended also,” Trump told reporters on Monday.\n\n“We had numerous conversations with President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia, and I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever, and we’ll see what we can do.”\n\nSince coming to power in January, the US president has been making efforts to end the war and has pressed Ukraine to offer concessions.\n\nSeveral rounds of high-level discussions, including an Alaska summit between Trump and Putin in August, and draft peace proposals have failed to end Europe’s deadliest war since World War II.\n\nWhat did Zelenskyy say?\n\nIn an X post, Zelenskyy wrote on Monday that “if these meetings had taken place earlier, the progress would have been even greater”, referring to meetings with Witkoff and Kushner.\n\n“Of course, we have different positions with Russia regarding territories. This must be acknowledged and discussed openly. I believe that the American side, acting as a mediator, will propose various steps to try to find at least some form of consensus,” Zelenskyy wrote.\n\n“We will do everything possible to find clear answers to questions about security guarantees, territories, and money as compensation for Ukraine to rebuild. It is necessary to understand the source of this funding.”\n\nUkraine had earlier signalled it may be willing to abandon its ambition to join the NATO military alliance in exchange for firm Western security guarantees. The Trump administration has been against NATO membership for Kyiv.\n\nHe added, “We are discussing security guarantees. And before taking any steps on the battlefield, both the military and the civilian population must have a clear understanding of what the security guarantees will be. This is very important.”\n\nIt is unclear what particular security guarantees Ukraine would receive, and which countries will contribute to providing them.\n\nAddressing the Dutch parliament on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine and Europe are working on a document that could “stop the killing,” adding that “every single detail matters” and “every detail represents a human life”, according to Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine, reporting from Kyiv.\n\nMcAlpine said that Zelenskyy is mirroring the language of Trump, who has said the phrase “stop the killing” time and time again.\n\n“He’s talking about documents. We know, before this meeting in Berlin, there were three documents in circulation. Now it appears from comments from Zelenskyy that there are five documents, the details of which we are still waiting to gather. But certainly it’s an evolving landscape with lots of difficult and nuanced pieces which we’re still waiting to get more information on,” McAlpine added.\n\nIs a ceasefire truly ‘closer than ever’?\n\nExperts doubt it.\n\n“Trump has repeatedly claimed that a peace deal is close without sustainable agreement,” Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at London think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAnother foreign policy expert, Nathalie Tocci, believes “it’s extremely unlikely that a ceasefire is going to be reached now.”\n\n“I think that it’s far more likely that we’re going to remain in the context of ongoing war,” Tocci, director at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, told Al Jazeera. She added that this is because issues of territory and security remain unresolved.\n\nRussia controls nearly 20 percent of eastern Ukraine and has been slowly gaining territory as Ukraine’s military has been weakened by desertions and dwindling military aid. Moscow annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014.\n\n“It’s probably impossible that Ukrainians will voluntarily withdraw from these territories unless we will also see a withdrawal of Russian forces on the other side,” Tocci told Al Jazeera.\n\nAl Jazeera’s McAlpine also said that one of the main sticking points is the question of territory.\n\nShe added that Zelenskyy has recently been firm on not giving up the Ukrainian territory of Donbas (in the country’s east). “We know that the Russian side is hoping to control the entirety of the Donbas region. Ukraine would prefer to draw the lines where they are,” McAlpine said.\n\n“Recent polling here in Ukraine shows that 75 percent of Ukrainians reject withdrawal from the Donbas region.” They back the idea of freezing the current front line.\n\nGiles from Chatham House said that there are still parallel negotiation tracks – one involving the US and Ukraine, and another between Ukraine and European nations. He added that there is no clear evidence that these efforts are fully coordinated or aligned in terms of strategy.\n\n“There is no guarantee that anything agreed will be accepted by Russia, and reason to think that anything that was agreed is achievable,” Giles added.\n\n“The key ingredient to make a ceasefire possible remains exactly as it has always been. Russia will only agree to stop fighting if it feels that it will gain more from a ceasefire than it will from continuing to attack Ukraine,” he said.\n\nWhat will end the war in Ukraine?\n\n“The answer to what will end the fighting remains the same that it always has been, for Russia to be beaten back and for Ukraine to be beaten into submission,” Giles said.\n\nGiles explained that Russia and Ukraine can not agree on the same terms for a ceasefire because their war aims are incompatible and “so far apart that they are exceptional in terms of modern wars.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly echoed many of the demands by the Kremlin, including on territorial concessions. His initial 28-point plan to end the war included a clause on amnesty for Russian war crimes. Zelenskyy has expressed his opposition to it.\n\nGiles said that after the 28-point plan, which has since been revised following pushback from European leaders, Russia feels it is at a disadvantage.\n\n“Russia will only accept a ceasefire agreement if it believes it can violate at will and that facilitates its resumption of the war at a time of its choosing,” he added.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/russia-ukraine-war-is-a-ceasefire-deal-on-the-horizon/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/afp_69413aace30c-1765882540-BX143S.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 16:06:10","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":387314242,"title":"Path to Ukraine peace not ‘straight line’, Starmer says after ‘productive’ talks","text":"Sir Keir Starmer has cautioned that the path to peace in Ukraine was “not an entirely straight line” after “productive” talks in Berlin.\n\nThe Prime Minister and other European leaders set out conditions for any peace deal with Russia after a Monday meeting in the German capital, with security guarantees backed by the US.\n\nDowning Street said setting out the UK’s contribution to a Europe-led multinational force in Ukraine – a proposal forming part of the new package of security guarantees – was “a few steps away yet”.\n\nSir Keir, updating his Cabinet on the Berlin discussions on Tuesday, said progress had been made.\n\n“The Prime Minister said we were making progress, including on security guarantees,” according to a No 10 readout.\n\n“He said it was clear the path to peace was not an entirely straight line but that the meeting in Berlin last night had been productive.”\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey meanwhile said the Ukraine war was at a “major moment” with progress in the US-led peace push “further advanced than at any time” during the conflict, but urged allies to keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe told a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group (UDCG), which he chaired alongside German defence minister Boris Pistorius, that they had a “clear-cut” mission to help Ukraine in its fight today while securing peace tomorrow.\n\n“We are at a major moment in this war,” Mr Healey told the group of around 50 nations committed to providing military support for Kyiv.\n\n“The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war.”\n\nFunding would continue to go to UK troops so they were “ready to deploy when peace comes, with troops on the ground and jets in the air”, he said.\n\nBut at the same time, the Russian president continued drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, he added.\n\n“We must step up our support still further, to put pressure on Putin to do a deal, but also to protect the Ukrainians during the winter months,” he said.\n\nOn Monday, European leaders said in a joint statement that they and the US had agreed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees” as well as support for Ukraine’s economic recovery.\n\nIt included six commitments for any peace deal, including an 800,000-troop limit on the Ukrainian military, deployment of a European multinational force in the country and strong support for Ukraine’s membership of the EU.\n\nAsked what Britain’s input into the force could be, Sir Keir’s spokesman told reporters: “I think that’s kind of a few steps away yet.\n\n“We’ve always said that the first step is to secure a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.\n\n“I think we’re a step closer to that today after this productive meeting yesterday, but we are still at a critical moment in discussions. There is a lot of work to do.\n\n“We haven’t yet got to the stage where we would comment on that kind of specific.”\n\nForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper also told MPs it would be “premature” to talk about the details of the UK’s role, as she highlighted the importance of security guarantees to prevent Mr Putin from rearming and then launching further attacks.\n\nA previous draft of the US-backed proposal had suggested limiting Ukraine’s armed forces to 600,000 troops, but the higher figure is more acceptable to Kyiv and only slightly below its current level.\n\nOther conditions included a legally binding commitment from allies to come to Ukraine’s aid if it was attacked by Russia again.\n\nBut it featured no mention of Ukrainian membership of Nato, and no hard conditions on whether Kyiv should cede territory to Russia, beyond saying this was a decision “for the people of Ukraine”.\n\nOfficials are optimistic that there could be some movement on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, after positive progress has been made over the last few weeks.\n\nUkraine and 34 other countries have approved plans to establish a compensation body to pay for damages caused by Moscow’s invasion, with the EU mulling the use of frozen Russian money for that purpose.\n\nMs Cooper told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee: “The UK supports the reparation loan proposals that the European Commission have put forward, and I am continuing to have discussions with other European countries, other foreign ministers, about their support for making sure that those Russian sovereign assets can be mobilised to support both military support and also economic support as well for Ukraine.\n\n“Frankly, I just think that Russia should pay for the damage that they have done to Ukraine, and that’s why this is the right thing to do, as well as increasing the pressure on Russia to come to the table.”\n\nMonday’s meeting in Berlin follows almost a year of discussions about a peace deal following US president Donald Trump’s promise to end the war on his first day in office in January.\n\nMoscow has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire, and is strongly opposed to any deal that sees Nato troops deployed in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has also repeatedly pushed for Ukraine to give up territory in any peace deal, with Mr Trump appearing at times to suggest he would support Kyiv surrendering territory in exchange for peace.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the draft peace plan discussed in Berlin was “very workable” but rejected the US push for transferring territory to Russia.","summary":"Progress is being made on security guarantees for Kyiv, the Prime Minister told his Cabinet.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ukraine-keir-starmer-prime-minister-john-healey-yvette-cooper-b1262809.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/16/14/6a859445358276964a1194a9fa6625d5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY1OTc5ODEw-2.82741636.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 16:05:05","author":"Sophie Wingate","authors":["Sophie Wingate"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.058},{"id":387314114,"title":"Trump Promised ‘Lower Prices’ on Day One — A Year Later, Americans Struggle to Afford Basic Needs, Poll Shows","text":"Donald Trump talks the talk, but can’t walk the walk.

The President confidently repeated his claims of planning to lower prices starting on “day one” throughout his campaign.

Being able to afford basic needs like groceries and health care has now become uncertain for many.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump carries an alternate narrative in his monologue and can be heard demanding to be revered for his inaction. Ironically, the President believes he has done justice to the promises he made while citing what critics describe as made-up data. He took to social media just last week to rant about the lack of credit on the citizens’ part.\n\n“When will I get credit for having created, with No Inflation, perhaps the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country?” he wrote in a post on Truth Social. He then implied that people were just unaware and blind to all the good he has done since his term started.\n\nHe also discredited the existing data but also claimed that the polls weren’t doing justice to the flourishing economy under his administration. “When will Polls reflect the Greatness of America at this point in time, and how bad it was just one year ago?”\n\nA report by Alaska Native News reveals that 27% of Americans skipped their medical checkups due to rising costs in the last two years, while 23% have skipped prescriptions.

The president wrote, “I have been briefed on the shooting that took place at Brown University in Rhode Island. The FBI is on the scene. The suspect is in custody.”\n\nThat wasn’t true. Many Americans learned long ago that the incumbent president is not a reliable source of information during major events, and this offered a timely reminder as to why: There was no suspect in custody, and as of this writing, the search is still underway.\n\nTwo days later, at an unrelated White House event, Trump made matters noticeably worse. Asked whether FBI Director Kash Patel had told him why it’s been difficult to identify a suspect in the shooting, the Republican replied, “You’d really have to ask the school a little bit more about that because this was a school problem.”\n\nTrump added, “They had their own guards. They had their own police. They had their own everything, but you’d have to ask that question really to the school, not to the FBI.”\n\nPassing the buck here was tough to defend, although as it turns out, Trump wasn’t the only member of his team to respond to the deadly shooting in an unfortunate way. NBC News reported:\n\nOn Sunday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a lengthy X message about the work the bureau had done to help detain someone he called ‘a person of interest in a hotel room in Coventry, RI, based off a lead by the [police department in Providence, Rhode Island].’\n\nAbout 12 hours later, law enforcement officials released that person from custody, with Providence police pushing back on Patel’s earlier post. Police said the lead about the person of interest was ‘picked up by’ the FBI, not local authorities, as Patel had indicated.\n\nThe false information from bureau’s hapless director would’ve been easier to overlook if it had been a one-time slip-up.\n\nBut it wasn’t. In September, Patel, who’s long prioritized the spotlight over credibility, published false information to social media about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, sparking a round of mockery for the former podcast personality.\n\nA month later, Patel published an item on social media to alert the public to some startling news. “This morning the FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend,” the director wrote, adding that there would be “more details to come.”\n\nMS NOW reported soon afterward that senior Justice Department and FBI officials expressed frustration that Patel had “publicly disclosed an investigation into what he called a ‘potential’ Halloween weekend terrorist plot near Detroit — before investigators had a chance to flesh out key details, including whether the attack actually was imminent.”\n\nThe same report added that Justice Department officials “registered concern that Patel appeared to have acted hastily on the probe without Main Justice’s approval, with the apparent goal of seeking some credit for the FBI, but in a way that could interfere with the investigation.”\n\nThe circumstances prompted The New York Times to note, “Mr. Patel’s impulse to seize the spotlight and publicize the work of the bureau under his leadership has revived questions about his competence and his future in the administration. It has added to the growing criticism over his recreational travel, his use of a SWAT team to protect his girlfriend and his handling of the Epstein files.”\n\nAfter Republicans confirmed Patel in February, he faced a challenge his predecessors did not: Because he lacked qualifications, relevant skills, knowledge, credibility and experience, he needed to invest real time and energy into proving his mettle, rolling up his sleeves and doing the work to earn a reputation as a serious and capable figure.\n\nMonths later, he’s done largely the opposite, careening through a series of avoidable missteps.\n\nThe latest of these incidents, in other words, was awful for Patel, but making matters worse is the degree to which few have been surprised by the latest evidence of his routine incompetence.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/fbi-kash-patel-mistakes-brown-shooting","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765898496/251215-kash-patel-zz/251215-kash-patel-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 15:59:57","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":387311062,"title":"U.S. Department of War escalates investigation into Sen.

And we are all paying the price for it.”","summary":"Trump's longtime critic is tired of her uncle's repeated attempts to belittle people and retain the spotlight on him.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trumps-niece-labels-him-deeply-disturbed-after-vile-comments-on-tragic-deaths","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mary-Trump-criticizes-Donald-Trump-for-insensitive-comments-after-the-deaths-of-Rob-Reiner-and-his-wife.-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 15:41:12","author":"Sweta Choudhury","authors":["Sweta Choudhury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.532},{"id":387314116,"title":"Ivanka Appears to Snub Donald Trump After His Bizarre Compliment to Her Lookalike","text":"Donald Trump has a history of going off-script. But during the White House Christmas Reception on December 14, he swerved straight into another round of uncomfortable déjà vu involving his 44-year-old daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nMidway through what he said was an “interesting story,” Trump stopped speaking and pointed into the crowd. His attention had locked onto a female journalist he claimed looked strikingly similar to Ivanka Trump. Then came the secondhand embarrassment. The president asked the woman to turn around so everyone else could see for themselves. He wondered whether it actually was Ivanka. “Boy, you look like Ivanka,” he said before asking if anyone had told her that before.\n\nTrump then added that it was “a great compliment!” \n\nTrump: “You look like Ivanka. Has anyone ever told you that? I’m looking,… I’m saying,… Could you turn around? So you wouldn’t,… I didn’t,… You look like jussst like Ivanka,…. which is a great compliment!”\nCreepy AF. 😬 pic.twitter.com/wzvpzObC3S\n— Roshan Rinaldi (@Roshan_Rinaldi) December 14, 2025\n\nWithin hours, viewers called the moment awkward at best and “creepy” at worst. One writes: “Why would bro say this?” Another pointed out that being compared to a politician’s daughter while doing your job as a reporter is uncomfortable.\n\nBut what made the moment louder was Ivanka Trump’s response to it, or rather, her complete lack of one. Instead of addressing the viral clip or her father’s comments, she took to Instagram Stories to share a staged glimpse of her holiday preparations. The image showed an elaborate gingerbread house with the names of her family (including that of herself, husband Jared Kushner, and their children Arabella, Joseph, and Theo) on the roof. Two more signs read “Happy Hanukkah” and “The Kushner Family.”\n\nShe also joked that two of the houses were DIY and invited followers to guess which ones. So yeah, there was absolutely no mention of her father. Many thought she was strategically distancing herself and wasn’t actually clueless. \n\nTrump kisses Ivanka on the mouth\nand caresses her thighs\nWhy don’t you write about that? https://t.co/QaH2aV9yCZ pic.twitter.com/dOvFio6Wy7\n— kj martin (@martin_kj) December 9, 2025\n\nThen again, we have to remember that this isn’t a one-off. Trump’s remarks about Ivanka have been weird for two decades. In 2006, on The View, he said, “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.” Around the same time, on The Howard Stern Show, he repeatedly called her “voluptuous” and praised her looks in ways that even left Stern stunned.\n\nIn 2013, during a joint appearance on The Wendy Williams Show, Ivanka named “real estate” and “golf” as traits she shared with her father. Trump responded with, “Well, I was going to say s–, but I can’t relate that to her.” The clip aged VERY poorly.\n\nFormer White House staffers and books have described Donald Trump making lewd comments about Ivanka Trump in front of employees, which often left people uncomfortable. Critics say he just disregards boundaries with women.\n\nThrough that lens, Ivanka Trump just avoided an all-too-familiar storm. \n\nNEXT UP: Ivanka Trump’s NYC Birthday Bash Has Everyone Talking, And It’s Not Just About Her Black Mini Dress","summary":"Ivanka couldn't care less, it seems.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/ivanka-appears-to-snub-donald-trump-after-his-bizarre-compliment-to-her-lookalike","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ivanka-Trump-shares-a-festive-gingerbread-house-post-as-her-father-Donald-Trumps-remarks-spark-backlash-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 15:20:41","author":"Sohini Sengupta","authors":["Sohini Sengupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":387311050,"title":"‘The love of my life’: Don Trump Jr. announces his engagement to Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson","text":"PALM BEACH, Florida – “She said yes!”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump, is sharing his excitement after announcing his engagement Monday night to Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson.\n\nThe news came during a White House Christmas party, as Don Jr., 47, said: “Not often that I’m at a loss for words, because we usually do the ranting and raving really well, but this is a little different.”\n\n“I just wanna wish all of you guys an incredible holiday season, a Merry Christmas, a very happy New Year, and to thank Bettina for that one word: Yes.\n\n“It’s almost when you go down there and you’re trying to ask and you’re not sure what the answer’s gonna be.

The case is being prosecuted by Attorney Geoffrey W. MacArthur and was investigated by ICE.\n\nHarris was charged with two counts of assault per the indictment obtained by the US Attorney’s Office in Pennsylvania. According to reports, the 24-year-old allegedly intervened during a routine investigation conducted by ICE officials, the aftermath of which was an arrest.\n\nSecretary Noem has been clear: if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nObstructing law enforcement is not protesting, it is a crime.

Since the officials reportedly didn’t give her the time of day, Harris followed the two men into ICE’s secure facility, where she confronted the two officials.\n\nUpon confrontation, the ICE officials allegedly asked her again to leave, but the encounter quickly turned hostile, resulting in Harris spitting on the two ICE officials. This alleged assault is what ultimately caused her to get handcuffed and detained. An official sentence is yet to be delivered; Harris remains in ICE custody until then.\n\nRemember that every time you hear Democrats attack ICE for arresting US citizens they are arresting citizens who violently obstructed or assaulted federal law enforcement and are facing criminal prosecution.\n— Stephen Miller (@StephenM) December 12, 2025\n\nCrimes of violence against ICE officials appear to be on the rise, with new cases like Harris’ being reported more frequently than before. Although these ICE officials weren’t physically injured, their colleagues haven’t been as lucky. Incidents range from officials being bitten and having Molotov cocktails thrown at them to stones being hurled. In some extreme scenarios, ICE officials have even been rammed by cars and physically assaulted, causing life-threatening injuries.\n\nRecently, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security surveyed violence against ICE officials in 2024 under both President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden’s presidencies. The results were staggering. According to the official Homeland Security website, there has been a 1,150% increase in both assault and violence against ICE officials.\n\nWhile there’s an alarming increase in crimes against ICE officials, violence against citizens also appears in tandem. A recent incident highlighted the growing tensions between ICE officials and citizens as they attempt to follow the law.\n\nOn December 15, 2025, two ICE officials requested immediate backup after they were surrounded by an angry mob that was hurling nasty insults while also throwing snowballs at them in Minneapolis. According to bystanders’ observations, the ICE officials prompted the crowd’s hostile response.\n\nReminder: if you assault a federal officer or agent, you will face the full extent of the law.\n— U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (@ICEgov) September 19, 2025\n\nThe ICE officials were amid an immigration-related arrest at a traffic light on Lake Street, Pillisbury Avenue in the afternoon. Per a video shared exclusively with MPR News, the woman appeared to be belly-down and was dragged by her hands to the car they were supposed to get in.\n\nAs the situation escalated, bystanders crowded the officials and began throwing objects. To defend themselves and ward off the growing crowd, the ICE officials reportedly used pepper spray and pepper balls. According to other observers, the officials allegedly used tasers on some people, too!\n\nLikewise, there have been an array of crimes against ICE officials and, in unfortunate cases, their victims.

Many pretend they haven’t see what the president wrote, while others say something along the lines of “Americans knew what they were getting into when they elected him.” Others still actually endorse Trump’s incendiary missives.\n\nBut when the president responded to the deaths of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, by attacking one of the victims, suggesting the filmmaker brought on his own slaying with his criticisms of Trump, something unusual happened: A variety of GOP voices, including some in Congress, agreed that the president had gone too far in his lack of basic human decency.\n\nIn a normal White House, a president would see the pushback from his own ostensible allies and realize he’d made a mistake (although in a normal White House, the comment never would have happened in the first place). In this White House, Trump acted as if he’d never heard the old expression about quitting while behind.\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3ma2iyqm2sj2c\n\nAt an unrelated event in the Oval Office, a reporter reminded the president that “a number of Republicans” had denounced his statement related to Reiner and asked, “Do you stand by that post?”\n\nThe smart move would have been for Trump to dodge the question and change the subject. He did not, however, make the smart move.\n\n“I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned,” the president said, referring to himself in third person. “He said he liked, he knew it was false — in fact, it’s the exact opposite — that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia. You know, it was the Russia hoax, he was one of the people behind it.”\n\nFor good measure, the Republican added, “He became like a deranged person, Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nFor now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Trump’s Russia scandal was not, and is not, a “hoax,” and no matter how many times he pretends the controversy has been discredited, Trump is wrong.\n\nLet’s also overlook for now that Reiner was not “one of the people behind” that scandal, making this a weird line of attack.\n\nInstead, let’s focus on the fact that Trump welcomed an avalanche of criticism from the left, right and center by condemning a celebrated artist immediately after learning of his death and, given an opportunity to make things better, made a conscious decision to make things worse.\n\nTrump is who he appears to be: a small and petty man, incapable of empathy or grace, obsessed with his grievances, unaware of what it means to be “presidential” and unable to control his worst instincts.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/on-the-reiners-death-trump-should-have-quit-while-he-was-behind","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765895397/251216-reiner-trump-split-pi/251216-reiner-trump-split-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 14:49:57","author":"Julianne McShane","authors":["Julianne McShane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.526},{"id":387314068,"title":"JFK’s Niece Rebukes Trump for ‘Insensitive’ Comment on Rob Reiner’s Death – “Explain to Him That….”","text":"Maria Shriver, John F.

But the president of the United States is supposed to have character, is supposed to know how to bring people together, is supposed to be a dignified human being who raises us up,” said the longtime Democrat-turned-Independent.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nShriver added that Trump’s comments made her ‘sick to my stomach’ and urged those close to him to help him understand the responsibility that comes with being the country’s president.\n\n“Explain to him the possibility of this office. Explain to him the responsibility of this office. Explain to him that we have had enough. All of us,” she said.\n\nShe also mentioned the Hanukkah shooting in Australia at Bondi Beach, and the weekend shooting at Brown University, emphasizing that the ‘entire world is hurting’ because of the political climate.\n\nReiner and his wife Michele were allegedly killed by their 32-year-old son Nick on Sunday (December 14). Shortly after that, the president said they died because of ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ and implied that the director’s criticism of his policies led to their deaths.\n\nShriver shared a strong bond with the Reiners. In an earlier post, she spoke about how they loved the country and ‘never gave up’ on it despite the challenges. She added that they wanted to make ‘our world better’.\n\nI am asking all America First Patriots in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District to please GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate and MAGA Warrior, Matt Van Epps!

They never gave up on our country. They wanted to make it better. They always, always wanted to make our world better, and they were willing to fight to make it the country they loved,” read her post.\n\nReiner, who was born in New York City in 1947, rose to fame as an actor with his portrayal of Michael ‘Meathead’ Stivic on the CBS sitcom All in the Family. He also appeared in films such as Sleepless in Seattle and The First Wives Club. He eventually shifted to directing, a decision that added a new dimension to his career.\n\nReiner won an Academy Award for his critically acclaimed film Misery (1990). He also directed well-received films such as When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, and Stand By Me.\n\nReiner’s death is a big loss for the film industry and marks the end of an era in Hollywood.

The lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida accused the BBC of interfering with the 2024 presidential election by airing an episode of “Panorama” featuring doctored video of Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it appear he incited the riot at the Capitol building.\n\n“The Panorama Documentary falsely depicted President Trump telling supporters: ‘We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.’ (Falsely depicted at 33:53 of the Documentary),” the complaint says. “President Trump never uttered this sequence of words.”\n\nTelegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube Nov. 3, which was similar to a description of the events in the complaint.\n\n“Moreover, the BBC purposefully omitted President Trump stating, less than one minute after urging supporters to cheer for their senators and congressmen, ‘I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard’ (Remarks made on January 6, 2021, 12:13 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 15:48 into the Speech),” the complaint states.\n\nThe BBC apologized to Trump on Nov. 13 in a letter from chairman Samir Shah after the two top BBC officials resigned following the Prescott dossier’s release, saying the program would not air again.\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep.

I do know them.”\n\nHer comments come after US President Donald Trump criticised the Reiners and alleged that their deaths were politically motivated.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump suggested Rob and Michele Reiner died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome.\n\n“He was known to have driven people crazy by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\n\n“May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\nRob Reiner was known for directing some of the most-loved films of the 1980s and 1990s, including the rom-com When Harry Met Sally, and the news of the couple’s deaths has shaken Hollywood with many paying their respects and sharing their disbelief online.\n\nAmong the tributes were those from director Francis Ford Coppola, TV host Jimmy Kimmel, singer Shania Twain and comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who said his sitcom Seinfeld “would never have happened without” Reiner, who produced the series.\n\nActress Jamie Lee Curtis, who played Reiner’s ex-wife in the hit comedy series New Girl, said: “I will always remember them as they lived. Passionate. Political. Surrounded by family and friends.\n\n“This is an ungraspable tragedy and loss. Pray for strength for their children. The world is bereft without them.”\n\nUS actor Kevin Bacon, who starred in Reiner’s legal thriller A Few Good Men, appeared emotional in a video he shared on Instagram, praising the director for giving him the job.\n\nHe said: “The making of that movie was one of the best experiences that I’ve ever had on a set.\n\n“It was a magical time. So I’m just sending love to everybody that knew him, because I know that everyone’s hurting today.”\n\nReiner’s other films included The Princess Bride (1987), Ghosts Of Mississippi (1996) The Story Of Us (1999), The Magic Of Belle Isle (2012) and LBJ (2016).\n\nHe also had acting credits, having made a name for himself playing Meathead in the 1970s TV show All In The Family, which aired between 1971-1979 in the US.\n\nActress and activist Jane Fonda said she was “reeling with grief” in a post on Instagram while Stephen King, whose books were adapted into Reiner’s films 1986’s Stand By Me and 1990’s Misery, said he was “horrified and saddened” by the death of Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nElsewhere, Kathy Bates, who played nurse Annie in psychological horror thriller Misery, told NBC News: “I’m horrified hearing this terrible news. Absolutely devastated. I loved Rob.”\n\nReiner was also friends with veteran musician Sir Elton John, who featured in the sequel to his 1984 mockumentary film about Spinal Tap, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, released in September this year.\n\nIn a post on his Instagram story, Sir Elton, 78, said: “They were two of the most beautiful people I’d ever met and they deserved better.”\n\nAlongside his work in film Reiner was also known for being a champion of liberal causes and was praised by former US presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton who each shared a post on X.\n\nMr Biden said: “Jill and I send our deepest condolences to everyone whose lives were touched by Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s extraordinary contributions.\n\n“We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.”\n\nMr Obama added: “Beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people – and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”\n\nMr Clinton also paid tribute to the couple on behalf of himself and his wife, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and said: “They inspired and uplifted millions through their work in film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defence of inclusive democracy, setting an example of us all to follow.”\n\nFormer US speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Reiner’s activism including his work to overturn California’s Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that outlawed same-sex marriages.\n\nTributes also came from Monty Python star Eric Idle, US actor James Woods, Frozen star Josh Gad, Sixteen Candles’ John Cusack, and Zoolander star Ben Stiller, and The Lord Of The Rings actor Elijah Wood, who appeared in Reiner’s 1994 family film North.\n\nReiner’s father, comedian, director and actor Carl Reiner, who died in June 2020 aged 98, helped create The Dick Van Dyke Show and appeared in films including Ocean’s Eleven.\n\nMost recently Reiner starred in season four of The Bear, but he was also in front of the camera for Sleepless In Seattle, The Wolf Of Wall Street and US sitcom New Girl.\n\nActress Ayo Edebiri, who plays Sydney Adamu in The Bear, said in a post on her Instagram story: “This man’s work changed my life and I don’t think that’s hyperbolic.”\n\nMeanwhile, New Girl actress Zooey Deschanel said her heart was broken in a tribute on Instagram to Reiner, who played her father in the hit series, and to Michele Reiner.","summary":"The former first lady paid tribute to the couple whom she described as the ‘most decent, courageous people you ever want to know’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/michelle-obama-elton-john-kevin-bacon-jamie-lee-curtis-barack-obama-b1262799.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/16/13/f778c333b8a612b009288cf5fdc0e207Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY1OTc1MzYx-2.82804745.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 13:37:20","author":"Hannah Roberts","authors":["Hannah Roberts"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.307},{"id":387311036,"title":"WATCH: Jillian Michaels leaves N.Y. Times contributor dazed and confused after he labels her a ‘white nationalist’","text":"Celebrity fitness trainer Jillian Michaels pushed back Monday after New York Times contributor Wajahat Ali accused her of being a “white nationalist.”\n\nAt least 15 people were killed Sunday when two gunmen opened fire during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, where hundreds gathered for an event known as Chanukah by the Sea, according to officials and media reports. During a discussion on “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” Ali criticized Michaels’ comments about Islamic extremism, saying that her arguments were outdated, and then he went further, flatly calling Michaels a white nationalist.\n\n“What I’m trying to say is that when people are labeled Islamophobic, I think what they’re often reacting to is an ideology that is not aligned with the West — not the vast majority of Muslims. Even if it’s, say, 10 percent, that is still a large number of people, and those are statistics,” Michaels said.\n\n“Individuals who were radicalized, we don’t know how, and saw Jews as the target through their dehumanization. There are 1.7 billion Muslim people on earth. Jillian’s talking points are from 2001, which is why I yawned. The DeLorean right now is in 2025,” Ali said. “Jillian, I know you’re discovering this. Congratulations. Let me just finish. I let you say a lot of hateful, stupid, reckless things. Jillian. You are a white nationalist. By your own admission. That’s what you are, a white nationalist. You admitted it.”\n\nMichaels immediately cut in, dismantling the accusation with a personal fact Ali appeared unprepared for.\n\n“You know I’m Arab, right? I’m Syrian and Lebanese and Turkish. When did I say I was a white nationalist?” Michaels asked.\n\n“OK, wasn’t there a clip of you saying you were a white nationalist? Oh, you’re not a white nationalist?” Ali asked.\n\nAfter Michaels denied the accusation, Ali backtracked.\n\n“Interesting to know. All right. I’m under the mistaken impression. I thought you were a white nationalist. I’m glad you’re not,” Ali said.\n\nMichaels’ paternal grandparents were of Syrian and Lebanese origin, while her maternal grandfather was the son of Italian immigrants, according to IMDB. Her maternal grandmother was born in Salford, England, to a Russian Jewish father and an Austrian Jewish mother. There are no credible articles, profiles, or documented write-ups showing that Michaels is a white nationalist.\n\nLeftist writer Ali, who frequently writes about the Muslim American experience, identity, and social justice, is a Daily Beast columnist and former New York Times op-ed contributor whose work often focuses on Islamophobia, race, immigration, and cultural inclusion.\n\nEarlier this month, Ali launched a racially charged rant telling white Americans that “brown people” were “breeding,” responding to President Donald Trump’s pledge to end “third world migration.”\n\n“The mistake that you made is you let us in in the first place. That’s because brown people, and I am going to say this as a brown person, there’s a lot of us, like a lot. There’s like 1.2 billion in India. There’s more than 200 million in Pakistan. There’s like 170 million in Bangladesh. Those are just the people over there,” Ali said.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump”. \n\n“He became like a deranged person, Trump Derangement Syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country,” Mr Trump said, \n\nThe comments drew widespread criticism, including from Republican politicians. \n\nLouisiana senator John Kennedy said: “I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man.\n\n“I think President Trump should have said nothing. I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements.”\n\nGeorgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch supporter of Mr Trump before recently becoming a critic, said that \"this is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\" and that the killings should be \"met with empathy\".\n\nKentucky representative Thomas Massie, wrote on X: \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\" \n\nHe added: “I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.”\n\nFilmmaker and actor Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Brentwood home in Los Angeles on Sunday. \n\nTheir son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nMr Reiner was a lifelong Democrat and prominent liberal activist who had spoken out against Mr Trump. \n\nHe had called the US President “mentally unfit” for office and earlier this year said he believed Mr Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US. \n\nThe President repeated his critical comments about Mr Reiner in the Oval Office. \n\nHe decribed the director, who made Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" past claims of collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's team.\n\n \"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.\n\nIt comes as the US president filed a 10 billion dollars (£7.5 billion) lawsuit against the BBC in response to the editing of a speech he made before the 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nMr Trump's lawyers argue the depiction of him given in the edit, which aired in a Panorama documentary a week before the results of the 2024 US election, \"was false and defamatory\" and they also said \"the BBC intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers around the world\".\n\nIn the Panorama programme, a clip from Mr Trump's speech on January 6 2021 was spliced to show him saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking five billion dollars (£3.7 billion) in damages on two counts: for an allegation of defamation, and for a violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\".","summary":"The US President has doubled down on remarks he made following the deaths of Rob Reiner and his wife

pressure up on Putin – Healey","text":"John Healey said the Ukraine war was at a “major moment” after an apparent breakthrough in US-led peace talks, but urged allies to keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Defence Secretary told a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group (UDCG), which he chaired alongside German defence minister Boris Pistorius, that they had a “clear-cut” mission to help Ukraine in its fight today while securing peace tomorrow.\n\nThe group, which was chaired by the US until Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, brings together around 50 nations committed to providing military support for Kyiv.\n\nIt follows a meeting in Berlin on Monday night that saw European leaders including Sir Keir Starmer set out conditions for any peace deal with Russia.\n\nAnd US officials reportedly offered Ukraine unspecified security guarantees in the event of an end to hostilities.\n\n“We are at a major moment in this war,” Mr Healey said.\n\n“The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war.”\n\nFunding would continue to go to UK troops so they were “ready to deploy when peace comes, with troops on the ground and jets in the air”, he said.\n\nBut at the same time, the Russian president continued drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, he added.\n\n“We must step up our support still further, to put pressure on Putin to do a deal, but also to protect the Ukrainians during the winter months,” he said.\n\nThe UK has committed £600 million for Ukrainian air defence, which includes providing missiles and automated turrets to shoot down Russian drones over the winter.\n\nMore than 1,000 missiles have been delivered to Ukraine since June, and production of new Octopus interceptor drones will soon start in the UK and return thousands of drones back to Ukraine every month, he said.\n\nMr Healey added: “And our mission is clear-cut: support the fight today, secure the peace tomorrow.\n\n“And if Putin chooses to continue this war into next year, our message to Moscow is clear, the UDCG will only grow stronger, more united and get even more kit into the hands of Ukrainian fighters during 2026.”\n\nOn Monday, European leaders said in a joint statement that they and the US had agreed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees” as well as support for Ukraine’s economic recovery.\n\nIt included six commitments for any peace deal, including an 800,000-troop limit on the Ukrainian military, deployment of a European multinational force in the country and strong support for Ukraine’s membership of the EU.\n\nA previous draft of the US-backed proposal had suggested limiting Ukraine’s armed forces to 600,000 troops, but the higher figure is more acceptable to Kyiv and only slightly below its current level.\n\nOther conditions included a legally binding commitment from allies to come to Ukraine’s aid if it was attacked by Russia again.\n\nBut it featured no mention of Ukrainian membership of Nato, and no hard conditions on whether Kyiv should cede territory to Russia, beyond saying this was a decision “for the people of Ukraine”.\n\nMonday’s meeting in Berlin follows almost a year of discussions about a peace deal following US president Mr Trump’s promise to end the war on his first day in office in January.\n\nMoscow has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire, and is strongly opposed to any deal that sees Nato troops deployed in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has also repeatedly pushed for Ukraine to give up territory in any peace deal, with Mr Trump appearing at times to suggest he would support Kyiv surrendering territory in exchange for peace.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been “progress” on an agreement, with the military aspects looking “quite solid”, but added there were some “destructive” elements to the American proposal that should not appear in “new versions”.\n\nHe said: “We will do everything possible to find clear answers to questions about security guarantees, territories, and money as compensation for Ukraine to rebuild.”","summary":"The Defence Secretary was speaking at a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact
