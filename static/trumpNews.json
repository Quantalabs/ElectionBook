Kathy Hochul for ‘little bitch’ remark","text":"Ex-New York Congressman Mondaire Jones apologized to Kathy Hochul after saying he didn’t want a “little bitch” as New York governor. “I want my Democratic governor of New York to be a political animal — I want them to maximize Democratic power,” Jones told The New Yorker in a piece published Wednesday. “I want my Democratic governor of New York to be Nancy Pelosi, O.K.?,” he said, referring to the longtime Democratic California congresswoman and former House speaker. “And not some, like, little bitch who is afraid to stick his or her neck out.” Jones is attempting a comeback, running against first-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler in the 17th District encompassing the lower Hudson Valley. Perhaps realizing his words would be perceived as a shot at the female governor, Jones then added to the reporter, “By the way, I’m not talking about any specific person.” But he went into damage control Wednesday, issuing a statement saying he personally apologized to Hochul and that he should have chosen his words “more wisely.” Jones had been discussing the 2022 redistricting debacle when New York judges overturned congressional maps drawn up by Democrats as overly partisan. A special master was assigned to redraw the congressional lines and the Republicans picked up five seats. “While I was not talking about the governor, and made clear during the interview that I was not referring to the governor, I should have chosen my words more wisely,” Jones said. “I have spoken with the governor and apologized for this distraction. The governor has invested tremendously in the Lower Hudson Valley and has allowed us to open up field offices and hire incredible staff who are organizing our communities across the district. I look forward to continuing to work together with her to take back the House.” Apology accepted, Hochul said. “He apologized, but I hadn’t read the article, but I accepted it and anybody wants to apologize they can apologize to me and set the record straight,” she said. Hochul said she will do all she can to help Jones defeat Lawler. “The contrast in that district, Mondaire Jones over Mike Lawler, who supports Donald Trump, he supports taking away women’s reproductive rights. I know who I’m supporting. It’s real clear to me,” Hochul said.","summary":"\"I should have chosen my words more wisely.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/mondaire-jones-apologizes-to-gov-kathy-hochul-for-little-bitch-remark/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90404597.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dQ5fScMh-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-26 01:06:23","author":"Carl Campanile,Vaughn Golden","authors":["Carl Campanile","Vaughn Golden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":257435268,"title":"Harris Speaks for American Women in Dismissing Trump’s Promise to ‘Protect’ Them","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris rejected Donald Trump’s recent assertion that, if elected, he will serve as the “protector” of women during an MSNBC interview Wednesday.

Jean Carroll, who previously accused Donald Trump of rape in 2019, wrote about journalist Natasha Stoynoff’s accusation that Trump had sexually assaulted her years earlier. On Wednesday Stoynoff appeared in a campaign ad sponsored by George Conway in which she detailed what happened when she visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago. “My name is Natasha Stoynoff. In 2005, I went to interview Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago,” she began. “At one point, Melania went upstairs to change her clothes for the next photoshoot. And Trump said to me, ‘I want to show you this beautiful painting, this beautiful room.’” “He leads me to this room, pushes me against the wall, and starts kissing me forcefully. I tried to push him, but he came back at me. I was in shock, getting smothered, and he had his hands here against my shoulders. I felt sick inside. I felt horrified, and thank goodness the butler charges into the room.” “Like many women, I blame myself. So Trump turned to me and said, ‘You know we’re going to have an affair, don’t you?’ And Melania was approaching. I was horrified,” Stoynoff continued. “When the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape came out, and also stories of many other women, including E. Jean Carroll, I realized I was not to blame, that he was just a predator of women.” “What could have happened if the butler had not come into the room? Donald Trump is an adjudicated sexual assaulter. We cannot elect this man as president,” she concluded. Stoynoff joined CNN’s Erin Burnett on OutFront Wednesday night to speak about the ads, which are produced by the Anti-Psychopath PAC. Burnett pointed out that despite the fact that Trump referenced Stoynoff by name at a campaign event two weeks ago (and he also spoke about her in 2016), he has since reversed course and claimed he doesn’t know who she is. Burnett asked Stoynoff why she is sharing her story again, after having first done so in 2016. “It is a risk to come forward. I feel that way and all the other women felt that way as well. But the risk that the country faces if he wins again is far greater to me. And I do think coming forward again right now could make a difference,” Stoynoff explained. She added that while on a 10-minute Uber ride in Colorado, she changed the mind of her driver, who was committed to vote for Trump, simply because she told her story. “So one vote at a time and that is what matters.” You can watch the ad starring Natasha Stoynoff in the video above.","summary":"“I tried to push him — he kept coming back at me,” Natasha Stoynoff says in the one-minute spot\n\n\nThe post Trump Assault Accuser Details 2005 Mar-a-Lago Incident in George Conway’s ‘Anti-Psychopath’ Campaign Ad | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-assault-accuser-natasha-stoynoff-ad/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/natasha-stoynoff-trump-accusations.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:59:32","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":257435020,"title":"Speaker Johnson calls for Zelenskyy to dismiss Ukraine’s US ambassador following visit to Pennsylvania","text":"WASHINGTON – House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s visit to an ammunition plant in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt. The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the war effort before meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. “The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy. Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova. An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended. Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown. The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year. While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin. Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket. Trump in his own speech Wednesday lashed out at Zelenskyy and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House. Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.” Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant to thank the workers who are producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S. “It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.” Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans. Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he visited Utah to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans. The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans. Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president. “The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration. The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said. Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican. However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday. “If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said. ___ Associated Press writers Stephen Groves and Lolita C.

The survey, conducted by researchers from the University of Southern California, Cal State Long Beach and Cal Poly Pomona, found that Democrats hold slim leads over Republicans in four of the state’s six most competitive congressional districts. It also shows three GOP incumbents — Rep. Michelle Steel, in the central Orange County seat CA-45, Rep. Ken Calvert, in the Inland Empire seat CA-41, and Rep. Mike Garcia, in the north Los Angeles County district CA-27 — either trailing or virtually tied with Democratic challengers. In the U.S. House of Representatives the GOP currently holds 220 seats and Democrats hold 211, while four seats are vacant. If the new survey results hold over the next two months California voters could be a key to flipping the House from red to blue. But the numbers also show that’s a big if. The survey of 3,700 voters — conducted from Sept. 14-21 in eight House districts across the state — has a 4.3% margin of error. That’s bigger than the difference in any of the closest races and suggestive of a possible statistical dead heat. The survey also includes data from voters who are undecided but leaning toward one party or another, suggesting that any Democratic gains could depend on particularly strong turnout in November. In addition to questions about congressional representation the survey also asked likely voters who they would choose for the U.S. Senate and President. Here’s a look at findings in two key Orange County races: 45th congressional district Of the 498 likely voters surveyed in the 45th district, including voters who said they were likely to vote but haven’t yet settled on a candidate, 47.9% said they favor Democrat Derek Tran, from Orange, while 46.1% said they would choose Steel, R-Seal Beach. When asked who they supported in the 2022 midterm election, 41% said they supported Steel, while 37% backed Democrat Jay Chen. More than one in five of those likely voters said they did not vote, or don’t remember voting, in ’22. While Steel’s past election wins have demonstrated Republican endurance in a Democratic-leaning district — she represents a district President Joe Biden won in 2020 — the survey results show other Democrats currently are looking strong within the district. Among CA-45 voters surveyed, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, holds a 7 point lead over Republican Steve Garvey in their race for the U.S. Senate, while Vice President Kamala Harris holds an 8.3 point lead over former President Donald Trump in their bid for the White House. Other forecasters were suggesting that Democrats were gaining ground in CA-45 even before the new poll came out. Earlier this month, the Cook Political Report changed its rating of CA-45 from “lean Republican” to “Republican toss up,” and Inside Elections, a newsletter that provides campaign analysis, also changed its rating from “lean Republican” to “tilt Republican.” Tran’s spokesperson Orrin Evans pointed to internal polling that says Tran’s lead reflects his “ability to unite a diverse coalition of supporters.” The district is among the most heavily Asian seats in the country, but it also includes a large block of Latino voters. The new survey shows Tran leading Steel by more than 10 points among Latino and Black voters and by about 2.4 points among Asian voters. Christian Grose, a political science professor at USC and the lead researcher of the survey, noted that about four in ten of the Asian voters surveyed in CA-45 are Vietnamese American. The next largest groups of Asian people who responded were Chinese and Filipino. “Vietnamese voters are splitting the vote with Steel and Tran each getting over 40%,” he said, adding that among Vietnamese surveyed voters, those under 40 appear to be supportive of Tran while older Vietnamese voters over 40 are backing Steel. The gender gap also is more pronounced in CA-45 than in most other surveyed districts, the survey found, though not in a way that might be expected in a race featuring a man and a woman. The survey found women favor Tran over Steel by about 18 points. Steel’s spokesperson, Lance Trover, said Tran and his “corporate pals” have spent over $1.5 million attacking Steel while her campaign has yet to begin its push against Tran. 47th congressional district The affluent 47th covers several coastal communities in Orange County, and it’s the only place where the new survey found that the Republican candidate, Scott Baugh, leads the Democrat, state Sen. Dave Min. It’s also the only open seat in Orange County, with three-time incumbent Katie Porter, D-Irvine, not running for re-election after losing a bid for the U.S. Senate. According to the survey, Baugh is ahead of Min by about 3 percentage points. Of the 525 likely voters surveyed in CA-47, including undecided likely voters, 48.6% said they would vote for Baugh, while 45.9% said they would choose Min. Unlike surveyed voters in CA-45, voters in the coastal district narrowly favor Garvey over Schiff for U.S. Senator. But they side with Harris, by about 3 points, over Trump, in the race for President. The poll also suggested that a recent spate of advertising for Baugh that highlight Min’s 2023 drunk driving conviction is working. When asked to list a word or phrase to describe each candidate, the words used most frequently (about 14%) to describe Min were “DUI/Drunk/Drunk driving/Drunk driver.” Grose said Min has a chance to win if there’s a very large Democratic turnout. In CA-47, surveyed voters who said they are excited to vote in November favor Min by 13.1 points. Within hours of the new poll numbers coming out, late Tuesday, Min addressed the findings in an email request for donations. “Here’s the bad news, team: Recent polling shows Dave is behind Scott Baugh by a few points,” his campaign wrote. “This poll is only going to amplify Republicans’ efforts to attack Dave by blanketing the district with false attacks. We have to correct the record and reach voters with Dave’s message.” The survey also asked voters what words they would use to describe Baugh, who in the 1990s faced his own criminal accusations, related to election interference. About 15% of voters used the word “conservative” to describe Baugh, while nearly 12% described him as “corrupt/crook/violated campaign finance laws,” and “dishonest/liar/untrustworthy.” Baugh said he isn’t worried about those results, noting his negatives are highest among Democrats who “are not going to vote for me anyway.” “Katie Porter and the Democrats spent over $30 million spreading disinformation about me,” Baugh said. “So none of that surprises me.” Baugh, a former head of the Republican Party of Orange County and a former State Assembly member, was indicted in 1996 by an Orange County Grand Jury on charges related to his State Assembly election. He later paid civil fines of nearly $48,000.","summary":"If the new survey results hold over the next two months California voters could be a key to flipping the House from red to blue....

Speaking at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump launched one of his most scathing attacks of the Ukraine’s leader, who on Thursday is set to meet Joe Biden, the US president, and vice-president Kamala Harris — Trump’s Democratic rival for the White House. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy,” Trump told the audience. “There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn’t have been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated.” Trump has repeatedly said in recent months that if he is elected to a second term he will immediately seek a settlement between Moscow and Kyiv, but he has boosted that message on the campaign trail in recent days. “We’re stuck in that war unless I’m president,” he said at a separate campaign event in Georgia on Tuesday. “I’ll get it done, I’ll get it negotiated, I’ll get out. We’ve got to get out.” Trump appears to have been angered by Zelenskyy’s comments at the start of his visit to the US in which he questioned the former president’s ability to quickly broker an agreement. Trump said: “The president of Ukraine is in our country and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president.” Zelenskyy’s visit to the US was intended as a pitch to secure more support that would put Kyiv in a better position to settle the conflict. But while he was expected to present that plan to Biden and Harris on Thursday, there is no meeting planned with Trump. In addition to Trump’s criticism of Zelensky for refusing to strike a peace deal with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Republicans have been upset by the Ukrainian president’s visit to an ammunition factory in the swing state of Pennsylvania earlier in the week. Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House, called for the resignation of Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s envoy to Washington. “The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” he wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy. “This shortsighted and intentionally political move has caused Republicans to lose trust in ambassador Markarova’s ability to fairly and effectively serve as a diplomat in this country,” he added. Ukraine’s embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden on Wednesday said the US would announce steps to accelerate lethal assistance for Ukraine but did not provide further details. Zelenskyy’s plan calls on Washington to provide binding security guarantees akin to Nato membership, permission for Kyiv to strike deep inside of Russia and more and faster military assistance. Diplomats familiar with the plan say it amounts to what Kyiv thinks it would need to be able to declare victory in its fight against Russia and create conditions for future negotiations with Moscow. But despite intense lobbying from the UK and many of Ukraine’s western allies, the US has continued to resist Kyiv’s pleas to allow it to use western weapons to strike deeper inside Russia. On the campaign trail, Harris has attacked Trump for his willingness to abandon Ukraine to the benefit of Putin, who launched his invasion in February 2022. Trump on Wednesday criticised Biden and Harris for leaving the US “locked in” to the conflict through the administration’s decisions. “Ukraine is gone. It’s not Ukraine any more,” he said. “You can never replace those cities and towns, and you can never replace the dead people, so many dead people. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the US Election Countdown newsletter for free Donald Trump has accused&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump criticizes Kyiv for not agreeing to negotiate to stop the war first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/donald-trump-criticizes-kyiv-for-not-agreeing-to-negotiate-to-stop-the-war/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:55:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":257435028,"title":"GOP Representative Clay Higgins Criticizes Haiti Harshly, Calling It the “Nastiest Country in the Western Hemisphere” in Rant","text":"Republican Clay Higgins sparked outrage after calling Haitian migrants ‘thugs’ and accusing them of eating pets and practicing ‘vudu.’ The Louisiana congressmen described Haitians as ‘slapstick gangsters’ in a now-deleted rant on X that sparked calls by his colleagues to be censured. In the post, Higgins repeated Donald Trump’s debunked claims that Haitian immigrants had been eating their neighbors’ pets. ‘These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters,’ Higgins said in the post on X. ‘All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,’ which is Inauguration Day. Similar false statements by Trump have been repeatedly debunked and only served to fuel threats and abuse against the Haitian community. Higgins, a staunch supporter of Trump, has voiced conspiracy theories in the past. He deleted the post after both Democrats and Republicans confronted him on the House floor. The head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Democratic Representative Steven Horsford, denounced Higgins comments as inciting hate and vowed to offer a resolution to censure Higgins over the tweet. ‘These words on an official post do not reflect credibly on the House,’ Horsford said. ‘In fact, they are inciting hate. They are inciting fear, and because of that, it is time for this body to stand with one voice and to ensure that there is accountability.’ Florida Republican Byron Donalds confronted Higgins later saying: ‘He and I had a conversation about it. I told him my thoughts. I thought it was not a good statement. I thought he should take it down.’ Fellow Louisiana Republican, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended Higgins noting how his tweet had already deleted. The House went into recess afterward, without taking immediate action. Later on Wednesday night, Higgins appeared to stand by his earlier comments despite having taken them off line. ‘I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want,’ he told CNN. ‘It’s not a big deal to me. It’s like something stuck to the bottom of my boot. Just scrape it off and move on with my life,’ Higgins continued. Springfield city and Ohio state officials have repeatedly debunked the false claim, though Trump has doubled down, vowing to try to deport members of the community. The majority of the 15,000 Haitian Americans in Springfield are in the U.S. legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. The Haitian community has faced an onslaught of racist abuse after Trump and his running mate Senator JD Vance falsely claimed that Haitians were eating pets. Higgins was responding to a report that a nonprofit representing the Haitian community has invoked a private-citizen right to file charges against Trump and Vance, which is permissible under Ohio law. The Haitian Bridge Alliance brought the charges over the chaos and threats experienced by Springfield and for spreading the rumor about the pet-eating. Higgins’ office has not responded to a request for comment about the post and its subsequent deletion. Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries in a statement blasted Higgins’ post as ‘vile, racist and beneath the dignity’ of the House. ‘The disgusting statement by Clay Higgins about the Haitian community is vile, racist and beneath the dignity of the United States House of Representatives,’ Jeffries said. ‘He must be held accountable for dishonorable conduct that is unbecoming of a Member of Congress. Clay Higgins is an election-denying, conspiracy-peddling racial arsonist who is a disgrace to the People’s House.’ But Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly came to his defense stressing how Higgins had regretted the post. ‘Clay Higgins is a dear friend of mine and a colleague from Louisiana and a very frank and outspoken person. He’s also a very principled man.’ He praised Higgins for deleting the post, saying ‘he prayed about it, and he regretted it and he pulled the post down. That’s what you want a gentleman to do. I’m sure he probably regrets some of the language he used, but, you know, we move forward. We believe in redemption around here.’ Higgins had been ‘approached on the floor by colleagues who said that was offensive. ‘He said he went to the back and he prayed about it, and he regretted it, and he pulled the post down.’ Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost chastised Higgins on X: ‘One of the most racist and bigoted posts I’ve seen from a fellow member of Congress. And from his official government account at that. Disgusting.’ Higgins has periodically stirred controversy with social media posts since his 2016 election to Congress – including a Facebook post in 2020 promising he would ‘drop’ armed protesters ‘where they stand.’ More recently he has spread a number of MAGA conspiracy theories including how the January 6 attack on the Capitol was orchestrated by the FBI. In 1992, Higgins he was a perpetrator of anti-black racism while an Army military policy officer, describing former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke as ‘a homeboy’ during Duke’s unsuccessful run for the presidency. ‘Regardless of the fact that David’s a homeboy and all that, the boy’s a Nazi, and that’s a real problem,’ Higgins was quoted as saying in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

A jury in 2022 found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans. The Chrisleys were also found guilty of tax evasion by hiding their earnings. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June upheld the Chrisleys’ convictions but found a legal error in how the trial judge had calculated Julie Chrisley’s sentence by holding her accountable for the entire bank fraud scheme. The appellate panel sent her case back to the lower court for resentencing. Julie Chrisley’s attorney, Alex Little, asked the judge to reduce his client’s sentence to no more than five years. He argued that she was a minor player in the crimes, that her “scattered offenses” were “dramatic mistakes.” He also noted that she has behaved well and taken advantage of enrichment opportunities during her 20 months in prison so far, receiving more than 70 certificates. In a court filing, Little had argued that Chrisley’s two youngest children are struggling with “day-to-day functioning” because of their mother’s absence. Federal prosecutor Annalise Peters urged the judge to reimpose the seven-year sentence. She argued that prosecutors had been conservative in charging the Chrisleys, that Julie Chrisley was a “core part” of a fraudulent scheme and that she had not apologized, shown remorse or admitted wrongdoing. Chrisley’s good behavior in prison does not cancel out an “11-year journey of fraud after fraud after fraud,” Peters said. Peters said she felt sympathy for Chrisley’s family but that their suffering was “a natural consequence of this defendant’s criminal choices.” Chrisley, dressed in a navy blue prison uniform and with her formerly blond hair now dark brown, addressed the judge. “I apologize for my actions and what led me to where I am today,” she said, later adding that her time in prison has been “the most difficult time in my life” and has been hard on her family. “I cannot ever repay my children for what they have had to go through, and for that I am sorry,” she said. Before the Chrisleys became reality television stars, they and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks in the Atlanta area to obtain fraudulent loans, prosecutors said during their trial. They accused the couple of spending lavishly on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel, and using new fraudulent loans to pay off old ones. Todd Chrisley then filed for bankruptcy, according to prosecutors, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans. U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross said that when she originally sentenced Chrisley she took into account her age, health and the fact that she was a caretaker for young children and elderly parents. Ross said she imposed a sentence that fell below the guidelines for Chrisley’s crimes and situation and below what prosecutors had requested. That departure from the guidelines was not based on the loss amount or the number of years that Chrisley was involved, so her sentence will not change, Ross said. The judge noted that many people she has sent to prison have children and most don’t have the resources or the support system the Chrisleys have. “It saddens me every time I see children going through that,” Ross said, later adding that she reminds herself, “I am not the one who made the choices to put the children in that situation.” Two of Chrisley’s adult children, Savannah and Chase, attended the hearing. Savannah Chrisley, who spoke in support of Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy at the Republican National Convention in July, told reporters outside the courthouse that the prosecution and sentencing of her parents was politically motivated. She said her mother will appeal the new sentence. Todd Chrisley is serving a sentence of 12 years behind bars. The couple was originally ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution, but Ross said Wednesday that the amount now stands at $4.7 million. Todd Chrisley, 56, is at a minimum security federal prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, with a release date in September 2032, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons website. Julie Chrisley, 51, had been held at a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, and is expected to return there.","summary":"Federal prosecutor Annalise Peters urged the judge to reimpose the seven-year sentence.

The former president recently claimed that he would not require approval from Congress to enact his plan.A number of economists have warned that the former president's proposal, which Trump says would target countries that are \"ripping us off,\" could adversely affect U.S. consumers and businesses.Harris, who says that the Trump plan amounts to a new \"national sales tax\" since increased import costs caused by tariffs would likely be passed on to consumers, denounced the plan during her MSNBC interview on Wednesday.\"You don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board,\" Harris said after Ruhle pointed out that President Joe Biden has some limited tariffs in place and asked whether she thought there were \"good\" or \"bad\" tariffs. \"[Trump is] just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues.\"\"One must be serious and have a plan,\" she added. \"And a real plan that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation in a political rally, but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment and the economic impact on everyday people.\"Harris went on to tout her proposals for $25,000 in \"down payment assistance for first-time home buyers,\" a $6,000 child tax credit and a $50,000 \"tax deduction for first-time small businesses.\"Harris on 'Broken Immigration System'\"We do have a broken immigration system,\" Harris said after being asked what she would do to help communities \"at capacity\" after taking in migrants. \"It needs to be fixed.\"Harris then pointed to the bipartisan border security bill that Trump urged Republicans to kill earlier this year, with the vice president saying that her opponent does not want to fix immigration and instead uses the issue only for political purposes.\"Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem that he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill,\" said Harris. \"He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.\"My pledge is that, when elected president if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law,\" she added. \"We need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways to citizenship.\"Women's Rights and Trump's 'Protector' RemarkTrump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally on Monday that women would \"no longer be thinking about abortion\" if he returned to the White House while pledging to be, from the Oval Office, the \"protector\" of women.Harris addressed the remark during her interview with Ruhle, denouncing the role that the former president played in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and pointing out that Trump previously said that \"some form of punishment\" should be given to women who get abortions.\"Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future,\" said Harris.\"He also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v. Wade, and now in state after state you see laws being passed that do punish women,\" she continued.Harris went on to say the following of Trump: \"I don't think the women of America need him to say that he's going to protect them, the women of America need him to trust them.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Wednesday night.","summary":"Harris took part in her first major one-on-one television interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/3-key-takeaways-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-1959525","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2480779/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:44:01","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":257434434,"title":"About 2 in 3 Asian American voters support Harris in tight US presidential race","text":"Roughly two in three Asian American voters support Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris over her Republican rival Donald Trump, a recent survey showed, amid expectations over the role of the rapidly growing voting bloc in the Nov. 5 general election. APIAVote, a nonpartisan organization for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, and AAPI Data, a research entity, released the outcome of the survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago from Sept. 3-9. The survey found that 66 percent of Asian American voters, including Korean Americans, plan to vote for Vice President Harris — 20 percentage points higher than President Joe Biden's support in the survey conducted in the April-May period. The latest survey put support for former President Trump at 28 percent. Those who say they would support another candidate or are undecided accounted for 6 percent. In terms of candidate favorability, 62 percent of Asian American voters said they have a favorable opinion of Harris, compared to 35 percent who have an unfavorable opinion of the vice president. Twenty-eight percent of Asian American voters said they have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared to 70 percent who have an unfavorable opinion of the former president. In the survey, 77 percent of Asian American voters said they are \"absolutely certain\" they will vote in the 2024 election, up from 68 percent who said the same in the survey conducted in April-May. The survey came as Harris and Trump are making all-out efforts to court undecided swing state voters with polls showing them in a tight race less than six weeks away from Election Day. Commenting on the survey results, Harris' campaign underscored its investments into reaching out to Asian American voters, as well as the importance of Democrats' work to build a \"broad, diverse\" coalition needed to win the election. \"Team Harris-Walz and Democrats know that Asian American voters are the margin of victory in this election — and we are working to earn every single vote,\" Andrew Peng, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement.

Among the discussions are what events can be secured, as well as the possibility that he might travel less on his own Trump-branded plane, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Secret Service officials had previously suggested to Trump’s team that it consider additional changes to his travel plans and campaign routines, after two assassination attempts against him in roughly two months. Trump and his team are also facing an assassination threat from Iran as revenge for ordering the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in early 2020, while Iran also has led hacking attempts on campaign officials’ emails. Two federal intelligence officials briefed Trump on Tuesday about the threats from Iran, his campaign said. An official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an umbrella entity that helps coordinate the work of the nation’s intelligence agencies, acknowledged the briefing but declined Tuesday and today to comment on the substance. As an example of what some travel could look like, the Trump team used multiple planes to get the candidate and his team to an event site in North Carolina on Wednesday, according to a person briefed on the matter. A Secret Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment today. Trump has always been a challenging figure for officials to protect compared with previous presidents, both when he was in office and since he left. He owns multiple properties, is set in his ways and doesn’t like to change his routine, and he is happiest when he’s greeting people on the patios of his clubs. Now, his aides have been forced to consider adjusting his travel schedule. They were advised that at least one event couldn’t be adequately secured in time for a planned visit. And he has told advisers he is not planning to play golf — his main source of relaxation — at his courses. The most recent assassination attempt occurred at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15. Ryan W. Routh, 58, of Kaaawa, had staked out Trump’s golf course and hid inside shrubs on the perimeter of the course as he waited for Trump to get within range of his semiautomatic rifle, authorities said. A Secret Service agent, scouting the course ahead of Trump, spotted the barrel of Routh’s gun in the bushes and started firing at him. Routh ran from the golf course and tried to escape in his car before police caught him 45 minutes later on a highway. He faces two firearm charges, but federal prosecutors plan to pursue a charge of attempted assassination. Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, declined to address specific questions about the campaign’s planning in response to threats, and instead blamed Democrats generally and Vice President Kamala Harris specifically for rhetoric that he said has been “emboldening” people seeking to harm Trump. The former president and current Republican presidential nominee prides himself on his plane. It has his name emblazoned on it in gold — his advisers refer to it as Trump Force One — and he wanted to keep using it as president after the 2016 election, something that the Secret Service did not support. He has also used his plane as a political backdrop, flying in to appear at rallies within view of crowds or using it behind him at airplane hangar events, a projection of power to rival Air Force One. But privately owned planes like Trump’s — a refurbished Boeing 757 that Trump bought from billionaire Paul Allen two decades ago — are not equipped with the kind of protections that Air Force One has. Using other private planes could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign’s spending. And Trump’s advisers have devoted a significant amount of time and energy dealing with security arrangements, three people briefed on the matter said. Trump’s team has dealt with other threats that have disrupted recent trips. On at least one campaign stop, a drone was spotted flying over Trump’s motorcade. The Secret Service scrambled the motorcade cars in different directions to create confusion about which car Trump was riding in, according to two people briefed on the discussions. And a planned visit to a Polish shrine in Pennsylvania last Sunday was canceled partly for security reasons, three people briefed on the matter said. Trump addressed the Iranian threats on his social media website today. “Moves were already made by Iran that didn’t work out, but they will try again,” Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after midnight. “Not a good situation for anyone. I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before.” In private discussions with his associates, Trump has repeatedly questioned why the Biden administration isn’t doing more to publicly denounce the threats he’s facing and to put Iran on notice, according to two people with knowledge of his remarks. “If this was Kamala or another Democrat, we’d blow up Iran,” one of those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, recalled Trump saying. “They won’t do anything because it’s me.” Some in Trump’s circle spoke of then-President Bill Clinton ordering Tomahawk cruise missiles fired on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad after a foiled assassination attempt on Clinton’s predecessor, George H.W. Bush. Trump made a version of that statement today at an event in Mint Hill, North Carolina, suggesting that the current administration should warn foreign leaders threatening Trump that if they harm him, they’ll be blown “to smithereens.” “And there would be no more threats,” Trump said, adding, “Right now we don’t have that leadership or the necessary leaders.” He pointed out that the president of Iran is in the United States for the U.N. General Assembly, being guarded by law enforcement officials, while he, the former president, remains under threat, describing it as a strange set of circumstances. Trump has told aides that he “can’t think about” the threats. Yet he has shown occasional signs that the assassination attempts are getting to him. At a rally in New York last week, he was visibly startled when he thought he saw someone approaching the stage as he spoke. He acknowledged, chuckling, that he has a “yip problem,” referring to his nerves. Trump has vented to aides that the threats he’s facing and the enhanced security they require constitute a form of “foreign election interference” meant to prevent him from campaigning. And while Trump and his team are supportive — and protective — of the former president’s own Secret Service detail, they have been concerned with the agency’s headquarters and whether agency leadership had previously approved a sufficient level of protection for him. Tensions between the Trump campaign and the Secret Service deepened significantly after the near-miss shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The Senate passed legislation unanimously this week to mandate that the Secret Service provide the same level of protection to presidential and vice presidential nominees as the sitting president and vice president. The bill had previously passed the House and now goes to President Joe Biden. In his social media post, Trump praised Congress for its recent bipartisan vote to approve extra funds for the Secret Service. “Nice to see Republicans and Democrats get together on something,” he wrote. “An attack on a former President is a Death Wish for the attacker!” There remains a persistent concern among Trump’s advisers about whether the two would-be assassins — Routh and Thomas Crooks, who was killed by law enforcement officials moments after firing at Trump in Butler — have ties to foreign governments. At his North Carolina event today, Trump suggested the two assassination attempts might be tied to Iran. So far, there is no evidence that either Routh or Crooks was working on behalf of a foreign nation. A third man, a Pakistani national, Asif Merchant, who has ties to Iran, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he was part of a murder-for-hire plot to assassinate Trump. Trump continues to want to hold large-scale, high-profile events, including a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York tentatively planned for late October. He also has announced a return Oct. 5 to Butler, where his ear was grazed by what the FBI later said was a bullet or bullet fragments. The University of Alabama has confirmed that Trump plans to attend a major football game in Tuscaloosa on Saturday against the University of Georgia. The stadium can hold a crowd of roughly 100,000. “The safety of our campus is and will remain our top priority,” the university said in a statement, adding that university police “will work closely with the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement partners to coordinate security.” The change in security protocols is a far cry from Trump’s earliest days as a third-time candidate, when access to his private club and residence, Mar-a-Lago, was freewheeling and people could sometimes walk in with virtually no screening. These days, the protocols are significantly more enhanced. At an event Tuesday in Savannah, Georgia, Trump recounted the recent assassination attempt, and then told the audience, “My profession is a very dangerous one.” As a point of comparison, he cited the death rates of race car drivers and bull riders as “one-tenth of 1%.” “Presidents?” he said. “I don’t want to tell you the percentage. But it happens to be a very dangerous profession.” ——— This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"Donald Trump&#8217;s advisers are considering whether to modify his travel after threats to his life from Iran and two assassination attempts, according to several people briefed on the matter, a shift that could affect the way the Republican nominee campaigns in the race&#8217;s final stretch.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/25/breaking-news/threats-to-trump-may-prompt-changes-in-travel-campaign-plans/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/themes/hsa-redesign/images/thumbnail-128x128.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:39:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":257434146,"title":"Arbitration board backs Japan company's buyout deal for U.S. Steel","text":"United States Steel Corp. said Wednesday that an arbitration board has ruled in favor of Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire the Pittsburgh company, a deal opposed by its union.

Nick Knowles future on Strictly Come Dancing is hanging in balance as he reportedly 'begs the show's producers to let him continue' despite his arm injury The DIY SOS presenter, 62, damaged his bicep on Sunday while changing a tyre after his car broke down on the way to his own birthday party and is 'desperate' to continue on the series They added: 'If Nick continues and does more damage to himself in the long run it puts them in a tricky position. His health comes first but Nick is pleading with them to continue. 'If he is cleared he will need to learn quickly. Luba is an amazing teacher and she is confident they can do it. But, ultimately, it might get to a point that the BBC just put their foot down.' MailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment. On Wednesday, Nick revealed he was on his way to the training studio to meet partner Luba Mushtuk to see what, if anything, he is able to do - and hopefully get the go ahead to dance. 'It's a big day for me really,' he told fans in a video. 'I'm really, really hoping that we find out that I can dance on Saturday.' Sharing the video of him walking to the dance studio, Nick said: 'Good morning everyone. Well it's been an interesting few days I can tell you that. A lot to think about, seen a lot of people. I've got loads of people trying to make everything work. 'I'm feeling good, arms in a sling still to make sure that it's rested when I'm not using it but today I'm going to try and dance to see what my capabilities are. 'Luba is trying to prepare a dance that will work for me. ' He added: I'd really like to stay part of the competition, so keep your fingers crossed for me.' On Wednesday, Nick revealed he was on his way to the training studio to meet partner Luba Mushtuk to see what, if anything, he is able to do - and hopefully get the go ahead to dance Nick's left arm was placed in a sling after the injury and he has been waiting to see if he is able to dance on Saturday He said: 'It's a big day for me really,' he told fans in a video. 'I'm really, really hoping that we find out that I can dance on Saturday' Strictly bosses have drawn up contingency plans if he is forced to withdraw from this weekend's show. Producers are desperate not to lose their most-profile star from the 20th anniversary series. They have made plans to give him a 'free pass' to week three while he recovers, instead of forcing him to withdraw from the competition completely. A source told MailOnline: 'They are all anxiously waiting to get the all clear from the medical team about Nick being able to compete this weekend, but are determined not to lose him from the show. 'He is such a popular figure with viewers, and if he needs time to recover he will get a free pass to return the following week, all being well.' 'If that bothers other contestants, then so be it. The bosses want him back.' Yesterday, Knowles was under the medical supervision of doctors and physiotherapists in a desperate bid to stay in the contest. He will return to Strictly rehearsals on Wednesday, where doctors will make a final decision on whether he is able to continue. This weekend, the first celebrity contestant will be voted off the dance show. After visiting Harley Street for an emergency MRI scan on Monday, Knowles told Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two that he remained 'really hopeful' he could continue on the show. But host Janette Manrara told viewers: 'At this stage, we don't know if you'll be able to dance on Saturday.' He is due to dance an American Smooth to Blur's Parklife with his professional partner Luba, providing he gets the all-clear from medics. After visiting Harley Street for an emergency MRI scan on Monday, Knowles told Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two that he remained 'really hopeful' he could continue on the show Mushtuk joked that they'll make Knowles's sling 'sparkly' and said that he 'still has perfect position on the right arm.' She said the pair can work on doing 'perfect footwork' for the foxtrot element of the dance and will still hopefully do a lift, noting that they could 'work around' the injury. Knowles added: 'Luckily I'm very big, and Luba is very light, so one-arm lifts.' A BBC insider said: 'No firm decision has been made. We are still very much hopeful that Nick will dance this weekend. 'Between everyone we are managing the injury. Nick very much wants to dance, his health comes first and we all have our fingers crossed.' Strictly Come Dancing returns to BBC One on Saturday at 6:15pm.

Kathy Hochul: new polls","text":"New Yorkers in critical battleground congressional districts don’t like Gov. Kathy Hochul — which could make her a political liability for Democrats in the upcoming races that could determine control of the House of Representatives, a set of revealing new polls have found. The surveys, conducted by McLaughlin & Associates for GOP candidates, found that more than half of potential voters in three key Empire State districts — covering the Long Island, Hudson Valley and Syracuse regions — have an unfavorable view of the governor. “Hochul is extremely unpopular with all voters in key battleground congressional districts — and she has exceptionally high negatives among the all-important Independent voters,” pollster Jim McLaughlin said in a campaign memo to Hudson Valley Republican Rep. Mike Lawler’s campaign. In the lower Hudson Valley’s District 17, where Lawler will face off against former Democrat Rep. Mondaire Jones, 56% of voters don’t hold Hochul in high regard. Meanwhile, less than two-thirds of voters in the district (35%) have a favorable view of the governor. Similarly, 57% of voters in Long Island’s District 4, which covers central and southern Nassau County, don’t have a favorable view of Hochul and the job she is doing running the Empire State — compared to 35% who said they approve of the governor. The race for New York’s second-wealthiest congressional district will pit first-term GOP incumbent Anthony D’Esposito against Democratic challenger Laura Gillen, the former Hempstead town supervisor. Finally, 56% of voters in the Syracuse region’s District 22 admitted to not liking the Democratic leader, while just 39% said they viewed Hochul positively. In that race, first-term GOP incumbent Brendan Williams will face off against Democrat John Mannion, a state senator. Unsettlingly, Hochul’s image was even worse with independent voters — or those not affiliated with a political party. About 70% of independent voters rated her unfavorably in Long Island’s District 4 and about 60% of independents viewed her negatively in the lower Hudson Valley and Syracuse region. The surveys were conducted on Aug. 5, 12 and 21 and queried 400 likely voters from each district. The polls have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The discouraging results have Dem strategists saying their party’s candidates would be foolish to invite her to stump with them during the final stretch before the Nov. 5 elections. “It’s not likely the Democrats will invite Hochul to the district but the Republicans might,” said Democratic political consultant Hank Sheinkopf, who has worked on campaigns for congressional candidates, as well as former President Bill Clinton. “If I were advising a Democratic candidate I’d say, ‘Don’t see us for a while. Come to the victory party,'” he quipped. Lawler and other Republicans also rubbed Hochul’s nose in it — especially after the governor boasted she and her team are overseeing the Democratic Party’s get-out-the-vote effort in House districts to defeat them. “It’s no surprise that Governor Hochul has one of the worst approval ratings in America, and it’s all thanks to her total inability to lead the state of New York,” Lawler said. “From a state budget that’s ballooning out of control to migrants and criminals roaming the streets of New York City, Kathy Hochul has completely and utterly failed the people of New York time and again — and in 2026, she’ll lose her job for it,” added Lawyer, who is considered a potential GOP gubernatorial challenger. The disclosure of the GOP polls in battleground House districts comes a week after a Siena College statewide poll found that Hochul was even more unpopular in blue-leaning New York than ex-President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the White House. Meanwhile, GOP polling also shows that a majority of voters in District 1 in Suffolk County/the East End and in District 3 in Nassau-Queens also don’t hold Hochul in high esteem. Notably, Hochul did not campaign with Rep. Tom Suozzi — a rival in the 2022 Democratic primary for governor — when he ran in the special election in February to succeed expelled ex-Republican Rep. George Santos in District 3. The veteran Democrat topped Republican rival Mazi Pilip in the closely watched race. Hochul’s campaign office declined to comment to The Post. The campaigns for Gillen, Jones and Mannion also declined to comment. However, State Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs, a Hochul ally, downplayed the GOP polls. He said Hochul is constantly under attack and she will be fine when she runs for re-election in 2026. “The candidates [for Congress] have to run their own campaigns,” he said.","summary":"Voters in New York House swing districts have soured on Gov.

Local TV news doesn’t really cover what the candidates say. Even if they did only local viewers or readers of local newspapers would know what is happening. National news and metropolitan newspapers seldom have journalists who live in central America they just interview a few “interesting” people when there is a disaster or a political rally (some of which also qualify.) They often repeat what VP Harris actually says, and even what VP candidate Vance says, but not so for her real opponent. Even CNN and MSNBC tend to “interpret” what Trump meant rather than just report what he said. I live in the quintessential small town America reintroduced to the world every February as the home of Groundhog Day. You probably haven’t been among the approximately 30,000 tourists who come here either on Groundhog Day or throughout the year. (I often go to Gobbler’s Knob where the daily events begin on cold Winter mornings) and there are usually tourists visiting in the warmer months, tourists, often from only a day’s drive, who are happy to talk with a local reporter. So I normally have a pretty good handle on what rural swing state voters are thinking but this year not so much. Trump vs Harris Yard Signs As I drive around I have seen only one house with Harris/Walz signs and only two with Trump signs. (Update, a week later TWO Harris and THREE Trump signs.) In 2020 I saw dozens of Trump signs and one or two Biden signs. I am referring to the purchased political party signs, there is also one small business with giant stacks of insulation with Trump written all over but that and a few similar handmade signs have been around off and on for a decade. It is difficult to say what people think since they tend to lie when they speak to reporters or pollsters, one reason both often make poor predictions on races, but going just on the signage I would say there is either very little interest in the race or a lot of fear over being identified by their neighbors as supporters of either side. An Ohio sheriff has asked neighbors to report Harris supporters to him. “Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski: when the Illegal human ‘Locust’ (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” Facebook posting apparently by the candidate for reelection Zuchowski. But almost no one had to wait to see that posting to suspect supporters are “Taking Names and Kicking A$$.” Therefore counting signs is only one indication. Many supporters on either side may simply be afraid to have their neighbors know their voting preference. Punxsutawney residents are not usually shy about sharing their most basic beliefs. Another strange indicator can be read in two different ways. Trump vs Harris and the Press In preparing to write about the campaign I have repeatedly contacted local and Commonwealth (State) Democratic party HQs and have been completely ignored. Harris has avoided one-on-one press interviews and I wasn’t requesting an interview except with some local supporters, rather I wrote as a journalist asking to be put on their mailing lists. (Although I have a small medical blog and a puppy blog, I’m not a “blogger.” I’m a credentialed foreign correspondent with many decades in press clubs and for 25 years I wrote a column for a major Washington D.C. newspaper). That total dismissal by Democratic campaign offices combined with the lack of campaign signs leads me to two possible conclusions and right now I have no idea which is true. First – Either the Democrats have completely given up on rural votes in this swing state because they feel they have no chance of winning outside Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. OR Second -The Democratic party has decided they have the state in the bag and don’t need any additional press coverage. Either way it doesn’t seem like a good “sign” to me. (apologies) Of course, the campaign may just be too busy to get back to me but several others have told me they have the same response, or rather, lack of it. Newsblaze gave the Democratic offices an opportunity to comment on this. They failed to reply. By comparison, getting mailings from the GOP or the Trump campaign is almost impossible to avoid! They want publicity. Local Trump vs. Harris News Watching American TV news you would think that practically everything is more newsworthy than Mr. Trump’s statements. Some journalists find that appalling. D. Earl Stephens, The retired Managing Editor of Stars and Stripes (the daily American military newspaper) recently gave U.S. journalists and their newsrooms a royal reaming accusing them of cowardice for failing to just honestly report what candidate Trump actually says instead of working hard to explain what they think he really meant. “Corporate media keeps hiding the the truth about madman Donald Trump | Opinion .” ..we have bitterly learned that we can no longer count on the fourth estate. It’s a terrible thing. They have catastrophically failed us like never before. We [presumably the editorial WE, meaning the author] have been forced to wait helplessly, and wonder if these incompetent, ponderous idiots [U.S, reporters and assignment editors] will ever stop ignoring what is so clearly right in front of our tired eyes: a dangerous maniac backed by a massive propaganda network that disgracefully fills his dark, billowing sails, allowing him to rumble unchecked and uncovered across the American countryside, taking a blowtorch to the truth, dead aim on our vote and our election workers, and repeating insane, dangerous and racist conspiracy theories that assault our senses, and could well result in the death of our democracy and many of our citizens.” Trump vs. Harris Latest If you missed it, the latest big conspiracy theory (vehemently denied by Springfield Ohio officials, police, and citizens) is that immigrants are stealing and eating household pets. Threats against Ohio government agencies and buildings as well as against schools quickly followed Trump repeating this nonsense. J D Vance, Trump’s Vice Presidential running mate, admitted on CNN that he (Vance) made up the story but he isn’t ashamed of doing so. Mr. Vance also told reporters he would continue to make up fake stories to boost the Trump campaign. “The major news outlets regularly describe Trump supporters as “left behind,” “stigmatized” or even “marginalized.” That is patently false since many of his supporters seen on TV and at rallies are one, White, two Men, and three evangelical Christians, none of which are oppressed minorities in the U.S..” Opinion: What the media still get wrong about Trump voters – Los Angeles Times. https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-09-15/white-men-christians-trump-supporters-psychology Considering that Candidate Trump designated journalists “enemies of the people” During the 2016 election and presidency and that journalists do get murdered even in the U.S. simply for reporting the truth, I can see why big media is running scared of their major advertisers as well as Trump followers. If they report honestly on what is said at Trump rallies and Trump wins they will be in danger for apparently opposing him by reporting the truth (brave sample below but from a European). If they don’t emphasize his gaffs and Harris wins she won’t come after them just for not helping her campaign. Luca Versteegen, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Vienna in Austria wrote in an opinion piece, that Trump had the following to say about affordable child care: “Well, I would do that, and we’re sitting down – you know, I was, somebody, we had Senator Marco Rubio, and my daughter Ivanka was so impactful on that issue. It’s a very important issue. But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I’m talking about, that – because, look, child care is child care. It’s, couldn’t, you know, there’s something, you have to have it – in this country, you have to have it.” (More of the same is left out but the quoted parts are unedited and the redacted paragraphs do not make any more sense.) … .”We’re gonna have – I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country, because I have to stay with child care … . I want to stay with child care, but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I’m talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just, that I just told you about.” I have seen that quoted elsewhere and still have no idea what Trump thinks about childcare or how he plans to eliminate the deficit by cutting taxes further on the rich and very rich. Trump vs Harris Election Consequences Trump vs Harris is probably the most important election in our lifetimes (Hitler’s election was before my time) not just for or perhaps not mostly for the U.S. but for every ally. I am not comparing anyone to Hitler but that election had an enormous implication for the world. (NOTE: Most people don’t know the Nazi party had growing electoral support and in 1933 President of Germany von Hindenburg appointed him Chancellor of Germany quite legally. Hindenburg was a field marshal during World War I and the second president of the Weimar Republic. Of course, once in, Hitler never gave up control. People kept saying that he really wasn’t that bad despite his laying out his entire plan in his only book. Even that renowned paranoid Stalin refused to believe Hitler would attack right up to the day AFTER Germany invaded the U.S.S.R.) This single U.S. presidential election in 2024 could mean the end of the U.S. as a world leader. I’m not Trump bashing, he keeps saying that he only cares about America, not the rest of the world. The U.S. would still be the most powerful country but how can we be leaders if we are strictly for America and America only? Remember that Trump told Putin to do whatever he wants to NATO members who fail to pay as much as Trump requires. At the first and likely only Trump-Harris debate and later, Ex-President Trump refused to say if he would support Ukraine in its battle against invading Russia. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-ukraine-war So, just how should Australians, Indians, Japanese, and even Filipinos in democratic or fairly democratic countries feel about U.S. support for them vs China if Trump/Vance win? Since the former President has had a long love fest with North Korea’s dear leader, praised Putin, and even Chinese dictators (If you’re elected but there is no opposition, that doesn’t make a democracy – Putin was elected too) just how much support do you think he would provide any country being pushed around by China? How quickly would the U.S. Navy (Seventh Fleet) be pulled out of the Western Pacific if China increased its belligerent stance? Arguably democracies around the world have more to lose in America’s election outcome than they do in their own domestic elections. How happy Phil will be next year is yet to be seen.","summary":"North Americans and especially those in allied countries including Australia see virtually no news from the real middle America.

While speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the Democratic presidential nominee said she would invest in critical sectors, offer tax credits for manufacturers, and double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of her first term. “We will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns,” Harris said. “I’m a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,” she said, adding that she strongly supports workers and labor unions. Harris said her “opportunity economy” approach will enable the United States to lead in future industries and ensure that America, not China, “wins the competition for the twenty-first century.” “We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace, remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies, expand our lead in clean energy, innovation, and manufacturing,” she said. The economy continues to be a top issue on the campaign trail and a thorn in the Harris campaign’s side. A national NBC News survey handed former President Donald Trump a nine-point advantage of who voters trust more to improve the economy. As part of his plan to restore manufacturing, Trump also wants to use various tools to convince companies to shift jobs to the United States. In a Savannah, Georgia, speech on Sept. 24, the Republican nominee suggested offering tax breaks and federal land to entice foreign manufacturers while slapping tariffs on businesses that do not relocate to the United States. “Foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,” Trump said. “It won’t even be difficult. Your only worry will be deciding which job to take.” Trump said the United States would become the new hub for auto manufacturing, robotics, and shipbuilding. Throughout the 2024 election cycle, polls have consistently highlighted that the economy and immigration rank among the top issues for voters. The latest KFF survey showed that the economy and immigration topped abortion as the most important issues in the election race. The vice president is trimming the Republican challenger’s lead on who is better equipped to manage the economy. The AP-NORC poll revealed that about four in 10 respondents say Trump would better handle the economy. A similar figure was applied to Harris. Harris has pledged to lower costs for low- and middle-income families. Her plan includes imposing a federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries, restoring and increasing the pandemic-era Child Tax Credit, exempting tipped wages from the income tax, and raising the minimum wage. She also vowed not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000, repeating President Joe Biden’s policy promise. The vice president said she would address housing affordability by employing tools to spur new construction and support homebuyers. In order to build three million units over the next four years, the Harris campaign proposed a $40 billion fund to incentivize local governments to construct more affordable homes and proposed tax credits for home builders. Harris has also proposed offering $25,000 downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers. To help cover the cost of her spending plans, Harris has proposed tax hikes of between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next 10 years. The former president has pledged to combat inflation by expanding domestic energy production, stopping illegal immigration, slashing wasteful government spending, and lowering commodity prices by ending military conflicts. On the tax policy front, he also wants to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. Further, Trump has vowed to eliminate taxes on tips, remove taxes on Social Security benefits, and exempt overtime pay from the income tax. To offset any revenue reduction, Trump has outlined broad tariffs: at least 60 percent on Chinese imports and a 10 percent universal levy on all imported goods. The Republican nominee has long advocated for bringing crucial supply chains back to the United States and signing fair and reciprocal trade deals. During his first term, the former president renegotiated and signed new trade deals, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in July 2020.","summary":"While speaking in Steel City, Harris said she considers herself capitalist and believes in free and fair markets.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-proposes-new-incentive-for-manufacturing-during-pittsburgh-speech-5729992","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/25/id5730170-Kamala-Harris_Pittsburgh-speech-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:20:05","author":"Andrew Moran,Emel Akan","authors":["Andrew Moran","Emel Akan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":257434040,"title":"Nick Knowles still doesn't know if he has a future on Strictly Come Dancing as he 'begs producers to let him continue' after suffering an arm injury while changing a tyre","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Thursday, Sep 26th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 11°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Gaunt Justin Bieber sparks concern for his health as he breaks cover amid Diddy scandal in first sighting since shock indictment Heartbroken partner of mother-of-five who became the first person to die from Brazilian Bum Lift procedure in the UK praises people for 'beautiful' support during family's 'time of need' Putin's chilling new nuke threat: Russia lowers threshold of when it can launch a nuclear strike in fresh warning to the West - just days after pro-Kremlin TV channel's simulated attack of London Elon Musk denies affair with 'beautiful' Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni after pictures of them sent social media into meltdown DAN HODGES: Sleaze.

The DIY SOS presenter, 62, damaged his bicep on Sunday while changing a tyre after his car broke down on the way to his own birthday party. Nick's left arm was placed in a sling after the injury and he has been waiting to see if he is able to dance on Saturday. He is said to be 'desperate to continue' but if he is cleared by medical professionals, he will need to learn the routine 'very quickly. A source told The Sun: 'Nick is desperate to carry on and is insisting he is fine to perform but the BBC are naturally wary.' Nick Knowles future on Strictly Come Dancing is hanging in balance as he reportedly 'begs the show's producers to let him continue' despite his arm injury The DIY SOS presenter, 62, damaged his bicep on Sunday while changing a tyre after his car broke down on the way to his own birthday party and is 'desperate' to continue on the series They added: 'If Nick continues and does more damage to himself in the long run it puts them in a tricky position. His health comes first but Nick is pleading with them to continue. 'If he is cleared he will need to learn quickly. Luba is an amazing teacher and she is confident they can do it. But, ultimately, it might get to a point that the BBC just put their foot down.' MailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment. On Wednesday, Nick revealed he was on his way to the training studio to meet partner Luba Mushtuk to see what, if anything, he is able to do - and hopefully get the go ahead to dance. 'It's a big day for me really,' he told fans in a video. 'I'm really, really hoping that we find out that I can dance on Saturday.' Sharing the video of him walking to the dance studio, Nick said: 'Good morning everyone. Well it's been an interesting few days I can tell you that. A lot to think about, seen a lot of people. I've got loads of people trying to make everything work. 'I'm feeling good, arms in a sling still to make sure that it's rested when I'm not using it but today I'm going to try and dance to see what my capabilities are. 'Luba is trying to prepare a dance that will work for me. ' He added: I'd really like to stay part of the competition, so keep your fingers crossed for me.'

'I'm really, really hoping that we find out that I can dance on Saturday' Strictly bosses have drawn up contingency plans if he is forced to withdraw from this weekend's show. Producers are desperate not to lose their most-profile star from the 20th anniversary series. They have made plans to give him a 'free pass' to week three while he recovers, instead of forcing him to withdraw from the competition completely. A source told MailOnline: 'They are all anxiously waiting to get the all clear from the medical team about Nick being able to compete this weekend, but are determined not to lose him from the show. 'He is such a popular figure with viewers, and if he needs time to recover he will get a free pass to return the following week, all being well.' 'If that bothers other contestants, then so be it. The bosses want him back.' Yesterday, Knowles was under the medical supervision of doctors and physiotherapists in a desperate bid to stay in the contest. He will return to Strictly rehearsals on Wednesday, where doctors will make a final decision on whether he is able to continue. This weekend, the first celebrity contestant will be voted off the dance show. After visiting Harley Street for an emergency MRI scan on Monday, Knowles told Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two that he remained 'really hopeful' he could continue on the show. But host Janette Manrara told viewers: 'At this stage, we don't know if you'll be able to dance on Saturday.' He is due to dance an American Smooth to Blur's Parklife with his professional partner Luba, providing he gets the all-clear from medics. After visiting Harley Street for an emergency MRI scan on Monday, Knowles told Strictly spin-off show It Takes Two that he remained 'really hopeful' he could continue on the show Mushtuk joked that they'll make Knowles's sling 'sparkly' and said that he 'still has perfect position on the right arm.' She said the pair can work on doing 'perfect footwork' for the foxtrot element of the dance and will still hopefully do a lift, noting that they could 'work around' the injury. Knowles added: 'Luckily I'm very big, and Luba is very light, so one-arm lifts.' A BBC insider said: 'No firm decision has been made. We are still very much hopeful that Nick will dance this weekend. 'Between everyone we are managing the injury. Nick very much wants to dance, his health comes first and we all have our fingers crossed.' Strictly Come Dancing returns to BBC One on Saturday at 6:15pm.

In an interview with Harris, MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle said, “I just want to ask you, yes or no: At any point in your life have you served two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions — “ “On a sesame seed bun?” Harris said in unison with Ruhle. She then added that “I have” worked at a McDonald’s. “Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s in our country who are trying to raise a family,” she said. “I worked there as a student.” “I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility, then, is to meet those needs,” she added. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Harris’ remarks. Trump has said he would end all taxes on overtime pay, though his campaign has not shared details about the plan. He has also touted a proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, a policy Harris later said she supported. Trump has also insisted that Harris’ anecdote about having worked at the fast-food chain is a “fake story.” In stump speeches, Harris often describes coming from the middle class and how that shaped her worldview. During Wednesday’s interview, Harris said: “My mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard; she saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy her first home. And, you know, homeownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. “Gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream. So part of my vision for the economy is let’s deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with commonsense solutions, such as affordable housing,” she added. An NBC News poll conducted this month found that 50% of registered voters believed Trump would be better at dealing with the economy, while 41% selected Harris. The results were outside the 3.1-percentage-point margin of error.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday again confirmed that she&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris praises working at McDonald&#8217;s while criticizing Trump&#8217;s economic policies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-praises-working-at-mcdonalds-while-criticizing-trumps-economic-policies/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240919-kamala-harris-debate-cs-1468a2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:13:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":257434038,"title":"Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas 'receives shock offer from musical legend as she gets set to head to Hollywood'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Thursday, Sep 26th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 11°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Gaunt Justin Bieber sparks concern for his health as he breaks cover amid Diddy scandal in first sighting since shock indictment Heartbroken partner of mother-of-five who became the first person to die from Brazilian Bum Lift procedure in the UK praises people for 'beautiful' support during family's 'time of need' Putin's chilling new nuke threat: Russia lowers threshold of when it can launch a nuclear strike in fresh warning to the West - just days after pro-Kremlin TV channel's simulated attack of London Elon Musk denies affair with 'beautiful' Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni after pictures of them sent social media into meltdown DAN HODGES: Sleaze.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:01:01 BST, 26 September 2024 |Updated:01:09 BST, 26 September 2024 e-mail View comments Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas has reportedly received a shock offer from a musical legend. The singer, 29, from Gravesend, has been asked by Canadian record producer, film composer, and music executive David Foster to perform at his 75th birthday concert. The Sun reports that the huge bash and concert will be held at The Hollywood Bowl in November. They claim that she will perform her single My Way as part of a line-up which also features Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bublé and Jennifer Hudson. A source told the publication: 'It's a huge deal for Sydnie. She naturally can't wait but is also nervous at the thought of performing alongside some of her icons. Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas has reportedly received a shock offer from a musical legend The singer, 29, from Gravesend, has been asked by Canadian record producer, film composer, and music executive David Foster to perform at his 75th birthday concert 'David was sent her performance on BGT and fell in love with her and immediately wanted to get her on the bill. 'Plans are being ironed out now.' A representative for Sydnie has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. It comes after last month it was reported that ITV's big Christmas bash is reportedly set to star Sydnie too. Show bosses are keeping in theme for the 2024 festive season as they have lined up BGT's 2024 winner to be at the forefront of their December, 25 schedule, according to the Sun. The competition winner is believed to have landed her own dedicated show which will see the singing sensation perform an array of festive favourites and her very own Christmas track. A TV insider said: 'Sydnie could become ITV's very own Mariah Carey. 'Her team have been in talks with top execs about making a show for Christmas Day, like an old school variety special. 'Her name obviously lends itself to Christmas so it would be a blockbuster festive spectacular.' Last year, ITV aired festive specials of The Masked Singer on Christmas Day, as well as soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale. The Sun reports that the huge bash and concert will be held at The Hollywood Bowl in November (David seen in April 2024) A source told the publication: 'It's a huge deal for Sydnie. She naturally can't wait but is also nervous at the thought of performing alongside some of her icons' But ITV lost out to the BBC in the annual ratings battle, as the beep featured Strictly and Doctor Who specials. Christmas came early for Sydnie in June when she was awarded £250,000 after winning BGT with her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Read More EXCLUSIVE Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas hits back at 'hateful' trolls The former PT became the show's favourite after judge Amanda Holden pressed her Golden Buzzer to guarantee the singer a place in the live shows. ITV will be staging her talents once again on the Royal Variety Performance, which will air later this year - part of her prize for being crowned champion. Earlier this month, Sydnie released her first single Starlight Express ahead of her upcoming album, My Way, which will be available in late September. The body of work will feature tracks Over The Rainbow, My Way, and Tomorrow, paying homage to Sydnie's spellbinding auditions. She is preparing to embark on her very first tour, where she will perform 15 dates across the country in October, kicking off in Gateshead and concluding in Liverpool. Speaking about her apprehensions ahead of the live shows, Sydnie said: 'I have never done anything like this before so this will be a first. I'm hoping it goes very well, I'm praying it goes well. It comes after last month it was reported that ITV's big Christmas bash is reportedly set to star Sydnie too Christmas came early for Sydnie in June when she was awarded £250,000 after winning BGT with her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow 'I'll try and show everybody to the best of my ability who I am and that's really my only story with this tour so I'm hoping it goes really well... I am terrified and excited. 'I feel under massive pressure as the Britain's Got Talent winner. It's hard to believe that people are going to buy tickets. 'That's my insecure side, I'm worrying about it. 'I still can't believe people liked what I did and voted and it's the same thing, I can't believe people would spend their hard-earned money on tickets. I hope they do and come and see the show and continue this journey.'

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:01:01 BST, 26 September 2024 |Updated:01:09 BST, 26 September 2024 e-mail View comments Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas has reportedly received a shock offer from a musical legend. The singer, 29, from Gravesend, has been asked by Canadian record producer, film composer, and music executive David Foster to perform at his 75th birthday concert. The Sun reports that the huge bash and concert will be held at The Hollywood Bowl in November. They claim that she will perform her single My Way as part of a line-up which also features Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bublé and Jennifer Hudson. A source told the publication: 'It's a huge deal for Sydnie. She naturally can't wait but is also nervous at the thought of performing alongside some of her icons. Britain's Got Talent winner Sydnie Christmas has reportedly received a shock offer from a musical legend The singer, 29, from Gravesend, has been asked by Canadian record producer, film composer, and music executive David Foster to perform at his 75th birthday concert 'David was sent her performance on BGT and fell in love with her and immediately wanted to get her on the bill. 'Plans are being ironed out now.' A representative for Sydnie has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. It comes after last month it was reported that ITV's big Christmas bash is reportedly set to star Sydnie too. Show bosses are keeping in theme for the 2024 festive season as they have lined up BGT's 2024 winner to be at the forefront of their December, 25 schedule, according to the Sun. The competition winner is believed to have landed her own dedicated show which will see the singing sensation perform an array of festive favourites and her very own Christmas track. A TV insider said: 'Sydnie could become ITV's very own Mariah Carey. 'Her team have been in talks with top execs about making a show for Christmas Day, like an old school variety special. 'Her name obviously lends itself to Christmas so it would be a blockbuster festive spectacular.' Last year, ITV aired festive specials of The Masked Singer on Christmas Day, as well as soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale. The Sun reports that the huge bash and concert will be held at The Hollywood Bowl in November (David seen in April 2024) A source told the publication: 'It's a huge deal for Sydnie. She naturally can't wait but is also nervous at the thought of performing alongside some of her icons' But ITV lost out to the BBC in the annual ratings battle, as the beep featured Strictly and Doctor Who specials. Christmas came early for Sydnie in June when she was awarded £250,000 after winning BGT with her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.

ITV will be staging her talents once again on the Royal Variety Performance, which will air later this year - part of her prize for being crowned champion. Earlier this month, Sydnie released her first single Starlight Express ahead of her upcoming album, My Way, which will be available in late September. The body of work will feature tracks Over The Rainbow, My Way, and Tomorrow, paying homage to Sydnie's spellbinding auditions. She is preparing to embark on her very first tour, where she will perform 15 dates across the country in October, kicking off in Gateshead and concluding in Liverpool. Speaking about her apprehensions ahead of the live shows, Sydnie said: 'I have never done anything like this before so this will be a first. I'm hoping it goes very well, I'm praying it goes well. It comes after last month it was reported that ITV's big Christmas bash is reportedly set to star Sydnie too Christmas came early for Sydnie in June when she was awarded £250,000 after winning BGT with her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow 'I'll try and show everybody to the best of my ability who I am and that's really my only story with this tour so I'm hoping it goes really well... I am terrified and excited. 'I feel under massive pressure as the Britain's Got Talent winner. It's hard to believe that people are going to buy tickets. 'That's my insecure side, I'm worrying about it. 'I still can't believe people liked what I did and voted and it's the same thing, I can't believe people would spend their hard-earned money on tickets. I hope they do and come and see the show and continue this journey.'

Ever since CNN reported that North Carolina’s lieutenant governor Mark Robinson posted on a pornography website that he’s a “black NAZI” who supported re-legalizing slavery and dubbed civil rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr. “Martin Lucifer Koon,” Trump and his campaign have tried to gently distance the ex-president from his staunchly MAGAfied ally, fearing Robinson’s extreme excesses could damage Trump himself. In recent days, as the former president has discussed with aides and confidants what to do amid the Robinson fallout, Trump also had a blunt query for those in his political and social orbit, according to a source close to Trump and another person familiar with the matter. He wanted to know if Robinson was mentally ill. Trump had previously heartily embraced the Tar Heel State’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, describing Robinson — in a statement that looks especially peculiar in retrospect — as “Martin Luther King on steroids.” But Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in the final-weeks sprint of this year’s extraordinarly high-stakes presidential contest, and various battleground and national polls point to a tight race that will likely come down to the margins in a tiny number of states. For both camps, nothing is to be taken for granted, and every inch of improvement or scandal seems to matter a great deal. Recent polling data has given the Harris campaign reason for cautious optimism in their uphill fight to best Trump for North Carolina’s electoral college votes. For Trump, the state is a must-win: Top advisers to Trump have repeatedly told Rolling Stone that they see virtually no plausible scenario in which he wins the election without keeping North Carolina in his corner. Earlier this month, Trump’s vice presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), told reporters that “it’s very hard for us to win unless we’re able to get North Carolina.” It is unusual that a gubernatorial candidate would have a dramatic effect on the electoral prospects of a party’s presidential nominee, particularly one who is as popular among the party’s base as Trump. Still, Robinson — who has attempted to dismiss CNN’s article as “tabloid trash” — is a uniquely shambolic case. Influential allies to the former president and his campaign’s senior staff certainly aren’t shrugging off his potential impact on the election in November. As the CNN story was breaking last week, multiple Trump lieutenants began messaging or calling well-placed political contacts in North Carolina to ask if there were any other embarrassing rumors or whispers of additional explosive information regarding Robinson that Team Trump may not know about yet and that may come out during this election cycle, two sources with knowledge of the matter say. As of early this week, according to a different person with knowledge of the matter, at least one major conservative organization was working to run a new private poll in North Carolina — largely to find if Robinson is dragging down Trump’s numbers. “This dumbass could… wreck this whole thing for us,” one Republican close to Trump, who is actively working to put him back in the White House, lamented to Rolling Stone. This person added though they believe the ex-president will win North Carolina, “Black Hitler doesn’t make it fucking easier!” In a presidential race that remains stubbornly close, the former president is not just running to revitalize his career and political legacy, or to enact an increasingly authoritarian, vengeance–obsessed policy vision. Trump is, in many ways, running to stay out of prison. And for the Republican lawmakers and other Trump associates who want to return Trump to power next year, a key task has been to figure out how, exactly, to claim that Trump has nothing to do with this man with whom Trump had, emphatically and publicly, a lot to do. “That’s literally [Democrats’] campaign in North Carolina, is trying to make people believe that Donald Trump somehow is involved with the Robinson guy,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a prominent Trump ally, said on Fox News on Monday. “Donald Trump knew nothing about this. I knew nothing about it. [Democrats are] trying to guilt by association.” At a recent North Carolina rally, Trump conspicuously did not even mention the lieutenant governor’s name. According to Trump advisers, there has been some internal conversation within the campaign about whether the former president should make a forceful statement about Robinson — but so far, there is no confirmed plan to do so or to revoke his endorsement. Others close to Trump have urged him to dump Robinson altogether, but the ex-president is not taking the advice and instead settling on a strategy of ignoring him, at least for the moment. Vance, for his part, refused to commit one way or another when he was asked if he trusts Robinson’s claims that he did not post the comments reported by CNN. “I don’t not believe him, I don’t believe him,” Vance said over the weekend. Speaking at a North Carolina rally on Monday, Vance said: “A sex scandal in North Carolina is between the lieutenant governor and the people of North Carolina. They’re going to make their decision, and we support them.” Still, before the CNN story, Robinson was already an ostentatiously far-right figure who much of the Republican elite was fine with not just tolerating, but championing. “I think you’re better than Martin Luther King,” Trump said of Robinson at a campaign event in March. “I think you are Martin Luther King times two.” Not quite.","summary":"Team Trump sees virtually no path to victory without North Carolina — and its ‘Black Nazi’ gubernatorial nominee is causing big problems","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-mark-robinson-north-carolina-hurt-campaign-2024-1235112644/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/trump-mark-robinson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:04:35","author":"Andrew Perez,Asawin Suebsaeng","authors":["Andrew Perez","Asawin Suebsaeng"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":257434506,"title":"Five policies Harris has yet to take her presidential stance on","text":"The Democratic presidential nominee has refused to specify her stance on the death penalty, tightening crime laws in her home state, restricting late-term abortion, supporting Israel’s war in Gaza, and decriminalizing sex work. At least three out of five of the policies hold popular public support. Harris’s silence comes as she has limited her interviews on the campaign trail and failed to expound on policy positions. Shifting on the death penalty Harris opposed the death penalty for decades. But now her campaign won’t answer questions regarding her position on the policy, according to an Axios report. After she was elected San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003, Harris stated vehement opposition to the death penalty during her inaugural address. Harris wavered on the policy in 2014, when she led the California Attorney General’s Office in defending the constitutionality of the state’s death penalty before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, less than five years later, she was back to a full-throttled defense of the policy as she praised Newsom for halting the death penalty in California. During her short-lived presidential campaign in 2020, Harris’s website stated that “Kamala believes the death penalty is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.” Roughly 62% of the country believes the death penalty should be legal, according to a 2023 poll from YouGov. Breaking with Newsom on California crime measure? Back in Harris’s home state, California residents are considering a ballot proposal that would toughen crime measures and reform treatment incentives for drug offenders. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has expressed harsh criticism for Proposition 36, although he recently conceded he didn’t have the “bandwidth” to use campaign resources to fight the measure. Newsom and Harris worked together as Democratic California colleagues for years in the Golden State. However, the vice president recently declined to say whether she echoed Newsom’s opposition to the ballot measure. The Harris campaign refused to give comment to the Los Angeles Times request for her position on Proposition 36, according to a report published Wednesday. Voters in Harris’s home state heavily support the measure 71%-26%, according to a poll released earlier this month. Proposition 36 rolls back several of the relaxed crime policies ushered in by Proposition 47, which Californians approved in 2014. Harris was the state’s Democratic attorney general at the time and didn’t weigh in on the measure due to apparent concerns there could be a conflict of interest. As attorney general, she was in charge of writing the ballot summary and title for Proposition 47. However, several close allies, including Newsom and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon, who signed the ballot argument favoring Proposition 47, firmly backed the proposal. Sidestepping late-term abortion discussion A firm proponent of abortion, it remains unclear as to whether Harris supports a federal law permitting abortion later than 24 weeks. Abortion is legal at 24 weeks or later in 18 states, according to a recent Axios report, though polls indicate late-term abortions are unpopular with the public. When asked if she would support any restrictions on abortions during her first debate with former President Donald Trump earlier this month, Harris deflected. “I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,” she told the debate moderators. The 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizes abortion up to the point of viability of a baby. The 24-week mark is generally considered the marker when the baby is able to survive outside the womb.” “Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion,” Harris continued. “That is not happening.” There are currently no legal limits to abortion in Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey, Alaska, and the District of Columbia. The majority of the country opposes abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, according to a Gallup poll conducted last year. Changes in Middle Eastern policy During her recent appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists and throughout her time on the campaign trail, Harris has refused to say whether she will make any specific policy changes to President Joe Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza. The issue has ignited tension within the Democratic Party ahead of the November elections. The “Uncommitted” movement, a group of pro-Palestinian activists, withheld a vital endorsement to Harris over her refusal to clarify if she’ll break with Biden’s Middle Eastern policy. The group wields significant political power in Michigan, which is a crucial battleground state Harris will likely need to win in order to secure a victory this November. The Uncommitted movement and other far-Left factions of her party demand that Harris institute an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as well as an instant arms embargo on Israel if she wins the election. During her most recent media appearance, and one of only two sitdowns she’s done with members of the press, she once again dodged questions from a NABJ panel on whether she would continue the Biden administration’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. “I absolutely believe that this war has to end, and it has to end as soon as possible, and the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and the ceasefire deal done, and we are working around the clock to achieve that end,” Harris said. The majority of the country wants a ceasefire and return of the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. Decriminalize prostitution? Harris has also refused to clarify her 2024 position on decriminalizing sex work, per an Axios report. Her campaign’s refusal to clarify her stance comes after she said in 2019 that she supported decriminalizing prostitution. “When you’re talking about consenting adults, I think that, yes, we should really consider that we can’t criminalize consensual behavior as long as no one is being harmed,” she told the Root. She defended her record of supporting the legalization of sex work during her tenure as San Francisco district attorney. “I was advocating then that we need to stop arresting these prostitutes and instead go after the Johns and the pimps because we were criminalizing the women,” she touted. Harris’s stance in 2019 marked a reversal from her position in 2008. At the time, she opposed a California ballot measure to decriminalize prostitution. “I think it’s completely ridiculous, just in case there’s any ambiguity about my position,” she told the New York Times. “It would put a welcome mat out for pimps and prostitutes to come on into San Francisco.” These days, Harris’s campaign appears to be perfectly happy to be ambiguous about her position.

His stage was the US-Mexico border in Arizona and the set piece of his performance was the border wall. The message was simple: with their border policy, Democrats have “unleashed a deadly plague of migrant crime”. Trump has ratcheted up the tensions on immigration further since then, repeating wild conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants eating pets and, more recently, claiming migrants are “attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest”. What the US needs, Trump has repeatedly stressed, is a closed border, a walled border. A long history of wall-building advocacy The US-Mexico border wall, which is currently around 700 miles in length in various stretches, has loomed large in American politics in recent decades, especially since the 2016 US presidential campaign. Yet, current stories about the wall mostly overlook its history. Most importantly, the media ignore the long-standing appeal of the wall as a tool of spatial and cultural division in the making of the US-Mexico border. In my forthcoming book, I trace the origin of the border wall to the early 1900s, when the US Immigration Service and other federal agencies called for the construction of barriers at the border. Congress answered their appeal by adopting an act in 1935 that authorised the secretary of state to construct and maintain fences between the US and Mexico. For decades following its adoption, US officials stood before Congress almost yearly, asking for funding for the construction of border fences. This trend culminated in the 1940s with two parallel projects: the Western Land Boundary Fence Project (576 miles or 926 kilometres of fencing from El Paso, Texas, to the west) and the Rio Grande Border Fence Project (415 miles or 668 kilometres of fencing along the Mexico-Texas border). Neither one of these projects was ever fully realised. But if they had been built, they would have surpassed the length of the current border wall. Immigration, disease and crime What is telling when looking at the history is how similar the arguments supporting such fences in the early 1900s were to those deployed today. Immigration, disease and crime have been recurring justifications for the wall, both then and now. Indeed, there is an uncanny likeness to Trump’s rhetoric surrounding the US-Mexico border — including during his August speech in Arizona — and the narratives justifying a border wall in the mid-20th century. High on the list of justifications was the need to deter “juvenile delinquents”, “thieves”, “beggars”, undocumented workers, narcotic smugglers, “wetbacks” (a derogatory term for Mexicans), and Mexican nationals seeking medical care in the US at public expense. These arguments appeared regularly in government reports and during congressional hearings from the 1930s to the late 1950s. A 1934 report by the Immigration Services on the feasibility of a short border fence between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, for example, said it would stifle illegal immigration that took employment opportunities from American workers, while lowering wages in the borderland area. Reminiscent of recent analogies between the borderland and a “war zone”, the report noted that sending agents to patrol the border without proper equipment was pointless. It was akin to: put[ting] a body of troops in the field in an enemy’s theatre of operation without artillery, observation planes, trucks, ammunition and other weapons. The fence was “the correct solution to the problem.” At times, the fear of the undocumented merged with the fear of contagion. A foot and mouth disease outbreak in Mexico in 1946, for example, provided additional rhetorical support for the wall. As Texas Senator Tom Connally said when the Committee on Foreign Relations considered the issue: It has been a dream of the Department of State for many years to have this fence, not because of the hoof and mouth disease, but for immigration and customs and smuggling and all of that sort of thing. Senator Tom Connally in 1938. Harris & Ewing photographs, via Wikimedia Commons Persistent racial faultlines The 1935 act has long been forgotten. In fact, by the end of the 1950s, only a few hundred miles of fencing had actually been built. These earlier walling plans failed for a range of reasons, including opposition by Texan landowners and industries relying on illegal Mexican labour. Perhaps most importantly, there were serious reservations back then about the efficiency of fences in curbing immigration. Yet, these doubts have not weighed in to the same extent in contemporary debates about the border wall. This underscores the performative role of the wall in today’s politics. In fact, close to 700 hundred miles (1,126 kilometres) of fencing has been built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006. This includes large portions of the wall built under the presidency of Barack Obama and, to a lesser extent, Trump’s. What has filtered through, however, is the racialised narrative that paints Mexicans nationals in a disparaging way. This rhetoric relied on generalisations and stereotypes on themes such as criminality, licentiousness and disease. It transformed Mexico into a threat to be curtailed and became a frame of reference that has permeated politics for decades – and is now a defining issue in the upcoming presidential election.

It is, of course, true that the filibuster isn’t in the Constitution. In many ways, however, it is one of the last remaining tools upholding a semblance of constitutional order. Yet, to most contemporary Democrats, the 60-vote threshold to cut off debate is an antiquated tool that facilitates “minority rule” — by which they mean “federalism.” Which makes sense. Democrats are keen on empowering narrow, fleeting left-wing majorities cramming through wide-ranging generational “reform” bills without any consensus, as they did with Obamacare and the Inflation Reduction Act. They know well that once a massive entitlement or regulatory program is passed, it will be virtually impossible to roll back. You don’t need to be a constitutional scholar to understand there’s no version of the founding that envisioned this kind of governance. Then again, the modern Democrat is a consequentialist who doesn’t concern himself with neutral principles. Imagine, if you can, what the world would look like if former President Donald Trump announced he was going to blow up the filibuster using a one-vote Senate majority and then cram through a national limit on abortion. Republicans would be accused of acting like fascistic ghouls, and the media would have a thermonuclear meltdown. It would be 1939 Germany all over again. Democrats play Calvinball on an All-Star level. Worse, Democrats have targeted virtually every institution that makes “democracy” tenable in a truly diverse and sprawling nation that is home to hundreds of millions of people. Because if forcing red states to adopt maximalist abortion laws is important enough to sink long-standing checks on federal power, you better believe it won’t be the last exception to the rule. For one thing, Republicans can’t be expected to play by a different set of governing guidelines. For another, the Left seems to believe every policy position it takes is fundamental to preserving “democracy.” The exemptions would be endless. Former President Barack Obama, you’ll remember, offered nearly identical justifications for suspending the filibuster when pushing an unconstitutional “voting rights bill.” At the funeral of John Lewis, Obama said the filibuster, first used in 1837 to oppose a national bank charter, was a “Jim Crow relic.” Which is weird because, in 2005, Obama warned that eliminating the filibuster would be an unpatriotic attack on foundational American ideals. They do this all the time, of course, without a hint of self-reflection, much less an explanation. Indeed, 30 Democrats, including Kamala Harris, signed a letter praising the filibuster as an imperative tool in maintaining the agency of the “world’s greatest deliberative body.” In 2018, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) argued that abolishing the filibuster “would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers.” When Joe Biden became president in 2020, Durbin became one of the leading advocates of overturning the filibuster. Why? Because democracy was on the line. Some of you may be too young to recall that even judicial votes are dictated by a simple Senate majority because Harry Reid blew up the 60-vote threshold in 2013. Reid, perhaps under the impression that Washington would be run by Democrats forever, failed to heed his own warning that weakening the filibuster would “destroy the very checks and balances our Founding Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government.” Let’s face it: That’s the point these days. It’s not just about the naked hypocrisy. It’s about republic-destroying norm-breaking. “Reforming” the filibuster is part of a broader effort to create a powerful, highly centralized state. Fortuitously for the country, Reid’s cynical weakening of Senate norms helped create one of the most constitutionally conscious Supreme Courts in modern history. It is perhaps the only institution inhibiting state overreach these days, which is why Democrats have been busy delegitimizing and now want to pack the court and transform it into another malleable partisan institution. Harris included. The other institution somewhat tempering a direct democracy is the Electoral College. Yet, left-wing pundits are already whining about the undemocratic nature of that institution as well. It is always confusing to me when someone writes to complain that the Electoral College doesn’t align with the “popular vote,” as if this wasn’t the entire point of the enterprise. If the two always harmonized, we wouldn’t need it. Then again, you may remember some Democrats worrying about the “House popular vote” and “Senate popular vote” — both, which, like the presidential “popular vote,” are not real things. The Senate was created as a countermajoritarian institution. Now that leftists believe they have the upper hand, they are increasingly perplexed by the fact that Wyoming and California have the same number of Senators. You know, it’s called the United States for a reason. Every time Democrats threaten to destroy a norm, they contend that Republicans would do it if they had the chance. While the GOP is hardly innocent, this is rarely the case. Republicans had numerous occasions to blow up the legislative filibuster and never did, including in 2017-18 when the GOP ran Washington, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), even after being pressured by Trump, refused to do it. When it comes to executive abuse, Trump, who makes tons of grandiose promises that lay far outside the president’s purview, is a mere piker compared to his predecessor and successor. There is a growing movement among progressive politicians and intellectuals, sometimes referred to as “popular constitutionalism,” that would allow Democrats to ignore the courts whenever they choose. It’s no accident that Harris promised to confiscate guns via an executive order like some kind of dictator. Or why Biden keeps ignoring the high court and unilaterally “forgives” loans.” Or that Democratic senators implore their president to declare national emergencies that would empower the White House to run the entire economy through a massive administrative state. But let’s set aside the Left’s problems for Article I-III of the Constitution. Here’s a thought experiment: How many contemporary Democrats would support swapping out, say, the 10th Amendment and replacing it with one that made abortion a right? One assumes most would. I won’t even ask about the Second Amendment, but how about the First Amendment? Do you think the free exercise clause would make it out of committee hearing if Democrats were in charge? What part of the Constitution do Democrats, who now support the state monitoring of “disinformation,” hold in high regard? CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Perhaps Harris’s position on the filibuster is a cynical play for votes. What’s become undeniable, however, is that counter-constitutionalism is being normalized on the Left. Democrats want to get rid of the Electoral College so that a few giant urban areas can run the executive branch. They want to get rid of the filibuster so they can unilaterally transform the nation. When they don’t have congressional majorities, they want (their) presidents to rule by fiat. And many now want to pack the Supreme Court to make sure no one will stop them. There are numerous ways to describe this brand of governance, but none of them have anything to do with American norms or democracy.","summary":"Though Democrats are endlessly prattling on about “norms” and “democracy,” it is often unclear what aspects of the constitutional order they actually support.&#160; This week, for example, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her support for suspending the legislative filibuster so that Democrats, should they eke out a slim Senate majority, can overturn thousands of state [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3166238/harris-attack-on-constitutional-order/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala_Harris_campaigning_2024_yyu24.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 00:00:00","author":"David Harsanyi","authors":["David Harsanyi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":257432684,"title":"Secret Service agent accused of sexually assaulting Kamala Harris staffer in hotel room","text":"A Secret Service agent is accused of sexually assaulting a staffer for Kamala Harris in a hotel room. The alleged incident took place over the last week, as a team of agents and Harris staffers did advance planning and security work for a September 20 event in Wisconsin that was later canceled, reports RealClearPolitics, citing four unnamed sources in the Secret Service community. The agent in question and the Harris staffers reportedly ate and drank together at a local restaurant, then went back to the female staffer’s room. There, the agent allegedly forced himself on the woman and groped her, an incident allegedly witnessed by others. Those inside the room allegedly kicked the agent out into the hallway, where he was said to have been so drunk he passed out. “The U.S. Secret Service Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating a misconduct allegation involving an employee,” a Secret Service spokesman said in a statement to the outlet. “The Secret Service holds its personnel to the highest standards. The employee has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.” The Harris campaign office also confirmed it was aware of the allegation. “We have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,” it told The Guardian. “Senior OVP [Office of the Vice President] officials were alerted by the USSS about an incident involving an agent and informed that USSS initiated an investigation.” Secret Service agents have been accused of misbehavior on trips in the past, including a 2012 scandal where agents in Colombia brought prostitutes back to a hotel, and a 2014 incident in which three agents protecting President Obama were sent home and suspended for excessive drinking during a trip to Amsterdam. In recent months, the elite outfit has been under scrutiny for potential security lapses, following multiple close-call threats against the life of Donald Trump, including an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and an alleged plot in Florida.

The hosts took turns hugging and shaking hands with the president as he walked onstage. As the crowd applauded Biden, co-host Joy Behar said to him, “They love you! They love you!” Co-host Sara Haines began the interview by asking Biden about his decision to step aside and “putting his country before any personal ambition” in the election. An audience member interrupted her question by shouting, “We love you, Joe!” “It’s like having one of the Beatles at the table,” Haines gushed in response. Following the interview, co-host Sunny Hostin likened Biden’s legacy to one of America’s Founding Fathers, George Washington. “I truly believe that Biden’s legacy will be etched in the history books as Washington,” Hostin said. The Trump campaign’s social media account “Trump War Room” shared fact-checks and responses to Biden throughout the interview. When Biden was asked if he felt his “hand was forced” in dropping out of the election, the Trump campaign’s account remarked, “His hand was forced by the same Democrats — Kamala chief among them — who perpetrated a fraud by covering for his cognitive decline.” “Biden gets asked on the The View if Pelosi forced him out of the presidential race. His immediate reaction let’s you know that the answer is definitely yes,” a social media user said. In the interview, Biden said his polling showed that he would have beaten former President Donald Trump but his age made him reflect about his life. “It’s hard for me to even say how old I am. No, I’m serious. I give my word. It’s like, holy God, that can’t be right. That just can’t be right,” Biden said. 81-year-old host Behar chimed in, “I’m your age, by the way. The number gives me vertigo.” Biden took her hand in his, which made her swoon. Goldberg told Biden that she didn’t like “the way they did it” in pushing him out because he was her “ride or die.” The Sister Act star continued to rip on Trump, calling him an annoying “bug” to which Biden responded by pretending to smash a bug on the table, which elicited a roaring applause by the television audience. “This Is Sickening! On The View today, co-host Whoopi Goldberg compares Donald Trump to a small bug as current sitting President Joe Biden pretends to ‘squish’ him. More violent rhetoric from the left against the former President,” a social media user reacted. Biden also tied his legacy to the current Democratic candidate. “As Vice President, there wasn’t a single thing that I did that she couldn’t do and so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy,” Biden said to the hosts. Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, chimed in to react to Biden’s comment. “Straight from Biden’s mouth: Kamala Harris 100% owns every single bad policy of the last four years that led to inflation, wars breaking out across the world and our wide open southern border!” Trump Jr. said on X. In addition to his appearance on The View, the president traveled to New York to deliver remarks to the U.N.

Following a hearing Tuesday, the unanimous court agreed that West and De la Cruz failed to qualify. That’s because their presidential electors did not each submit a separate petition with the 7,500 signatures needed to access Georgia’s ballots. Instead, only one petition per candidate was submitted, as specified by Georgia’s secretary of state. Democrats who are trying to prevent other candidates from siphoning votes from Vice President Kamala Harris challenged West and De la Cruz’s positions on the ballot. West and De la Cruz qualified as independents in Georgia, although De la Cruz is the nominee of the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Neither the West nor the De la Cruz campaigns immediately responded to emails seeking comment. The names of both candidates will remain on Georgia’s ballots, but votes for them won’t be counted, said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. A lawyer for Raffensperger told justices Tuesday that it’s too late to reprint ballots, in part because not enough watermarked security paper is available. There could also be problems with reprogramming voting machines. If ordered to disqualify the candidates, Raffensperger will order notices in polling places and mailed-out ballots warning that votes for West and De la Cruz won’t count, Sinners said. That’s a common remedy for late ballot changes in Georgia. The disqualifications will leave Georgia voters with the choice of four presidential candidates — Harris for the Democrats, Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians automatically qualify for elections in Georgia. Even four candidates will be the most since 2000 in Georgia. Justice Sarah Warren, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the rulings of two lower court judges who separately overturned Raffensperger’s decisions to qualify West and De la Cruz. “But the defect that prevents independent presidential candidates West and De la Cruz from appearing on Georgia’s ballot does not pertain to the number of signatures acquired; it is that West’s electors and De la Cruz’s electors filed no nomination petitions at all,” Warren wrote Justices rejected the argument that a 2017 federal court decision that lowered the signature threshold for statewide ballot access to 7,500 — citing constitutional issues — should also prohibit the claim that each of the 16 electors should have to file petitions, which would require a total of 120,000 valid signatures. “No constitutional challenge to the current statutory scheme for qualifying candidates for the office of elector of independent candidates for president is properly before this court in these cases,” Warren wrote. “We therefore express no view on any such constitutional questions today.” Because the court ruled no elector submitted a valid petition, an appeal into federal court on constitutional grounds could be difficult, said Bryan Tyson, a lawyer who represented West. Georgia is one of several states where Democrats have challenged third-party and independent candidates, seeking to block nominees who could take votes from Harris after President Joe Biden won Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes in 2020. Republicans in Georgia have sought to keep all the candidates on the ballot, and the party has pushed to prop up liberal third-party candidates in battleground states. Those interests have contributed to a flurry of legal activity in Georgia. An administrative law judge disqualified West, De la Cruz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Georgia Green Party from the ballot. Raffensperger, a Republican, overruled the judge, and said West and De la Cruz should get access. He also ruled that under a new Georgia law Stein should go on Georgia ballots because the national Green Party qualified her in at least 20 other states. Kennedy’s name stayed off ballots because he withdrew his candidacy in Georgia after suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nATLANTA – Presidential candidates Cornel West and Claudia De la Cruz aren’t&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court in Georgia refuses to count votes for Cornel West and Claudia De la Cruz in the presidential election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/court-in-georgia-refuses-to-count-votes-for-cornel-west-and-claudia-de-la-cruz-in-the-presidential-election/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/HDUI7AIM5VBCFC7FGOTBWMCYYU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-25 23:57:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.489},{"id":257433502,"title":"The Swing States That Could Matter Most in the Presidential Election","text":"The 2024 presidential election is, according to where the polls stand right now, confoundingly close.

Jordan (R-Ohio), 60, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, 71, on Wednesday raising the concerns while also pointing to the DOJ’s past resistance to divulging manifestos. Prosecutors disclosed the chilling note — which offered a $150,000 bounty on Trump, 78, — in a public court filing Monday as part of a motion to hold Routh, 58 in pretrial detention. “The Department’s decision to broadcast the attempted assassin’s bounty on President Trump—at the same time that the Department is aggressively and unconstitutionally prosecuting President Trump raises significant concern that the Department could cause additional harm to occur,” Jordan wrote. Routh allegedly put the note, which was addressed “To the World,” in a box at someone’s home weeks before his arrest on Sept. 15 after being caught with a loaded SKS-style rifle on Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, according to prosecutors. “This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,” the letter read. “I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster.” In the alleged note, Routh then made a public plea to “finish the job” and offered a $150,000 bounty. Secret Service Acting Director Ron Rowe Jr. previously said that Routh “did not fire or get off any shots at our agent.” A Secret Service agent had opened fire on Routh after seeing the gun through a fence near his apparent sniper’s nest off the 6th hole on the golf course. Routh then fled the scene but was caught after a chase. Prosecutors cited Routh’s alleged note as evidence of his intention to murder the 45th president, but the disclosure had drawn criticism, including from former US Attorney General William Barr, who said he was “dumbfounded” by the move. Barr argued that the note should’ve at least been redacted. “During your tenure as Attorney General, the Department has generally refused to release details about so-called ‘manifestos’ written by the perpetrators of high-profile crimes,” Jordan emphasized in his letter to Garland. “This decision seems to contravene the Department’s stated policy that ‘public access to legacy tokens,’ more commonly known as manifestos, ‘will contribute to further attacks’ by ‘spark[ing] incredibly intense interest and study’ by potential copycat offenders and providing a blueprint for future attackers,” he added. The Buckeye State Republican is demanding the DOJ cough up all communications and documents about the decision to release Routh’s letter in the public filing. He gave the Justice Department a 5 pm deadline on Oct. 9 to meet his demand. The Post contacted a DOJ spokesperson for comment. Routh was initially slapped with two charges including for illegal possession of a gun as a felon and possession of a gun with an obliterated serial number. On Tuesday, a grand jury indicted him on a charge of attempted assassination of a political figure, assaulting a federal officer and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump and oversaw before tossing out the 40-count Mar-a-Lago document indictment against him, was assigned to Routh’s case. Garland has vowed to deploy the “full force of our authorities to thoroughly investigate every lead and ensure accountability into this matter.” “Our nation has now experienced two assassination attempts against the former president in just the last three months,” he said on Wednesday.","summary":"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan criticized the Justice Department for releasing a disturbing letter from Ryan Wesley Routh, the alleged would-be assassin who targeted former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-judiciary-criticizes-doj-over-release-of-ryan-wesley-rouths-chilling-bounty-letter/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90403033.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-25 23:50:32","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":257432184,"title":"Zelensky’s arms-factory visit reeks of partisan foreign-election interference","text":"What was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doing at what sure looked like a partisan US political event this week? And how did the White House let this happen? Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates. And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics. Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses? Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference. Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year. House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend Ukraine’s fences here. But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over his supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics. We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed. And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry. But dragging any foreign leader, especially one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least. Whether at the White House or the State Department, American heads need to roll over this.","summary":"What was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky doing at what sure looked like a partisan US political event this week?

But his lead is driven by demographic strength among one group of high-propensity voters that could prove potent in the race for 16 electoral votes. In an American Association of Retired Persons survey conducted by the GOP-leaning Fabrizio Ward and the Democratic Impact Research shop between Sept. 11 and 17 during the week after the presidential debate, 50% of likely voters favor the former president, with 47% backing the vice president. While this suggests an even race, the battle between Harris and Trump in North Carolina is actually characterized by sharp demographic divides that will inform the topography of the race, particularly between black and white voters aged 50 and up. When it comes to older black voters, Harris has her best showing among any group polled. A full 92% back her, with 4% supporting Trump. But older white voters are falling in behind Trump, though not in quite that dramatic a proportion. He has 66% support among them, with just 30% backing Harris. The divides among older voters are more dramatic than the overall racial split between Trump and Harris. The former prez leads 60% to 35% with white voters of all ages, while Harris is up 84% to 10% with black voters. White voters outnumber black voters in the Tar Heel State, and because of this Trump is up over Harris overall with the 50+ set, 52% to 43%. He’s up by 9 points with caretakers over the age of 50 and 18 points with self-described swing voters of that relatively advanced age. Even among voters between 35 and 49 years of age, Harris and Trump are effectively tied, with Trump +2 in a head to head and Harris up a point in an expanded field. Harris is perceived to have won the presidential debate by nearly every group polled — except for white voters over 50, who rate it essentially a dead heat, and Republicans, who think Trump won. But consistent with other polls, a strong debate performance isn’t translating into momentum. This poll offers some more familiar insights, meanwhile, including a reminder Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson likely can’t win. The survey was wrapped before salacious reporting of his personal scandals, but he was still down 52% to 42% to Democrat Josh Stein. Whereas Trump leads by 3 with independents, Robinson trails by 17, showing the gap between the two candidates.","summary":"In the battleground state of North Carolina, Donald Trump narrowly leads Kamala Harris in a new poll.&nbsp; But his lead is driven by demographic strength among one group of high-propensity voters that could prove potent in the race for 16 electoral votes.

The 76-year-old cook has long been an admirer of the 34-year-old pop sensation. Garten’s respect for the “Are You Ready For It?” singer is not new: she has been a ‘Swiftie’ for several ‘Eras’ now! Swift’s most recent album was April’s “The Tortured Poets Department.” Before the blockbuster record’s release, Swift released the ‘Taylor’s Version’ of “1989,” a record first released nearly a decade ago. Garten has been on the Swiftie train for that long. She recently opened up about a treasured memory she shares with the “Blank Space” singer! Article continues below advertisement Swift was well into superstardom during her “1989” era. There’s no doubt the pop princess wanted to figure out some creative ways to have some fun while waiting for showtime on the album’s tour! One tour stop marked an instance where she and Garten played a well-known game to pass the time! The duo played beer pong together! Garten recalled the moment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. She told the publication, “I’m crazy about Taylor Swift. After the show, she invited us to go to a party that she gave for all the crew. As my friend Kate said, ‘Let’s go play beer pong!” The “Kate” Garten is referring to is Kate Wambach, a former soccer player. Wambach was also known for her coaching, as well. Article continues below advertisement Garten continues, “As we went over there Abby Wambach — who had just won the World Cup Championship for soccer — came over to me and said, I’m going to be your advisor.” Wambach reportedly gave her ‘student’ some colorful advice: “Get the f**king ball in the f**king cup!” The legendary cook laughs at the memory now. She continued, “I was like, ‘that’s your advice?” Perhaps Garten may have known that no subsequent game of beer pong would ever top the game of beer pong she played with a legendary soccer star and one of the most well-known musicians of the last 20 years. The “Be Ready When The Luck Happens” author has not grabbed a Solo cup and played a round of beer pong since! (per People) Article continues below advertisement Garten is sticking to her primary expertise these days; She shares the occasional recipe on her Instagram, in between preparing for the release of her new memoir! Back in 2021 (and during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic), The Blast highlighted a particular pasta dish that Garten shared on her feed. In the caption for the post, Garten expressed her excitement to see her friends and host them for dinner after COVID vaccinations went through! She also joked the dish would “Solve all your problems!” Article continues below advertisement The “Barefoot Contessa” star’s backstage antics with the “Speak Now” singer aren’t the only aspect of the duo’s relationship; Garten has supported Swift on her Instagram several times over the years! Back in 2015, Garten commemorated seeing the “Welcome To New York” singer live on the “1989” tour. She wrote, “OMG world-class night at the @taylorswiftconcert with my amazing team #1989 Taylor, you knock me out!!!,” and also included the hashtag #fangirls. Two years later, the author commemorated the release of Swift’s 2017 album, “Reputation,” by posting a photo of the LP. Garten detailed her enjoyment of the record by writing, “Love @taylorswift ‘s new album Reputation!! Congratulations, Taylor!! Your amazing talent and heart are in every song.” Article continues below advertisement In 2019, Garten congratulated her bestie after Swift delivered a passionate speech after winning the Woman of the Decade award. In a birthday-themed post, Garten wrote, “Happy birthday @taylorswift !! You’re a beacon of light for women of all generations, including me! What a brilliant speech at the Billboard awards. Congratulations!” Nearly ten years after Garten and Swift got their beer-pong on, Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for the President of the United States. Swift’s endorsement followed the Presidential debate between Harris and Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump. In a lengthy Instagram post, Swift wrote, “Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.” Article continues below advertisement “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,” she announced. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” Garten is gearing up to add another book to her lengthy book library! Her memoir, “Be Ready When The Luck Happens,” comes next week! Earlier this week, she detailed a particular memory related to the memoir. Garten shared a snapshot of her husband, Jeffery, and detailed his thoughts on what she should do with some earnings from her first cookbook. Mr. Garten encouraged his wife to pursue one of her lifelong dreams of buying an apartment in Paris. Despite the house-related hardships that would come into their lives afterward, Mrs. Garten knew the apartment was a wonderful investment! She left a lesson with her followers at the post’s conclusion- they are in control of their life’s path! Article continues below advertisement “Something I’ve realized in writing my memoir is that the way your life starts doesn’t have to be the story of your life. You get to choose. That’s why BE READY WHEN THE LUCK HAPPENS begins in 1964 when I met Jeffrey. I can’t wait to tell you my story,” the post concludes. “Be Ready When The Luck Happens” will be released on October 1st!","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#8220;The Barefoot Contessa&#8221; extraordinaire Ina Garten is one of those fans!

The journalist, 54, interviewed the royal in 2019 and has now told how she had to 'excuse herself' and flee to the toilet just before the chat to compose herself. The interview has now been turned into a three-part Prime Video series which has been lauded in its reviews. It follows actress Ruth Wilson, 42, who plays former Newsnight journalist Emily in a retelling of the car crash interview. He was quizzed about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein which threatened to damage the reputation of the entire royal family.

I locked the door and slumped in the corner of this wonderful, very chintzy, very ornate loo. 'I was holding the hand basin at one point and just saying to myself: 'Right, what is this interview about? 'Find the focus, find the point of the interview.' I was sort of lecturing myself: 'Don't interrupt, don't be rude, don't forget to be courteous in your address - but also don't pull your punches in the questions.' Canadian-born British journalist Emily went on to say that her younger self 'wouldn't believe' that parts of her life would end up on TV dramas. She added: 'I just thought it was a hoot. I couldn't believe it. 'It's the stuff of dreams, isn't it, to be portrayed by Gillian Anderson and Ruth Wilson? If I had to describe that to a younger version of myself, I just wouldn't believe it.' Emily said that, following the interview, 'far too much responsibility' was put on her and her team. The journalist said: 'There were some people saying to me, 'what have you done to the royal family?'.

Her post-BBC work has seen her appear on Channel 4's election night coverage, present a daily news podcast called The News Agents and work as an executive producer on A Very Royal Scandal. Speaking on GMB last week Emily also recounted her time doing the interview, candidly saying watching the series back reminded her of the stress of taking on the challenge. She said: 'When I watch the drama I get palpitations - it takes me back to when I thought 'will I remember to ask the right questions? Can I do this?'' She added of her reaction to Prince Andrew's demeanour: 'I realised early on he would be candid in his responses. We never assumed guilt and it was an hour of his own words. 'It didn't matter what he said it was always going to make history. We knew we only had one shot at it to hear from the Prince. It was a document of public record if anything. 'We were building up the picture of what actually happened and it was quite forensic.' When asked by host Richard Madeley what she thought of the Prince when the interview was done she carefully answered: 'I thought he had tried very hard to remember his lines... 'He wanted us to film extra pieces too he wanted to expand on the Pizza Express stuff and things like that. It was a dilemma as a journalist whether to add stuff he wanted at the end. 'But he was happy with the interview he gave us a tour of the Palace after the interview and he even invited us back.'

'There was fallout for his family. I feel concern for him as I do for anyone that has had a drop in status. But I don't regret the interview.' To counter balance her point she added: 'But nothing has been concluded for Epstein's victims still.' The November 2024 issue of Good Housekeeping is now on sale.

The journalist, 54, interviewed the royal in 2019 and has now told how she had to 'excuse herself' and flee to the toilet just before the chat to compose herself. The interview has now been turned into a three-part Prime Video series which has been lauded in its reviews. It follows actress Ruth Wilson, 42, who plays former Newsnight journalist Emily in a retelling of the car crash interview. He was quizzed about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein which threatened to damage the reputation of the entire royal family. Emily Maitlis has revealed that she had to give herself a last-minute crisis talking to in the bathrooms of Buckingham Palace just seconds before her famous Prince Andrew interview The journalist, 54, interviewed the royal in 2019 and has now told how she had to 'excuse herself' and flee to the toilet just before the chat to compose herself Speaking to Good Housekeeping Emily said of composing herself just before the career-defining moment: 'I remember shaking [the Prince's] hand, and then I excused myself and fled to the toilet. I locked the door and slumped in the corner of this wonderful, very chintzy, very ornate loo. 'I was holding the hand basin at one point and just saying to myself: 'Right, what is this interview about? 'Find the focus, find the point of the interview.' I was sort of lecturing myself: 'Don't interrupt, don't be rude, don't forget to be courteous in your address - but also don't pull your punches in the questions.' Canadian-born British journalist Emily went on to say that her younger self 'wouldn't believe' that parts of her life would end up on TV dramas. She added: 'I just thought it was a hoot. I couldn't believe it. 'It's the stuff of dreams, isn't it, to be portrayed by Gillian Anderson and Ruth Wilson? If I had to describe that to a younger version of myself, I just wouldn't believe it.' Emily said that, following the interview, 'far too much responsibility' was put on her and her team. The journalist said: 'There were some people saying to me, 'what have you done to the royal family?'.

'But there's something very disturbing about seeing the effects play out in real time, because you do feel a sense of responsibility. 'The thing I keep coming back to is, I'm a journalist, I just ask the questions.' Read More Emily Maitlis looks effortlessly stylish in a black dress as she joins chic Ruth Wilson at Prime Video's A Very Royal Scandal screening in NYC She also spoke about her decision to leave the BBC in 2022, saying she was 'grateful' to the corporation but had thought it was 'now or never' when she entered her 50s, so decided to leave. Her post-BBC work has seen her appear on Channel 4's election night coverage, present a daily news podcast called The News Agents and work as an executive producer on A Very Royal Scandal. Speaking on GMB last week Emily also recounted her time doing the interview, candidly saying watching the series back reminded her of the stress of taking on the challenge. She said: 'When I watch the drama I get palpitations - it takes me back to when I thought 'will I remember to ask the right questions? Can I do this?'' She added of her reaction to Prince Andrew's demeanour: 'I realised early on he would be candid in his responses. We never assumed guilt and it was an hour of his own words. 'It didn't matter what he said it was always going to make history. We knew we only had one shot at it to hear from the Prince. It was a document of public record if anything. 'We were building up the picture of what actually happened and it was quite forensic.' When asked by host Richard Madeley what she thought of the Prince when the interview was done she carefully answered: 'I thought he had tried very hard to remember his lines... 'He wanted us to film extra pieces too he wanted to expand on the Pizza Express stuff and things like that. It was a dilemma as a journalist whether to add stuff he wanted at the end. 'But he was happy with the interview he gave us a tour of the Palace after the interview and he even invited us back.' Ruth (left) stars as journalist Emily Actor Michael Sheen (left) portrays the Duke Of York (right) in the new production Emily and Ruth are pictured at a NYC screening for the series earlier this month Speaking on GMB last week Emily also recounted her time doing the interview, candidly saying watching the series back reminded her of the stress of taking on the challenge She added of the potential harm the interview could have caused: 'I do worry about the fallout from it. 'There was fallout for his family. I feel concern for him as I do for anyone that has had a drop in status. But I don't regret the interview.' To counter balance her point she added: 'But nothing has been concluded for Epstein's victims still.' The November 2024 issue of Good Housekeeping is now on sale.

Obama was being guarded by his protective detail inside a black SUV on a trip to LA when an armed man said he approached the vehicle, according to TMZ The unidentified man was there checking on the situation in his capacity as a security guard for the bar mitzvah, after being informed there were federal agents stationed outside, the report stated. Upon approaching, he says he came across the government vehicle, then snapped an image of it, only to see the former president seated in the passenger side of the vehicle. He said he quickly walked away, aware that he was carrying a weapon, which might be perceived as a threat by Obama’s protective detail. The agency is on alert for threats after two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump, and has been tightening up presidential protection. (The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to boost Secret Service protection for federal candidates). The Secret Service later denied claims there was a breach and no one was in the vehicle at the time. ‘The Secret Service cannot provide the details on our means and methods of protection, but we can confirm that at no time were any Secret Service protectees in the vehicle while the individual was walking down the alleyway,’ a spokesman told Newsweek. ‘These claims are inaccurate’. According to the TMZ report, the man who didn’t want his name used, says he greeted the agents protecting Obama, then returned to the bar mitzvah. Later, he says his boss asked him to provide his credentials and concealed carry permit for review, the outlet reported – an indication Obama’s guards felt the need to follow up. The president’s adult daughters Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23, were joining their dad for dinner at Mother Wolf, rated a top upscale pizza restaurant. Even though he meant no harm, the unidentified guard indicated his ability to get close to the former president with a weapon was a lapse. He said of his interactions with the agents on the detail, ‘I think they were obviously embarrassed by the situation.’ The office of the former president declined to comment. DailyMail.com has sought comment from the Secret Service, which was the subject of a scathing report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on security failures leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania rally. The interaction involving Obama’s detail happened at 7:30 on September 21st. The event happened hours after Biden hosted his first solo fundraiser for Vice President Kamala Harris, helping haul in $4 million for her presidential campaign. That event was held at the home of former Obama ambassador to Spain James Costos and his partner Michael Smith, James Costos, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra under Obama, and his partner, Michael S. Smith, who served as White House decorator under Obama. Obama spoke at the Democratic Convention, mocking Trump’s ‘weird obsession with crowd sizes,’ and members of his former campaign team were among the most vocal voices pushing President Biden to step aside.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Secret Service has responded to claims agents were responsible for a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Secret Service Reacts to &#8216;Armed Individual&#8217; Approaching Barack Obama&#8217;s Motorcade at a Restaurant in Los Angeles first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/secret-service-reacts-to-armed-individual-approaching-barack-obamas-motorcade-at-a-restaurant-in-los-angeles/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/25/23/90101217-13891875-Former_President_Barack_Obama_s_Secret_Service_security_detail_h-a-1_1727304789249.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-25 23:43:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":257432510,"title":"Funding bill clears House without Trump-backed SAVE Act","text":"Funding bill clears House without Trump-backed SAVE Act The House passed a three-month government funding bill Wednesday that did not include the so-called election security provision known as the \"SAVE Act\" that former President Donald Trump had insisted Republicans tie to the measure.

His stage was the US-Mexico border in Arizona and the set piece of his performance was the border wall. The message was simple: with their border policy, Democrats have “unleashed a deadly plague of migrant crime”. Trump has ratcheted up the tensions on immigration further since then, repeating wild conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants eating pets and, more recently, claiming migrants are “attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest”. What the US needs, Trump has repeatedly stressed, is a closed border, a walled border. A long history of wall-building advocacy The US-Mexico border wall, which is currently around 700 miles in length in various stretches, has loomed large in American politics in recent decades, especially since the 2016 US presidential campaign. Yet, current stories about the wall mostly overlook its history. Most importantly, the media ignore the long-standing appeal of the wall as a tool of spatial and cultural division in the making of the US-Mexico border. In my forthcoming book, I trace the origin of the border wall to the early 1900s, when the US Immigration Service and other federal agencies called for the construction of barriers at the border. Congress answered their appeal by adopting an act in 1935 that authorised the secretary of state to construct and maintain fences between the US and Mexico. For decades following its adoption, US officials stood before Congress almost yearly, asking for funding for the construction of border fences. This trend culminated in the 1940s with two parallel projects: the Western Land Boundary Fence Project (576 miles or 926 kilometres of fencing from El Paso, Texas, to the west) and the Rio Grande Border Fence Project (415 miles or 668 kilometres of fencing along the Mexico-Texas border). Neither one of these projects was ever fully realised. But if they had been built, they would have surpassed the length of the current border wall. Immigration, disease and crime What is telling when looking at the history is how similar the arguments supporting such fences in the early 1900s were to those deployed today. Immigration, disease and crime have been recurring justifications for the wall, both then and now. Indeed, there is an uncanny likeness to Trump’s rhetoric surrounding the US-Mexico border — including during his August speech in Arizona — and the narratives justifying a border wall in the mid-20th century. High on the list of justifications was the need to deter “juvenile delinquents”, “thieves”, “beggars”, undocumented workers, narcotic smugglers, “wetbacks” (a derogatory term for Mexicans), and Mexican nationals seeking medical care in the US at public expense. These arguments appeared regularly in government reports and during congressional hearings from the 1930s to the late 1950s. A 1934 report by the Immigration Services on the feasibility of a short border fence between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, for example, said it would stifle illegal immigration that took employment opportunities from American workers, while lowering wages in the borderland area. Reminiscent of recent analogies between the borderland and a “war zone”, the report noted that sending agents to patrol the border without proper equipment was pointless. It was akin to: put[ting] a body of troops in the field in an enemy’s theatre of operation without artillery, observation planes, trucks, ammunition and other weapons. The fence was “the correct solution to the problem.” At times, the fear of the undocumented merged with the fear of contagion. A foot and mouth disease outbreak in Mexico in 1946, for example, provided additional rhetorical support for the wall. As Texas Senator Tom Connally said when the Committee on Foreign Relations considered the issue: It has been a dream of the Department of State for many years to have this fence, not because of the hoof and mouth disease, but for immigration and customs and smuggling and all of that sort of thing. Persistent racial faultlines The 1935 act has long been forgotten. In fact, by the end of the 1950s, only a few hundred miles of fencing had actually been built. These earlier walling plans failed for a range of reasons, including opposition by Texan landowners and industries relying on illegal Mexican labour. Perhaps most importantly, there were serious reservations back then about the efficiency of fences in curbing immigration. Yet, these doubts have not weighed in to the same extent in contemporary debates about the border wall. This underscores the performative role of the wall in today’s politics. In fact, close to 700 hundred miles (1,126 kilometres) of fencing has been built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006. This includes large portions of the wall built under the presidency of Barack Obama and, to a lesser extent, Trump’s. What has filtered through, however, is the racialised narrative that paints Mexicans nationals in a disparaging way. This rhetoric relied on generalisations and stereotypes on themes such as criminality, licentiousness and disease. It transformed Mexico into a threat to be curtailed and became a frame of reference that has permeated politics for decades – and is now a defining issue in the upcoming presidential election.","summary":"Donald Trump says immigrants are ‘attacking’ US cities and the country needs a closed border.

General Motors was downgraded to “underweight” from “equal weight,” and its shares fell 5.4 percentage points, to $45.50. Ford went to “equal weight” from “overweight,” with its shares dropping more than 4 percentage points, to $10.43. Electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian Automotive and Canadian parts manufacturer Magna International were both downgraded to “equal weight” from “overweight.” Shares of Rivian were down 5.7 percentage points while Magna’s were off 4.7 percentage points. Investors sold after Morgan Stanley analysts warned about what they called the “China butterfly effect,” a metaphor suggesting that even small surges in China’s industrial production capacity could have significant ripple effects across the global market. “China capacity ‘butterfly’ has emerged and is flapping its wings,” the analysts wrote in a note viewed by The Epoch Times, noting that China now produces 9 million more cars than its domestic market can absorb. This oversupply of Chinese cars will be “upsetting the competitive balance in the West,” according to the analysis. Even if those units don’t enter the U.S. market, it warned, the “‘fungibility’ of lost share and profit by key U.S. players adds pressure here at home.” Shifting its outlook, Morgan Stanley downgraded the U.S. auto industry to “in-line” from “attractive,” based on “a combination of international, domestic, and strategic factors that we believe may not be fully appreciated by investors.” The investment bank further highlighted the “capital intensity” Western automakers might face as they compete with Chinese manufacturers, especially when it comes to developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology for the next generation of cars. “The AI/data theme for autos still gets us excited, but to play in the game, players need to spend tens of billions,” the analysts said. “We question the financial ability of most auto companies to create proprietary AI models to augment their operations.” At the same time, Morgan Stanley upgraded car retailers and dealerships, which are largely insulated from Chinese competition, and generate recurring profits from servicing vehicles and selling parts. Shares of Penske Automotive, for example, were up 0.5 percentage points, Asbury Automotive gained 2 percentage points, and Sonic Automotive added 0.3 percentage points. The revision reflects growing concerns over the influx of Chinese-made cars, particularly EVs, into international markets. Bolstered in part by massive government subsidies, Chinese manufacturers have rapidly emerged as major players in the EV industry, accounting for 60 percent of worldwide EV sales and almost one in five EVs sold in Europe last year. Both Washington and Brussels have hiked tariffs in response to China’s excess production of low-price EVs. The European Union announced plans in July to levy import duties of up to 36 percent for Chinese EV imports—on top of its standard 10 percent car tariff, while the Biden administration last month quadrupled the existing tariff, from 25 percent to 100 percent. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has also pledged to implement a tariff as high as 200 percent on Chinese EVs assembled in plants located in Mexico, which he said would make them “unsellable” in the United States.","summary":"Investors sold after the investment bank's analysts warned about what they called the 'China butterfly effect.'","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/gm-ford-shares-dip-as-morgan-stanley-downgrades-us-auto-industry-5729989","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/09/18/id5493260-MadeinUSGettyImages-1236626057-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-25 23:33:31","author":"Bill Pan","authors":["Bill Pan"],"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":257431304,"title":"Tommy John blames not getting into Baseball Hall of Fame on  Donald Trump vote","text":"Tommy John isn’t sure why he’s been kept out of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, but he has a clue: his support for former president Donald Trump. John, who is best known for the ubiquitous elbow surgery named after him, blamed his choice at the ballot box in 2016 and 2020 for his falling short on Cooperstown ballots over the years. “Maybe because I voted for Donald Trump,” John said when asked by Michael Kay on Wednesday afternoon on “The Michael Kay Show” why he wasn’t in the Hall of Fame. “Probably. I don’t know. I have no idea. If I knew and I could do something, I would do it. But I can’t.” After retiring in 1989, John was on the Hall of Fame ballot from 1995 to 2009 – long before Trump’s decision to run for president in 2016. John got four more shots at making it to Cooperstown through the Veteran’s Committee in 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2020 – the latter two years, of course, were after Trump had become president. Needing 75 percent of votes to make it, John topped out at 31.7 percent of the electorate in 2009, his final year on the ballot. John spent 26 seasons in the big leagues from 1963 to 1989, making four All-Star teams in stints with the then-Indians, White Sox, Dodgers, Yankees, Angels and A’s. He had a 3.34 career ERA and compiled 288 wins. Only Roger Clemens, who was linked to steroids, and Bobby Mathews, who played in the 19th century when pitcher wins were much more common, had more career wins without making the Hall of Fame.","summary":"Tommy John isn’t sure why he’s been kept out of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, but he has a clue: His support for former president Donald Trump. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/sports/tommy-john-blames-donald-trump-vote-for-not-getting-into-baseball-hall-of-fame/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-pcov4829q-1727306355516.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727292064&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-25 23:32:16","author":"Dylan Svoboda","authors":["Dylan Svoboda"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":257435224,"title":"Notoriously racist GOP congressman deletes heinous rant about Haitians","text":"A Louisiana congressman’s post on X claiming that Haitian people participate in “eating pets,” practice “vudu,” and come from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere” sparked widespread outrage on Wednesday. “All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” Clay Higgins’ post concluded. (Note: These immigrants from Haiti are in the United States legally.) Two hours later, the racist post was deleted from the Republican House member’s official account, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus were calling for Higgins to be censured. Higgins’ diatribe was sparked by a Haitian community group in Springfield, Ohio, filing criminal charges against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after they repeatedly—and falsely—claimed Haitian immigrants were kidnapping and eating cats and dogs. While the claims were quickly debunked by city officials, that hasn't stopped Trump and Vance from continuing to spread the lie—and it hasn’t kept MAGA supporters from believing it. Springfield residents have faced tangible consequences as a result of the racist political rhetoric, with bomb threats forcing local children to evacuate from their schools. Higgins, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, decided to pile on with his latest despicable tirade. The former cop and car dealership manager has a history of antidemocratic, racist, and violent behavior. In 2016, Higgins resigned as captain of the St. Landy Parish Sheriff’s office after a viral video showed him threatening a group of Black gang members and calling them “thugs,” “heathens,” and “animals,” according to The Washington Post. In 2020, during protests in response to the police murder of George Floyd, Higgins made alarming threats against black protesters in Louisiana. \"I'd drop any 10 of you where you stand,\" Higgins wrote in a post that was also quickly deleted. \"Nothing personal. We just eliminate the threat. We don't care what color you are. We don't care if you're left or right. If you show up like this, if we recognize threat...you won't walk away.\" The Acadiana Advocate reported that Facebook removed the post because it violated the site’s “violence and incitement” policy. During a 2021 interview with CNN’s Jim Sciutto, Higgins asserted that fraud was committed during the 2020 election. When prompted by Sciutto to “cite one example” of his evidence, Higgins couldn’t muster any answers other than repeating, “We have preponderance of evidence.” In 2023, on the day Trump was indicted for his handling of classified documents, Higgins posted some vaguely threatening instructions on the site then known as Twitter. “This is a perimeter probe from the oppressors,” he wrote. “Hold. rPOTUS has this. Buckle up. 1/50K know your bridges. Rock steady calm. That is all.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Higgins’ post was “vile, racist, and beneath the House of Representatives” in a post on X. “The extreme MAGA Republicans in the House are unfit to govern,” Jeffries said.","summary":"A Louisiana congressman’s post on X claiming that Haitian people participate in “eating pets,” practice “vudu,” and come from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere” sparked widespread outrage on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n“All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” Clay Higgins’ post concluded.

Punchbowl News pointed out that Trump has spent the past week bashing Zelenskyy, and it's causing Republicans to \"wince.\" Over the weekend, Zelenskyy was in Scranton, PA, for a tour of a plant manufacturing artillery that has aided Ukraine's defense from the Russian invasion. He was joined by Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) as the top elected officials in the state. But Trump allies attacked the move as \"election interference.\" Speaking to The New Yorker, Zelenskyy described Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) as “too radical” and told him to “read up” on World War II. Trump allies were immediately triggered. “The idea that a foreign leader is here flying around on a C-17, in Pennsylvania, criticizing President Trump, criticizing JD Vance — it’s like a campaign stop that, again, just feels way over the top,” Trump surrogate Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), told Punchbowl. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the comments “the biggest mistake he’d ever make.” “I don’t mind him going to a munitions plant thanking people for helping Ukraine. But I think his comments about JD Vance and President Trump were out of bounds,” Graham told Punchbowl. “With conservatives, it’s going to hurt Ukraine.” Conservatives have grown increasingly pro-Russia thanks to Donald Trump's ongoing support of Vladimir Putin. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), on the other hand, didn't much care. “President Zelenskyy is trying to do everything he can to secure the support for a sustained successful effort against Putin. My guess is, if we were in similar circumstances, we’d do the same thing,\" said Tillis. “He’s making a reference to J.D.’s comments about supporting the Ukraine effort,\" Tillis explained to Punchbowl. \"And in that case, I agree. J.D. has a position I don’t share, unfortunately. The majority of Congress doesn’t either.\" In a speech to a Georgia audience, Trump admitted he only recently learned about Russia's role in World War II and its battle with former French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.","summary":"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was one of the international leaders willing to stand up to Donald Trump when he demanded a \"favor\" in exchange for sending military assistance already allocated by Congress.
