Right?’ he said, referring to the ongoing economic sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine. ‘They are sanctioned.’\n\nBessent admitted that some tariffs on countries like China were higher than expected, but said they were part of a negotiating process.\n\n He urged every country alarmed by President Trump’s actions to take stock in the new tariffs before reacting dramatically.\n\n‘My advice to every now is do not retaliate. Sit back. Take it in. Let’s see how it goes. Because, if you retaliate, there will be escalation. If you don’t retaliate, this is the high water mark,’ he said.\n\nTrump did not hold back as he announced sweeping tariffs across the world, including on American allied countries. \n\n‘My fellow Americans, this is liberation day, we’ve been waiting for a long time,’ Trump said. \n\nChina, one of the United States’ largest trading partners, would be hit with a 54 percent tariff according to Trump’s chart that he revealed during the event. \n\n Trump’s opening salvo on tariffs has already sent stock market values plunging as uncertainty plagues global economists and investors.\n\nFitch Ratings revealed that Trump’s new tariffs would raise trade levels from just 2.5 percent last year to 22 percent, the highest levels since 1910.\n\nDuring the event at the White House, the president singled out several countries specifically for ripping off the United States. \n\nTrump singled out the European Union as ‘very tough, very, very tough traders’ and proposed a 20 percent tariff. \n\nYou think of European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It’s so said to see. It’s pathetic,’ Trump said.\n\nHe proposed a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, noting they were ‘great negotiators’ and ‘great people’ but said that the United States suffered a 90 percent trading rate. \n\nOther tariffs included 32 percent for Taiwan, 24 percent on Japan and 26 percent on India.\n\nStock futures fell steeply after Trump’s announcement as futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,007 points, or 2.3 percent. S&P 500 futures dropped 3.4 percent and Nasdaq-100 futures lost 4.2 percent, according to CNBC. \n\nAmerican companies relying on imported goods such as Nike and Apple each dropped about seven percent.\n\nFutures for bargain retailers such as Dollar Tree lost 11 percent and Five Below lost 15 percent.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Wednesday his decision to level sweeping economic tariffs&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Why Were Three Key Nations Not Included on Trump’s Extensive Tariffs List? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/why-were-three-key-nations-not-included-on-trumps-extensive-tariffs-list/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/02/23/96853591-14565431-U_S_President_Donald_Trump_displays_a_chart_on_tariffs_in_the_Ro-a-15_1743634652370.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 01:01:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":307058604,"title":"Donald Trump’s dumb war just got much, much dumber","text":"Donald Trump has just announced the most self-destructive set of policies in modern American economic history.\n\nThe US built the post-war global trading system and its companies are the most enmeshed in it.

Reciprocal: That means they do it to us and we do it to them. This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It is our Declaration of Economic Independence.

This decision led to an alarming loss of approximately 4700 jobs, triggering a widespread outcry among the members of the Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN). The demonstrators were joined by Québec Solidaire, a left-wing political party, united in their call against what they see as a draconian move by Amazon to penalize unionization efforts.\n\nThe Closure’s Hidden Agenda\n\nThe wrath against Amazon’s actions runs deeper than the immediate job losses. The closure, many assert, is a retaliatory attempt to stifle the emergent union at one of Amazon’s facilities. This comes at a time when the Quebec labor tribunal was on the verge of enforcing a collective agreement due to Amazon’s refusal to negotiate. Such strategies by Amazon reflect a larger trend in its operational ethos, characterized by its unyielding stance against union rights. According to Green Left, Amazon continues to deploy tactics aimed at controlling and influencing labor dynamics across its global operations.\n\nGlobal Implications and Solidarity\n\nAmazon, part of the infamous ‘Big Five’ tech giants, holds sway over 1.5 million employees worldwide, including vast numbers in the US, Canada, and Europe. Its influence mirrors that of former US President Donald Trump, highlighting a troubling alliance of power that extends beyond borders. This ‘Trump-Bezos’ duo, as likened by protestors, signifies broader economic and political struggles that emphasize the need for a concerted fight against corporate oligarchies.\n\nA Unified Call to Action\n\nThe protest movement in Quebec has ignited an ambitious ‘Ici, on boycotte Amazon’ campaign. Supported by 50 organizations, this initiative seeks extensive boycotts and legislative interventions against Amazon. The demands are intensifying, from keeping the warehouses open to calls for expropriation of Amazon’s assets. The underlying message is clear: workers are ready to challenge not just corporate overreach but also political complacency.\n\nConnecting Workers and Climate Struggles\n\nThe unfolding protests serve as a fertile ground for interlinking labor rights with environmental activism. The fight against Amazon’s practices dovetails with broader, urgent demands for climate justice, resisting Trump’s anti-environment policies. The demonstration’s significance extends into a potential North American solidarity movement, calling upon the US workers to rally against shared adversaries.\n\nReflecting on the Path Forward\n\nWhile the turnout on February 15 was significant, protestors acknowledge that a broader mobilization is vital to sustain momentum. The echoes from past large-scale demonstrations, such as Greta Thunberg’s climate marches, remind organizers of the power in numbers. As they press on, the dual narrative of resisting corporate exploitation and environmental degradation remains central to the evolving struggle.\n\nIn the ongoing battle against formidable adversaries, Quebec’s demonstrators are not just marking a protest. They are scripting a crucial chapter in the broader narrative of labor and environmental justice.","summary":"Over 2000 demonstrators rallied in Montreal, challenging Amazon's warehouse shutdowns and the larger issues tied to Trumpism.","url":"https://internetprotocol.co/web/2025/04/03/montreals-outcry-against-the-trump-bezos-closure-a-call-for-justice/","image":"https://internetprotocol.co/content/images/2025/04/3525495180.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:49:01","author":"Kay Lee","authors":["Kay Lee"],"language":"en","source_country":"co","sentiment":0.048},{"id":307057890,"title":"Russia not included in list of nations, subject to US customs duties","text":"WASHINGTON, April 3. /TASS/.

Announcing the measure in the White House Rose Garden, on what he described as ‘Liberation Day’, Mr Trump claimed they were reciprocal tariffs - with a standard 25 per cent tariff on all cars produced outside the USA. Here in the UK, the big news was the fact that there is now a 10 per cent tariff on other British goods crossing the Atlantic to the States. Producing a chart to illustrate his new tariffs, Mr Trump also announced 20 per cent tariffs against the 27 European Union nations, 34 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and 24 per cent against Japan. Shortly afterwards, the White House published a full list of all affected countries and territories on X. One that made headlines immediately in the USA was the Heard and McDonald Islands, which now faces a 10 per cent tariff on all goods sent to the United States. This would be bad news for the island’s inhabitants, if anyone lived there. The islands, sitting around halfway between Madagascar and Antarctica are an Australian external territory that is completely uninhabited and which takes two weeks to sail to by boat from Australia. However it was not the only slightly unusual entry on the extensive list. Here are five more places on the list you may not have heard of. Svalbard and Jan Mayen are both administered by Norway - with the Svalbard archipelago sitting high in the Arctic and boasting the world’s most northern town with more than a thousand people, Longyearbyen. Along with the tiny Russian colony of Barentsburg, which exists under the Svalbard Treaty allowing signatory nations to mine on the islands, Longyearbyen is one of very few settlements on the island. Once a centre of whaling and mining, tourism now makes up a major part of Svalbard’s economy, apart from the coal mine at Barentsburg that sends its resources back to Russia. Jan Mayen meanwhile is completely uninhabited aside from Norwegian scientists from the country’s weather forecaster and the Norwegian armed forces. If these areas export anything to the US, they face a 10 per cent tariff - below the 15 per cent for goods from Norway itself. It is well known that France once claimed a significant area of North America, including areas such as Louisiana in the USA and Quebec in Canada. What is less well known is that France continues to hold a tiny group of eight islands off the Canadian coast. Saint Pierre and Miquelon, near the coast of Labrador, is home to just under 6,000 people - who have a right to French citizenship as the islands are a French ‘overseas collectively’ - with the islands even sending a representative to the country’s National Assembly and voting in the presidential elections. Fishing is a traditional part of the island group’s economy, although efforts have been made to diversify this. While Metropolitan France will face 20 per cent tariffs under Donald Trump’s announcement,, the islands will face a tariff of 50 per cent for anything exported to the US - which the White House claims is a response to 99 per cent tariffs charged on goods to the USA. A tiny Pacific Island nation, Nauru has one of the smallest populations of any independent country in the world. Slightly under 12,000 people call the nation home, with the country heavily dependent on Foreign Aid from Australia and others. The island’s economy was for many years based on Phosphate mining, however these reserves have now been depleted. As a result other income streams include selling the rights for people to fish in Nauru’s territorial waters and hosting an Australian immigration detention facility. Goods from Nauru that make their way to the US now face a 30 per cent tariff, which the US Government says is in response to 59 per cent tariffs for American goods heading to the country. The Kingdom of the Netherlands continues to include a number of islands in the Caribbean - with these forming constituent countries in the kingdom along with the Netherlands itself. Of these, Aruba is perhaps the best known, but it is not the only one. Curaçao, which consists of the main island and a smaller uninhabited island, is home to around 160,000 people and is considered a 'constituent island country' within the kingdom. The island, which boasts a high standard of living, is best known for its tourism and financial services trades. As a result of the Liberation Day announcement, it will now face a 10 per cent tariff - lower than the 20 per cent imposed on the Netherlands itself as part of the EU . Sitting in the Pacific Ocean, between New Zealand and New Caledonia (an overseas territory of France), Norfolk Island, like the Heard and McDonald Islands, is an Australian territory. Like the Heard and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island now faces a 10 per cent tariff on all goods sent to the United States - however unlike the Heard and McDonald Islands, people actually live there. The island is home to around 2,000 people and it's main source of income is tourism - with direct flights bringing visitors in from Australia and New Zealand.","summary":"Tariffs against the UK, EU, China and other major economies made the headlines - but a smaller territories also made the list","url":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/five-places-donald-trumps-liberation-31339739","image":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article30649765.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Svalbard-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:45:50","author":"Tom Burnett","authors":["Tom Burnett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.062},{"id":307058794,"title":"Senate rebukes Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports","text":"The US Senate has passed a resolution which would thwart Donald Trump’s ability to impose tariffs on Canada, hours after the president unveiled sweeping plans to clamp down on international trade.\n\nThe resolution, passed by a 51-48 vote, would end Mr Trump’s emergency declaration on fentanyl which underpins tariffs on Canada. The president announced orders earlier on Wednesday — his so-called Liberation Day — to impose import taxes on a slew of international trading partners, although Canadian imports were spared from new taxes.\n\nThe Senate’s legislation has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled House and being signed by Mr Trump, but it showed the limits of Republican support for his vision of remaking the US economy by restricting free trade.\n\nMany economists are warning the plan could cause an economic contraction and Republican senators are already watching with unease as Mr Trump upends the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world.\n\nThe president singled out the four Republicans — senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky — who voted in favour of the resolution.\n\nIn a social media post just before 1am on Wednesday, Mr Trump said the four “will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl”.\n\nTo justify the tariffs, Mr Trump has argued that Canada is not doing enough to stop illegal drugs from entering the northern border. Customs and Border Protection seized 43lb of fentanyl in its northern border sector during the 2024 fiscal year and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5lb, according to federal data. At the southern border, authorities seized more than 21,000lb last year.\n\n“This is not about fentanyl. It’s about tariffs. It’s about a national sales tax on American families,” senator Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who initiated the resolution, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats argued Mr Trump is using the tariffs to pay for tax cuts which would benefit the wealthy, but will make it more expensive to build homes, disrupt industries and raise prices on imported grocery products. Mr Kaine pointed to aluminium imported from Canada that is used by businesses ranging from pie makers to shipbuilders.\n\n“Today, Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to the American economy and even to the American dream,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech.\n\nOn the heels of election results in Wisconsin and Florida which delivered early warning signs to Republicans about the popularity of Mr Trump’s agenda, Mr Schumer said the president is particularly vulnerable when it comes to the economy.\n\n“Once the American people say, ‘I don’t want to embrace somebody, I don’t want to vote for somebody, I don’t want to support somebody who embraces Trump’s policies,’ things are going to change,” he told reporters. “Public sentiment is everything.”\n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump singled out Canada as a beneficiary of “unfair” trading practices with the US, although his latest order did not add to tariffs already in place on Canada and Mexico.\n\n“Why are we doing this? I mean, at what point do we say, ‘You’ve got to work for yourselves and you’ve got to’? This is why we have the big deficits,” Mr Trump said.\n\nAfter his announcement, representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.\n\n“Republicans can’t keep ducking this — it’s time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,” he said on social media.\n\nRepublican leaders tried to hold their members in line against the tariff resolution by emphasising that Mr Trump was acting to address fentanyl trafficking and border security.\n\nMajority whip senator John Barrasso argued in a floor speech that former president Joe Biden had “also thrown open the northern border. The criminal cartels noticed and they took advantage”.\n\n“There are unique threats to the United States at our northern border,” the Wyoming senator said. “President Trump is taking the bold, decisive, swift action that is necessary to secure that border as well.”\n\nWhile a younger group of Republicans closely aligned with Mr Trump have spoken out in favour of the president’s plans to aggressively reshape the economy, a sizeable portion of the Republican conference voiced concerns about the tariff impacts on farmers and other industries. Most wanted to give Mr Trump room to negotiate better trade deals.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/senate-rebukes-trump-tariffs-canadian-004351603.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dgk38gDuLus..TZTqesLgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_704/98a32bf72a631d1c13ce00323ed46467","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:43:51","author":"Stephen Groves, Associated Press","authors":["Stephen Groves, Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":307057250,"title":"Canada’s Prime Minister Carney Pledges to Combat Trump’s Tariffs as Global Leaders Assess the Consequences","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday evening vowed to “fight” the new round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, and said he would turn to other international partners to get through the rocky times ahead. \n\n“President Trump has just announced a series of measures that are going to fundamentally change the international trading system,” Carney told reporters following Trump’s Rose Garden announcement. “We’re in a situation where there’s going to be an impact on the U.S. economy, which will build with time.\n\n“In our judgment, it will be negative on the U.S. economy that will have an impact on us,” he added, noting millions of Canadians will be impacted.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, generally seen as a Trump ally, said Trump’s tariffs were “wrong” and warned they would not only harm American and European pocketbooks, but aid Western adversaries.\n\n“We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,” Meloni said in a statement on Facebook.\n\n“In any case, as always, we will act in the interest of Italy and its economy, also engaging with other European partners,” she added.\n\nIreland’s Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Harris, said he “deeply regret[s]” the new tariffs but said he is committed to working with Washington to end this tariff war. \n\n“I must be honest tonight that a 20% blanket tariff on goods from all EU countries could have a significant effect on Irish investment and the wider economy,” he said, noting the effects would “likely be felt for some time.”\n\nChairman of the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee Bernd Lange called for a united response from countries targeted by Trump.\n\n“While President Trump might call today ‘Liberation Day,’ from an ordinary citizen’s point of view this is ‘Inflation Day,’ he said, reported Reuters. “Because of this decision, U.S. consumers will be forced to carry the heaviest burden in a trade war.”\n\nLange said the EU will respond through “legal, legitimate, proportionate and decisive” measures.\n\nSwiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said her government would work to figure out the next steps. \n\nThe U.K., along with the president of Mexico ahead of the announcement, said they would continue to work with the U.S. and would not rush to enforce reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSimilarly, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that while Trump’s decision was “not the act of a friend,” his country would not impose reciprocal tariffs, reported Reuters. \n\nHe reportedly condemned the U.S. tariffs as totally unwarranted and said Australia will continue to negotiate to have the tariffs lifted.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday evening vowed to &#8220;fight&#8221; the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Canada&#8217;s Prime Minister Carney Pledges to Combat Trump&#8217;s Tariffs as Global Leaders Assess the Consequences first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/canadas-prime-minister-carney-pledges-to-combat-trumps-tariffs-as-global-leaders-assess-the-consequences/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Canadas-PM-Carney-vows-to-‘fight-Trumps-tariffs-other-world.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:42:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":307058790,"title":"Republicans join Democrats in Senate vote to rescind Trump Canada tariffs","text":"Several Republican senators joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policy just hours after he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners.\n\nIn a 51-48 vote, four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure.

Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.”\n\nRepublicans have expressed varying degrees of unease over Trump’s clampdown on free trade – once a pillar of conservative orthodoxy – but few were willing to cross him, and many GOP leaders and supporters, including the House speaker Mike Johnson, were in the Rose Garden on Wednesday – a day dubbed “liberation day” by the president – as a way of championing the historic barrage of tariffs on goods from overseas he believes will boost American manufacturing.\n\nBefore the vote, Senate majority leader John Thune of South Dakota urged Republicans to oppose the resolution, arguing that the tariffs are needed to “ensure that President Trump has the tools to combat the flow of fentanyl from all directions”.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, sent just before 1am ET on Wednesday, Trump assailed the four GOP senators who had expressed opposition to his tariffs, imploring them to “get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl”.\n\nHe vowed not to sign the measure if it reached his desk.\n\nDefending her vote, Collins said that the tariffs would hurt working families in her state of Maine, which shares a long border with Canada.\n\n“The price hikes that will happen for Maine families, every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank, if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful,” she said in a Wednesday floor speech. “And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.”\n\nShe also argued that fentanyl from Canada was not a major threat to the US, as Trump’s national emergency claims. “The fact is the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border,” she said.\n\nDemocrats argued that Americans were turning against Trump’s agenda, pointing to a string of strong performances by their party in recent special elections that included a consequential victory in a Wisconsin state supreme court race on Tuesday night.\n\n“The American people are seeing how bad Trump is,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech. “Tariffs is a good part of it. And they are not supporting people like Elon Musk and those who support Donald Trump.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said he would also force a similar vote in the House on the tariffs.\n\n“Republicans can’t keep ducking this – it’s time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,” he wrote on X.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/republicans-join-democrats-senate-vote-004222431.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/1f025acb1bd526032a742ac13618de73","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:42:22","author":"Lauren Gambino","authors":["Lauren Gambino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":307057436,"title":"World News | World Reacts with Caution to US 'reciprocal' Tariffs Against Dozens of Nations","text":"Mexico City, Apr 3 (AP) The sweeping new tariffs announced Wednesday by US President Donald Trump were met initially with measured reactions from key trading partners, highlighting the lack of appetite for a full-fledged trade war. Trump presented the import taxes, which he calls “reciprocal tariffs” and range from 10 per cent to 49 per cent, in the simplest terms: the US would do to its trading partners what he said they had been doing to the US for decades.

Nobody wants a trade war Shortly after Trump's announcement, the British government said the United States remains the UK's “closest ally.” Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK hoped to strike a trade deal to “mitigate the impact” of the 10% tariffs on British goods announced by Trump. “Nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal,\" said Reynolds. \"But nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the UK's national interest.” Italy's conservative Premier Giorgia Meloni described the new 20 per cent tariffs against the European Union as “wrong,” saying they benefit neither side. “We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favour of other global players,” Meloni said in a Facebook post. Brazil's government said it was considering taking the case to the World Trade Organization. And later, in a rare display of unity, Brazil's Congress unanimously passed a reciprocity bill to allow its government to retaliate against any country or trade bloc that imposes tariffs on Brazilian goods. No basis in logic Some countries took issue with the White House's calculations. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the US tariffs imposed on his country were totally unwarranted, but Australia will not retaliate. “President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10 per cent,” said Albanese. The US and Australia have a free trade agreement and the US has a USD 2-to-USD 1 trade surplus with Australia. “This is not the act of a friend.” Trump said the United States bought USD 3 billion of Australian beef last year, but Australia would not accept US beef imports. Albanese said the ban on raw US beef was for biosecurity reasons. The 29% tariff imposed on the tiny South Pacific outpost of Norfolk Island came as a shock. The Australian territory has a population of around 2,000 people and the economy revolves around tourism. “To my knowledge, we do not export anything to the United States,” Norfolk Island Administrator George Plant, the Australian government's representative on the island, told the AP Thursday. “We don't charge tariffs on anything. I can't think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so we're scratching our heads here.” New Zealand also took issue with Trump's tariff logic. “We don't have a 20 per cent tariff rate,” said trade minister Todd McClay, adding that New Zealand was “a very low tariff regime” and the correct figure was below the 10 per cent baseline rate applied by the US to all countries. “We won't be looking to retaliate. That would put up prices on New Zealand consumers and it would be inflationary,” he said. Spared for the moment from the latest round of tariffs were Mexico and Canada, so far as goods that already qualified under their free trade agreement with the United States. Yet, the previously announced 25% tariffs on auto imports were scheduled to take effect at midnight. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday she would wait to take action on Thursday when it was clear how Trump's announcement would affect Mexico. “It's not a question of if you impose tariffs on me, I'm going to impose tariffs on you,” she said Wednesday morning. “Our interest is in strengthening the Mexican economy.” Canada had imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to the 25 per cent tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed taxes on 26 billion euros' worth (USD 28 billion) of US goods, including bourbon, prompting Trump to threaten a 200 per cent tariff on European alcohol. Little to gain As Trump read the list of countries that would be targeted Wednesday, he repeatedly said he didn't blame them for the trade barriers they imposed to protect their own nations' businesses. “But we're doing the same thing right now,” he said. “In the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the United States can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender,” Trump said. Speaking from a business forum in India, Chilean President Gabriel Boric warned that such measures, in addition to causing uncertainty, challenge the “mutually agreed rules” and the “principles that govern international trade.” Colombia President Gustavo Petro, who has clashed with Trump before, said via X that the tariffs marked a global milestone: “Today the neoliberalism that proclaimed free-trade policies all over the world has died.” Analysts say there's little to be gained from an all-out trade war, neither in the United States or in other countries. “Once again, Trump has put Europe at a crossroads,” said Matteo Villa, senior analyst at Italy's Institute for International Political Studies. “If Trump really imposes high tariffs, Europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the EU would be better off doing nothing,” he added. Villa also noted that retaliation would certainly be a further “blow” to the United States, but it would hurt Europe even more, as the EU bloc depends more on exports to the US than vice versa. “On the other hand, Trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response,” Villa said. “Probably the hope, in Brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce Trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

China received the harshest levies, with Trump announcing a 34% tariff on top of a 20% tariff already imposed on Chinese goods.

Trump has threatened and delayed imposing the 25% tariff against Canada and Mexico. The president claimed the rates he announced Wednesday were placed at about half of the charges imposed against the U.S. by other countries, though that has not been independently verified.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHere’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes)\n\nTrump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Trump's TariffsUS President Trump on Wednesday unveiled a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world, including some of its closest trading partners, in a move that risks sparking a ruinous trade war. He announced a baseline 10 per cent tariff on imports and reserved some of the heaviest blows for what he called the \"nations that treat us badly,\" including 34 percent on goods from superpower rival China, 20 percent on key ally the European Union and 24 percent on Japan.Besides China's 34 per cent tax, India got a 26 per cent, Vietnam 46 per cent and South Korea 25 per cent. The European Union was hit with a 20 per cent levy.Trump also shut a loophole used to ship low-value packages from China, which is likely to hurt China's giant online retailers.But the 78-year-old Republican -- who held up a chart with a list of levies -- said that he was \"very kind\" and so was only imposing half the amount that those countries taxed US exports.Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices.\"We would characterise this slate of tariffs as 'worse than the worst case scenario' the Street was fearing,\" said analysts at Wedbush, with the technology supply chain in Taiwan and China hit hard.U.S. interest rate futures leapt as investors priced in slowing US growth and a higher chance of rate cuts.\"The tariff rates unveiled this morning far exceed baseline expectations, and if they aren't negotiated down promptly, expectations for a recession in the US will rise dramatically,\" said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore.&nbsp","summary":"Stocks slumped, bonds surged, and gold hit a new high as markets braced for the impact of US President Donald Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariffs on Thursday.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/stocks-slump-gold-hits-new-high-as-markets-react-to-trumps-bombshell-tariffs-8073876","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/nh8mmcvo_market-trump-tariffs_625x300_03_April_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:39:57","author":"Sanstuti Nath","authors":["Sanstuti Nath"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":307057396,"title":"Man charged with making threats against ICE agents, DHS Sec Kristi Noem in 'alarming' social media posts","text":"A Texas man was recently arrested after authorities say he made terroristic threats against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem.

Shares of Baltimore’s Under Armour, which maintains a large Portland office, fell 6%. Shares of Switzerland-based On, which employs around 300 in Portland, and which makes 90% of its footwear in Vietnam, were down 12%.\n\nNike and Columbia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced across-the-board tariff increases, including 46% on Vietnam and 34% on China, two countries which for decades have been popular places to make sneakers and T-shirts. \n\nThe tariffs are in addition to those already announced. \n\n“This is catastrophic for American families,” Matt Priest, CEO of the trade group Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said in a written statement. “We had hoped the president would take a more targeted approach, but these broad tariffs will only drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence.”\n\nIn remarks outside the White House, Trump said he hoped the tariffs spark more domestic manufacturing. \n\n“If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” Trump said, according to The New York Times, “then you build your product right here in America.”\n\nVirtually all of Nike’s manufacturing is done abroad. The company made 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel in Vietnam in its most recent fiscal year, according to the company’s annual report. It has steadily moved more footwear manufacturing to Vietnam and lessened its dependence on China, which was the subject of an earlier trade war. \n\nOregon’s senior senator Wednesday said in a statement the tariffs would have consequences for apparel industry jobs and the state’s economy.\n\n“These incoherent and destructive Trump tariffs leave no shortage of economic casualties in Oregon, and that obviously includes the painful fallout for the jobs and revenue generated by our state’s world-renowned sportswear industry, standout agricultural sector and much more,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. “I will not stop fighting this asinine excuse for a strategy concocted by Trump and congressional Republicans all too willing to endorse this economic madness.”\n\nShawn Narancich, an analyst at the Portland investment firm Ferguson Wellman, doesn’t think the tariffs will spur domestic manufacturing. \n\n“Companies like Nike are going to see this as temporary,” he said. “We don’t have the labor capacity to scale manufacturing and companies aren’t going to make that investment because nobody thinks this is going to stick. It’s headline grabbing.” \n\nWhile the tariffs could be temporary, they’ll still be costly. Alex Harding, another Ferguson Wellman analyst, said he expects companies like Nike will absorb some of the new costs and pass the rest to consumers. \n\n“It’s a mix of both,” he said. “But it’s certainly going to be an impact to Nike’s earning in a negative way. And it’s going to be an impact to a consumer – higher prices.”\n\n– Matthew Kish covers business, including the sportswear and banking industries.

The surplus countries traditionally, always lose any kind of trade escalation,' Bessent added. \n\nSeveral nations have already said they would be prepared for when the tariffs begin to respond to Trump's actions. \n\n'As a student of economic history or a professor of economic history, I'd advise against' trying to get revenge. \n\nBessent's advice to remain calm may mirror what Trump is going to do, as he said the president's tariffs could be temporary and they're going to 'wait and see how this plays out.' \n\nThe US President said his 'liberation day' announcement was a 'declaration of economic independence'.\n\nThe White House announced a baseline 10 percent tariff on all imports, effective April 5, with higher rates for countries imposing steeper duties on US goods.\n\nMr Trump confirmed that from midnight in Washington, a 25 percent tariff would be imposed on all foreign cars imported to the US.\n\nTrump held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 percent tax on imports from China, a 20 percent tax on imports from the European Union, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan.\n\nThe president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the United States helped to build after World War II, saying 'our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered' by other nations.\n\nTrump declared a national economic emergency to launch the tariffs, expected to produce hundreds of billions in annual revenues. \n\nHe has promised that factory jobs will return back to the United States as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods.\n\n'Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,' Trump said in remarks at the White House. 'But it is not going to happen anymore.'\n\nThe president kicked off his speech just after 4pm by giving a blistering tirade, slamming 'friend and foe' for 'ripping off' America. \n\nHe condemned 'foreign scavengers.' And he talked of other nations that had 'pillaged, raped and plundered' the U.S. and 'foreign cheaters' who 'ransacked' American factories. \n\nIt took nearly 20 minutes before Trump shared the tariff details. \n\n'For nations that treat us badly we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating. And because we are being very kind ... We will charge them approximately half of what they charge us,' Trump said. \n\nTrump then held up a large sign that showed the calculations. \n\nAs Trump went through the chart, he knocked even some of the U.S.'s closest allies for charging import taxes. \n\n'The European Union. They're very tough, very, very tough traders. You think of European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so said to see. It's pathetic,' Trump said. 'Thirty-nine percent, we're going to charge them 20 percent, so we're charging them essentially half.'\n\nTrump called Vietnam 'great negotiators' and said they were 'great people.' \n\n'They like me, I like them. The problem is they charge us 90 percent. We're going to charge them 46 percent,' he said. \n\nTrump blasted Taiwan and said they 'took all of our computer chips and semiconductors.' \n\nTaiwan will be charged 32 percent. \n\n'Japan - very, very tough, great people,' Trump continued. \n\nJapan will be hit with a 24 percent tariff. \n\nTrump also said that India was 'very, very tough' while complimenting Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great friend of mine.' \n\n'But I said, 'You're a friend of mine but you're not treating us right,'' Trump said, pointing out that India will now be charged 26 percent. \n\nThe largest tariff will hit the African nation of Lesotho, at a rate of 50 percent. \n\nCanada and Mexico were exempt from Wednesday's tariff announcement, due to the president already charging them 25 percent excluding the goods outlined in the trade agreement from Trump's first administration. \n\n'They all understand, we're gonna have to go through a little tough love maybe? But they all understand. They're ripping us off and they understood,' Trump said. \n\nTrump had been heralding the tariff announcement as 'Liberation Day' for weeks but up until the event kicked off, it appeared some of the details hadn't been fully worked out. \n\nWall Street fears the move will stifle economic growth, drive up inflation and further rattle global stock markets when trading resumes in Asia and Europe on Thursday.\n\nMost Americans' retirement savings, including 401(K)s, are tied to stock market performance. They are invested in shares and funds that track the major indices. \n\nAt 6.30pm in after-hours trading in New York, futures that track the S&P 500 were down 2.3 percent, while one that is tied to the Nasdaq-100 fund dropped 4.2 percent. A fund that follows the Dow Jones slipped 2.3 percent. \n\nStocks of major importers took a hit late Wednesday. Nike plunged 6 percent, and General Motors fell 3 percent. Companies already struggling amid tariff concerns, like Nvidia and Tesla, each lost about 3 percent. Five Below dropped 11 percent, while Gap tumbled 12 percent. \n\nAlthough Wall Street's main trading sessions ends at 4pm in New York, traders can continue buying and selling regular stocks until 8pm in after-hours trading.\n\nBeyond that, investors can trade futures contracts around the clock, except for a one-hour break starting at 5pm each day. Futures track the prices of major indexes like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, as well as gold and other commodities.\n\nAmericans will have already seen their retirement funds take a hit based on after-hours trading and futures. If prices don't recover, they'll face a bigger blow when markets open at 9.30am in New York on Thursday.","summary":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned America's trading partners against trying to get revenge on Donald Trump 's tariff program.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14565629/trump-treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-warns-countries-tariff-revenge.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/03/01/96855881-0-image-m-14_1743639895734.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/02/6776931499683330057/1024x576_MP4_6776931499683330057.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:34:13","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

The stunning array of tariffs, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House late Wednesday in what the American leader had billed as “Liberation Day,” included a baseline 10 percent tariff on all nations. A higher reciprocal tariff has then been imposed on roughly 60 other nations with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficits. “Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency, and his order imposes responsive tariffs to strengthen the international economic position of the United States and protect American workers,” the White House said in a statement. It added, “These tariffs are central to President Trump’s plan to reverse the economic damage left by President Biden and put America on a path to a new golden age.” According to a list of tariffs released by the White House, which appear to include the 10 percent baseline tariff, three Southeast Asian nations were among the hardest hit nations in the world: Cambodia, which was slapped with a 49 percent tariff, Laos (48 percent), and Vietnam (46 percent). Myanmar, which is subject to layers of U.S. sanctions and currently conducts minuscule amounts of trade with the U.S., will be subject to a 44 percent tariff. It was followed by Thailand (36 percent), Indonesia (32 percent), Brunei (24 percent), and Malaysia (24 percent). The nations that got off most lightly were the Philippines (17 percent), Timor-Leste (10 percent), and Singapore (10 percent). The latter two are the only Southeast Asian nations that currently run a trade surplus with the U.S. The tariff list also included what the administration claimed were the total tariff rates that each foreign nation had imposed on the United States, “including currency manipulations and trade barriers.” For instance, Vietnam has been accused of imposing an effective tariff rate of 90 percent on U.S. imports, followed by Thailand (72 percent), Indonesia (63 percent), Malaysia (47 percent), and so forth. However, there are strong indications that these figures have been basically made up. As numerous observers have already noted, the tariffs that the administration claims have been imposed on U.S. goods correspond to the nations’ current trade surplus with the United States, expressed as a percentage of these nations’ total exports to the U.S. This is true of the figures for all nine of the Southeast Asian nations that have been subjected to reciprocal tariffs, as well as seemingly every other nation that falls into this category. (The White House later appeared to confirm this.) The fact that the administration has passed this off as a “tariff” rate, and then used this as the basis for the imposition of so-called reciprocal tariffs on other nations – in most cases the latter seems to have been calculated simply by halving the former – is a sign of spectacular mendacity and incompetence. As Mike Bird of The Economist noted on X, the fraudulent way that the tariffs were calculated is almost a worse signal than the tariffs themselves. Perhaps one shouldn’t be surprised. The Trump trade policy has always been more political than economic: an attempt to communicate strength and resolve to the U.S. electorate (even as the looming trade war portends higher prices for U.S. consumers) and to strongarm partners into further opening their markets to U.S. goods. As the White House said in its statement on the tariffs, “The United States will no longer put itself last on matters of international trade in exchange for empty promises. Reciprocal tariffs are a big part of why Americans voted for President Trump.” Needless to say, these essentially arbitrary tariffs could have devastating impacts on the manufacturing industries in many Southeast Asian nations. Among the most vulnerable is Vietnam. The U.S. is the main destination for Vietnamese goods, and its goods exports to the United States last year accounted for 29 percent of its total exports and 30 percent of its GDP. Vietnam has long been in the crosshairs of Trump’s team due to its massive $123.5 billion trade surplus with the U.S., which grew by nearly a fifth in 2024. This is currently the third-largest in the world, behind the surpluses enjoyed by China and Mexico. At the same time, Vietnam has become an increasingly close strategic partner of the U.S., and Vietnamese officials had made assiduous efforts to preempt the Trump administration’s likely concerns about the trade imbalance. It is therefore hard to avoid the conclusion that the imposition of a 46 percent tariff will undermine hard-won bilateral trust and suck much of the content out of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership that was established with great fanfare in 2023. According to one Vietnamese observer, the initial reaction among Vietnamese social media users, including government officials, has been one of “great sadness and disappointment.” Taking such a step days before Chinese leader Xi Jinping is set to visit Vietnam is “a geopolitical own goal,” Khang Vu, a regular contributor to The Diplomat, wrote on X. The 49 percent U.S. tariff on Cambodia could also have a significant effect on the country’s nascent manufacturing industry. The country last year exported $9.91 billion worth of goods to the U.S., around 37 percent of its total, according to Cambodian government figures. Mass layoffs in the Cambodian apparel and garment manufacturing sector, should they eventuate, could well result in widespread hardship and potentially political unrest. Of course, whether these tariffs are actually imposed in their current state remains to be seen. These figures are perhaps best seen as an opening negotiating position, which will be used to bring foreign governments to the negotiating table where they will be forced to make significant concessions to U.S. economic interests. The notion that this will pan out in Southeast Asia, where China, which was also hit with a 34 percent reciprocal tariff (on top of the 20 percent already imposed by the Trump administration) is now the preeminent economic power, is a risky bet. Trump’s “Liberation Day” appears to mark Washington’s final retreat from the principle of free trade in a region where the U.S. is already absent from the largest multilateral trade blocs: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), from which Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2017, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). While the U.S. will no doubt continue to remain a prominent security presence in the region, any reduction in the U.S. economic influence in the region is likely to undermine its influence more broadly and burnish China’s image as a steadfast and predictable economic partner. “The U.S. is pretty much done strategically in Southeast Asia,” Evan Feigenbaum, formerly of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X after the announcement of the tariffs. “The region is filled with pragmatists, who can and do navigate all kinds of crazy stuff from outside powers. But that depends greatly on those players being either principled or strategic – and Washington is now neither.” Certainly, when China’s leader Xi visits Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia later this month, it is clear what will be at the top of his agenda.","summary":"Nine of the region's 11 nations have been hit with reciprocal tariffs that could devastate local industries – and create a strategic opening for China.","url":"https://thediplomat.com/2025/04/southeast-asian-slammed-by-president-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/","image":"https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-04-03-005114.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:27:00","author":"Sebastian Strangio","authors":["Sebastian Strangio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":307056174,"title":"‘The View’ co-host Joy Behar wonders if Trump DOJ seeking death penalty for Luigi Mangione will cause ‘backlash’ against Republicans","text":"“The View” co-host Joy Behar said Wednesday that there could be “backlash” against the Republican Party as the Trump Justice Department has ordered prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n“He’s very popular, this guy, there could be a backlash,” she said. \n\n“All I’m saying is, politically, it could be a backlash against Republicans to give him the death penalty.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on Tuesday that Thompson’s murder was “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”\n\n“After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,” the statement continued.\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin suggested that Bondi’s efforts were “an assault on the process.” \n\n“It just seems like the attorney general is acting, really, against our institutional standards, which is what this administration is doing,” Hostin added.\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said she believed in the death penalty, but questioned the administration’s push to apply it in this case.\n\n“I was a little surprised this is where the Trump Justice Department started,” she said, wondering if they should have focused on a drug cartel member or human trafficking cases. \n\n“I personally believe in the death penalty in the most extreme cases, terrorism, mass murder, with the most extensive appeals process in place so that mistakes are not made,” Griffin continued, adding, “I personally, I think Luigi Mangione, if convicted, should spend his life in jail.

But his announcement still rippled through the markets that were open at the time, sending stock futures and bond yields lower, while gold surged to a new record high.As the evening progressed, US futures fell sharply, with the Dow Jones dropping 2.4 percent at around 2345 GMT, the Nasdaq index plunging 4.2 percent, and the broader futures index for the S&P 500 falling 3.5 percent. Wall Street has largely suffered from Trump's various trade announcements in recent weeks.\"The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board,\" Northlight Asset Management's Chris Zaccarelli wrote in a note to clients.\"But for now traders are shooting first and asking questions later,\" he added. The share price of technology companies whose components are produced abroad also fell sharply, with Apple losing 7.4 percent after-hours, Nvidia falling 5.2 percent and TSMC declining 5.9 percent. Futures markets are typically much more volatile than the regular indices. The clothing sector was also hit especially hard, with a particularly heavy bill for China, where products will be hit by an additional duty of 34 percent from April 9, and Vietnam, where the new \"reciprocal\" rate will be 46 percent.Brands whose clothes are partly made in China or Vietnam were sharply lower, with Gap down 8.5 percent after hours, Ralph Lauren falling 7.3 percent, and Nike losing 7.1 percent.Investors flocked to gold, which has been setting new records in the face of trade uncertainties.The yellow metal blew past its previous day's record high after Donald Trump's new announcements, and was trading at roughly $3,160 an ounce at around 2345 GMT. The price of gold has jumped by close to 20 percent since the start of 2025. The bond market also played its role as a safe haven, with the yield on the benchmark ten-year US Treasury, easing to 4.10 percent after Donald Trump's announcement.

He’s a great friend of mine. But I said, ‘You’re a friend of mine, but you haven’t been treating us right’. They charge us 52 per cent, but we charge them almost nothing for years and decades. It was only seven years ago when I came in,” he said.\nIn a strong move on trade policy, announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods.\nHere are the other highlighted quotes from his remarks.\nTrump’s ‘Liberation Day’ Speech: Top Quotes\n\n“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Trump said, stressing that trade abuse by allies was often more intense than that committed by rivals.\n“This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It’s our declaration of economic independence.”\n“Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers, and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”\nDespite unveiling “minimum baseline” tariffs of 10 per cent on trading partners, Trump sought to spin his move as a positive for global trade. “We are being very kind,” the president said. “We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.”\nThe world’s second largest economy, China, appeared at the top of the tariffs list Trump held up at the podium. “We’re going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 per cent” on China imports, Trump said.\n“They charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset? They will be, because we never charged anybody anything. But now we’re going to charge.”\nTrump said China’s President Xi Jinping was among several world leaders who “understand” the need for the tariffs, such as the ones he slapped on Chinese steel and other products during his first term as president.\n“From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,” said Trump, who has repeatedly elevated 1890s protectionist president William McKinley as one of his heroes who also slapped tariffs on imports.\n“In 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,” Trump said.\n“Then in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression. And it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy,” Trump said.\n\n(With agency inputs)","summary":"Reflecting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in February, he described him as a “great friend\" but criticised India for imposing “very tough\" tariffs","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/pm-modi-great-friend-of-mine-top-quotes-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs-speech-9284851.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/04/Trump-2025-04-5bcc949fe35bc82203a58fc72d99c521.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:18:49","author":"News18,Ronit Singh","authors":["News18","Ronit Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.063},{"id":307057888,"title":"Elon Musk dismisses claims that his role in politics will soon diminish","text":"NEW YORK, April 3. /TASS/.

Trump has threatened a similar \"secondary tariff\" on Russian oil.- Small parcels -On Wednesday, Trump ordered an end to a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China too, a move likely to severely disrupt the import of popular low-cost products.The rule has faced heavy scrutiny as US officials pointed to the growth of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu as a factor behind a surge of shipments using the exemption.Products imported under the \"loophole\" from China would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or $25 per item, increasing to $50 per item after June 1.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"After weeks of anticipation, US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping new tariffs on trading partners Wednesday, calling it a \"declaration of economic independence.\"","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/inside-donald-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-which-countries-are-hit-hardest-8073803","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/b85hfvt4_donald-trump_625x300_03_April_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:10:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":307057676,"title":"These tech markets are taking the brunt of the new US tariffs - what that means for you","text":"On Wednesday, April 2, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would impose a new series of tariffs against trade partners.

That said, the effects of these new tariffs could be wide-reaching. It's entirely possible that we could see steeper price hikes hit tech products amidst greatly inflating costs. While the price changes may not go into effect over the next few weeks, the months ahead will be a telltale sign of where the market is headed.\n\nPresident Trump has argued that the tariffs will encourage companies to invest in the United States. This has worked to some extent. Back in February, Apple announced it was making a $500 billion investment in the US over the next four years [to] grow its role in US manufacturing.

U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer briefed House Republican staffers on the administration's strategy on Wednesday evening, Fox News Digital was told. Greer opened the call stressing that Trump was ushering in a magnitude of economic change not seen since the post-World War II era. He also said the U.S. had been subjected to unfair trade practices for decades since lowering its own tariffs against other countries in a bid to bolster global trade, Fox News Digital was told. WALL STREET FIRMS SEE RECESSION RISK RISING OVER TARIFFS, TRADE WAR Examples Greer cited for Capitol Hill aides included both Brazil and the European Union, while stressing that exemptions would be made for foreign products already subject to U.S. penalties — rather than double up on the taxes. While political communications offices often hold coordinated messaging calls on important issues, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that it was the first such communications policy call between this White House and House Republican staff. It underscores tariffs' importance in the Trump administration's policy platform, as the White House works to ensure the GOP is in lock-step on its messaging. When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a White House official emphasized that the Trump administration has been the most transparent in history, and that the president wants to ensure his allies are armed with the most up-to-date information. And while the vast majority of Republicans are praising Trump's moves, some GOP lawmakers have conceded to at least some concerns. \"I think tariffs that are equal to what they're charging are defensible. We want a level playing field,\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told Fox News Digital on Wednesday evening. \"The automobile one can be messy because the parts are from all over.\" Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., spoke out in support of a Democratic bid to exempt Canada from tariffs on the Senate floor Thursday, hours before Trump's formal announcement. \"The price hikes that will happen for Maine families, every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank, if these tariffs go into effect, will be so harmful,\" Collins said of the Canada tariffs specifically. \"And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least. Therefore, I will support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do so likewise.\" Another GOP lawmaker who spoke with Fox News Digital on Thursday, however, downplayed any longstanding concerns. \"I think as long as it's a short-term tool, folks will be OK with it,\" the GOP lawmaker said. During the Thursday evening call rallying House GOP aides, first-term Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., sent out a statement backing Trump's move but conceding she understood the concerns.

Trump's plan involves a 10% blanket tariff on all foreign imports into the U.S., as well as tariffs up to 50% on both adversaries and allies. It also introduces some level of reciprocal tariffs on countries that tax U.S. exports, though in most cases, the U.S. rate is lower than the foreign country's.","summary":"The White House held a call with House Republican aides rallying them around Trump&apos;s tariff plan, Fox News Digital was told.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-rallies-house-republicans-trump-tariff-plan-secret-call","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/trumptariffs.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 00:09:41","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":307057488,"title":"Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, targeting U.S. trade partners around the globe and even including small, uninhabited islands and other extremely remote areas in his lengthy list of tariffs.\n\n(Photo by MATT CURNOCK/AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC DIVISION/AFP via Getty Images)\nAUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC DIVISION/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Trump administration’s list, it will be imposing a 10% reciprocal tariff on the Heard and McDonald Islands—an external Australian territory a little less than 1,000 miles north of Antarctica.\n\nAccording to an informational guide to the islands on an Australian government website, they are considered to be “one of the wildest and remotest places on Earth.”\n\nOther tariff targets include the British Indian Ocean Territory, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which have a population of less than 600, and the Norwegian Arctic islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen, the latter of which has no permanent population.\n\nHeard Island’s land is dominated by Big Ben, a 1.7-mile tall volcano that has erupted at least three times since 2000, according to the BBC.\n\nMcDonald island is much smaller than Heard and is surrounded by smaller islands, according to UNESCO.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

All of the over 180 countries on Trump’s tariff list have baseline tariffs of 10%, though Canada and Mexico have been excluded from the rate as the U.S. may soon place a 25% tariff on most Canadian and Mexican imports. China took the largest hit from the Trump administration, which announced a 34% tax that will tack on to the 20% tariffs already placed on Chinese imports.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe Heard and McDonald Islands are the only sub-Antarctic island group believed to have no known species introduced through humans, contributing to its status as one of the most pure ecosystems in the world and making it an important scientific research asset. The islands’ ecosystems allow for scientists to have a baseline when monitoring the health of the larger Southern Ocean ecosystem. Animals on the islands include seals, penguins, albatrosses, invertebrates and seabirds known as petrels. Weather on the Heard and McDonald Islands is fast-changing, according to the Australian government, which notes “unbelievably rapid changes in winds, cloud cover and precipitation” can occur.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nHere’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes)\n\nTrump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

However, Russia and North Korea are excluded from the list.\nUnveiling the tariffs in a dramatic White House Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, Trump declared the move a \"Liberation Day\" for American manufacturing. The new tariff structure imposes a 34% tax on imports from China, 20% on the European Union, 24% on Japan, and 26% on India, with a baseline tariff of 10% for most other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia.\nWhy Were Russia and North Korea Left Out?\nDespite the broad scope of the tariffs, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus were noticeably absent from the list. A White House official, speaking anonymously to The New York Times, explained that these nations were excluded because they already face extensive U.S. sanctions that limit trade.\n\"Sanctions, not tariffs, restrict Russia's economy, especially in finance, energy, and defense sectors,\" noted a report by Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok. The U.S.-Russia trade volume had already plummeted from $35 billion in 2021 to just $3.5 billion in 2024 due to existing sanctions.\nMoreover, Trump has recently hinted at additional sanctions on Russia, particularly targeting its oil industry. He has threatened to impose secondary tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil, potentially impacting nations like India, China, Turkey, and several EU members.\nGlobal Leaders Slams Trump Tariffs\nThe tariff announcement triggered an immediate backlash from key U.S. allies.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the tariffs \"totally unwarranted.\"\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a Trump ally, criticized the move as \"wrong.\"\nThe European Union vowed retaliatory measures, potentially affecting U.S. exports.\nThe financial markets reacted sharply. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5% in after-hours trading, while the U.S. dollar initially weakened against the euro before stabilizing.\nMeanwhile, diplomatic efforts are already underway.
