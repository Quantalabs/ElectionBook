On Saturday, in a post shared on his platform X, Musk announced the creation of a new political force in the United States—the America Party.\n“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,” Musk wrote, citing the results of a recent poll he conducted that, according to him, revealed a 2-to-1 public desire for an alternative to the current political system.\nThe announcement comes amid growing public frustration with America’s entrenched two-party structure. Musk didn't hold back in his critique, saying, “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste and graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.”\nMusk's Challenge to the \"Uniparty\" System\nIn a follow-up post, Musk expanded on his vision for disrupting what he described as a \"uniparty\" system, drawing an unexpected comparison to a legendary military strategy.\n“The way we’re going to crack the uniparty system is by using a variant of how Epaminondas shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility at Leuctra: Extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield,” he wrote, referencing the famed Theban general’s unexpected victory in ancient Greece.\n\"Posting on X, Musk drew inspiration from Epaminondas—the legendary Greek general who shattered Spartan dominance at the Battle of Leuctra.\"\nA Party Born on Independence Day\nThe seeds for the America Party were planted on July 4, when Musk leveraged the symbolic power of Independence Day to float the idea through a poll on X. He asked followers, “Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system! Should we create the America Party?”\nThe response was swift and decisive: 65.4% voted “Yes”, while 34.6% voted “No.” Musk took this as a mandate, framing it as a clear sign that many Americans are hungry for a new political direction.\nFrom Ally to Adversary\nMusk’s announcement comes on the heels of a sharp political pivot. Once a close ally of former President Donald Trump, Musk has recently distanced himself following a bitter fallout over Trump’s sweeping new legislation.\nThe bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” passed Congress and was signed into law on July 4. Musk was quick to voice his opposition, warning it could add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.\nThe rift marks a dramatic reversal in their relationship. Musk previously played a key advisory role under Trump, heading the now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, he officially stepped away from the position in May, signaling a larger shift in his political affiliations and priorities.\nWhat’s Next for the America Party?\nAlthough many questions remain—including the party’s official registration, leadership structure, and long-term strategy—Musk has already outlined his short-term goals. He plans to focus the America Party’s efforts on 2 to 3 Senate races and 8 to 10 House races in 2026, aiming to tip the scales in key contests.\nThe idea, Musk says, is to create a swing bloc capable of influencing tight legislative decisions—particularly on contentious bills. The party would caucus independently, negotiating with both Republicans and Democrats on a case-by-case basis.\nDespite the party’s infancy, Musk’s political ambitions appear to be more than symbolic. In 2024 alone, he contributed over $280 million, mostly to Trump’s campaign and various Republican candidates. Now, with the formation of his own party, Musk seems poised to use that influence in a radically different way.","summary":"&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, has taken a bold new step into the political arena.

Musk Has Launched America Party; Now Here Are His Biggest Challenges","text":"Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party faces significant obstacles within the entrenched two-party system of the United States, grappling with numerous challenges historically faced by third parties.\nDespite Musk’s vast personal wealth and extensive social media influence, converting online enthusiasm into a potent political force is a formidable task.\nBallot access laws\nA primary obstacle is ballot access laws. Each US state has complex and often deliberately difficult regulations for recognising political parties and allowing their candidates to appear on ballots. These requirements range from collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures from registered voters within strict deadlines to achieving certain percentages of votes in previous elections.\nFor example, in California, a new party must either register 0.33% of the state’s voters as members (approximately 75,000 people) or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. Maintaining this status necessitates ongoing efforts, such as retaining the registration threshold or securing at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race. Such state laws inherently favour the two major parties—Democrats and Republicans—rendering the establishment of a new national party a multi-year endeavour costing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees and grassroots organising.\nDuverger’s Law\nThe America Party must also contend with Duverger’s Law, a political science principle stating that plurality-rule electoral systems with single-member districts tend to produce two dominant political parties.\nThis structural reality leads voters to often favour major parties to avoid “wasting” their vote on a third-party candidate unlikely to win, even if they align more closely with the third party’s platform. This creates a powerful self-reinforcing cycle that has consistently marginalised third parties like the Green Party and Libertarian Party, despite their decades-long existence.\nFinance and organisation\nFinancial limitations and organisational infrastructure represent another daunting challenge. Although Musk’s personal fortune exceeds $350 billion, once a party attains national recognition, individual donors like Musk would be constrained by Federal Election Commission (FEC) caps on political contributions.\nCurrently, individuals can only contribute $10,000 annually to a state political party or $44,300 annually to a national party committee. Establishing a comprehensive national infrastructure—including state-level committees, staff, and volunteers across 50 states—requires sustained, widespread financial support that surpasses a single billionaire’s initial investment. Existing third parties, despite years of effort, operate on relatively modest budgets compared to the multi-billion dollar expenditures of the Democratic and Republican parties.\nBrand value\nMoreover, public perception and brand recognition are crucial. While Elon Musk is globally recognised, his public image is often polarising.\nCritics argue that his brand may be too tarnished to inspire a broad-based movement, particularly among those outside his immediate fan base or those who view him as too closely associated with specific controversial tech or social issues.\nHis recent public falling out with Donald Trump and criticisms of both major parties, though potentially appealing to some, also alienate others.\n\nLastly, the absence of a clear, broad ideological foundation beyond “anti-uniparty” sentiment could impede long-term growth. While many Americans express dissatisfaction with the two major parties, translating that generalised discontent into a cohesive political platform that attracts diverse voters across various policy issues has historically been challenging for new parties.\nThe America Party would need to articulate clear, actionable policies that resonate widely and distinguish it sufficiently from both Republicans and Democrats, without alienating potential supporters. Although Musk has suggested focusing on a few key House and Senate seats to act as a “deciding vote on contentious laws,” building a lasting political party requires more than merely holding a balance of power; it demands a shared vision and a dedicated, organised grassroots movement.\n(With agency inputs)","summary":"Despite Musk’s vast personal wealth and extensive social media influence, converting online enthusiasm into a potent political force is a formidable task","url":"https://www.news18.com/explainers/leave-well-enough-elon-musk-has-launched-america-party-now-here-are-his-biggest-challenges-9423592.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/01/Mallika-1600-x-900-px-48-2025-01-5494156d780b0363f86eb5e7f0d796e2.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 01:00:29","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.238},{"id":338668684,"title":"Opinion | Can BRICS Be Compromised As The SCO Was?","text":"On July 6, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will represent India at the BRICS Summit in Rio. At the summit, India will be joined by nine other participating nations, along with the host nation, Brazil, and observer countries. At the summit, India’s major objective is to push through its counter-terrorism agenda in light of the Pahalgam attack and the aftermath of it, which led to a conflict with the Pakistani state, and name and shame the terror-breeding nation.\nHowever, it’s not the first time India has been pushing this agenda with a similar group of nations in attendance. Last month, at the SCO defence ministers’ meeting in Qingdao, India tried to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan, only to be rebutted. Pakistan, with the help of China, forced down a counter-terror joint statement that failed to mention Pahalgam but conveniently included the struggle for independence in Balochistan, a pain point for the Pakistani state nonetheless, and conveniently labelled it terrorism. India refused to sign it. Nine of the 10 participating nations that did sign the joint statement included Iran, Russia, and China.\nThree of those nations will also be present at the BRICS summit; therefore, the question arises whether they’d still try to rebut India’s genuine counterterror agenda. Will Russia ally with China and Iran? Will China once again be allowed to steamroll through the summit? Quite plainly, the answer is no.\nFor the first time in 12 years of the BRICS summit, the Chinese President has chosen to skip the forum altogether. The decision is even more surprising given that almost all member countries are facing imminent and costly tariff wars with the United States. Does Beijing no longer have leadership ambitions? Or is it now aware that, outside of inconsequential multilateral summits such as the SCO, its flat-track bullying and bulldozing diplomacy will not work? Or it’s the fact that Xi knew that he would be upstaged by Modi, who is the guest of honour in Brazil, and chose to spare his blushes.\nWhatever the reason, Xi’s absence is telling. With a constrained Vladimir Putin appearing via video, PM Modi will be the most senior and most formidable leader present among the founding members. The centre of gravity at BRICS has decisively shifted. Unlike the SCO, this is a genuinely multipolar grouping where countries like Brazil and South Africa have robust, independent partnerships with India that act as a natural counterbalance to any Chinese overreach.\nSCO: A Stage for China’s Games\nThe charade at Qingdao was predictable. The SCO has long been China’s diplomatic playground, a place where its writ runs large and inconvenient truths are swept under the carpet. The joint statement was a masterclass in Chinese manipulation designed not to combat terror but to protect its all-weather ally, Pakistan.\nWhat’s even more appalling is that the very attack the SCO refused to condemn was enabled by Chinese technology. According to a detailed report by the ORF, militants in Kashmir are increasingly using sophisticated, military-grade Chinese hardware, such as Huawei satellite phones, encrypted communication systems, and GPS devices. China’s diplomatic cover for Pakistan at the SCO is, in reality, a cover for its own strategic footprint in the region’s terror ecosystem. It’s easy to be a bully when you own the playground.\nIt’s why the SCO fails to get a serious mention in geopolitical circles. Everyone knows it’s a rigged forum where China’s strategic interests trump any genuine commitment to collective security. But Beijing’s ability to dominate such a forum is a measure of the SCO’s weakness, not China’s strength. In the real world, among platforms of consequence, this kind of behaviour doesn’t fly.\nIndia’s Shining Moment\nBRICS is not the SCO, and Rio is not Qingdao. With Xi absent and Putin constrained, Modi arrives as the undisputed senior-most leader from the founding members. The spotlight will be on India, and for good reason. India’s economy, projected by Morgan Stanley to be the world’s fastest-growing in 2025-26, gives it the clout to match its ambitions.\nMost importantly, unlike at the SCO, India is confident that the BRICS declaration will not only condemn the Pahalgam attack but will do so in language that is “to India’s satisfaction”, backed by a consensus of partners who understand the threat of state-sponsored terror. Key partners have already offered their solidarity.\nIndia’s position is further fortified by its robust bilateral ties that serve as a powerful counterbalance to Chinese influence. The India-Brazil partnership, marked by talks of major defence pacts, including the sale of Indian Akash air defence systems, along with India’s strong relationships with South Africa and the UAE, creates a web of influence that China cannot simply bulldoze. At BRICS, India has the partners, the power, and the platform to ensure its voice is heard and its security interests are upheld.\nBut it’s not just that because India has favourable conditions, its concerns will be heard or met with interest. At the G7 summit this year in Canada, despite the geopolitical “khichdi”, which seems to be the theme wherever US President Donald Trump goes, India raised the issue, stood its ground, gathered the support needed, and pushed through with its agenda. Modi also rebuffed Trump’s claims that he was the one who made the ceasefire possible after pressing India and Pakistan on trade. And he did it directly to him on a call, after the US President couldn’t be bothered to stay for the entire summit.\nThe point of it is that India is not going to be bullied into signing or accepting narratives. India will carve its agenda, it will rise for itself and the Global South, and it will make itself heard on the world’s stage, and it will do so at a forum that keeps the West on the edge of their seats, unlike the SCO, which does not even get a whisper.","summary":"BRICS is not the SCO, and Rio is not Qingdao.

Responding to criticism in the comments under her post, Luna added, “The Ukraine bots are big mad about this one.”\n\n“All of a sudden these pro-war shills are religion experts and also telepathic, as they are CERTAIN not one Christian went to those churches to worship God. Imagine if we did that in the States. Hypocrites,” she said.\n\nAccording to Ukraine Oversight, an official US government portal tracking aid disbursements, Washington allocated a total of $182.8 billion in assistance to Ukraine between 2022 and the end of 2024.\n\nIn May, President Donald Trump expressed concern over what he described as billions of dollars being wasted on Ukraine aid. He said Congress was “very upset about it” and that lawmakers were demanding answers about how the money was being spent.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon reportedly halted shipments of certain weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, citing the need to review remaining stockpiles as part of Trump’s ‘America First’ policy.\n\nKiev’s persecution of the canonical Orthodox Church has received limited attention from US politicians and public figures. In late May, American journalist Tucker Carlson raised the issue in an interview with former Ukrainian MP Vadim Novinsky.\n\n“I think very few Americans understand the degree to which the Ukrainian government under Zelensky has persecuted the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,” Carlson said during the broadcast.\n\nYears of state pressure on the church have included the arrests of clergymen and raids on monasteries, including a high-profile incident at the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, where religious relics are kept.\n\nLast year, Zelensky signed legislation allowing the government to ban religious organizations deemed affiliated with so-called “aggressor” states, effectively targeting the UOC. Earlier this week, he also stripped the church’s senior bishop, Metropolitan Onufry, of his citizenship, citing his previously acquired Russian passport.","summary":"US Representative Anna Paulina Luna has vowed to oppose military aid to Ukraine and demanded Kiev “negotiate for peace” \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621054-no-weapons-ukraine-christian-persecution/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/6869a17785f5405c4c1668fd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:59:37","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":338668896,"title":"Iran's Supreme Leader Makes First Public Appearance Since War","text":"Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei emerged from hiding Saturday to attend a religious ceremony, marking his first public appearance since the 12-day war between Israel and Iran began.Why It MattersKhamenei's public reappearance signals a potential shift in Iran's posture following a devastating conflict that saw U.S. forces bomb three key nuclear sites and resulted in over 900 Iranian deaths.His decision to emerge from what sources describe as \"bunker hiding\" demonstrates either increased confidence in his security or the political necessity of showing strength to his people during a significant religious observance.The timing coincides with Iran's controversial suspension of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reports of major internet disruptions across the country, suggesting ongoing tensions and potential preparations for future diplomatic or military developments.What To KnowThe 86-year-old leader appeared at a mourning ceremony on the eve of Ashoura at a mosque next to his office and residence in Tehran, where state television showed him waving and nodding to a chanting crowd that rose to its feet upon his entrance.Khamenei's absence during the recent conflict had suggested heightened security concerns for the Iranian leader, who maintains final authority on all state matters. The ceremony was held under heavy security, with Iranian officials including the Parliament speaker in attendance. There was no immediate report of any public statement made during the event.The 12-day war began when Israel launched strikes fearing Iran was developing atomic weapons, targeting defense systems, military officials, and atomic scientists. In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, with most intercepted, killing 28 people. The U.S. subsequently bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, which President Donald Trump described as \"total obliteration.\"Iran has acknowledged serious damage to its nuclear facilities and denied access to U.N. inspectors. On Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a law suspending cooperation with the IAEA, after parliament voted in favor of the bill.The ceremony Khamenei attended commemorates the 7th century martyrdom of Prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein, a pivotal event in Shiite Islam that created the historic rift between Sunni and Shiite Muslims.What People Are SayingU.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said last week: \"It is unacceptable that Iran chose to suspend cooperation with the IAEA at a time when it has a window of opportunity to reverse course and choose a path of peace and prosperity.\"She added: \"Iran must cooperate fully, without further delay.\"President Donald Trump addressed the Iranian Supreme Leader during a White House press conference in June: \"Look, you're a man of great faith. A man who's highly respected in his country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell.\"Supreme Leader Khamenei in previous statement said Tehran had delivered a: \"Slap to America's face\" by striking a U.S. air base in Qatar, warning against further attacks by the U.S. or Israel.What Happens NextThe extent of damage to Iran's nuclear facilities remains unclear, as does whether enriched uranium or centrifuges were moved before the attacks.Iran's willingness to continue negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program is now in question, especially after rejecting Trump's offer to restart diplomacy immediately.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first public appearance since the 12-day Israel-Iran war, attending a ceremony.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/iran-supreme-leader-ayatollah-public-appearance-since-war-2095057","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2677546/supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:58:26","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":338668066,"title":"Musk announces 'America Party' founding","text":"July 5 (UPI) -- Entrepreneur and former Department of Government Efficiency Director Elon Musk on Saturday announced the creation of the America Party.\n\nMusk says the American Party will restore democracy and freedom after suggesting he would a new political party amid a high-profile feud with President Donald Trump.\n\nHe conducted a straw poll on his social media platform X on Friday, Politico reported.\n\n\"By a factor or 2 to 1, you want a new political party, and you shall have it,\" Musk said Saturday afternoon in a post on X. \n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,\" Musk continued. \"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"\n\nMusk suggested the political party would focus on two or three Senate seats and between eight and 10 House seats during the 2026 mid-term elections, CNBC reported.\n\nGiven the narrow margins among House and Senate majorities in recent years, a small number of seats in both chambers would be enough to significantly influence legislation, Musk said.\n\nHe said the party would caucus independently of Democrats and Republicans but enter into legislative discussions with both.\n\nMusk did not say if he registered the party with the Federal Election Commission, but an \"America Party\" search of the FEC website did not produce any results on Saturday.","summary":"Entrepreneur and former Department of Government Efficiency Director Elon Musk on Saturday announced the creation of the America Party.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/07/05/elon-musk-america-party/2311751762141/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2311751762141/2025/1/080bb147924dce2a68ca88e7e1dd900e/v1.5/Musk-announces-America-Party-founding.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:48:43","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.411},{"id":338670992,"title":"BRICS agree to joint statement ahead of Rio leaders summit","text":"Negotiators have been laying final groundwork for the leaders’ summit throughout the week. (AFP pic)RIO DE JANEIRO: Diplomats from the BRICS group of developing nations have agreed on a joint declaration of their leaders at a summit in Rio de Janeiro this week, three people familiar with the talks said on Saturday.The shared statement, which a gathering of their foreign ministers failed to achieve in April, underscores the group’s commitment to consensus despite its quickly expanding ranks.The group of major emerging economies expanded last year beyond Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.That has added diplomatic weight to the gathering, which aspires to speak for developing nations in the Global South but also increased the complexity of reaching common terms on contentious geopolitical issues.Negotiators preparing for the leaders summit over the past week had struggled to find shared language about the bombardment of Gaza, the Israel-Iran conflict and Africa’s representative in a proposed reform of the UN Security Council, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak openly.To overcome differences among African nations on the continent’s Security Council representative, the group agreed to endorse seats for Brazil and India while leaving open which country should represent Africa’s interests, a person familiar with the talks said.The source said the group had agreed to sharpen its tone on conflicts in the Middle East, strengthening language beyond an April note expressing “serious concern”.On trade, sources said the BRICS will continue their thinly veiled criticism of US tariff policy under President Donald Trump from the April ministerial meeting, where they warned against “unjustified unilateral protectionist measures, including the indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs.”","summary":"The group finally reached a joint statement, highlighting its push for consensus despite growing membership.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/07/06/brics-agree-to-joint-statement-ahead-of-rio-leaders-summit/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ef9fd0bc-brics-summit-venue-06072025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:46:54","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.166},{"id":338667476,"title":"Mel C shares sweet tribute to Spice Girls bandmate Mel B on her wedding day despite not attending - but there's still no word from Geri Halliwell","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Our marriage was falling apart... if only we'd known the terrifying reason why.'

Kerr County has been hit the hardest, accounting for 43 deaths, followed by Travis County with 4, Burnet County with 3, and Kendall County with 1. Among the victims are at least 15 children, many of whom were attending Camp Mystic on the banks of the Guadalupe River. The flooding was triggered by an unprecedented surge in the Guadalupe River, which rose more than 26 feet (8 meters) in just a few hours before sunrise Friday. The flash floods tore through homes, camps, and roads in Kerr County, as officials reported that several months’ worth of rain fell in under two hours. At least four young girls from Camp Mystic, Renee Smajstrla, Janie Hunt, Sarah Marsh, and Lila Bonner, have been confirmed among the dead, devastating their families and communities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared Sunday, July 6, as a statewide Day of Prayer to honor the lives lost and support those affected by the tragedy. He noted that over 850 people have been rescued so far, with search and rescue teams continuing operations around the clock. Also read: Georgetown, Texas Floods: San Gabriel River Overflows, Triggers Evacuations In Williamson County | Watch \"Recovery efforts are a 24-hour operation,\" Abbott said, emphasizing that all state agencies have been directed to prioritize life-saving measures. According to officials, search crews are operating in extremely dangerous conditions, retrieving survivors from trees and other high-ground locations. President Donald Trump confirmed via social media that the Trump administration is actively working with state and local authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the administration will honor the federal disaster declaration signed by Governor Abbott.

(AFP pic)AIX-EN-PROVENCE: France’s finance minister said Saturday he hoped the EU would reach a deal on tariffs with Washington “this weekend”.EU and US negotiators are holding talks over the weekend as Brussels chases a deal before a July 9 deadline to avoid the return of steep tariffs.“On tariffs, it could all be decided this weekend,” said French Finance Minister Eric Lombard.“If not, Europe will undoubtedly have to respond more vigorously to restore the balance,” Lombard said at an economic forum in southern France.If the EU does not clinch an agreement with the US by Wednesday next week, higher levies will snap back in and unleash economic pain on the bloc.Without a deal, the default levy on EU imports is set to double to 20% or even higher – US President Donald Trump having threatened at one point to apply 50% duties.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday that Brussels sought an agreement in principle, which would mean further talks would be necessary on the details.But the commission believes that whatever happens, an imbalance in trade measures between the EU and the US will remain.Lombard said it was “essential” to protect its industry from the US and China.“Imagine the world as a playground where everyone is playing… and following the rules,” he said.“And then three bullies come along and don’t follow any rules, they knock over the game tables and push around the children who were playing nicely. That’s the world of predators,” he said, referring to the US, Russia and China.On China, Lombard said that existing tariffs on steel and the automotive industry were not sufficient.“We need to do it across all our industrial sectors. Otherwise, China’s policy of maintaining a production capacity exceeding 50% of the global market share in each industrial sector will destroy our industry,” he added.","summary":"EU and US negotiators are in weekend talks as Brussels pushes to strike a deal before July 9 to avoid steep tariffs.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/07/06/france-hopes-eu-will-reach-tariff-deal-with-us-this-weekend/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/f2ec8ef6-eric-lombard-france-march-2025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:35:27","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":338669544,"title":"Why this dope smoking, privately educated Marxist - set to be New York's next mayor - could bankrupt the once proud city I call home: TOM LEONARD","text":"The New York subway system has never exactly been a cosy place, but the past six months have seen two crimes take place there that appalled even its most hardened travellers. Three days before Christmas, a man approached a woman sleeping on a stationary F train at Coney Island, Brooklyn, at around 7.30am – and set her on fire. Surveillance video captured Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, an undocumented Guatemalan migrant, nonchalantly walking up to 57-year-old Debrina Kawam and using a cigarette lighter to ignite her clothes.\n\nHorrific CCTV footage showed Zapera-Calil – who told police he was a heavy drinker and smoker of a synthetic cannabis known as ‘spice’ or ‘K2’ – sitting on a station bench and watching as the woman burned to death.\n\nThe killing was the 11th in New York’s subways last year, the highest figure in decades, and it came just after state governor Kathy Hochul had sent 1,000 National Guard troops into the subway system to maintain public order after a rise in crimes.\n\nNo soldiers were around to stop an even more disgusting incident in April this year, when CCTV captured a man sodomising a corpse on an empty train in Manhattan’s Financial District at around midnight. Felix Rojas, 44, another undocumented migrant, was charged with attempting to rape an unresponsive Jorge Gonzalez, 37, who was later determined to have been dead. Rojas allegedly first robbed his victim then returned 25 minutes later to have sex with his body.\n\nViolent crime is rising sharply in the subway – last year’s felony assaults were triple the figure in 2009. Thanks to New York’s Left-wing policy of drastically restricting the courts’ practice of demanding cash bail for less serious crimes, many repeat offenders are now simply released – while many violent offences are treated as ‘misdemeanours’, even though they can still be vicious attacks.\n\nAnd even if commuters and tourists on the subway don’t find themselves becoming a new statistic, they’re still highly likely to experience so-called ‘quality of life’ offences such as aggressive begging and open drug use, along with seriously mentally-ill people living permanently on the subway – problems to which New York police nowadays turn a blind eye.\n\nThe situation is not much better above ground where, thanks to the obsession of New York’s prosecutors with cutting incarceration rates (especially among ethnic minorities whom they claim experience discrimination in the justice system), has led to a crime upsurge that included a shoplifting epidemic prompting retailers to start locking away even toothpaste and shampoo.\n\nAnd, as I wrote in these pages last year, it also sparked a terrifying spate of random street attacks involving men randomly punching young women in the face as hard as they can.\n\nThe streets in the city where I have lived for 18 years now reek of illicit cannabis. Since 2021, the drug – now conclusively shown to cause schizophrenia and other serious mental health disorders – has been legal.\n\nBut rather than being purchased from licensed shops as pro-drug advocates imagined, it is mostly sourced from hundreds of unlicensed ‘smoke shops’ that sell it far cheaper than official dispensaries and have made a mockery of attempts to remove criminals from the trade.\n\nAs with the city’s ‘progressive’ criminal justice reforms, New York’s legalisation of weed was appallingly executed because it was designed chiefly to address the disproportionate jailing of black people for cannabis crimes.\n\nPoliticians pushed ahead with an absurd and impractical system in which the first people offered licences to sell the drug were those previously jailed for cannabis offences.\n\nNew York’s litany of problems caused by its Democrat leaders continues with its status as a ‘sanctuary city’ for illegal migrants, meaning it cooperates as little as possible with federal authorities searching for those with no right to be in the US.\n\nThis piece of do-goodery has backfired spectacularly since 2023, when the Biden administration’s wholesale lifting of border restrictions prompted a tidal wave of Latin American migrants to cross the Mexican border. Around 10,000 a month were soon arriving in New York, completely overwhelming the city’s ability to house and support them. Some 550,000 are now estimated to live here.\n\nCrime, drugs, migrants – and let’s not forget New York’s crumbling infrastructure, from criminally rutted roads to the decrepit subway – experts say it will take years to clear up the mess, assuming there is a political will do it.\n\nWhich brings me to a high-minded young politician who may soon be in charge of New York City and will – many well-established residents fear – only make its problems far, far worse.\n\nSo much worse, say those with long memories, that he might drag the Big Apple back to the nightmarish years of the 1970s, when the city’s fiscal crisis was so dire it nearly went bankrupt.\n\nA toxic combination of chronic overspending, economic downturn and investors losing confidence in the city led to it essentially defaulting on $1.6 billion in debts. Crime rocketed along with arson and unemployment – a bleak and violent dystopia captured in Hollywood films such as Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.\n\nNeedless to say, Zohran Mamdani – proud socialist, savvy social media user and charismatic darling of the wokerati – remembers none of these horrors, as he is just 33. However he has just pulled off a stunning and entirely unexpected victory in the election primary to become the official Democrat candidate for New York mayor.\n\nThat means, barring a major upset, he seems set to be elected to the hugely influential and powerful post in November.\n\nTo do so, Mamdani will probably have to defeat the incumbent mayor, Eric Adams – accused of accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions – and ex-New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who has been accused of sexual harassment by 13 women. Both men deny the claims, but their campaigns have nevertheless been tarnished as a result.\n\nAn obscure member of the New York state assembly for four years before he ran for mayor, Mamdani seemingly came from nowhere. His victory has been hailed as a ‘political earthquake’, that might shake up the Democratic Party across the US.\n\nA Shia Muslim born in Uganda and of Indian extraction, Mamdani moved to New York with his parents when he was seven and his father became a professor at Columbia University. He became an American citizen only seven years ago.\n\nSteeped in the ‘privilege’ he says he stands against, he is the privately educated son of a successful film director mother and ultra-Left-wing father, whose post-colonialist views are required reading in many UK university politics and history departments.\n\nMamdani’s own beliefs seem even more radical. He was educated at Manhattan’s Bank Street School for Children, where annual fees range from £27,500 to £50,000, and Bowdoin College, a private ‘liberal arts’ college in Maine.\n\nIn 2021, he gave a speech to the Young Democratic Socialists of America in which said that the ‘end goal’ was ‘seizing the means of production’ – language straight out of Karl Marx – while he has also described capitalism as ‘theft’. No wonder Donald Trump characterises him as a ‘100 per cent communist lunatic’ and a ‘total nut-job’.\n\nTo be fair to Mamdani, he does at least admit he is a nepo-baby. As a younger man, he boasted the sort of connections that allowed him to recruit the well-known TV chef and actress Madhur Jaffrey to appear in a rap video he made when his ambitions ran in that direction.\n\nHis CV – which includes being a fanatical Arsenal supporter and keen cricketer – hardly screams horny-handed son of toil, although he does live in a small apartment in Queens.\n\nIn a sign of how political campaigning is shifting, Mamdani benefited enormously from putting out endless slick campaign videos on social media, some published within minutes of being filmed and going viral instantly, leading some to call him ‘a TikTok savant’.\n\nFellow millennials were also no doubt impressed that Leftie celebrity fans like the supermodel Emily Ratajkowski and Sex And The City actress Cynthia Nixon backed him, the former joining other young women in donning ‘Hot Girls For Zohran’ T-shirts.\n\nThe bearded Mamdani, who won the ‘Biggest Smile’ prize at middle school, has inevitably drawn breathless comparisons to Barack Obama.\n\nHe has virtually no relevant experience for the job but his younger fans hardly care when they find him so handsome and charismatic. Sadly for the female ones, he’s married, to 27-year-old Syrian Rama Duwaji, a fiercely pro-Palestinian artist.\n\nLike innumerable socialists before him, he has made endless promises – money no object – to New Yorkers struggling to afford to live in an expensive city.\n\nHis long list includes free public transport, free college tuition, universal free childcare, freezing rents for two million people and a $60 million (£44 million) scheme to set up government-run grocery stores that he says will be exempt from paying rent or property taxes and so be able to sell food more cheaply.\n\nHe’s called for a subsidised housing building programme that alone would cost $100 billion (£73 billion) over ten years.\n\nWhen it comes to crime, he previously endorsed plans to ‘defund the police’ amid the Black Lives Matter riots in 2020. He’s even suggested violence is an ‘artificial construction’ (not so ‘artificial’, perhaps to someone who’s been shot or stabbed).\n\nAs the health risks of cannabis have become clearer, some New York politicians who backed legalisation are starting to reconsider their positions. Not Mamdani, who has never denied reports that he enjoys cannabis personally. Implying that political opponents who don’t share his enthusiasm for the drug may be racist, he accused them of using ‘coded language’ when criticising cannabis smokers.\n\nOpponents say one of his stupidest ideas is to convert empty retail spaces in the subway system\n\ninto city-run facilities for the homeless, thereby further worsening, they say, the problem of violently mentally ill people roaming\n\nthe network.\n\nOn the delicate question of how to pay for everything, Mamdani has an easy answer – higher taxes. He said he intends to ‘shift the tax burden’ to ‘richer, whiter neighbourhoods’, an ugly remark that sparked accusations of racism.\n\nPredictably, New York’s business leaders have said they are ‘terrified’ of his rise. Senior Democrats of the old guard – including governor Kathy Hochul, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer – have refrained from endorsing him.\n\nMamdani believes that billionaires ‘shouldn’t exist’ – but the truth is he needs the rich New Yorkers, who haven’t already fled to lower-tax states such as Florida and Texas, to pay the taxes that will fund his vast spending plans.\n\nHe hasn’t panicked only businesspeople. New York has more than a million Jews, 12 per cent of its population, who typically vote Democrat. But they are deeply wary of their mayor being a Muslim who relishes his record of anti-Israel activism.\n\nAlthough he insists he is not anti-Semitic, Mamdani has questioned Israel’s existence as a Jewish state and has repeatedly refused to condemn the phrase ‘globalise the intifada’, which many believe is an open incitement to violence. Some Jewish commentators have said many Jews will feel they have to leave New York, so long a safe haven for them, if Mamdani takes over.\n\nThere is no shortage of experts arguing that Mamdani’s ideas are more likely to hurt the poorest New Yorkers than help them.\n\nFreezing rents, for instance, typically discourages landlords from putting properties on the market and makes it less likely they can maintain them properly. Making public transport free has been shown to encourage vagrants and troublemakers to use it, while cutting police numbers primarily hits poorer, high-crime areas.\n\nUS political commentator Rob Henderson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, calls Mamdani a ‘poster child for luxury beliefs’: that is, opinions that make wealthy, privileged people feel good at very little cost, but make life difficult for the poorest.\n\nAs for Trump, he seems to be rubbing his hands with glee at what Mamdani running New York would likely do to the Democrats’ reputation. ‘We’ve had radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,’ said the president, a long-time New Yorker.\n\nFor once, many Democrats may be inclined to agree with him.","summary":"The Big Apple has become a crime-ridden hellscape thanks to ruinous woke policies on policing and immigration.

NORAD scrambled a F-16 fighter aircraft, which performed a standard “headbutt maneuver” to alert the pilot and safely escort the aircraft out of the restricted zone.\n\nThe interception was part of a broader alert response, as Saturday saw a total of five separate TFR violations in the Bedminster area – including three prior to the “headbutt” incident and one more later in the day. NORAD did not release additional details about the aircraft or pilots involved.\n\n“Pilots, a reminder to check FAA NOTAMs before you fly!” NORAD posted on X, referring to Notice to Air Missions bulletins issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency highlighted FAA NOTAMs 1353, 1358, 2246 and 2247 as especially relevant for flights near Bedminster.\n\nThe command warned that pilots are responsible for verifying TFR zones before takeoff and emphasized that its layered air defense system – comprising radars, satellites and fighter jets – remains active in detecting and responding to unauthorized incursions.\n\nTrump has made Bedminster one of his main residences since returning to office in January, with the FAA frequently designating restricted airspace in the vicinity whenever the president is present.

A Musk-backed party could potentially undermine Trump by attracting vital votes from his base. Musk has a distinct following, particularly among tech-savvy, libertarian-leaning, and anti-establishment voters, who often overlap with Trump’s supporters. These groups share a common disdain for traditional political structures, perceived governmental overreach, and a desire for disruptive change.\nIf a “Musk party” gains traction and fields candidates in key races, it could draw away independent voters, disillusioned Republicans, and new participants in the political process who might otherwise support Trump. In closely contested elections, even a slight shift in votes can be decisive, possibly preventing Trump from securing a clear majority. This development could further fragment the conservative or populist vote, complicating the path to victory for any major party candidate.\nCould be ‘release’ for conservative dissent\nConversely, a Musk-aligned party might inadvertently benefit Trump in certain scenarios. If the new party’s appeal primarily attracts voters who are unlikely to support the Democratic Party but are also dissatisfied with the Republican Party, it could serve as a pressure release for internal dissent within the broader conservative movement.\nBy offering an alternative for those feeling unrepresented by traditional Republicanism, it might prevent them from disengaging from politics entirely or casting protest votes for a more ideologically distant third-party candidate. In a general election, if a “Musk party” draws more support from the anti-establishment or populist wing that Trump has cultivated, its presence might dilute opposition to Trump’s main challenger rather than eroding Trump’s core support significantly.\nVehicle for experimentation?\nAdditionally, a new political entity backed by Musk could experiment with innovative political strategies, technological integrations, or fundraising models.\nIf successful, these approaches could be adopted, adapted, or even co-opted by Trump’s campaign or the broader Republican Party, enhancing their capabilities.\nThe ultimate impact depends on the new party’s platform, the calibre of its candidates, Musk’s level of financial and public involvement, and the prevailing political climate.","summary":"Musk's entry into the political arena through the formation of the America Party introduces a complex dynamic with significant implications for Trump","url":"https://www.news18.com/explainers/elon-musks-third-party-intervention-in-us-politics-will-it-help-or-hurt-donald-trump-9423590.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/Elon-Musk-exits-Trump-administration-2025-05-58121616f2e8c50966de509b2de93585.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:27:58","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.403},{"id":338668662,"title":"NORAD intercepts plane in Trump’s Bedminster no-fly zone: 'No excuses'","text":"A fighter jet scrambled by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted a civilian aircraft Saturday afternoon after it entered restricted airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, where President Donald Trump is spending the holiday weekend.

The aircraft was safely escorted out of the area after a standard \"headbutt\" maneuver was used to get the pilot’s attention.

The letters, scheduled for Monday, each state a bespoke tariff rate ranging from baseline 10 per cent to significantly higher levels, with the tariffs set to become enforceable from 1 August unless an interim agreement is struck.\n\nThe move follows Trump’s decision not to extend a 90‑day suspension on steep global tariffs beyond 9 July, the original “Liberation Day” pause date, effectively placing several governments under pressure to secure deals or face punitive duties. The policy is framed as “take‑it‑or‑leave‑it”, and officials noted it would apply even to countries engaged in negotiations, including India and Japan.\n\nIndia–U. S. discussions, extending into Monday in Washington, have centred on tariff reductions, with agriculture, dairy and auto component sectors emerging as key sticking points. Indian negotiators, led by chief negotiator Rajesh Aggarwal and Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, have emphasised the need to protect sensitive domestic sectors while opening access for U. S. exports.\n\nOn an economic front, India has offered tariff reductions on non‑agricultural goods such as leather, textiles and footwear, while maintaining stringent restrictions on genetically modified crops and dairy, driven by deep‑seated domestic concerns. The U. S., in turn, is pressing for greater access in these sectors in exchange for tariff relief for Indian goods.\n\nTariffs were originally introduced in early April under a “Liberation Day” plan that imposed a 10 per cent universal tariff plus additional reciprocal tariffs tailored to each country. Although a legal challenge briefly halted the policy, it was reinstated on appeal, leaving the 9 July date intact.\n\nWith only the United Kingdom and Vietnam having secured agreements so far—UK retaining a 10 per cent baseline tariff and Vietnam receiving relief in the 20–46 per cent range—the U. S. is now applying heightened pressure on major partners like India, Japan and the EU to finalise deals before the deadline.\n\nIndia’s economy has proven resilient: exports to the U. S. rose by 11.6 per cent to $86.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, even as U. S. imports from India slipped slightly in May, down to $3.63 billion from $3.85 billion a year earlier. Nevertheless, both nations face trade imbalances and sector‑specific challenges—India’s auto components and steel sectors remain particularly sensitive in discussions.\n\nEconomists have criticised Trump’s reciprocal tariffs as excessively broad, arguing that they often surpass foreign protective barriers and may have adverse effects on global markets. Financial analysts caution that failure to lock in an agreement could trigger jitters across equity and bond markets, though upbeat sentiment remains in the near term.\n\nThe outcome of India–U. S. negotiations is being closely observed by markets and policymakers alike. A final interim deal—focused exclusively on goods—could be signed as soon as 8 July, narrowly averting the threat of tariffs. If adopted, it would mark a pivotal step toward a broader bilateral trade pact, envisioned to double trade to $500 billion by 2030.","summary":"President Donald Trump has authorised dispatch of letters to twelve nations outlining new reciprocal tariffs, marking a decisive turn as bilateral negotiations with India intensify ahead of his self&#x2011;imposed tariff deadline.

Trump even suggested that his office would look into possibly deporting Musk, a South African immigrant.Musk's July 4 poll on X came the same day Trump signed the bill into law.The CEO said on his social media platform that one way the new party could work is to focus on winning just a handful of Senate seats and House districts that could serve as the \"deciding vote\" on \"contentious laws,\" given the \"razor-thin legislative margins\" in Congress.Musk and a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Musk's back-and-forth regarding his involvement in political affairs has been followed by volatile times for the CEO of Tesla, his EV company.Wall Street analysts, including Tesla bull Dan Ives, have said that Musk's politics could lead the company astray if the chief executive doesn't snap back into focus.Earlier in June, Baird analysts downgraded the Tesla stock, noting that the Musk-Trump spat adds \"uncertainty to TSLA's outlook.","summary":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been a harsh critic of President Donald Trump's spending bill, which was signed into law on July 4.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-party-2025-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/6869b2ed85e81483682d6def?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 00:17:43","author":"Lloyd Lee","authors":["Lloyd Lee"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":338663476,"title":"Maisie Smith lifts the lid on marriage plans with boyfriend Max George... but her mum insists she's 'too young' to wed just yet","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Our marriage was falling apart... if only we'd known the terrifying reason why.'

Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”\n\nMr Musk offered no further details on the announcement.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX billionaire has been publicly toying with the idea of forming his own party in recent weeks after his dramatic breakup with US President Donald Trump over the “Big Beautiful Bill”. \n\nMr Musk, who exited the Trump administration in May after spearheading the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, had lobbied for weeks for Republicans to vote against the “utterly insane and destructive” tax and spending bill.\n\nThe nearly 900-page bill narrowly passed the Senate on Thursday and was signed into law by Mr Trump on Friday, America’s July 4 Independence Day holiday.\n\n“Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system! Should we create the America Party?” Mr Musk wrote in his poll question on Friday.\n\nHe went on to suggest that “one way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts”.\n\n“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” he wrote.\n\nMr Musk had expressed fierce opposition to the spending legislation, and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting “debt slavery”.\n\nHe quickly vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $US3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.\n\n“They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Mr Musk threatened last weekend. “Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people.”\n\nA few hours later, he posted, “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.”\n\nAfter Mr Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill, Mr Trump threatened to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.\n\n“We’ll have to take a look,” the President told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Mr Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.","summary":"Elon Musk says he has launched a new political party “to give you back your freedom” after his dramatic breakup with Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/the-america-party-elon-musk-says-hes-formed-new-political-party/news-story/1c08d363d04f244aa1ffb88d297a03ad?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0f8f0dfbcb37d5c2b70fc93cca866dbd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:58:52","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.143},{"id":338661724,"title":"Elon Musk Starts New Political Party Following Major Disagreement with Trump","text":"Support Our Cause\n\nSupport Our Cause\n\n Search for:\n\n HomeCelebCeleb NewsElon Musk Starts New Political Party Following Major Disagreement with Trump\n\nCeleb News \n\nElon Musk Starts New Political Party Following Major Disagreement with Trump\n\n \n\n Up next \n\n \n\n \n\nI’ve Swapped My Premium Bonds for Lottery Tickets\n\n Published on 06 July 2025\n\n Internewscast \n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\n You May Also Like \n\n \n\nCeleb News \n\nTrump Warns of 68% Tax Hike if Senate Doesn’t Approve Crucial Bill \n\n President Donald Trump again pressured Senate Republicans to pass his massive spending…\n\nInternewscast\nJuly 5, 2025\n\n \n\nCeleb News \n\n“Spitting Image Returns: Get Ready for Hilarious Parodies Featuring Prince Harry, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Angela Rayner” \n\nInternewscast\nJuly 5, 2025\n\n \n\nCeleb News \n\nTrump Warns Musk with Potential DOGE Move \n\n Donald Trump has threatened to turn the Department of Government Efficiency on…\n\nInternewscast\nJuly 5, 2025\n\n \n\nCeleb News \n\nTrump Issues Threat of Deportation Against Musk \n\n President Donald Trump said he is open to deporting Elon Musk and…\n\nInternewscast\nJuly 5, 2025\n\n \n\nRapid Surge in Residents Overwhelms Conservative City \n\n A town in Florida, once recognized for its vast orange groves, picturesque… \n\nInternewscast\nJuly 6, 2025 \n\n \n\nLocal news \n\nFamilies report that several campers perished in devastating Texas flooding \n\n AUSTIN (KXAN) – Several young girls attending Camp Mystic, a cherished summer… \n\nInternewscast\nJuly 6, 2025 \n\n \n\nFood For Soul \n\nRhapsody Of Realities 6 July 2025 – Focus On What Truly Matters \n\n Rhapsody Of Realities 6 July 2025 By Pastor Chris Oyakhilome (Christ Embassy):… \n\nInternewscast\nJuly 6, 2025 \n\n \n\nBusiness \n\nI’ve Swapped My Premium Bonds for Lottery Tickets \n\n I have now cashed in all my Premium Bonds.

Email: john.james@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM HUSSEY and JOHN JAMES \n Published:00:24 BST, 6 July 2025 |Updated:00:43 BST, 6 July 2025 \n\nA couple who cleared out their retirement savings to build an illegal off-grid cabin in one of Britain's most protected national parks say they are 'devastated' after planners ordered they knock it down. \nAndrew and Debbie Melbourne insist they knew 'nothing' and were 'led in blind' about planning laws preventing the construction of their 1,200 sq ft fully insulated spruce cabin which boasts stunning views over the South Downs. \nFollowing a complex planning investigation and abject fury from neighbours, the couple were pursued through the courts and now have two months to knock the vast single-storey structure down or face jail. \nSpeaking to MailOnline at their now partially-dismantled cabin near Waterlooville, in Hampshire, Debbie broke down in tears as she said: 'It would have allowed us to foresee our dream. It was something for our boys and a legacy. \n'Normal people like us don't know the laws of the land. At no point ever were we told about Article 4 restrictions or that this was in the national park.' \nAndrew, 56, a former music teacher, added: 'We were led in blind basically. It's absolutely devastating, we spent two years researching what we could and couldn't put on the land. \n'There were no disclosures that we were on the South Downs National Park. If we'd known we wouldn't have bought it. Absolutely I regret it, I wouldn't have done it, I've lost all my inheritance through this. \n'We've had loads of grief from the council, lies from the council. Half a dozen people up on the other side don't like what we're doing. I was a teacher in the area and they just want to discredit my name.' \n\nAndrew and Debbie Melbourne insist they knew 'nothing' and were 'led in blind' about planning laws\n\nThe illegal off-grid cabin was erected in one of Britain's most protected national parks\n\nThe couple were pursued through the courts and now have two months to knock the vast single-storey structure down or face jail\n\nAndrew and Deborah Melbourne built the fully insulated home on their land west of Lovedean Lane in Waterlooville, a viewpoint across the South Downs National Park\nThe couple purchased their half-acre plot on land off Lovedean Lane last year for around £20,000 before buying a German-made prefabricated log cabin online for £25,000. \nThe site is one of over 80 individual plots on a controversial land banking scheme owned by Gladwish Land Sales, who once had their name emblazoned across a whopping 31 Non-League football teams and courted criticism in the early noughties through their fan-targeted matchday programme ads. \nThe concept sees developers buy a field before dividing it into smaller parcels and selling those off to buyers who are often told they will get planning in the future which may not be granted. \nAndrew said he had never heard of land banking before and said he bought the land privately from the vendor. \nThe dad-of-two, who plays the trombone in local Ska and Jazz bands, insists there were no disclosures on the plot being inside a National Park or it being subject to an Article 4, which removes permitted development rights which allow certain types of minor building works to take place. \n'We had no idea we couldn't do anything on this land, we had no idea it was part of the South Downs National Park, the maps are quite ambiguous, they are not very clear,' Andrew added.\nA quick Google search of the South Downs National Park boundaries takes you to an interactive map titled 'Do I live in the National Park?', it shows the Melbournes' plot inside the boundary. \nBuilding began without planning permission in April last year and saw the couple level a vast area at the top of their plot where the cabin now sits. Andrew reckons they removed well over ten tons of mostly chalk soil. \n'The whole idea was to start up a community garden, we wanted to put in the lodge so people could use it while working here,' Andrew claims. \nThe cabin was up in five months and the couple say it would have been totally off-grid featuring a kitchen, office space, shower rooms, living quarters and a compostable toilet with its own on-site water supply. \n\nIn order to build the cabin, the couple bulldozed the hillside and scarred the landscape\n\nA quick Google search of the South Downs National Park boundaries shows the hilltop firmly inside the park\n\nThe South Downs National Park (pictured) is England's newest national park, designated on March 31, 2010\nDespite the facilities to make the cabin habitable, the couple, who have lived in the area for 35 years, claim they had no intention of living in it. \nAs the project progressed, trees were cut down and a garden which slopes down the hill towards a bridleway was created. \nTrees, shrubs and bushes were planted with the intention of creating a Japanese 'miyawaki forest' that would grow quickly into a miniature dense woodland.\nA road leading from an entrance gate up the side of the hill and to the cabin was also carved into the hillside without planning permission. \nIt didn't take long before planners from East Hampshire District Council and the South Downs National Park Authority began issuing warnings and notices. \nBetween September 2024 and February 2025 officers served a Planning Contravention Notice, two Enforcement Notices and a Stop Notice to the Melbournes. \nDespite multiple warnings, the couple 'ploughed on regardless', as one exasperated neighbour who looks out on to the 'eyesore' cabin, said. \nThat neighbour, along with several others, had watched the 'upsetting' project unfold from their homes on Glamorgan Road, which overlooks the Melbournes cabin plot from an opposing hillside, and decided to take action. \nThey added: 'We saw them clearing the site with a mini digger and thought, hang on? On the one hand they're claiming the land is for eco purposes and bee farming but then they're pulling down trees during nesting season. \n'Every morning I make a cup of coffee, I look at that, I go to my office, I get up to get something, I look at that. I can't avoid it. \n'They had a chance to engage in a process but they've just ploughed on regardless of the planning enforcement notices. Anyone in their right mind would have sought legal advice.' \nAnother neighbour on the road said: 'The thing that galled us was that they were constantly ignoring the law, advice and notices they were issued. 'They could have gone to any one of the authorities for proper advice and they chose not to. \n'Every time somebody spoke to them and tried to get to the bottom of what they were doing they seemed to change their story.' \n\nDespite the facilities to make the cabin habitable, the couple, who have lived in the area for 35 years, claim they had no intention of living in it\n\nNeighbours say the construction of the cabin spoiled their scenic views of the countryside \nOne lady who wished to remain anonymous alleged the couple had objected to people walking along the bridleway past the cabin. 'He's obviously tried to do that to stop people looking at what he's doing,' she claimed. \nDespite some objections, one local carpenter said he didn't think the cabin was that bad, noting: 'It blends into the landscape doesn't it? It's natural isn't it? But they didn't have planning, unfortunately.' \nThe cabin was 80 per cent finished in May when the Melbournes, threatened with a High Court hearing in June, signed a legally binding contract agreeing to remove the building.\nAs part of the agreement they were ordered to remove all materials, gates, fences and other forms of development, including the groundworks and paths they'd carved out of the landscape and return the site to its original condition. \nThey were slapped with a £3,500 fine by East Hampshire District Council and told the cabin must be gone in 56 days or face a custodial sentence. The couple are in the process of dismantling the cabin and have already removed the roof and flooring. \nThe Melbournes reckon they have lost well over £50,000 on the project and get emotional when asked about their next move. \n'It was something for our boys and a legacy, it would've been great for our grandson,' says Debbie, as she wipes away tears after struggling to comprehend the situation. \nShe added: 'We have got no savings left now, we invested in something we thought would be good for the community. It's been a complete nightmare. The plot is going on the market this week. \n'We will recoup some money and maybe find another piece of land that's not in a national park.' \nAndrew added: 'We were going to retire but it's all gone sour.'\n\nThe demolition of the cabin is now firmly under way and the land will be returned to its former state \nCouncillor Angela Glass, EHDC's Portfolio Holder for Planning and Enforcement, said: 'We are delighted this legal agreement has been signed and we now expect the development to be cleared over the next couple of months.\n'This is the culmination of many months of complex legal and enforcement work by our determined team of officers to reach this position.\n'I want residents to understand that if people breach planning rules, then we have the means to take action against them.' \nCouncillor Sara Schillemore, the local ward councillor for Catherington, said: 'Residents were appalled to see this unsightly structure being erected in one of the most picturesque and valuable viewpoints in East Hampshire. \n'It's vitally important that we protect our precious landscape and residents will be thrilled to see the development removed. East Hampshire Enforcement Officers worked hard for many months to achieve this result, and I sincerely thank them.' \nTim Slaney, Director of Planning at the South Downs National Park Authority, said: 'I'm delighted we've reached a resolution to this breach of planning that was harming this wonderful nationally-designated landscape. \n'I would like to thank East Hampshire District Council which pursued this enforcement case with determination, making it clear we will not tolerate blatant breaches of planning.' \nThe agreement sets out a 56-day deadline to carry out the work. Failure to comply with this type of legal agreement can lead to enforcement proceedings in the High Court which can lead to costly legal fees and even a custodial sentence.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Devastated' couple who spent £45k inheritance on building illegal log cabin in national park say they were 'led in blind' after council orders them to demolish it\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy RUTH FRANCIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:21 BST, 6 July 2025 |Updated:00:40 BST, 6 July 2025 \n\nVicky Pattison has reportedly been offered a spot on this year's Strictly Come Dancing.\nThe reality TV star, 37, is said to have caught the attention of producers when she cheered on pal Pete Wicks from the audience during last year's series - and now bosses are keen to bring her centre stage.\nA source told The Sun: 'Vicky loved watching Pete on the series and was in awe of the detail that goes into every performance.\n'She has great energy and will no doubt be a hit with the viewers.\n'Vicky's done plenty of reality shows but is ready to be out of her comfort zone on the dance floor.'\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Strictly Come Dancing and Vicky for comment. \n\nVicky Pattison, 37, has reportedly been offered a spot on this year's Strictly Come Dancing after wowing bosses\n\nThe reality TV star is said to have caught the attention of producers when she cheered on pal Pete Wicks from the audience during last year's series \nThe Geordie lass rose to fame in 2011 on MTV's Geordie Shore, becoming known for her wild nights out and on-screen flings. \nBut Vicky turned things around and went on to be crowned I'm A Celebrity's Queen of the Jungle in 2015, a moment she's since called the 'best thing' she's ever done.\nLast year, the Newcastle-born star revealed that wouldn't say no to Strictly, but admitted dancing wasn't her strong suit. \nShe told the publication: 'When I found out Pete was doing it, I called him straight away to check he was alright. \n'Because me and him are more ‘stand in the corner, drink and have a laugh’ than the ‘centre of the dance floor’ people.'\nShe added that as she's got older, she knows she should be pushing herself out of her comfort zone.\nThe rumour comes after Strictly bosses announced the professional lineup for this year's show and revealed there will be two brand new dancers joining.\nDianne Buswell, who lifted the glitter ball in December with Chris McCausland, will be joining Nadiya Bychkova, Karen Hauer, Katya Jones, Neil Jones, Nikita Kuzmin, Gorka Marquez, Luba Mushtuk and Jowita Przystal in returning to the dance floor this September.\n\nIt is thought bosses are keen to bring her centre stage after her best mate Pete Wicks appeared on the show last year (picture with his professional partner Jowita Przystal)\n\nLast year, the Newcastle-born star revealed that she wouldn't say no to Strictly, but admitted dancing wasn't her strong suit (pictured with Pete)\n\nThe rumour comes after Strictly bosses announced the professional lineup for this year's show and revealed there will be two brand new dancers joining\n\n Strictly star mugged in Central London as 'traumatic' ordeal leaves them 'scared and helpless' \nThey will be joined by Johannes Radebe, Aljaž Škorjanec, Nancy Xu, Lauren Oakley, Michelle Tsiakkas and Vito Coppola who will all take to the floor once more alongside two new stars, who will be announced closer to the time.\nAmy Dowden, who pulled out in the opening weeks of last year's show due to a foot injury, will also be back on Strictly for 2025, as will Carlos Gu and Kai Widdrington, who didn't have a celebrity partner last year.\nDespite rumours that he might be making a return after missing out on last year's series, Giovanni Pernice will not be heading back to the ballroom this time around.\nSarah James, Executive Producer, BBC Studios said : 'The excitement is already building ahead of the new series and in addition to welcoming back our fantastic returning Pros, we are looking forward to welcoming two brand new Professional Dancers to the line up who will help bring another unforgettable series of dazzling dance and loads more besides to viewers later in 2025.'\nAs well as the pros taking part in the competition itself, all of them will be taking to the floor each week in group routines. \nMailOnline previously revealed that Strictly Come Dancing professional Karen will return to the BBC show this year.\nIt was rumoured that the programme's longest-serving dancer was axed by bosses, sparking an 'ageism' row among the cast but it has been confirmed that the star, 42, will be back as normal when the series returns in September.\nKaren, who joined the lineup in 2012, is yet to win the glitter ball trophy but has reached several finals including with celebrity partners Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing and former TOWIE star Mark Wright.\n\nVicky rose to fame in 2011 on MTV's Geordie Shore, becoming known for her wild nights out and on-screen flings, bubt has since turned her life completely around (pictured (L), Charlotte-Letitia Crosby, Rebecca Walker (Middle), Vicky and Ricci Guarnaccio)\n\nLast year, Karen was partnered with former footballer Paul Merson, 57, but the pair were eliminated in week five and the previous season the dancer performed with DJ Eddie Kadi.\nA TV source told MailOnline: 'Karen is a well loved and respected member of the Strictly cast and there's no way she would be axed, especially not because of her age.\n'She has dedicated years to the programme and can't wait to get back in the training room with a new partner in the next coming months.'\nFollowing speculation surrounding whether she would axed from the long running series due to being in her 40s, Karen spoke about not being 'threatened' by younger competitors.\nIndeed, she said performing alongside new joiners makes her feel empowered and she is 'inspired' by the younger generation.\nVicky PattisonStrictly Come DancingPete Wicks\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVicky Pattison 'set to join Strictly Come Dancing line-up after wowing bosses'\n\nAdd comment\n\n

Bush’s re-election bid resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton’s victory.\n“You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don’t like it,” one X user wrote to Musk.","summary":"Elon Musk, former ally of Donald Trump, launched the America Party to challenge the US \"one-party system.\"","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/elon-musk-launches-new-political-party-america-party-us-donald-trump-republicans-democrats-latest-news-ws-kl-9423583.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/03/Elon-Musk-Donald-Trump-Reuters-Power-Broker-Of-Washington-2025-03-988e0243f1c3059d7eac6a0a11bc5741.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:34:26","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.229},{"id":338663964,"title":"Elon Musk Leaves Trump and MAGA with a Bang And a Smile","text":"The suspense is officially over. On Saturday, July 5, 2025, Elon Musk declared the formation of a new political party, the “America Party,” with the stated aim of dismantling the perceived “uniparty” system of both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nHe dropped his political bombshell around 3:46 PM ET. “Today, the America party is formed to give you back freedom.”\n\n By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. https://t.co/9K8AD04QQN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025\n\nAnd then, he apparently sat back and enjoyed the show. Within minutes, his announcement tweet had garnered millions of views and an explosion of comments, particularly from users clearly aligned with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement that propelled President Donald Trump to power in 2016 and again in 2024.\n\nMusk appeared utterly amused by the torrent of reactions, much of which expressed outright anger and disbelief at his decision.\n\n“Elon is going to get AOC elected President,” one visibly pro-MAGA user shouted in disbelief. “Unbelievable.”\n\n Elon is going to get AOC elected President. Unbelievable. — Pro America Politics (@Pro__Trading) July 5, 2025\n\n“Yes, let’s split the Republican Party and let the Dems win. Great strategy,” another disgusted user commented, highlighting fears of a fractured conservative vote.\n\n Yes, let's split the Republican Party and let the Dems win. Great strategy 🙄 — Pray The Rosary (@PrayTheRosary12) July 5, 2025\n\n“I can’t wait for all the partisan legislation,” another commenter sarcastically remarked, anticipating gridlock.\n\n I can't wait for all the tripartisan legislation. 😂 — MAZE (@mazemoore) July 5, 2025\n\nMusk seemed to revel in the spectacle, clearly entertained by the unfolding drama. He shared his delight openly.\n\n“The replies to this announcement are comedy gold,” he exclaimed, punctuating his message with two rolling-on-the-floor laughing emojis. His reaction suggested he found the situation truly funny, ridiculous, absurd, or perhaps all three.\n\n The replies to this announcement are comedy gold 🤣🤣 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025\n\nAs is typical for the self-proclaimed “Techno King,” Musk once again commanded the spotlight during this long July 4th weekend. He orchestrated a political drama that even a seasoned Hollywood screenwriter would struggle to match in its unpredictable twists.\n\nPresident Trump, a master of attention himself, found himself reduced to a mere spectator of a show he would undoubtedly have loved to direct and star in. That starring role, for once, belonged squarely to Musk.\n\nBeyond the emojis, Musk, a virtuoso in wielding social media for maximum impact, then began to reveal more details about his new political venture. Initially dubbed “The America Party,” he quickly shortened the name to simply “America,” accompanying his message with three American flags on either side of the word. The timing was impeccable for a weekend celebrating the country’s independence, subtly reclaiming a patriotic spirit that Trump has placed at the center of his “Make America Great Again” and “America First” movements, yet doing so in his own unconventional style.\n\n 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025\n\nThe spectacle continued with the viral spread of a “snake meme,” enthusiastically shared by one of his millions of followers who routinely flatter and amplify his every move.\n\n“End the Uniparty,” the user wrote, illustrating their point with an image of a two headed snake, one head representing the Democrats and the other the Republicans.\n\nThe term “uniparty” is Musk’s consistent moniker for what he views as the indistinguishable two party political system.\n\n“Yes,” Musk immediately replied, endorsing the meme’s message.\n\n Yes https://t.co/NHJf7ZxICv — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025\n\nAnd then, there was the rocket emoji. In Musk’s characteristic digital language, this symbol signifies a “political flex”—a powerful declaration of intent. It suggests that “America,” or “The America Party,” is far from symbolic. It is, he implies, a real force, designed to exert influence and fundamentally disrupt the American political system. This move embodies his rebellious, tech driven ethos. It is his way of proclaiming that he has regained his freedom, asserting himself as unconventional and iconoclastic. For those who might have speculated that he compromised his principles by spending nearly $290 million to help Trump’s return to the White House, this is his defiant declaration: nobody owns him.\n\nIt is bravado. It is quintessential Elon Musk, who embraces the “Techno King” moniker and consistently positions himself as someone operating above conventional norms, and political parties, it seems, are no exception.\n\nIn the aftermath of this dramatic launch, many critical questions remain unanswered: What constitutes America’s detailed policy platform? Which candidates will this nascent party endorse? What specific ideals does “America” truly stand for beyond its name? What does Musk ultimately seek to achieve?\n\nBy taking on the two entrenched traditional parties, Musk appears to be seeking an exciting, seemingly impossible challenge, a motivation that has driven his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX. The lingering question, however, is whether he might be overestimating his own political influence.","summary":"The world's richest man blew up online MAGA with his new \"America Party\" and seemed to love every minute of the chaos.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-leaves-trump-and-maga-with-a-bang-and-a-smile-2000624469","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-at-Mar-a-Lago-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:33:22","author":"Luc Olinga","authors":["Luc Olinga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.223},{"id":338668742,"title":"NVIDIA becomes world's most valuable company, overtaking Apple, Microsoft","text":"NVIDIA has dethroned Apple and Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world.

His absence during the war suggested heavy security for the Iranian leader who has final say on all state matters. The 86-year-old had reportedly spent the war in a bunker as threats on his life escalated. Attending a mourning ceremony on the eve of Ashoura, Iranian state television broadcasted images of him waving to a chanting crowd in the Iranian capital of Tehran. No immediate report was available on any public statement made. US President Donald Trump had sent warnings via social media to Khamenei after inserting themselves into the Iran-Israel war by bombing three nuclear sites. Trump had said that the US knew where Khamenei was, but had no plans to kill him “at least for now.” Khamenei made a public statement on June 26, shortly before the ceasefire began. He said that Tehran had delivered a “slap to America’s face” by striking a US air base in Qatar and warned against further attacks by the US or Israel. Trump replied, in remarks to reporters and on social media: “Look, you’re a man of great faith. A man who’s highly respected in his country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell.” Iran said that more than 900 people were killed during its conflict with Israel, and thousands more were injured. It also confirmed serious damage to its nuclear facilities and subsequently denied the UN nuclear watchdog access to them. It remains unclear how badly damaged the sites were and whether Tehran has plans to continue negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme.","summary":"The Iranian Supreme Leader on Saturday made his first public appearance since the conflict between Israel and Iran began.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/06/irans-supreme-leader-makes-first-public-appearance-since-iran-israel-war-started","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/35/83/34/1440x810_cmsv2_35d8beaa-dc3d-51c8-ac86-26c4043e4199-9358334.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:27:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":338662128,"title":"Locals in seaside town where beloved grandfather died after being attacked by 'plastic gangsters' are terrified to leave their homes due to violent gangs of catapult wielding yobs","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Our marriage was falling apart... if only we'd known the terrifying reason why.'

Chillingly, foreign students and residents, including pensioners, have also been attacked. \nThe anti-social behavior has become such a feature of the town that one resident has even claimed it was a factor in his father's early death. \nPensioner Raymond Foreman, 73, died early this year after he was attacked by a gang of teenagers along the seafront. \nThe gang kicked away his walking stick and left him writhing on the floor in agony after he fell against a wall and tore tendons in his back. \nHe lay there in pain for thirty minutes until help finally arrived and was bed bound until his death just two months later. \n\nTerrified locals in a quaint seaside town claim they are terrified to go outside after dark\n\nLocals say they are being menaced by mobs of violent drunk youths who attack people and kill animals with catapults\n\nPensioner Raymond Foreman, 73, died early this year after he was attacked by a gang of teenagers along the seafront\n\nHis distraught son Andrew, 31, (left) is adamant that his death was a consequence of the attack\nHis distraught son Andrew, 31, is adamant that his death was a consequence of the attack, telling KentOnline: 'They put my father in an early grave.\n'They did damage that was inconceivable. Even if it was his time soon, which it didn't feel like it was, they hit the fast forward button on that ten-fold.'\nWhen MailOnline visited the quiet coastal idyll this week we found residents living on the edge. \nFollowing a packed meeting attended by hundreds last month, police pledged to get more officers on the street to deal with the problems. \nBut some locals say they haven't yet seen the effects. \nTaxi driver Ivan Rachev spends his working day driving through the worst areas and says he has seen it all. \nHe said: 'In the evening there's drunk people everywhere'. We work in this area; I'm a taxi driver and he's a delivery driver and most of the problems are coming from young people, the teenagers, they're making the most trouble.\n'They're breaking the windows there, they're fighting, they're stealing bikes.'\nPensioner Jim Williams, 75, told us he no longer goes out at night. \nHe said: 'We don't really go out much at night, but we have heard that there's a lot of stuff going on.'\n'The only thing is they go up and down on their little bikes and scooters, and there's no police about, we haven't even got a police station here; it's just an office, and that's it. Nobody tells them off, no one takes any notice.'\n'They can do what they like and they know they can, and they just think it's funny. They're of an age when they think they can.'\n\nFor generations, Herne Bay was a place of calm and serenity, where those in the twilight of their lives would retire to in comfort\n\nBut locals say you're more likely to hear police sirens than seagulls these days\n\nThe town park is a hotbed for antisocial behaviour according to residents \nIt isn't just criminal damage that has residents down - some of them have been attacked. \nLast month a distraught homestay host revealed that her young foreign guests were being routinely racially attacked in the town. \nKathy Atwal told the BBC her students had 'rocks and stones thrown at them.'\nShe said: 'The local children are using catapults against them and basically they're just causing an awful lot of trouble.'\nOutraged local Nick Seymour believes this abuse and attacks like it are endemic of a 'sickness' in the youth. \nHe said: They're just showing off in front of their mates. Of course it's really sad when they're killing animals. It's a sign of a sick society.'\n'I work in a school, so I think it's often the breakdown at home, but then in school if they don't have normality, then a lot of screentime is making things a lot worse, so they're influenced by the group, and the group now dictates what they see online as well, and there's no filters it's the wild west! \n'It's the screentime, that's the huge problem. It's what they're seeing on TikTok, and they egg each other on.' \nThis peer pressure has led to shocking incidents, including the murder of one duck which has left the community scarred. \nOne woman, who preferred to stay anonymous, revealed: 'They killed a duck. But there was a girl there, that's what I can't understand. When it's boys, it's not such a shock, but when it's a girl, well girls are normally softer and love animals. The girl was in the gang. \n\nThis peer pressure has led to shocking incidents, including the murder of one duck which has left the community scarred\n\nRoger Herring, 78, said he had seen children kill birds in trees\n\nCafe owner Mitch Nejni said the town was under seige by the 'plastic gangsters'\n'If I saw lots of youths in that park I wouldn't go in there.'\nRoger Herring, 78, agreed, saying he had seen children kill birds in trees. \n Police 'understand effect of behaviour'\n\nKent Police Chief Superintendent Rob Marsh said: ‘We are committed to tackling antisocial behaviour in Herne Bay and the surrounding coastline.\n‘It can blight a community and we are under no illusion of the effect that the nuisance behaviour caused by a minority of people can have on others. People deserve to feel safe.\n‘Our commitment through our dedicated teams of beat officers and PCSOs in Herne Bay and listening to local concerns has resulted in a 22 per cent reduction in the number of antisocial behaviour reports made in the last 12 months. \n'While that is positive, we are not complacent and will continue to work to identify offenders and take action against them.\n‘People can expect to continue to see high-visibility patrols and the use of additional police powers, such as Section 34 dispersal orders where necessary.\n‘Between Friday 27 June and Sunday 29 June 2025, a total of 16 people identifying as causing issues in Herne Bay town centre were dispersed out of the area by using the order. \n'They were unable to return for 24 hours and would risk arrest if they did so. Children were returned back home and parents were spoken to about their behaviour.\n\n‘Our officers work hard to ensure Herne Bay remains a safe place to live and visit.’ \n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe recalled: 'They come and catapult them out the tree, and they're floating on the ground and they just repeatedly firing at them. \n'I've seen it happen. If I was fitter, I'd down 'em.' 'Why are they doing it? Because they can get away with it. There's no punishment nowadays. People don't get prison sentences these days. \n'The doves, you know, the pigeons, because they can't take off that quick. And when they're on the ground, with an injured wing, they're just shooting into them.'\nCafe owner Mitch Nejni, 49 agreed, saying: 'To be honest with you, we've been in Herne Bay for 25 years and there's always been this problem. So I think the problem stems from the fact that it was never addressed before and it's just gotten worse and worse and worse.\n'We own the bar next door, but that's older, it's not kids. That's more over 21.\n'Do you know what it is? It's kids being kids more than anything else. And I do understand it's gotten out of hand, but that's because of many years of lack of police presence, lack of police doing anything.\n'Girls in Herne Bay are much worse than the boys. I was stood here and there were two girls walking down in school uniform, they must have been about 12. She's drinking a can of Redbull, and she's walked straight past me and she's thrown it onto the floor. \n'She's finished her drink, she's scrunched it up and just dropped it. So I said 'excuse me, I said to her, you just dropped that.' Got back 'oh f**k off, why don't you just f**k off, you know. .\n'It's society, that's all it is – they've given too much protection to these kids and I think they're taking liberties with it. So you can't enforce any discipline on them. So if this is what we want to do and we want to give these rights to youngsters and kids, then that's what you're going to get.\n'Kids from London come down and see the gangs here and call them plastic gangsters. They're plastic, they're just chucking stones at ducks, like a duck can't fight back. \n'In London, we live by set rules, whereas in Herne, there's none of that, they don't understand how to be a gangster. You wouldn't get kids in London chucking stones at ducks. It's just silly, really silly.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLocals in seaside town where beloved grandfather died after being attacked by 'plastic gangsters' are terrified to leave their homes due to violent gangs of catapult wielding yobs\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Citing her time in Congress and as governor of South Dakota, Noem said that while the weather is difficult to predict, there have been instances when officials and citizens expressed the need for quicker warning and clearer notification before deadly weather. \"That is one of the reasons that, when President [Donald] Trump took office, he said he wanted to fix and is currently upgrading the technology,\" Noem said during a news conference with state officials Saturday afternoon. \"The National Weather Service has indicated that with that and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA), we needed to renew this ancient system that has been left in place with the federal government for many, many years.\" PARENTS DESPERATELY SEEKING ANSWERS ON MISSING CAMPERS AFTER TEXAS FLOOD The National Weather Service told Noem its notifications department started to look at expansion of its limited flood impact area at 1:18 p.m. local time Thursday, about 12 hours before the tragedy. Though a flood watch was issued, Noem described it as a \"moderate\" alert. \"When the [weather] system came over the area, it stalled,\" she said. \"It was much more water, much like [what] we experienced during [Hurricane] Harvey, with the same type of system that was unpredictable in the way that it reacted in the way that it stopped right here and dumped unprecedented amounts of rain that caused a flooding event like this.\" TEXAS RIVER FLOOD LEAVES AT LEAST 6 DEAD AS EMERGENCY CREWS RACE TO FIND OTHERS MISSING; CAMP EVACUATED Initial reports indicated heavy rain Friday morning caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 30 feet in 45 minutes. Weather service employees told Noem they continued to elevate notifications, though those alerts likely would have come through in the early morning hours when local residents were asleep. Texas officials on Saturday confirmed at least 32 deaths, including 14 children. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM HOSPITALIZED AFTER ALLERGIC REACTION One of the hardest hit areas was Camp Mystic, an all-girls private Christian camp in Hunt, Texas. As of Saturday afternoon, 27 young girls remain missing. \"I do carry your concerns back to the federal government, to President Trump, and we will do all we can to fix those kinds of things that may have felt like a failure to you and to your community members,\" Noem told a reporter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We know that everybody wants more warning time, and that's why we're working to upgrade the technologies that have been neglected for far too long, to make sure that families have as much advanced notice as possible,\" she added.

On Saturday, Musk announced on X, the social media platform he owns, the formation of the \"America Party,\" calling it a direct response to what he described as a corrupt political establishment that no longer represents the American people. The announcement followed a viral July 4 poll on X, where Musk asked whether voters wanted independence from what he called the \"two-party (some would say uniparty) system.\" ELON MUSK INDICATES HE'LL DONATE TO REP. THOMAS MASSIE, A REPUBLICAN WHO HAS BEEN EXCORIATED BY TRUMP Over 1.2 million votes were cast, with 65.4% saying \"yes.\" \"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it,\" Musk posted Saturday. \"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\" The move came just after President Donald Trump signed the \"big, beautiful bill\" into law Friday at the White House. The sweeping $3.3 trillion legislation includes tax cuts, infrastructure spending and stimulus measures and has drawn criticism from fiscal conservatives and libertarians. Though Musk did not reference the bill directly in his America Party posts, the timing suggests rising friction between the billionaire and the president. Musk has previously warned that unchecked spending by both parties threatens the long-term health of the economy. The new party, according to Musk’s posts, will target a few key seats in Congress. The goal is to create a swing bloc powerful enough to hold the balance of power and block what Musk sees as the worst excesses of both Republicans and Democrats. ELON MUSK SAYS US IS RULED BY 'PORKY PIG PARTY' AS TRUMP DEFENDS HIS VISION AGAINST FORMER ALLY'S CRITICISM Some on the right voiced concern in the comments section that a third party could split the conservative vote and help Democrats win more easily. \"Your third party will disproportionately take votes from the right vs the left and give the left an easier path to power,\" conservative commentator Shawn Farash posted. Others, like Joey Mannarino, urged Musk to focus instead on reforming the GOP from within. Critics also pointed out that the X poll was informal, not limited to American voters and vulnerable to bots. Third parties have traditionally had a difficult time gaining ground in American politics as the system is built for two dominant parties. With the Electoral College, winner-take-all elections and strict ballot access laws, outsiders cannot meaningfully compete. Even when a third-party candidate catches fire, it rarely lasts beyond a single election cycle. One of the biggest third-party efforts in recent history was Ross Perot’s 1992 run. He earned nearly 19% of the popular vote as an independent but didn’t win a single Electoral College vote. It was the closest a third-party candidate got to the White House after President Teddy Roosevelt's famed Bull Moose Party run in 1912 against his onetime protégé, William Howard Taft. Others, like Ralph Nader, have tried with the Green Party, and Gary Johnson with the Libertarian Party, but no third-party candidate has come close to winning the Presidency.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Elon Musk launched the &quot;America Party&quot; Saturday, calling for an end to the “uniparty&quot; system after President Donald Trump signed the &quot;big, beautiful bill&quot; into law.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-launches-america-party-after-trump-signs-historic-spending-bill-waste-graft","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/elon-musk-doge-hat.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:10:16","author":"Jasmine Baehr","authors":["Jasmine Baehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":338657320,"title":"Fighter jet scrambles to intercept plane in Bedminster flying too close to where Trump is spending weekend","text":"A NORAD fighter jet intercepted a plane violating restricted airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, where President Donald Trump is spending the weekend. \n\nA general aviation aircraft committed what ended up being five different violations over the protected airspace on Saturday.\n\nThe NORAD aircraft conducted what's known as a 'headbutt maneuver' to gain the civilian pilot’s attention. \n\nThe aircraft was safely escorted out of the area.

So how did we get here?\n\nElon Musk’s propaganda machine\n\nThe 2024 election made it clear why Elon Musk leveraged billions of dollars to purchase Twitter, which he has since rebranded as X. The wealthiest man in the world turned the site into a propaganda machine, amplifying conspiracy theories and bigotry.\n\nWhen he threw his support behind Trump, the site went all in on amplifying his campaign while escalating lies and falsehoods about Democrats, particularly President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, liberals and progressives mounted a mass exodus to Bluesky. Conservatives responded with anger—because they vitally need to troll liberals, which they prefer over speaking with each other.\n\nAttack on diversity\n\nTrump is a racist and the biggest promoter of the “birther” conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. In his first term, he praised Nazis as “very fine people.” And now in his second term, there’s just more of the same.\n\nBut instead of merely throwing around rhetoric where “woke” is a substitute for the N-word, Trump is using his power to roll back the very notion of diversity. He’s used executive action and internal government policy to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and has even taken to simply erasing the achievement of Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAt the same time, he’s fulfilled—in part, at least—his campaign pledges to the most virulent racists by affirming his support for the pro-slavery Confederacy. Trump and his lieutenants like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are relitigating the Civil War and coming down firmly on the side that viewed Black people as property.\n\nMusk’s government sledgehammer\n\nBy empowering Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency to infiltrate multiple government agencies, Trump advanced the longstanding right-wing mission to undermine effective government. Musk and his team of destructive operatives—like “Big Balls”—have tried to take down government agencies that millions of people rely on.\n\nThere has been significant resistance and a string of courtroom losses for Trump. But thanks to DOGE, the government’s ability to do things like send out Social Security payments and monitor hurricanes has been compromised.\n\nTrust in the government was already in trouble, but Trump and Musk made it worse—all in the name of “small” government, even if that means that people have to die.\n\nScared men and predators\n\nAt the Pentagon, former Fox News host Hegseth continues to be the living embodiment of the toxic masculinity that he represented on the right-wing network. The only problem is that it’s manifested in the mismanagement of the most powerful military in recorded history.\n\nWith Trump’s blessing, Hegseth pounds the table on so-called “warrior” ethos while gossiping on group chats about missile strikes and making a mess of international diplomacy.\n\nSimultaneously, the Trump administration has continued its outreach to the toxic right-wing manosphere by reportedly advocating for the release of influencer Andrew Tate, a misogynist who has been accused of rape in multiple countries. In other words, he’s the perfect hero for the Trump administration.\n\nNever stop pushing conspiracies\n\nTrump is a conspiracy theorist. For decades, he’s offered up half-baked, debunked theories on a litany of topics—like when he said that climate change was a Chinese “hoax”. Even though he and the GOP are in charge, the Trump team still insists that the “deep state” is out to get them.\n\nThe conspiracies are even worse this time around because they’re being fueled by Musk. He and Trump bandied about the notion that gold at Fort Knox had been stolen, even though Trump’s last Treasury secretary did a weird photo shoot there just a few years ago.\n\nThere is no such thing as “white genocide,” but Trump spent days harping on it, throwing a rhetorical bone to white supremacists who have pushed the conspiracy.\n\nThey love abusing and bombing people\n\nConservatism has a long-standing love affair with abusive behavior. The line goes back to figures like President George W. Bush, who promoted torture as U.S. policy with the euphemism “enhanced interrogation” at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\nNow Trump has brought it back to the forefront by abducting and detaining immigrants, crowing about detention camps, and having his subordinates like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stage photo shoots in front of packed jail cells.\n\nThe Republican tradition of gleefully bombing people has resurfaced with Trump’s decision to inject the nation into the conflict between Iran and Israel. Like Bush, Trump is now complaining about the media accurately covering his questionable declarations of success in his bombings.\n\nKilling the economy\n\nTrump inherited an economy from Biden that was on the mend, following years of Trump’s mismanagement during COVID-19. Instead of just taking credit for it, like he did with Obama’s economic recovery in 2017, Trump has gone on the attack.\n\nHe unilaterally imposed tariffs that have already contributed to a fiscal slowdown and sticker shock. Businesses have had their hiring impacted while countries around the world are anticipating the shockwaves of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe last few Republican presidents—Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bush, and Trump—have all presided over economic pullbacks that were cleaned up by Democratic presidents. \n\nTrump and his team, who spent years complaining about prices under Biden, have now said that cost increases are good for the economy, lest they offend Trump.\n\nWar on immigrants\n\nTrump hates immigrants. He launched his initial bid for the presidency based on bald-faced lies about Mexican immigrants being rapists and has pursued a policy of cruelty ever since. In his first term, he separated immigrant families. Now, he’s abducting immigrants and even forcing military occupation on American cities.\n\nThe desire to demonize immigrants or people sympathetic to immigration—a tradition that has been forever intertwined with U.S. history—is evident in all of Trump’s actions. \n\nBut now that the public has seen that Trump and the GOP overstated the threat of “immigrant criminals,” he’s losing ground on what past polls found were his strongest issues.\n\nThe United States is in a bad place, but that didn’t happen overnight. The right plotted and planned for the Trump-powered onslaught, even though he pretended that he was not connected to initiatives like Project 2025.\n\nIf the country recovers, it will take a very long time. Trump has an entire system behind him, from the Republican Party to propaganda machines like X and Fox News.\n\nThey can be defeated, but the fight will have to be sustained.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a tumultuous 6 months with Donald Trump inhabiting the presidency, with a weakened federal government now incapable of addressing monumental problems like climate change, pandemics, education, basic security and safety, and even forecasting the weather.\n\n\n\nAs the United States reaches its 249th year of existence, it’s in a very precarious position. So how did we get here?\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s propaganda machine\n\nThe 2024 election made it clear why Elon Musk leveraged billions of dollars to purchase Twitter, which he has since rebranded as X. The wealthiest man in the world turned the site into a propaganda machine, amplifying conspiracy theories and bigotry.\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk and President Donald Trump\n\n\nWhen he threw his support behind Trump, the site went all in on amplifying his campaign while escalating lies and falsehoods about Democrats, particul","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/5/2331391/-How-the-hell-did-we-get-here?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1451981/story_image/ETR_7.21.png?1751497149","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 23:00:16","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":338662130,"title":"Mystery as Simon Cowell fails to attend Mel B's wedding after gearing up for an awkward reunion with rival music manager Simon Fuller","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Our marriage was falling apart... if only we'd known the terrifying reason why.'

Musk has clashed with Trump over the president's massive domestic spending plan, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it. Now he has created the so-called America Party, his own political framework, through which to try and achieve that.\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,\" the Space X and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"Musk cited a poll -- uploaded on Friday, US Independence Day -- in which he asked whether respondents \"want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system\" that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.The yes-or-no survey earned more than 1.2 million responses.\"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\" he posted on Saturday.Musk also shared a meme depicting a two-headed snake and the caption \"End the Uniparty.\"It is not clear how much impact the new party would have on the 2026 mid-term elections, or on the presidential vote two years after that.The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation, and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting \"debt slavery.\" He vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk said earlier this week.After Musk heavily criticized the flagship spending bill -- which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law -- Trump threatened to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.\"We'll have to take a look,\" the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002.On Friday after posting the poll, Musk laid out a possible political battle plan to pick off vulnerable House and Senate seats and become \"the deciding vote\" on key legislation.\"One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,\" Musk posted on X. All 435 US House seats are up for grabs every two years, while about one third of the Senate's 100 members, who serve six-year terms, are elected every two years.Some observers were quick to point out how third-party campaigns have historically split the vote -- as businessman Ross Perot's independent presidential run in 1992 did when it helped doom George H.W. Bush's re-election bid resulting in Democrat Bill Clinton's victory.\"You are pulling a Ross Perot, and I don't like it,\" one X user wrote to Musk.","summary":"Elon Musk, an ex-ally of US President Donald Trump, said Saturday he had launched a new political party in the United States to challenge what the tech billionaire described as the country's \"one-party system.\"","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/elon-musk-says-he-has-created-new-us-political-party-3777733","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4609174/elon-musk-worlds-richest-person-was-once-close-ally-us-president-donald-trump-has-since-had.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 22:36:09","author":"Michael Mathes","authors":["Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.271},{"id":338656782,"title":"Musk enters political arena with new ‘America Party’","text":"Elon Musk, billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has officially launched a new political party the America Party promising to represent what he calls the “80% in the middle” of the political spectrum. The announcement, made on July 5 via his social media platform X (formerly Twitter), marks one of the most significant outsider entries into American politics in recent history.\n\nThe formation of the America Party follows a growing rift between Musk and both major U.S. political parties. Although Musk has previously donated to candidates from both sides, his recent falling out with former president Donald Trump whom he supported in 2024 through a super PAC appears to have prompted a sharp shift in direction.\n\nIn a series of posts, Musk criticised the current political system as dominated by what he calls a “corrupt uni-party” made up of both Democrats and Republicans. He claims the America Party will offer an alternative focused on transparency, economic growth, and protecting civil liberties—particularly around freedom of speech, digital rights, and innovation. “I’m done choosing the lesser of two evils,” Musk wrote in a pinned post. “The America Party is for those who want actual progress, not political theatre.” His call to action came after a viral online poll he conducted garnered overwhelming support for a new political formation. Early messaging from the party suggests a platform rooted in libertarian-leaning ideals, with a focus on decentralisation, pro-business policies, and less federal government interference.\n\nRather than aiming for the presidency at least initially Musk’s team has stated the party’s short-term goal is to win several key congressional seats in the 2026 midterms. With billions at his disposal, political analysts say Musk could be uniquely positioned to disrupt the U.S. political landscape especially given his massive online following and control of influential platforms. However, skeptics warn that third-party efforts in the U.S. face steep institutional hurdles, including ballot access laws and the “winner-take-all” electoral system that tends to marginalise non-major parties.\n\nMusk’s break with Trump became public following disputes over a sweeping tax-and-spending bill that Musk opposed, calling it “fiscal insanity.” Trump allies have since launched a political counter-offensive, including a new super PAC designed to neutralise Musk’s growing influence. Despite criticism from both parties, Musk’s move has already sparked enthusiastic responses from some sectors of the public, particularly younger and independent voters disillusioned with the status quo.\n\nWhile the America Party remains in its infancy, its launch has already stirred intense political debate. Whether it can translate digital popularity into electoral success remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Elon Musk is no longer just shaping the future of cars, rockets, and AI he now wants to help reshape the future of American democracy.","summary":"Elon Musk, billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has officially launched a new political party the America Party [&#8230;]","url":"https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/07/06/musk-enters-political-arena-with-new-america-party/","image":"https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/elon-6083103_1280.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 22:35:19","author":"Molly Grace","authors":["Molly Grace"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"es","sentiment":0.268},{"id":338656688,"title":"Kelly Osbourne shares her support for dad Ozzy as she watches him reunite with Black Sabbath for the final time in emotional show","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jul 5th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristi Noem is brutally grilled over delayed warning system as monster river burst killed at least 32 - as they give grim update\n\nPro-Palestine activists disrupt London Pride parade with red paint - as almost 30 people are arrested for supporting Palestine Action a day after group was deemed a terror organisation\n\nAngela Rayner to put 'BANTER POLICE' in your office: Watch what you say by the water cooler!

Let's dig deeper to see how this story might play out for Tesla shareholders.\n\nIs Elon Musk propping up Tesla's valuation?\n\nIt's impossible to analyze Tesla without considering its controversial CEO, Elon Musk, who plays a significant role in its stock's perception, even if he isn't necessarily involved with all its day-to-day decision-making. Love him or hate him, Musk is an incredibly skilled executive. He has a track record of involvement in successful companies ranging from PayPal to Starlink, and typically aims to tackle massive world-changing topics like clean energy, space travel, and brain implants. \n\nThe market seems to appreciate Musk's bold risk-taking leadership style, which helps explain why Tesla still enjoys an incredibly high valuation, despite its increasingly lackluster fundamentals. \n\nWith a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 172, the stock trades at a substantial premium over the S&P 500 average of 30 despite posting lackluster operating results. First-quarter revenue dropped 9% year over year to $19.3 million, while operating income collapsed by 66% to just $399 million. With these weak fundamentals, Tesla should probably be cheaper than it is, but the market still has faith in Musk. \n\nA political liability \n\nOver time, it is becoming clear that Tesla's \"Musk premium\" is eroding and may soon become a liability. The CEO's managerial skills have not translated to political acumen. In fact, his antics usually seem to minimize results while maximizing the potential for backlash. A great example of this is the flare-up over the \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" legislation, which passed the U.S. Senate on July 1 and is expected to become law later this month despite Musk's vocal opposition on social media.\n\nNow, Musk-affiliated companies must face a double whammy over the potential for political retaliation (this may come in the form of regulatory challenges) while also dealing with the contents of the bill itself.\n\nThe bill could be a crushing burden on a U.S. EV industry that is already struggling with consumer fatigue, high interest rates, and tariffs on imported components. Although the final version is yet to be approved, the Senate has agreed to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit on electric vehicle purchases, while also ending support for residential solar and rolling back vehicle emissions regulations on Tesla's gas-powered rivals.\n\nThese headwinds come at a time when Tesla's overseas operations are struggling because of political backlash and new, low-cost rivals from China, which often enjoy open support from their government. \n\nWhat comes next for Tesla?\n\nThe next three years will be incredibly challenging for Tesla as the impacts of the act could potentially weaken the market for its products in the U.S. Musk's political antics could make things worse by alienating some consumers and drawing potential political retaliation from President Donald Trump and his allies as it attempts to pioneer regulatorily-sensitive business ventures like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. \n\nHistorically, it hasn't been a good idea to bet against Musk because he usually proves his naysayers wrong. That said, these current challenges look daunting, even for him. And they could easily put pressure on Tesla's sky-high valuation.

with no election, referendum or opinion polls.\n\nMany appointments in the government are reported to be based on connections rather than qualifications, and most of those in charge have a radical Islamic agenda and are enforcing it.\n\nLammy said the UK wants Syria to \"move in the direction of peace, of prosperity, of stability for the people and an inclusive country\" and will use humanitarian aid to help that. \n\nHe added the UK would monitor the situation to ensure the new government ruled the population in an inclusive manner.\n\nThe UK government is also supporting the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to help dismantle Assad's chemical weapons in Syria.\n\nA further £2m was committed to the organisation this financial year in addition to around £837,000 provided since the fall of Assad.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rvpz1kjkpo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/380f/live/6bf5bb40-59e3-11f0-95d7-c939ccdafb65.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 22:22:40","author":"Lina Sinjab","authors":["Lina Sinjab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.183},{"id":338651578,"title":"Texas flood: Frantic search for survivors of deluge that killed 32, including 14 children","text":"Among the areas most severely hit by the floods were mobile homes, summer camps and camping sites where many had gathered for 4 July holiday celebrations.\n\nAt a press conference on Saturday afternoon, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he had signed an expanded disaster declaration to boost search efforts. \n\nTexas flood victims: Girl 'living her best life' and 'heart and soul' of camp\n\nHe said officials would be relentless in ensuring they locate \"every single person who's been a victim of this event\", adding that \"we will stop when job is completed\".\n\nIt remains a search and rescue mission, officials said, not a recovery effort.\n\nThey said rescuers were going up and down the Guadalupe River to try to find people who may have been swept away by the floods. \n\nMuch of the rescue has focused on a large all-girls Christian summer camp called Camp Mystic. \n\nThe camp, where 27 remain missing, is on the banks of the Guadalupe River near Hunt, Texas. \n\nTexas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme that of the 27 children missing from Camp Mystic \"many of these girls are younger girls under the age of 12\".\n\nHe also said that many more people were likely to remain unaccounted for across the region, because some were visiting for the holiday weekend. \n\nIn an email to parents of the roughly 750 campers, Camp Mystic said that if they haven't been contacted directly, their child is considered missing.\n\nSome of the families have already stated publicly that their children were among those who were found dead. \n\nUS President Donald Trump has said his administration is working closely with local authorities to respond to the emergency.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president was \"devastated\" by the loss of life and promised full federal support.\n\nNoem joined Governor Abbott at Saturday afternoon's press conference and said the federal government would soon be deploying the Coast Guard to help search efforts.\n\nElsewhere in central Texas, in Travis County, officials say another two people have died and 10 are missing because of the flooding. \n\nForecasters have warned that central Texas may see more flooding this weekend. \n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said the area could see 2 to 5in (5cm to 12cm) of rain on Saturday. \n\nUp to 10in of rain was possible in some areas that are still reeling from Friday's deluge.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4w36lnvgyo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4417/live/25bcb680-59e6-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 22:22:40","author":"Ana Faguy","authors":["Ana Faguy"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":338651580,"title":"Iran Supreme Leader Khamenei in first public appearance since Israel war","text":"During the 12-day war with Israel, Khamenei appeared on TV in three video messages and there was speculation that he was hiding in a bunker. \n\nOn Saturday Iranian media coverage was dominated by Khamenei's appearance, with footage of supporters expressing joy at seeing him on television. \n\nKhamenei is seen turning to senior cleric Mahmoud Karimi, encouraging him to \"sing the anthem, O Iran\".

U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for an agreement and will host Netanyahu at the White House on Monday (July 7, 2025) to discuss a deal. \n\nInside Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed 14 Palestinians and another 10 were killed while seeking food aid, hospital officials in the embattled enclave told The Associated Press. And two American aid workers with the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured in an attack at a food distribution site, which the organization blamed on Hamas, without providing evidence.\n\nWeary Palestinians expressed cautious hope after Hamas gave a “positive” response late Friday to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce but said further talks were needed on implementation.\n\n“We are tired. Enough starvation, enough closure of crossing points. We want to sleep in calm where we don’t hear warplanes or drones or shelling,” said Jamalat Wadi, one of Gaza's hundreds of thousands of displaced people, speaking in Deir al-Balah. She squinted in the sun during a summer heat wave of over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHamas has sought guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Previous negotiations have stalled over Hamas demands of guarantees that further negotiations would lead to the war’s end, while Netanyahu has insisted Israel would resume fighting to ensure the militant group's destruction.\n\n“Send a delegation with a full mandate to bring a comprehensive agreement to end the war and bring everyone back. No one must be left behind,” Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, told the weekly rally by relatives and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes struck tents in the crowded Muwasi area on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast, killing seven people including a Palestinian doctor and his three children, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nFour others were killed in the town of Bani Suheila in southern Gaza. Three people were killed in three strikes in Khan Younis. Israel's army did not immediately comment.\n\nShooting at Gaza aid site\n\nSeparately, eight Palestinians were killed near a GHF aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, the hospital said. One Palestinian was killed near another GHF point in Rafah. It was not clear how far the Palestinians were from the sites.\n\nGHF denied the killings happened near their sites. The organization has said no one has been shot at its sites, which are guarded by private contractors and can be accessed only by passing Israeli military positions hundreds of meters (yards) away.\n\nThe army had no immediate comment but has said it fires warning shots as a crowd-control measure and only aims at people when its troops are threatened.\n\nAnother Palestinian was killed waiting in crowds for aid trucks in eastern Khan Younis, officials at Nasser Hospital said. The United Nations and other international organizations have been bringing in their own supplies of aid since the war began. The incident did not appear to be connected to GHF operations.\n\nMuch of Gaza's population of over 2 million now relies on international aid after the war has largely devastated agriculture and other food sources and left many people near famine. Crowds of Palestinians often wait for trucks and unload or loot their contents before they reach their destinations. The trucks must pass through areas under Israeli military control. Israel's military did not immediately comment.\n\nThe GHF said the two American aid workers were injured on Saturday morning when assailants threw grenades at a distribution site in Khan Younis. The foundation said the injuries were not life-threatening. Israel's military said it evacuated the workers for medical treatment.\n\n U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid system\n\nThe GHF — a U.S.- and Israeli-backed initiative meant to bypass the U.N. — distributes aid from four sites that are surrounded by Israeli troops. Three sites are in Gaza's far south.\n\nThe U.N. and other humanitarian groups have rejected the GHF system, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and is not effective. Israel says Hamas has siphoned off aid delivered by the U.N., a claim the U.N. denies. Hamas has urged Palestinians not to cooperate with the GHF.\n\nGHF, registered in Delaware, began distributing food in May to Palestinians, who say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points.\n\nSeveral hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and witnesses. The U.N. human rights office says it has recorded 613 Palestinians killed within a month in Gaza while trying to obtain aid, most of them while trying to reach GHF sites.\n\nThe war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.\n\nIsrael responded with an offensive that has killed over 57,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is led by medical professionals employed by the Hamas government. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but the U.N. and other international organizations see its figures as the most reliable statistics on war casualties.","summary":"Palestinians expressed cautious hope after Hamas gave a “positive” response late Friday to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce but said further talks were needed on implementation.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-ceasefire-negotiating-team-to-qatar-before-trump-and-netanyahu-meet/article69778198.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3d1gbr/article69778203.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-07-05T192941Z_318972973_RC2IGFAJTGAU_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 22:17:07","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.448}]}
