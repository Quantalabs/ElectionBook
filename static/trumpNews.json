He reassures that this wave of change is temporary, not lasting.","text":"Robert Thomson, a close ally of Rupert Murdoch and CEO of the media titan’s News Corp, said the initial “turmoil” of Donald Trump‘s time in the White House is certain to calm down in the coming months.\n\nSpeaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Thomson said the whirlwind early weeks of Trump’s second term have unfolded at a pace that cannot be sustained. He pointed to Monday’s negative reaction to the president’s vow to initiate previously shelved tariffs against Canada and Mexico, calling it a check on the president’s impulsiveness.\n\nThe “tariff turmoil” and other sources of “uncertainty” are not “what Chairman Mao used to call a ‘permanent revolution,’” Thomson said. “This is not a permanent revolution.”\n\nInstead, the tariffs are “transactional” measures, the exec reasoned, and “there’s a certain method to the madness. If that’s the case, then in six to nine months’ time, for our businesses and for any business operating in the States or for any global company contemplating investment, the scenario will be somewhat different” than the current one.\n\nNews Corp’s media portfolio includes The Wall Street Journal, whose recent editorials have at times directly challenged Trump, calling his tariff plan a step toward “the dumbest trade war in history.” The news outlet has also clashed with Trump advisor Elon Musk after publishing investigative articles about his leadership of Tesla and other companies as well as his oversight of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nOther parts of Murdoch’s media empire, especially Fox News at sister entity Fox Corp., have remained ardently supportive of Trump. Over the decade of Trump emerging as a prominent figure in presidential politics, Murdoch’s relationship with him has fluctuated noticeably, but has recently landed in a generally pragmatic place. Thomson himself, during a quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month, hailed Trump’s election win for lifting the “yoke of woke” from U.S. businesses.\n\nThomson at the Morgan Stanley event predicted that Corporate America would be able to ride out the storm.\n\n“If you were going in and wanting to disrupt, you would do it at the front end,” he said. “Then hopefully, and obviously the goal, is to change in terms of trade, to reduce the federal bureaucracy spend, etc. etc. Which is why, essentially DOGE has a limited timeline. But we’re in the midst of the early Trump 2 turmoil. The optimistic interpretation is, it’s purposeful turbulence.”\n\nWith Trump sensitive to the stock market and consumer price inflation data, “those two things themselves provide a natural discipline,” Thomson argued. “But there’s also no doubt that in the end he wants to be seen as a successful president. And a successful president presiding over four years of chaos is not a successful president. So, I would try to contextualize the upheaval in which we find ourselves. I’m of the more optimistic school, could be proved wrong.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert Thomson, a close ally of Rupert Murdoch and CEO of the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp and close associate of Rupert Murdoch, predicts that the initial upheaval following Trump&#8217;s second term will soon diminish.

The official added that the U.S. was “pausing and reviewing” its aid to “ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” The official spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance.\n\nThe pause comes some five years after Trump held up congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine in 2019 as he sought to pressure Zelensky to launch investigations into then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. That led to Trump’s first impeachment.\n\nIn the lead-up to his 2024 election win, Trump vowed to quickly end the war in Ukraine, often promising it would be resolved “on Day One” or “within 24 hours” of his reelection. He’s expressed increasing frustration with Zelensky over the war while simultaneously expressing confidence that Russian leader Vladimir Putin can be trusted to keep the peace if a truce in the conflict is reached.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump attacked Zelensky for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine likely “is still very, very far away.”\n\nThe comments come as prominent Trump allies escalate pressure on Zelensky to either dramatically change his approach to dealing with Trump — or step aside.\n\n‘WON’T BE AROUND VERY LONG’\n\nThe long-complicated relationship between the leaders has reached a low point following the disastrous White House meeting Friday, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance excoriated Zelensky for a perceived lack of gratitude for U.S. support for Ukraine since Putin ordered the February 2022 invasion.\n\n“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform about the comments Zelensky made late Sunday while speaking to reporters in London.\n\nAt an event at the White House later Monday, Trump referred to Zelensky’s reported comments and asserted the Ukrainian leader “better not be right about that.”\n\n“If somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long,” Trump added. “That person will not be listened to very long.”\n\nIn his Sunday remarks, the Ukrainian leader had tried to offer a positive take on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of last week’s White House meeting.\n\nAsked by a reporter about the outlines of a new European initiative to end Russia’s war, Zelensky said: “We are talking about the first steps today, and, therefore, until they are on paper, I would not like to talk about them in great detail.”\n\n“An agreement to end the war is still very, very far away, and no one has started all these steps yet,” he added.\n\nBut Trump was only further irritated by Zelensky’s suggesting it will take time for the conflict to come to a close.\n\n“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. — Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,” Trump wrote in his post. “What are they thinking?”\n\nZelensky took to social media himself soon after Trump’s latest criticism. He did not directly refer to Trump’s comments but underscored that it “is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible.”\n\n“We need real peace and Ukrainians want it most because the war ruins our cities and towns,” Zelensky added. “We lose our people. We need to stop the war and to guarantee security.”\n\nTRUMP’S ALLIES ECHO PRESIDENT\n\nTrump’s national security adviser said Zelensky’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office talks “put up in the air” whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward.\n\n“Is he ready, personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?” Mike Waltz said on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” earlier Monday. “And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?”\n\nWaltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support as other high-profile Trump allies have suggested that the relationship between Trump and Zelensky is becoming untenable.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday that Zelensky “needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country” for Ukraine to continue pursuing a peace deal negotiated by the United States.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally who has been previously a vociferous supporter of Ukraine, said soon after the Oval Office meeting that Zelensky “either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”\n\nAngela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said Putin is likely in no rush to end the war amid the fissures between Trump and Zelensky and between Europe and the U.S. about the way ahead.\n\n“He is not interested in ending the war,” said Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “He thinks Russia is winning. … And he thinks that as time goes on, the West will be more fractured.”\n\nTrump administration and Ukrainian officials had been expected to sign off on a deal during Zelensky’s visit last week that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals, in part to pay back more than $180 billion in aid the U.S. has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. The White House also billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.\n\nBut the signing was scrapped after the leaders’ Oval Office talks went off the rails, and White House officials asked Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation to leave.\n\nOn Monday, Trump suggested he hasn’t given up on the economic pact, calling it “a great deal.” He added that he expected to speak about the deal during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, spoke with Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Monday about getting the mineral rights deal back on track.\n\nAfter the lengthy call, Fitzpatrick predicted the “deal will be signed in short order.”\n\nAP journalist Tracy Brown contributed to this story.","summary":"Earlier Monday, the president attacked Ukraine's for suggesting that the end of Russia's war against Ukraine likely 'is still very, very far away.'","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/03/03/trump-pauses-us-aid-to-ukraine-after-oval-office-confrontation-with-zelensky/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/03/Trump_Zelenskyy_03743_ea75b4.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 01:05:49","author":"Aamer Madhani And Zeke Miller,AAMER MADHANI and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press","authors":["Aamer Madhani And Zeke Miller","AAMER MADHANI and ZEKE MILLER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":296374970,"title":"Sports News | Bill to Ban Trans Athletes from Girls', Women's Sports Teams Fails to Advance in US Senate","text":"Washington, Mar 4 (AP) Legislation that aimed to bar transgender women and girls nationwide from participating in school athletic competitions designated for female athletes failed to advance in a divided US Senate as Democrats stood united against an issue that Republicans leveraged in last year's elections. A test vote on the bill on Monday night failed to gain the 60 votes needed in the Senate on a party-line 51-45 vote. Also Read | Why Ajinkya Rahane Was Preferred As KKR Captain Over Venkatesh Iyer? Here’s Three Possible Reasons For Veteran Indian Cricketer Getting Leadership Role Ahead of IPL 2025. The bill sought to determine Title IX protections “based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” The vote came as Republicans have homed in repeatedly on the social cause, casting it as an issue of ensuring athletic fairness for women and girls. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month giving federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the administration's view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.

Still, Republicans in Congress have set their sights on enshrining that policy into law by amending the 1972 Title IX law, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. “Around the country we have seen men — biological men who identify as women — take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, adding, “This is a matter of fairness and equality.” The House had already passed similar legislation with only two Democrats in support, but the setback for the bill in the Senate showed the steep climb for any legislation that targets LGBTQ people. Democrats slammed the bill as both a distraction from more pressing issues and a federal overreach into local school decisions. “What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,” Senator Brian Schatz said in a floor speech. Senator Tammy Baldwin said, “This is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.” Still, Republicans nationwide appear determined to press the issue. During his presidential campaign, Trump found that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far. Following Trump's executive order, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth. In Minnesota Monday, the state House braced for a similar debate on a GOP-backed bill that would apply to primary and secondary schools. Ahead of the debate, several dozen supporters rallied on the steps of the state Capitol in St Paul, framing the bill as protection for opportunities and safety for girls in sports, and ensuring that they have a level playing field. Democrats and LGBTQ+ rights activists denounced the measure as bullying.

The White House has also billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.\n\nThe signing was scrapped after the leaders' Oval Office talks went off the rails and White House officials asked Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation to leave.\n\nTrump on Monday, however, suggested he hasn’t given up on the economic pact, calling it “a great deal.” He added that he expected to speak to the deal during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, spoke with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Monday about getting the mineral rights deal back on track.\n\nFitzpatrick after the lengthy call predicted the “deal will be signed in short order.”\n\nBy Aamer Madhani and Zeke Miller Associated Press\n\nAP journalist Tracy Brown contributed reporting.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Monday directed a “pause” to U.S. assistance to Ukraine after a disastrous Oval Office meeting as Trump seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in peace talks with Russia.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/03/trump-hits-pause-on-us-aid-to-ukraine-after-oval-dustup-pressuring-zelenskyy-on-russia-talks.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/YTOWYN4JAFCTVKACFZ22EANDIQ.jpg?auth=1899e27b001d7b7d43d27a5b0e028159fa9a089a1b1c1a522a7f4e7c96b4bde7&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:55:13","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":296373072,"title":"Ukraine Needs Security Guarantees for ‘Real, Fair Peace,’ Zelenskyy Reiterates","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated Monday that Ukraine needs firm security guarantees to achieve a “real, fair peace” and bring the war with Russia to an end.\n\nHis remarks came after high-level meetings with Ukrainian leadership, during which officials analyzed military aid packages, defense contracts, and strategies to safeguard Ukraine’s long-term security. According to Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s primary objective is to hold positions on the battlefield while creating diplomatic conditions for sustainable peace.\n\n“The baseline scenario is to hold positions and create conditions for proper diplomacy, for the soonest possible end to this war with a decent peace. We need peace—real, fair peace—not endless war,” he said. “And we need security guarantees.”\n\nZelenskyy said the lack of security guarantees for Ukraine enabled Russia to occupy Crimea and wage war in Donbas 11 years ago—and later facilitated Moscow’s full-scale invasion. He added that now, the continued absence of such guarantees is allowing the war to continue.\n\n“Because there are still no defined security guarantees, it is Russia that is keeping this war going,” he said. “The whole world sees this, the whole world acknowledges this.”\n\nUkraine’s demand for security guarantees has become a central issue in diplomatic discussions with Western allies, particularly in talks with the United States. These discussions came into sharp focus following a contentious Feb. 28 meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump. The meeting, initially intended to finalize an economic cooperation agreement granting the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in exchange for continued military support, devolved into a heated exchange over the path to ending the war.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, Trump pushed for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations with Russia, while Zelenskyy challenged the feasibility of any agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he argued could not be trusted to honor a peace deal. Zelenskyy insisted on explicit security guarantees from the United States as part of any future peace deal with Moscow but Trump rejected the idea, saying that U.S. economic engagement in Ukraine’s mineral sector would serve as a sufficient deterrent against future Russian aggression. Ultimately, Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House without signing the proposed economic pact.","summary":"The Ukrainian president says the lack of security guarantees is allowing the war with Russia to continue.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/ukraine-needs-security-guarantees-for-real-fair-peace-zelenskyy-reiterates-5819359","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/03/03/id5819394-GettyImages-2202214228-e1741047493776-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:53:40","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":296375892,"title":"Trump pauses US military aid to Ukraine after clash with Zelensky","text":"US President Donald Trump has paused all military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said on Monday.\n“President has been clear that he is focused on peace.

Trump,’ the president wrote on Truth Social. ‘Remember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat’s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!’ \n\nTrump’s National Security Advisor Mike Waltz warned in an interview on FOX News Channel’s America’s Newsroom Monday morning that the days of unlimited support from America to Ukraine were over. \n\n‘The American people’s patience is not unlimited, their wallets are not unlimited and our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited,’ he said. ‘The time to talk is now.’ \n\nWaltz said that Zelensky failed to demonstrate that he was willing to work with the United States and Russia to strike a peace deal to end the war. \n\n‘Success looks like President Zelensky sitting down and talking the terms of peace … what became so evident to us in that session is he’s not ready to talk peace at all but here’s the problem: Time is not on his side,’ he said. \n\nWaltz said it was ‘really confounding’ that Zelensky blew up the meeting and lost an opportunity to work with the American people for the future of his country. \n\n‘I think that President Zelensky truly did his country a real disservice by not having a positive outcome on Friday and we’ll see where things are going forward,’ he concluded. \n\nZelensky grew frustrated during the Oval Office meeting after Vance spoke about the importance of allowing President Trump to engage in diplomacy with Russia. \n\n‘What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?’ he asked, after listing all of the ways that Putin had broken previous agreements with Ukraine. \n\n‘I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President,’ Vance replied, before accusing Zelensky of being disrespectful to President Trump by trying to voice his opposition to a peace deal in front of the American media. \n\nAfter the contentious Oval Office meeting, Trump told Zelensky to leave, canceling the planned lunch, and a meeting to sign an mineral deal agreement followed by a press conference to celebrate.\n\n‘I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President,’ Vance replied, before accusing Zelensky of being disrespectful to President Trump by trying to voice his opposition to a peace deal in front of the American media. \n\nTrump criticized Zelensky for disrespecting the United States in the Oval Office, noting the Ukrainian president did not appear willing to make a peace deal. \n\n‘He can come back when he is ready for Peace,’ Trump wrote on social media. \n\nAfter the disastrous meeting with Trump, Zelensky made an emergency trip to London where he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European leaders who emphasized their support for Ukraine.\n\n‘The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others,’ Starmer said. ‘Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is putting a pause on all military aid to Ukraine and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump halts US military assistance to Ukraine following heated argument with Zelensky and delivers surprising ultimatum first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-halts-us-military-assistance-to-ukraine-following-heated-argument-with-zelensky-and-delivers-surprising-ultimatum/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Trump-pauses-all-US-military-aid-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:50:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":296373428,"title":"Netanyahu warns of ‘consequences you can’t imagine’ if hostages aren’t freed – after Hamas refuses ceasefire extension","text":"ISRAEL has threatened Hamas terrorists with \"consequences you can't imagine\" if all remaining hostages aren't freed.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent out the powerful warning to the thugs in Gaza just days after the first phase of the ceasefire officially expired.\n\nThe Palestinian group still have around 59 of the 251 hostages they first kidnapped with brute force during the horrors of October 7.\n\nOnly 24 are believed to be alive still with another 35 bodies also expected to be returned for official burials by Israel.\n\nTerms for a second phase of the crucial ceasefire agreement are yet to be hashed out with the latest deal being rejected by Hamas.\n\nIn response, Israel blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza with Netanyahu saying he was left with no choice.\n\nIf Hamas continues to refuse then the PM has warned \"there will be further consequences\".\n\nNetanyahu made another ultimatum to the terror group on Monday when he spoke to Israel’s parliament at a hearing on an inquiry into the October 7 terror attacks.\n\nHe warned: “If you don’t release our hostages, there will be consequences you can’t imagine.\n\n\"We will not stop until we achieve all our victory objectives: the return of all our hostages, the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing power, and ensuring Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.\"\n\nFreed hostage Yarden Bibas, the dad of young murdered captives Kfir and Ariel, has now called on Netanyahu to take responsibility for failing to prevent the deadly massacre in 2023.\n\nYarden wrote in a letter which was read out at the hearing: “I won’t get to hug my children and wife any more.”\n\nHe added that the inquiry is needed to help “prevent the next disaster\".\n\nOver the weekend, Donald Trump's peace envoy, Steve Witkoff, proposed to extend the ceasefire for the next 50 days to include Ramadan and Passover.\n\nThe deal would see half of the living and dead hostages released on the first day, with the rest released at the end if an agreement on a permanent ceasefire were reached.\n\nHamas rejected the proposal as Israeli Defence Forces troops, tanks and warplane prepared to resume hostilities.\n\nIn 2025, thirty-three Israeli captives were returned in the first phase of the ceasefire -

This is evil,’ Musk wrote on X in reaction to a Truth Social post by Donald Trump lashing out at Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia was ‘still very, very far away’.\n\n‘This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer,’ an infuriated Trump posted on his Truth Social website after upping the pressure on Kyiv to end the war.\n\nTrump added that Zelensky ‘doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing’.\n\nMusk also alleged in another post that Zelensky ‘wants a forever war’ because he would otherwise ‘lose his spotlight on the international stage’.\n\nUS President Trump hinted during a press conference on Monday that Zelensky might not survive long as Ukrainian president if he continued to make demands ahead of a peace deal.\n\n‘It should not be that hard a deal to make,’ Trump told reporters at the White House. \n\n‘It could be made very fast. Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long.’\n\nIn reply to a post on X claiming that ‘Zelensky knows if the war ends, his power ends’ and branding him a ‘dictator’, Musk said: ‘True. As distasteful as it is, Zelensky should be offered some kind of amnesty in a neutral country in exchange for a peaceful transition back to democracy in Ukraine.’\n\nThis echoes a statement by Trump, who also called Zelensky a ‘dictator’ for not holding elections in Ukraine, where Martial Law has been declared since the start of Russia’s invasion in 2022.\n\nOn Monday, Trump was asked what Zelensky needed to do to resume talks with Washington. \n\n‘Well, I just think you should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,’ he said, before repeating a falsehood about levels of American aid.\n\nHe added: ‘We’ve given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us.’\n\nTrump is pushing for a rapid deal to end the war in Ukraine. His administration has held talks with Kyiv on a rare earth minerals deal that would allow Washington to recoup some of its costs. \n\nOn Friday, Zelensky visited the White House to discuss the minerals deal, but the meeting ended in disaster after him and Trump clashed in the Oval Office over whether or not Russian President Vladimir Putin could be trusted. \n\nZelensky then traveled to the UK where European leaders – among them France, Germany and the UK – and Canada scrambled to thrash out a joint position on Ukraine at an emergency summit before reiterating their support for the war-torn country.\n\nTrump said: ‘It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelensky, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US.’\n\nTrump said he would give an update on the minerals deal during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. \n\nHe added on Monday in what appeared to be an attack on European leaders: ‘Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?’ \n\nThis comes after NATO chief Mark Rutte on Sunday pointed to promises from more European countries to ‘ramp up defence spending’, while insisting that Washington remained committed to the transatlantic alliance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron suggested that European countries should raise their defence spending to between 3.0 and 3.5 percent of GDP to respond to Washington’s shifting priorities and Russia’s militarisation. \n\nLast week, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that the UK would increase its defence spending to 2.5 per cent of its GDP, slashing the aid budget, with plans to increase military spending to three per cent soon after.\n\nWhile the US is the largest single donor of aid to Ukraine, more than 50 allies and partner countries have provided security assurances to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in 2022. \n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Europe had contributed 132.3bn euros in allocated aid, versus 114.2bn given by the US. \n\nEurope’s contributions are also expected to keep flowing; 115.1bn remained to be allocated from Europe, with just 4.84bn from the US.\n\nThe key difference is in what the U.S. is able to supply. Britain has been able to match the U.S. with long-range missiles, able to hit deep into Russian territory. And the Challenger 2 tank has been one of the most reliable fixtures on the battlefield.\n\nBut American air defences – and their sheer volume – are critical to fending off Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and disrupting utilities.\n\nLong range ATACMS missiles can also ‘make a significant difference in the war’, according to Olga Tokariuk, Academy Associate, Ukraine Forum, Russia and Eurasia Programme. \n\nThe summit between the European leaders, where countries promised to increase their defence spending to react to Washington’s shifting priorities and Russia’s militarisation, has been commended by US national security advisor Mike Waltz. \n\n‘We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security,’ he told reporters at the White House and even praised Sir Keir and Macron. \n\n‘I mean that’s been an underpinning.

The official added that the U.S. was “pausing and reviewing” its aid to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assistance.The pause comes as prominent Trump allies escalate pressure on Zelenskyy to dramatically change his approach to the U.S. president, who has made quickly ending the war a top priority, or step aside.The long, complicated relationship between the leaders has reached a nadir following a disastrous White House meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance excoriated Zelenskyy for not being sufficiently thankful for U.S. support for Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the February 2022 invasion.“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform about the comments Zelenskyy made late Sunday while speaking to reporters in London.Trump at an event at the White House later on Monday referred to Zelenskyy's reported comments, and asserted the Ukrainian leader “better not be right about that.”“If somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long,” Trump added. \"That person will not be listened to very long.”Trump took issue with Zelenskyy suggesting it would take time to come to an agreement to end the war. The Ukrainian leader also tried to offer a positive take on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship in the aftermath of last week's White House meeting.Asked by a reporter about the outlines of a new European initiative to end Russia’s war, Zelenskyy said: “We are talking about the first steps today, and, therefore, until they are on paper, I would not like to talk about them in great detail.”“An agreement to end the war is still very, very far away, and no one has started all these steps yet,\" he added.But Trump was only further irritated by Zelenskyy’s suggesting it will take time for the conflict to come to a close.“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. — Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,” Trump added in his post. “What are they thinking?”RELATED STORY | Trump reflects on meeting with Zelenskyy: 'He very much overplayed his hand'Zelenskyy took to social media soon after Trump's latest criticism. He did not directly refer to Trump's comments, but underscored that it “is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible.”“We need real peace and Ukrainians want it most because the war ruins our cities and towns,” Zelenskyy added. “We lose our people. We need to stop the war and to guarantee security.”Trump's national security adviser said Zelenskyy’s posture during Friday’s Oval Office talks “put up in the air” whether he’s someone the U.S. administration will be able to deal with going forward.“Is he ready, personally, politically, to move his country towards an end to the fighting?” Mike Waltz said on Fox News' \"America’s Newsroom\" earlier Monday. \"And can he and will he make the compromises necessary?”Waltz added another layer of doubt about U.S. support as other high-profile Trump allies have suggested that the relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy is becoming untenable.House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that Zelenskyy “needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country” for Ukraine to continue pursuing a peace deal negotiated by the United States.Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally who has been a vociferous supporter of Ukraine, said soon after the Oval Office meeting that Zelenskyy “either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, said Putin is likely in no rush to end the war amid the fissures between Trump and Zelenskyy and Europe and the U.S. about the way ahead.“He is not interested in ending the war,” said Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “He thinks Russia is winning. ...

But the news drew criticism from many, including conservatives and even ardent crypto backers, over many concerns: giveaways to a wealthy community, delegitimizing the digital currency industry and more.\n\n\"I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World,\" Trump declared on his Truth Social network Sunday in announcing the reserve, which would involve the federal government stockpiling five tokens: two well-established ones (Bitcoin and ether) and three newer ones (XRP, solana and cardano).\n\nProponents say a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto's price growth. It's still not clear how such a reserve would work or when it would be introduced, though a Republican-authored bill in the Senate would direct the government to buy 1 million bitcoins -- $92.6 billion at today's prices -- over five years.\n\nThe plan is music to the ears of many in the crypto industry, who have already benefited significantly from Trump moves like picking regulators who will go easier on digital currencies. The price of bitcoin alone has jumped 36% since the election.\n\nCritics of all political stripes decried the move. Some Republicans raised questions about spending taxpayer money on risky assets instead of paying down the national debt. Joe Lonsdale, a friend of Elon Musk, wrote on X: \"It's wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it's also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.\"\n\nSome protested the seeming latest conflict of interest involving Trump and crypto, noting that Trump profited from promoting the so-called memecoin $Trump before his inauguration. (The SEC last week said memecoins wouldn't be subject to regulatory oversight.) \"This is getting egregious,\" software developer Nikita Bier replied to Lonsdale's post. \"Every 2 weeks there is a kickback to the family.\"\n\n\"Completely delegitimizes all the work DOGE is doing,\" he said, referring to Elon Musk's government initiative that purports to dig out fraud.\n\nOthers questioned whether David Sacks, the investor who is Trump's crypto czar, also stands to benefit from such a reserve. Sacks wrote on X that he had sold his cryptocurrency holdings, but didn't address any holdings his investment firm has in crypto startups. Sacks will chair a first-of-its kind crypto White House summit Friday intended to discuss ways to spur innovation and growth in the sector.\n\nThis poses a longer-term question. Judging by Sunday's rally in crypto assets, this could vastly benefit crypto investors, who showed that they're willing to inject huge sums into politics. Could such an explicitly beneficial policy for crypto give them even more ammunition to influence future elections, further reshaping government in their favor?\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"(DealBook)","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-faces-blowback-over-plans-for-crypto-reserve/article_09fb6e35-a885-598e-893d-1f07651ab8ff.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:37:03","author":"Michael J. de la Merced,North Adams Pride","authors":["Michael J. de la Merced","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":296371280,"title":"Pittsburgh mayor took ‘MAGA’ donations too","text":"“Can’t wait to see the back flips of the Gainey haters have to try to spin this one,” Bethany Hallam, a left-wing county councilwoman, posted on X in response to a story written by the U.K.-based Guardian raising questions about O’Connor’s donors. The Guardian headline read “Republican donors trying to unseat Pittsburgh’s progressive black mayor.”\n\nThe problem for Gainey is that not only has he also taken donations from Republican donors, but he’s taken a greater percentage than O’Connor has.\n\nDemocratic strategist Mike Mikus, who has worked on campaigns for more than three decades, said he finds it astonishing that Gainey would launch an attack on O’Connor on this common practice.\n\n“Republicans have given him 23% of the money he has raised so far. That’s a larger percentage than was given to O’Connor,” said Mikus.\n\nIn total, nearly a quarter of the money Gainey has raised for his reelection has come from at least 42 donations from MAGA Republicans — donors who have also donated to President Donald Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA), Lou Barletta, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Dave McCormick, or Govs. Greg Abbott (R-TX) or Ron DeSantis (R-FL), according to Open Secrets.\n\nRaces for mayor in Pittsburgh have been decided in the primary since the 1930s, when the last Republican held the seat. Four years ago Gainey unseated sitting Democrat Mayor Bill Peduto.\n\nIn conversations with several current and former elected Democrats, all of them said they have taken donations from Republicans for years.\n\nGainey held a press conference at a North Side thrift shop to address the Guardian story, saying, “There is one place I didn’t expect to have to defend the MAGA assault, and that was in the primary race, but unfortunately, this is exactly where we are at. Trump’s MAGA donors, his consultants, and his corporate interests are trying to buy the mayor’s office by attacking me just like they attacked Kamala Harris.”\n\nGainey, a former state representative, has struggled in his role as mayor. He has taken heat for his lack of leadership on simple things like getting the snow plows out during winter storms, to harder issues like crime, homelessness, and economic growth in a city whose business district has all the markings of a ghost town.\n\nIn a private poll taken two weeks ago, a clear majority of Pittsburgh Democrats (55% to 32%) favored O’Connor over Gainey with 14% undecided.\n\nThe survey also showed that a majority believe the city of Pittsburgh is on the wrong track under his leadership.\n\nIn reaction to Hallam’s tweet, local radio host Colin Dunlap admonished her for making the donations about race when clearly Gainey was taking more money from MAGA Republicans than O’Connor. More importantly, Dunlap said Gainey was losing because the city has been run to the ground since he took office. “Keep telling yourself it is about skin color,” Dunlap said.\n\nThe convoluted accusation started to gain national attention when the Intercept ran a similar story to the Guardian, noting, “Now that Republicans have won control of government in Washington they’re shifting their sights to a progressive enclave in Pennsylvania.”\n\nThen anti-gun activist Shannon Watts posted on X, “NEW: Trump’s advisors and donors are meddling in a Democratic primary to oust Pittsburgh’s first black mayor, Ed Gainey. This is a foreshadowing of what’s to come for incumbent Democratic mayors — especially black and brown mayors.”\n\nLocal elected Democrats, some allies of Gainey, some not, rolled their eyes at the donor stories.\n\nOne of those Democrats, who does not live in the city so he has no skin in the game, said, “No, Donald Trump is not trying to come here and take Gainey’s job away from him. Gainey himself took donations from MAGA donors.”\n\n“As for why Gainey is losing in the polling, sadly it has to do with his performance and what the city looks like, none of this has to do with race,” he added.","summary":"PITTSBURGH — The Democratic primary race between incumbent Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Corey O’Connor, the Allegheny County controller, has Gainey’s allies crying racism because O’Connor has received donations from Republican donors. “Can’t wait to see the back flips of the Gainey haters have to try to spin this one,” Bethany Hallam, a left-wing county [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3335901/pittsburgh-mayor-ed-gainey-took-maga-donations-too/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP24109771769795.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:36:30","author":"Salena Zito","authors":["Salena Zito"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":296375946,"title":"BC-SPORTS-BUDGET-NYT","text":"Sports stories from The New York Times News Service for Tuesday, March 4.

Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhy Were Bases Renamed?\n\nFort Moore received its name two years ago as part of a broad, bipartisan effort to rename landmarks and bases that honored Confederate soldiers. The push was led by a Department of Defense commission that provided renaming recommendations for bases, ships, streets and more named after Confederate soldiers. The commission was established in 2021 despite Trump’s opposition to the National Defense Authorization Act, the legislation that created the commission. Bipartisan majorities in Congress overrode a veto made by the president against the legislation. The push to change names was prompted by a national racial reckoning after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, which led to scrutiny of Confederacy-linked landmarks and installations for their associations with slavery and racism.\n\nKey Background\n\nHegseth has now renamed two bases back to names of veterans who share last names with Confederate generals. Hegseth said the Fort Liberty name change was to honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart. Hegseth said repeatedly prior to his role as defense secretary that the names of bases honoring Confederate generals should be changed back, calling the renaming efforts “a sham,” “garbage,” and “crap,” according to CNN, which cited interviews Hegseth gave throughout 2024. Hegseth’s push to rename the bases aligns with President Donald Trump’s vow to do so on the campaign trail last year, when he promised to change Fort Liberty’s name back to Fort Bragg.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDefense Secretary Hegseth Renames Fort Liberty To Fort Bragg—But Not After The Confederate General (Forbes)\n\nHegseth Revives the Old Name of Another Military Base (NYT)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

She let them know they were in experienced hands: She had deployed to Afghanistan three times, seen a fair share of combat and been awarded the Bronze Star.\n\nAlso, she told them, she was transgender.\n\nShe had worried about this moment since transitioning a year earlier. How would the soldiers react? Would they accept a trans woman as their leader?\n\nFor a few seconds, no one spoke. Then there were nods of acceptance. Other soldiers started introducing themselves as well, sharing something about their own lives.\n\nThen they all went to do morning physical training, just like every other squad in their battalion.\n\n\"At first, you could tell some were surprised,\" Becraft recalled earlier this year. \"But they saw I was genuine and respected my experience. Me being transgender just wasn't that much of a thing.\"\n\nBecraft does not recognize herself in the Trump administration's portrayal of transgender service members. The administration says, without providing evidence, that trans troops saddle the government with costly health care and corrode military effectiveness. An executive order in January asserted that being transgender \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful and disciplined lifestyle.\" Last week, the Defense Department released a memo saying that trans troops now serving would be forced out.\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States government to establish high standards for service-member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity,\" the memo explaining the policy said.\n\nEssential troops may be able to get a waiver, the policy states, if they don't transition and can show \"compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\"\n\nSome trans military members are challenging the policy in court.\n\nTrans troops say their experiences in uniform hardly fit the dark descriptions of their critics. In two dozen interviews, many told The New York Times that despite the dire depictions being transgender in the military is no big deal.\n\nThe troops interviewed -- three pilots, an explosives expert, a special operations officer, a nuclear reactor supervisor, a flight nurse, a missile battery commander and others -- said they have faced some institutional barriers and heard a few cutting comments. But mostly, they say, they have been treated with respect. Their leadership has supported them, their peers have accepted them, and they have earned good performance reviews and promotions.\n\nOfficers and troops who are not trans said in interviews they had not seen any negative impact from trans troops.\n\nNot that coming out was easy. Many of the trans troops said it was hard to come to terms with something they had been trying to deny for years. Becraft's marriage didn't survive. But when she told the Army that she was trans, her brigade offered her a temporary desk job with a more flexible schedule while she began her transition and went to therapy. A year later, she returned to leading soldiers.\n\n\"If anything, since I've transitioned, I've become a better leader,\" Becraft said in an interview before the ban was announced. \"I'm more comfortable. I don't have to hide anything. Now, maybe, I have more wisdom, and I think my soldiers respond to that.\"\n\nBefore the decision to discharge all trans soldiers was announced, she had hoped to be promoted to platoon sergeant this spring.\n\nMany trans troops, like millions of others in America, saw the military as a patriotic pathway for opportunity -- one that has become open to an increasingly diverse group of Americans.\n\nThe policy on trans military service, however, has been a tug of war between competing visions of the military for a decade. In 2016, six years after he signed a bill to let gay service members serve openly, President Barack Obama lifted a ban on transgender service. The next year, President Donald Trump announced a new ban, which President Joe Biden reversed in 2021.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, thousands of trans service members who had been serving in uniform for years came out.\n\nEven so, trans troops still make up only a tiny portion of the armed forces. There are currently 4,240 trans troops in the military, or about 0.2% of the force, according to numbers released Thursday.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nMany of them volunteered to serve not yet recognizing that they were transgender.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Jo Ellis was just out of high school in 2009 when she joined the Army National Guard as a helicopter mechanic. She deployed to combat as a door gunner, then became a Black Hawk helicopter pilot. In 2021, while going through the military's brutal survival school, where pilots endure mock torture, sleep deprivation and solitary confinement, she had a sudden realization that she was trans.\n\n\"I had been raised very conservative, church twice a week, home-school,\" Ellis said. \"Throughout my life, I was plagued by the desire to be a woman, but I never understood why. And suddenly I was so exhausted that I had no defenses left, and it just smacked me in the face.\"\n\nWorried that coming out would ruin her career, she hid how she felt for two years.\n\n\"Maybe there were trans people serving somewhere in the Army, but definitely not in my unit,\" she said. \"We're a very blue-collar, good-old-boy-type environment.\"\n\n\"I assumed the worst, but I was wrong,\" she said. \"When I came out, everyone in my unit just opened their arms to me.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called trans troops \"weird\" and \"a distraction.\" A number of military officers who have commanded units with trans troops said that was not their experience.\n\n\"They've tried to make a big deal out of this, just like they did in the past with integrating women or African Americans, but it's just a nothing-burger,\" said Capt. Justin Long, who retired from the Navy in 2023 after more than 20 years in uniform. \"I've had 15 trans sailors in my command over the years and never had an issue. The other sailors treat them like anyone else. All they want to know is, Will you show up and do your job?\"\n\nIn recent years, the military has looked at gender affirming medical care the same way it has regarded broken bones, cancer diagnoses or scores of other medical issues that troops encounter. To receive treatment, there must be a diagnosis, a treatment plan and coordination with commanders to avoid interference with deployments or critical training.\n\n\"We don't treat them any differently, and we shouldn't,\" Long said.\n\nHe said that forcing all trans troops out ignores the recommendations of senior leaders, and \"flies in the face of science and reality.\"\n\nThe Trump administration also claimed the cost of gender-affirming care is too high -- though it had not offered any figures.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Defense Department to release numbers for the first time. The figures showed the military has spent $52 million on gender-affirming care since 2015, or about $9,000 per individual. The department said about half of trans troops required no gender-affirming medical care, and only a quarter received gender-affirming surgery.\n\nThere is another cost that is rarely mentioned, said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy fighter pilot: the cost of losing highly trained service members.\n\nShilling has flown 60 combat missions and is the president of SPARTA Pride, an advocacy organization for trans troops. She said many trans troops are people like her: senior personnel who will be difficult and expensive to replace.\n\nThe Navy spent millions of dollars on her training and flight hours, and sent her to graduate school to prepare her for greater responsibilities, she said. She now helps to oversee a multibillion-dollar carrier-launched drone program.\n\n\"We're an extremely valuable asset to just throw away,\" Shilling said. \"Why would you want to get rid of someone you have so much invested in?\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nThe new policy makes clear that even people who transitioned years before, and are unlikely to represent any extra costs or time lost for the armed forces, can no longer serve.\n\nPetty Officer 2nd Class Paulo Bautista transitioned more than 10 years before he joined the Navy. His surgery was done, his hormone levels were stable, and the emotional turmoil of the process had long ago settled into a quiet confidence.\n\nThe only gender-related medical care he requires is a weekly testosterone shot. The military provides the same shots to about 5,000 men in uniform who are not trans and have low testosterone levels.\n\n\"Honestly, most people don't even know I'm trans, unless I tell them,\" he said.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, trans troops who had already started their transition in uniform were allowed to keep serving. Many who came out under the old regulations are shocked that this time they are being forced out.\n\nPetty Officer 2nd Class Sam Rodriguez joined the Navy as a diesel mechanic, then served as a military prison guard. Rodriguez, who is nonbinary and uses the pronouns they and them, got married, had two children and studied at night for a master's degree. Last fall, the Navy selected them to commission as an officer and train as a clinical social worker.\n\nBut the military now sees them as unfit to serve, and they face mandatory discharge. But before the new policy was announced, they saw their identity as an asset to the Navy.\n\n\"Since I've been on both sides of gender, and both sides of enlisted and officer experience, I have a lot of lived experience that will help me relate to people,\" they said. \"I joined the Navy to be part of the greater good, and giving good health care to people who serve is part of that.\"\n\nRodriguez said it was difficult at times to fit in to a military that dresses and houses troops based strictly on two genders. Forced to check a box, they reluctantly picked \"male.\"\n\n\"It can feel like you are an invisible person,\" Rodriguez said. \"But I realize we all have to make sacrifices, and that's something I decided I was willing to do to keep serving.\"\n\nNow, they feel they are being punished for following regulations, and wonder if that sacrifice was for nothing.\n\nAs Rodriguez contemplated being forced out, they asked, \"What will I do for my family?\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"SAN DIEGO -- Sgt. 1st Class Julia Becraft circled up a dozen infantry soldiers at Fort Cavazos, Texas, and introduced herself as their new squad leader.

Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America’s schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon “to put herself out of a job.”\n\nThe Senate voted to confirm McMahon 51-45.\n\nA billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut’s state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.\n\nMcMahon’s supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she’s unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.\n\n“Americans believe in public education,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the confirmation vote. “They don’t want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.”\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Trump’s blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department “operate more efficiently,” not to defund programs.\n\nShe acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.\n\nWeeks before McMahon’s confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon’s allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.\n\nCreated by Congress in 1979, the Education Department’s primary role is to disburse money to the nation’s schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.\n\nTrump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America’s schools.\n\nSchools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference “diversity” or “equity” alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.\n\nAlready, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department’s work.\n\nTrump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as “woke” and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation’s academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.\n\nSome of the cuts have halted work that’s ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that’s directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE’s cuts as merely an audit.\n\nMcMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Trump’s campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Trump has proposed adding a 25% fee on all Mexican and Canadian exports crossing those borders and an additional 10% for Chinese goods, beginning just after midnight Tuesday, saying those countries have not done enough to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. The move is likely to shatter regional supply chains and raise the cost of products ranging from automobiles to breast pumps and vegetables.

It's the latest boost that Trump has given the crypto industry, which spent some $130 million backing him and other Republicans. But the news drew criticism from many, including conservatives and even ardent crypto backers, over many concerns: giveaways to a wealthy community, delegitimizing the digital currency industry and more.

Opening the taps in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have voluntarily throttled supply to prop up prices, increases the risk that the world could soon find itself with more oil than it needs.

With a demonstrated lack of knowledge about even the most basic education laws and policies, McMahon is now the head of a department that Trump has called a “big con job” that he hopes to dismantle.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon after Democrats spent hours opposing the confirmation and a pending bill to ban trans girls and women from women’s sports from kindergarten through college. After confirming McMahon, Senate Republicans immediately, and ultimately unsuccessfully, moved to end debate on the bill, which would codify Trump’s change to Title IX that classifies trans-inclusive athletic policies as sex discrimination.\n\nCreated by Congress in 1979, the Department of Education is one of the largest agencies in the federal government, responsible for the disbursement of tens of billions of dollars each year for everything from preschool readiness programs to grants for low-income college students and school funding for students with disabilities. It holds more than $1.5 trillion in federal student loans from 43 million borrowers. It’s also responsible for ensuring that schools comply with a variety of federal laws, including Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination, and Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or national origin. \n\n“We need a Secretary of Education who will put students first, not billionaires, who will stand up for our students—every single one of them—even if it means standing up to Donald Trump and Elon Musk,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said on the Senate floor. “Linda McMahon fails to make the grade.”\n\nBest known as the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and a major Trump donor alongside her since-separated husband Vince, McMahon’s experience in education is limited. She worked for a semester as a student teacher while studying at Eastern Carolina University, served for a year in 2009 on the Connecticut State Board of Education (which ended after the Hartford Courant discovered she falsely claimed to have an education degree), and spent more than a decade on the board of a private Catholic university. She unsuccessfully ran for US Senate in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012. During the first Trump administration, she served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019 to join the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action. \n\nAccording to Senate Republicans, McMahon’s business track record matters much more than her skimpy experience in education.\n\n“I know that some people feel the Secretary of Education should have extensive experience in a school system. However, it is important to remember that education is still mostly a state and local responsibility,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. “The job is to manage a bureaucracy who [stet] runs a number of funding programs.”\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing in February, McMahon largely defended Trump’s vision for education in America, affirming her dedication to the expansion of school choice programs and following the administration’s interpretation of federal anti-discrimination laws—such as using Title IX to investigate schools that allow trans women and girls to play girls’ sports. As I reported:\n\nBetween outbursts from protesters at the Senate hearing—most of whom identified themselves as teachers—McMahon did not say whether she supports Trump’s plan to get rid of the department. She vowed that important programs protected by statute, such as the Title I program for high-poverty schools, Pell Grants, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, would continue.But she also expressed support for downsizing the department and suggested that other federal departments and agencies might be able to oversee key education-related programs. For example, she said the department’s Office of Civil Rights, which enforces federal anti-discrimination laws including Title VI and Title IX, might be better managed by the Department of Justice. Disabled students might have their funding and protections overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, she suggested.When asked about choosing between upholding the law—for example, administering education funds already appropriated by Congress—and carrying out Trump’s directives, McMahon said that “the president will not ask me to do anything that is against the law.” She repeatedly asserted that defunding federal educational programs is not the Trump administration’s goal—ignoring Musk’s directive to slash funding, cancel grants, and end contracts.\n\n“I believe the American people spoke loudly in the election last November to say they do want to look at waste, fraud and abuse in our government,” McMahon told the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, suggesting Musk’s budget cuts amount to an “audit.”\n\nAs for questions about multiple education laws, including the Every Student Succeeds Act, one of the major laws governing K-12 public schools, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, McMahon was unable to reply. When Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) asked McMahon about Title IX, the nominee mischaracterized the policy and incorrectly stated that under the 2020 Trump rules, colleges are obligated to investigate off-campus sexual assaults. (In fact, those rules expressly forbid universities from investigating off-campus assaults.) Her difficulty in demonstrating some understanding of the foundational laws and policies affecting education prompted groups including the National Education Association and the National Center for Learning Disabilities to condemn her nomination. After the hearing, nearly 100 civil rights organizations penned a letter urging senators to reject McMahon. \n\n“McMahon’s defense that she hopes to learn on the job what is required of a Secretary of Education would be a disqualifying answer in any environment,” the letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights read. “In this moment, when the threats to education are so overwhelming, and when so much damage has already been done in the first few weeks of this new administration, McMahon’s response is even more alarming.” \n\nAlong with nearly every federal agency, the Education Department has been upended since Trump took office. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has canceled nearly $1 billion in contracts, mostly affecting the department’s nonpartisan research arm that provides schools and states with valuable information about school performance. DOGE asserts that its calculations result in only about $450 million in savings. Dozens of department employees, including civil rights investigators, have been fired. In a prelude to a “very significant” workforce reduction, on Friday afternoon, the department’s top human resources official offered remaining employees a $25,000 buyout if they resigned by midnight on Monday, according to Politico.\n\nMeanwhile, the department has shut down income-driven repayment plans for student loan borrowers for at least three months. These plans tailor monthly loan payments to a person’s discretionary income and offer the lowest monthly payments compared to other plans. It has stopped investigations into race- and gender-based discrimination. In furthering Trump’s targeting of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, the department gave schools until the end of February to halt initiatives that, in its view, unlawfully discriminate to achieve “nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity.” The memo, which the department admits holds no legal weight, faces a legal challenge. Still, colleges across the United States have shuttered diversity offices and scrubbed all DEI references from their websites rather than risk federal funding. \n\nBut it’s not as if McMahon has not invested in education. According to her December 2024 financial disclosure report, she holds millions of dollars worth of bonds issued to colleges and school districts across the country.

That lack of firsthand knowledge has been framed as an asset by a White House looking to abolish the department she now leads and as a glaring deficiency by her critics.\n\nMcMahon, 76, told lawmakers during her confirmation process that she \"wholeheartedly\" agreed with President Donald Trump's \"mission\" to eliminate the Education Department. During her hearing last month, she argued that most Americans did, too, and that she was ready to make it happen.\n\nBut there appears to be significant public opposition to getting rid of the Education Department.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans said last week they opposed eliminating the agency, according to the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. In North Carolina, one of seven battleground states that Trump swept in November, a similar share, 63%, also said they opposed abolishing the agency, according to a Meredith College poll last month.\n\nThe Education Department has already been a top target of the aggressive government overhaul project overseen by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key Trump adviser. At least 60 employees have been suspended as part of the administration's purge of diversity efforts, and Musk's team has discussed the possibility of an executive order that would effectively shut down the department.\n\nOn Friday, employees in the Education Department were given a \"one-time offer\" of up to $25,000 if they agreed to retire or resign by the end of the day Monday. The message, sent by Jacqueline Clay, the department's chief human capital officer, said the offer was being made before the department underwent \"a very significant reduction in force.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with the Democrats and is that party's ranking member on the Senate Education Committee, said the department provides \"enormously important resources\" to children in high-poverty school districts and those with disabilities.\n\n\"We must make the Department of Education stronger and more efficient, not to dismantle it as Trump has proposed,\" Sanders said in a statement.\n\nMcMahon received a teaching certificate, but never taught. She has been a member of the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private school in Connecticut with about 8,500 students, for about 16 years. She and her husband, Vince McMahon, from whom she is separated, have donated millions to the Catholic university, where the student commons bears her name.\n\nShe also served for about a year on the Connecticut Board of Education, although some state lawmakers questioned her experience for the position and said she ran a wrestling company that promoted violent and sexual images to children.\n\nHer nomination to run the Education Department prompted a new round of concerns about her experience, as critics have said she is ill-prepared to navigate the effects that Trump's politically charged agenda may have on the nation's schools.\n\nTrump told reporters last month that the Education Department was \"a big con job\" and that \"I'd like to close it immediately.\" Musk has said the administration has terminated 89 contracts worth $881 million at the agency.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon presented a more nuanced version of potential changes. She said the administration planned to \"reorient\" the department while acknowledging that some of the agency's largest programs would remain in place. She also said core programs, such as Title I money for low-income schools and Pell grants for the poorest college students, would not be eliminated.\n\nShe also agreed that an act of Congress would be required to abolish the department, which was created in 1979 to ensure equal access to education, help parents and local communities improve the quality of education and coordinate federal education programs.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, McMahon served as the head of the Small Business Administration until stepping down in 2019 to run a super political action committee supporting Trump. That super PAC, America First Action, spent about $150 million before Trump's loss in 2020.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, McMahon was among the largest contributors to Trump's campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted Monday along party lines to confirm Linda McMahon as the nation's next education secretary, putting the former pro-wrestling executive in charge of an agency that the Trump administration wants to eliminate.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/senate-confirms-linda-mcmahon-as-education-secretary/article_7fd1d68c-aa78-58d3-98a6-c3034c88eee8.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:25:09","author":"Michael C.

Now comes the acid test for Europe: How many countries will step up, and does that even matter, given Russia's rejection of such a coalition as part of any settlement?\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain left those questions unanswered as he bade farewell to fellow leaders after a summit in London on Sunday. He conceded that \"not every nation will feel able to contribute,\" though he expressed optimism that several would, and that this would send a signal to President Donald Trump that Europe was ready to \"do the heavy lifting.\"\n\nDrawing Trump back into the process is as important as the mission and scope of a European coalition, analysts say. For the moment, the United States appears determined to strike a deal with President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the heads of Europe and Ukraine, and without any security guarantees.\n\nStarmer presented his coalition of the willing as one of multiple steps that included continued military aid for Ukraine to improve its position on the battlefield, a seat at the table for Ukraine in any peace negotiation and further help with its defensive capabilities after a settlement. That is where the coalition would come in.\n\nIn addition to Britain and France, northern European countries like Denmark and the Netherlands seem obvious candidates to take part. Both have been strong financial supporters of Ukraine's war effort and are NATO members who contributed to other security campaigns, like the one in Afghanistan. Germany is the second-largest contributor of military and other aid to Ukraine, after the United States.\n\nBut each country faces political and economic hurdles, such as the need to pass specific parliamentary measures in the Netherlands and the lack of a new government in Germany after recent elections. Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she had an \"open mind.\" Dick Schoof, prime minister of the Netherlands, said he had not yet made concrete commitments.\n\n\"We will renegotiate precisely these issues,\" departing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after Sunday's meeting, in what sounded like something less than a stirring call to arms. Ramping up military spending, he added, \"will require an effort that many are not yet really sufficiently prepared for.\"\n\nScholz's likely successor, Friedrich Merz, is scrambling to obtain a huge amount of funding for defense -- potentially at least 200 billion euros (about $207 billion) -- in the current German parliament because he faces the prospect of an opposition minority in the next that is big enough to block additional spending.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France said the nascent British-French plan would begin with a one-month truce between Ukraine and Russia. Any deployment of peacekeeping troops would come only after that, he said in an interview with French paper Le Figaro on Sunday evening.\n\n\"There will be no European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks,\" Macron said, noting the need for negotiations first. \"The question is how we use this time to try and obtain an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace has been signed, a deployment.\"\n\n\"We want peace,\" Macron said. \"We don't want it at any price, without guarantees.\"\n\nFrench Prime Minister François Bayrou took a harder line Monday night, telling lawmakers during a debate on Ukraine that \"what we have brutally discovered over the past few weeks\" was a \"stunning reality\" that the international rule of law was broken.\n\n\"They want to encircle us, to subjugate us, to bend us, too, to the law of the strongest -- and this on the part of our allies,\" Bayrou said, who plays little role in France's foreign policy.\n\nBut Bayrou insisted that \"we Europeans are stronger than we believe,\" as he called for increased military spending around the Continent. \"On this point, France is for once in agreement with Mr. Trump,\" he said. \"If we are strong, we can't ask others to defend us over the long term.\"\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has cultivated friendly ties with the Trump administration, remains skeptical of a peacekeeping force. On Sunday, she noted that deploying Italian troops \"has never been on the table\" and added that such an operation ran the risk of being \"highly complex and less effective.\"\n\nThere are also openly unwilling countries, notably Hungary, which has in the past tried to hold up additional European aid to Ukraine. Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban thanked Trump for his hostile treatment of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine during their Oval Office meeting last week.\n\nOrban and Robert Fico, Slovakia's prime minister, have demanded that the European Union push for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Both have threatened to block statements of support for Ukraine at an EU summit meeting this week. Neither leader was invited to the gathering in London.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nEuropean leaders fear that Orban could also hold up efforts to keep about $200 billion in Russian assets frozen when the decision to keep them locked up is up for renewal this summer. London just lent Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds (about $2.8 billion) that it says will be paid back with the interest on frozen Russian assets held in Britain.\n\n\"This requires unanimity,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland said of the vote to keep the assets frozen. \"We know what Hungary's position is, what it may be.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nEuropean leaders will gather Thursday for a specially planned European Council meeting, where officials are expected to discuss support for Ukraine and how to build up defense capabilities across the EU.\n\nThe point is to \"approve concrete decisions,\" Antonio Costa, president of the council, said during a news conference Monday.\n\nEven if Europe marshals a robust coalition, it is not clear that will satisfy Trump. On Monday, he was expected to meet with top aides to discuss suspending or canceling U.S. military aid to Ukraine, according to an administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nIn addition to shutting down military aid, Trump could also decide to pull back on intelligence sharing and training for Ukrainian troops and pilots, as well as on U.S. management of an office that coordinates international aid at a U.S. military base in Germany, the official said.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nFor Starmer, who has cast himself as a bridge between Europe and the United States, the diplomatic risks are high.\n\nBritain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, drew protests at home Monday after he told ABC News that Zelenskyy needed to give \"his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine.\"\n\nJames Cleverly, a Conservative former foreign secretary, posted on social media, \"The UK ambassador to Washington isn't meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion.\" He urged Starmer and the current foreign secretary, David Lammy, to \"grip this.\"\n\nBut Starmer has also rejected calls for Europe to distance itself from Trump, who he said was committed to a \"durable peace.\" He said he had discussed Europe's plans by phone with Trump on Saturday evening. He was likely to face close questioning about his strategy in Parliament.\n\n\"I wouldn't be taking this step down this road if I didn't think it would yield a positive outcome in terms of ensuring that we move together,\" Starmer said after his day of whirlwind diplomacy in London.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"LONDON -- Britain and France have promised to muster a \"coalition of the willing\" to secure a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

And they’ve acted very well. You know, they’re good people … they want to work it out,” Mr Trump said at the White House.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Sir Keir again promised British troops and jets would be available to a peacekeeping force if a deal is done to end the war, along with a “coalition of the willing” from other nations.\n\n“It is right that Europe do the heavy lifting to support peace on our continent,” he said.\n\n“But to succeed, this effort must also have strong US backing.”\n\nThe Prime Minister said the proposed minerals deal between the US and Ukraine is “not enough” of a security guarantee on its own.\n\nPlans for Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky to sign the minerals deal were put on hold after the Ukrainian leader left the White House early following their Oval Office bust-up.\n\nBut Mr Zelensky has since suggested he is ready to sign it.\n\nAsked what the Ukrainian leader needed to do to restart negotiations, Mr Trump said he should be “more appreciative” and that he “better not be right” about the war going on “for a long time”.\n\nMr Zelensky later tweeted that “peace is needed as soon as possible” and that the people of Ukraine “very much hope on US support on the path to peace”.\n\nMr Trump had suggested the deal would effectively act as the security “backstop” from the US that Sir Keir has called for.\n\nBut asked in the House of Commons whether the US presence brought by that deal would in itself be enough of a security guarantee, Sir Keir said no.\n\n“The mineral deal is not enough on its own”, Sir Keir said in response to a question from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, an ally of Mr Trump.\n\nSir Keir said Mr Trump’s commitment to peace was “sincere” and that a security guarantee should be led by Europe but needs US backing.\n\nSir Keir told MPs Britain needs to “lead from the front” and that the European “coalition of the willing” has been formed to avoid moving “at the speed of the most reluctant and that will be too slow”.\n\nHe also cautioned against accepting a “weak deal”.\n\nEarlier, the UK played down suggestions it supported a one-month truce in Ukraine as an initial step.\n\nDowning Street said various options are on the table but insisted no plan has been agreed after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said his country and Britain are backing the prospect of a limited ceasefire.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “What I’m not going to do is provide a running commentary on those options, but there are clearly a number of options on the table.”\n\nBut Sir Keir is clear that any peace deal “must be lasting, it must be durable, it must ensure that Ukraine has got significant defensive capabilities”.\n\nKey to the discussions, led by Britain and France, has been an insistence on the inclusion of an American backstop as part of any peacekeeping deal in order to deter future Russian aggression.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey is expected to visit the US later this week for talks with his counterpart Pete Hegseth.\n\nGermany and France meanwhile have reportedly started discussions of how 200 billion euros (£165 billion) of frozen Russian assets could be used as a way to hold Moscow to a potential ceasefire deal.\n\nBoth countries have previously been opposed to seizing Russian assets, about 300 billion US dollars worth of which were frozen across the continent after the invasion in 2022.\n\nFrench officials have discussed a proposal for European capitals to seize the assets if Moscow were to violate a future ceasefire deal and Germany’s likely next leader Friedrich Merz has indicated he would consider backing a proposal involving seizing frozen Russian assets, the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary recently called for the UK and its European allies to move from freezing Russian assets to seizing them.\n\nOn Sunday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves signed off on a £2.26 billion loan scheme to help Ukraine buy weapons and fund its reconstruction after the war, which will be repaid with the profits of frozen Russian assets.\n\nSir Keir told MPs on Monday that while the proceeds from the frozen assets are already being used, using the assets themselves is “a very complicated issue”.\n\nHe said: “We are doing more work to look at the possibilities, along with other countries, but I am not going to pretend that that is simple or straightforward.”","summary":"European leaders have called for the US to provide security guarantees for a Ukraine ceasefire

More than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post last February.\nCiting the smuggling of drugs across the border, Trump has vowed to stop or \"seriously limit\" such drugs, especially Fentanyl.\n\"Millions of people have died over the last two decades. The families of the victims are devastated and, in many instances, virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" read the Trump's post.\nIn addition, China will also be charged an additional 10 pc tariff from March 4.\n\"China will likewise be charged an additional 10 per cent Tariff on that date. The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect. Thank you for your attention to this matter. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" Trump added.

However, panelists representing environmental groups, industry and health research institutions agreed that the talks were not a failure.\"We would rather have a little bit more time to get a really strong treaty with global obligations than a weak and watered-down treaty,\" Mars Global Vice President of Packaging Sustainability Allison Lin said in the December panel discussion.Panelist Dr. Leonardo Trasande, who directs the NYU Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, agreed.\"I'm glad the treaty process is stalled because we are going to have a better treaty if we work out our issues,\" Trasande said. \"Ultimately, we need independent science to carry the day.\"Panelists discussed ways to reduce plastic waste through product design improvements, more financing for waste management systems and increased recycling. But one policy approach emerged as most critical: a reduction in the total amount of global plastic production. That was the key sticking point in the South Korea talks.The next treaty talks in Geneva will also take place with a new presidential administration in the U.S. While President Joe Biden's environmental officials had embraced a cap on plastic production, President Donald Trump's more industry-friendly team is unlikely to follow that policy.While many countries, states and major companies have taken steps to ban problematic plastics and set ambitious goals for waste reduction, the collective effort is still falling far short of what's needed to stem the tide of plastic waste.A report released in November by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that despite progress among signatories to its Global Commitment on plastic waste, many signatories are \"likely to miss key 2025 targets.\"","summary":"The last negotiations for a treaty to rein in plastic waste ended in a stalemate, but some participants saw signs of a possible breakthrough this summer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/global-plastics-treaty-talks-2025-dates-united-nations-environment-programme-unep-2039053","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2599622/plastic-waste-rivers.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:18:58","author":"Jeff Young","authors":["Jeff Young"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":296367690,"title":"Republican 'Can't Guarantee' Trump-Backed Budget Cuts Won't Hurt Veterans","text":"Republican Representative Greg Murphy of North Carolina said he \"can't guarantee\" that budget cuts won't negatively affect veterans.Newsweek reached out to Murphy's office via email Monday evening for comment.Why It MattersSince taking office at the end of January, President Donald Trump has issued sweeping changes via executive orders and implemented the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with the stated goal of cutting waste and abuse from the federal government's budget.Billionaire Elon Musk was initially tasked with leading DOGE. Under Trump's guidance, Musk and DOGE have initiated mass firings of government workers and made numerous cuts to federal agencies, including dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).Critics have accused the Trump administration of exceeding the power of the executive branch and have responded by filing a number of lawsuits intended to block executive orders and to limit the reach of DOGE.What To KnowDuring an interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar on Monday, Murphy was asked about budget cuts, as more than 1,000 staff members from the Department of Veterans Affairs were let go. Murphy is vice chair of Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health.Murphy was asked about what voters in his district think of the cuts. He replied in part by arguing that it was \"a national emergency to try to get our finances under control.\"Keilar then asked if veterans' benefits and care will not be affected by the financial restructuring. Murphy responded, \"No, I can't guarantee anything.\"\"But the whole purpose, again, of restructuring is to make sure that that agency is efficient,\" Murphy added. \"And you know, look, I care for our veterans. One out of 10 constituents of mine are veterans. It's a real issue in eastern North Carolina.\"\"The real issue is also when somebody can't get benefits, and they're put off their doctor's appointments for eight or 10 months when they can't get care,\" he continued. \"That is where an agency has failed. We're trying to get an agency that actually works for the people that are supposed to be taken care of.\"What People Are SayingProgressive veterans group VoteVets, responding to Murphy's remarks in a post to X, formerly Twitter: \"Republican Greg Murphy was asked point-blank if Veterans would lose their benefits due to GOP cuts. His answer? 'No, I can't guarantee anything.' This is the Republican Party under Trump: shrugging off the well-being of Veterans while pushing reckless cuts. They talk about supporting the Troops—then refuse to stand up for them when it matters.\"Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, while sharing an image of herself with Veterans of Foreign Wars members to X on Monday: \"Proud to meet with the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Nearly 30% of federal workers are veterans. Americans who raised their hands to serve us in the Armed Forces and then continued that service in the federal government. Cutting their jobs is a disgrace.\"What Happens NextThe extent to which the Trump budget cuts could affect veterans remains unclear. Any further cuts or mass firings are all but certain to inspire additional backlash from veterans groups and advocates.","summary":"Representative Greg Murphy said Trump's mission to slash the federal budget was in response to \"a national emergency.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-cant-guarantee-trump-backed-budget-cuts-wont-hurt-veterans-2039039","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2599598/veterans-affairs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:18:28","author":"Aila Slisco,Anna Commander","authors":["Aila Slisco","Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":296368970,"title":"Starmer says Europe is at ‘crossroads in history’ as leaders agree to steps to Ukraine peace","text":"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rallied his European counterparts yesterday [Macau time] to shore up their borders and throw their full weight behind Ukraine as he announced outlines of a plan to end Russia’s war.\n\n“Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can, bringing different capabilities and support to the table, but all taking responsibility to act, all stepping up their own share of the burden,” he said.\n\nStarmer’s exhortation to 18 fellow leaders that they need to do the heavy lifting for their own security comes two days after U.S. backing of Ukraine appeared in jeopardy when President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he wasn’t grateful enough for America’s support.\n\nThe meeting had been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding that took place on live television at the White House. Starmer used the opportunity as part of his broader effort to bridge the gap between Europe and the U.S. and also salvage what had seemed like the start of a peace process before Friday’s spat.\n\nStarmer said he had worked with France and Ukraine on a plan to end the war and that the group of leaders — mostly from Europe — had agreed on four things.\n\nThe steps toward peace would: keep aid flowing to Kyiv and maintain economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine’s hand; make sure Ukraine is at the bargaining table and any peace deal must ensure its sovereignty and security; and continue to arm Ukraine to deter future invasion.\n\nA ‘coalition of the willing’\n\nFinally, Starmer said they would develop a “coalition of the willing” to defend Ukraine and guarantee the peace.\n\n“Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back,” he said. “Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others.”\n\nIt is far from certain whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will accept any such plan, which Starmer said would require strong U.S. backing. He did not specify what that meant, though he told the BBC before the summit that there were “intense discussions” to get a security guarantee from the U.S.\n\n“If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,” Starmer said.\n\nStarmer said he will later bring a more formal plan to the U.S. and work with Trump.\n\nBefore arriving in London, French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in an interview with a French newspaper that he and Starmer are proposing a “truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures” that would last a month.\n\nThere would be no European troops in the coming weeks and troops would only be deployed on the ground at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe question, Macron said, is “how we use this time to try and get an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a deployment.”\n\nTwo diplomatic steps forward, one back\n\nEurope has been anxious since Trump initiated direct peace talks with Putin, who had been isolated by most Western leaders since invading Ukraine three years ago. The scramble to remain relevant and protect European interests as their once stalwart ally appeared to be cozying up to Putin was even more troubling when Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely said Ukraine started the war.\n\nMeetings last week had provided some hope — until Zelenskyy’s trip to the White House on Friday.\n\nVisits to the Oval Office by Starmer and Macron, who had declared his visit a “turning point,” were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained that Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.\n\nWithin 12 hours of Starmer’s return from Washington, the talk of peace seemed to collapse as Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy for challenging Trump’s assertions that Putin could be trusted.\n\nDuring his press conference, Starmer rejected the suggestion that the U.S. was no longer a reliable ally.\n\n“There are no two countries as closely aligned as our two countries and our defense, our security and intelligence is intertwined in a way no two other countries are, so it’s an important and reliable ally for us,” he said.\n\nStarmer does not trust Putin\n\nStarmer told the BBC before the summit that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Trump.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni said she was sorry for what happened with Zelenskyy in Washington. Meloni is both a strong Ukraine supporter and — as head of a far-right party — she is a natural ally of Trump. She was the only European leader to attend his inauguration.\n\nShe said told reporters following the meeting that Europe must remain focused on its common goals and that “dividing the West would be disastrous for everyone.”\n\n“We need to work to reinforce our unity, and I think that Italy can play a role, not just in its own interest, but in everyone’s,” she said. “I don’t want to take any other scenario into consideration.”\n\nStarmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following his charm offensive with Macron to persuade Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.\n\nLeaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, the NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance.\n\nTurning Ukraine into a ‘steel porcupine’\n\nStarmer used sweeping terms to describe the challenge ahead, saying Europe was at a crossroads in its history and needed to step up to meet “once in a generation moment.”\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen emerged from the meeting and said she would present a plan to “rearm Europe” to bolster the bloc’s security after a long period of underinvestment.\n\nAs for the future of war-torn Ukraine, von der Leyen said it needs security guarantees.\n\n“We have to put Ukraine in a position of strength so that it has the means to fortify itself and to protect itself,” von der Leyen said. “It’s basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.”\n\nLast week, Starmer pledged to boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027. Other European nations may follow suit.\n\nStarmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles.
