(Photo by Ifeanyi Immanuel Bakwenye / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nDana Malcolm \nNovember 26, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Nigeria declares national emergency after mass kidnappings \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAGOS, Nigeria (AFP) — Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu on Wednesday declared a “nationwide security emergency” as the country scrambled to respond to a wave of mass kidnappings that have seen hundreds of people, mostly schoolchildren, captured in a week.\n\n“This is a national emergency, and we are responding by deploying more boots on the ground, especially in security-challenged areas,” Tinubu said in a statement.\n\nWithin days, assailants across the country kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 worshippers, more than 300 schoolchildren and teachers from a Catholic school, 13 young women and girls walking near a farm, and another 10 women and children.\n\nDozens have been rescued and others escaped but 265 children and their teachers seized from a Catholic boarding school in the country’s Niger state on Friday are still missing.\n\n“In view of the emerging security situation, I have decided to declare a nationwide security emergency and order additional recruitment into the Armed Forces,” Tinubu said.\n\nAt the weekend he ordered a redeployment of police VIP bodyguards to core policing duties, and has ordered the hiring of another 50,000 new police recruits.\n\nAccording to the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) more than 100,000 of the estimated 371,000-strong force were previously assigned to protect politicians and VIPs.\n\nIn addition to a 16-year jihadist insurgency raging in the northeast, Nigeria is plagued by persistent insecurity, with frequent kidnappings for ransom.\n\nThe first mass abduction to shock Nigeria was in 2014 when the jihadist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 teenage girls in Chibok, in the northeast, sparking an international outcry.\n\nSince then thousands of kidnappings have occurred. Some go unreported.\n\n– ‘Flush out terrorists’ –\n\nFor years, heavily armed criminal gangs have been intensifying attacks in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria, where there is little state presence, killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom.\n\nThe gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states including Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger from where they launch attacks.\n\nTinubu said he was also authorising the intelligence department to “immediately” deploy forest guards to “flush out the terrorists and bandits lurking in our forests” as well as to hire more staff to patrol them.\n\n“The times require all hands on deck,” he said.\n\nHe vowed to continue “efforts to rescue” the students and other people still in captivity.\n\nIn the 12 months between July last year and June 2025, at least 4,722 people were kidnapped in 997 incidents, and at least 762 were killed, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence.\n\nIt said kidnappers demanded some 48 billion naira overall but only managed to get 2.57 billion naira (around $1.66 million).\n\nDuring that period “Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry,” said the Lagos-based security advisory firm.\n\nThe latest attacks struck just weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened Nigeria with military action over the alleged killing of Christians in large numbers by radical Islamists.\n\nTinubu urged mosques and churches to seek security protection when they congregate for prayers, particularly in vulnerable areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: emergency kidnappings Nigeria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Miguel Coley agrees to join Reggae Boyz coaching staff \n\n\n\n\n ANDRE LOWE Sports content manager lowea@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n Former Reggae Boyz Assistant Coach Miguel Coley has officially agreed to return to the role on an interim basis, following the finalisation of a deal ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Samuda applauds universities for launching Higher Education Disaster Task Force (HEDE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change Matthew Samuda has commended Jamaica’s tertiary institutions for establishing a H... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Portland principal helps community ‘press’ forward after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n PORTLAND, Jamaica — A Portland-based school leader has been receiving widespread praise after turning the school into a hub for parents and other comm... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JDSF raises over $3.1 million to support Hurricane Melissa relief efforts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Down’s Syndrome Foundation (JDSF) has secured more than $3.1 million in sponsorship from the second staging of its Bre... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Consultations to be held on establishment of one road authority \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Consultations will be held with key stakeholders regarding the establishment of the One Road Authority, which will regulate the ma... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Campbell’s responds to employee’s ‘absurd’ claim it uses 3D-printed chicken \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Food giant Campbell's has dismissed as \"absurd\" claims allegedly made by a senior executive, who has since been plac... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘More than two light post deep’ \n\n\n Chigwell residents turn to rafting as water continues to rise in Hanover community \n\n\n BY KELSEY THOMAS Online coordinator thomask@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nNovember 26, 2025 \n\n\n Nearly a month after Hurricane Melissa tore through western Jamaica, rising floodwaters in Chigwell and Old Pen in Hanover continue to swallow roads, ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

FBI Director Kash Patel and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said they were hospitalized in critical condition. The rare shooting of National Guard members comes as the presence of the troops in the nation’s capital and other cities around the country has been a flashpoint issue for months, fueling court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration’s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem. Jeffrey Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief, said investigators had no information on a motive. He said the assailant “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops, citing video reviewed by investigators. “This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said. Two law enforcement officials and a person familiar with the matter said the suspect was believed to be an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and has been living in Washington state. The suspect has been identified by law enforcement officials as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, but authorities were still working to fully confirm his background, they said. The people could not discuss details of an ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially said the troops had died, but he later walked that statement back to say his office was “receiving conflicting reports” about their condition. A suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington following the shooting. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said President Donald Trump asked him to send the extra troops. Nearly 2,200 troops currently are assigned to the joint task force operating in the city, according to the government’s latest update. Troops held down the shooter The shooting happened roughly two blocks northwest of the White House near a metro station. After hearing gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the gunman after he was shot, Carroll said. “It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said, adding that it was not clear whether one of the guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect. “At this point we have no other suspects,” Carroll said at a news conference. At least one of the guard members exchanged gunfire with the shooter, said another law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Social media video shared in the immediate aftermath showed first responders performing CPR on one of the troops and treating the other on a glass-covered sidewalk. Witnesses saw people fleeing Stacy Walters said she was in a car when she heard two gunshots and saw people running. Almost instantly, law enforcement swarmed the area. “It’s such a beautiful day. Who would do this? And we’re getting ready for the holidays?” Emma McDonald, who exited a metro station just after the shots were fired, said she and a friend sought safety with others in a cafe. McDonald told AP that minutes later she saw first responders rolling a stretcher carrying a National Guard member whose head was covered in blood. More than 300 West Virginia National Guard members were deployed to Washington in August. Last week about 160 of them volunteered to extend their deployment until the end of the year, while the others returned to West Virginia just over a week ago. Police tape cordoned off the scene, and fire and police vehicle lights flashed and helicopter blades thudded overhead. Agents from the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were there, and National Guard troops stood sentry nearby. At least one helicopter landed on the National Mall. Trump vows that shooter will pay The president, who was in Florida for Thanksgiving, warned in a statement on social media that the “animal” who shot the guard members “will pay a very steep price.” “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,”...","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/two-national-guard-members-shot-near-white-house-1919880","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/27/1983243-aa-6009341-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 01:16:21","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":382558422,"title":"STOXX 600 climbs on Fed cut hopes; banks rally","text":"FRANKFURT: Europe’s main equity indexes closed higher on Wednesday, led by technology stocks as growing expectations of a US rate cut boosted global risk appetite, while financials also found support following the UK budget announcement.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.06 percent to 574.01 points at the close, extending its winning streak to a third straight session.\n\nMajor regional indexes also firmed, with Germany and France up about 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.\n\nTechnology shares were the biggest boost to the benchmark index, up 2.1 percent, tracking upbeat global sentiment as investors grew more confident about the possibility of a Fed rate cut in December.\n\nChip equipment maker ASML jumped 5.7 percent, BESI 4 percent, and chipmaker Infineon advanced 3.7 percent.\n\n“We’re continuing to see the Federal Reserve easing expectations drive risk appetite at the margin, and that’s leading to this broad-based advance, not only in the US, but certainly looking at European markets today,” said Laura Cooper, head of macro credit at Nuveen.\n\nBloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, who has called for lower interest rates, was widely viewed as the leading contender for the post of Fed chair.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there were good chances of President Donald Trump announcing his pick for the Fed chair before Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile in the UK, British finance minister Rachel Reeves announced a big tax-raising budget that will take more money from workers but kept banks exempted from fresh targeted taxes.\n\nLondon’s FTSE 100 added 0.85 percent, boosted by shares in British banks.

Backers of Ukraine have worried that a U.S.-based 28-point framework for ending the war in Ukraine, first reported last week, means Trump's administration might be willing to push Kyiv to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow.'This so-called 'peace plan' has real problems, and I am highly skeptical it will achieve peace,' Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Friday. Those fears escalated when Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, in an Oct. 14 telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin's policy aide Yuri Ushakov, said they should work together on a ceasefire plan and that Putin should raise it with Trump.'For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign & democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he? He should be fired,' Republican Rep. Don Bacon said on X. While Trump's party remains overwhelmingly behind him, the criticism from Republican lawmakers is notable, given the president's recent setbacks, including Democratic election victories this month and Congress backing the release of Justice Department files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, an outcome Trump fought for months.","summary":"The attacks from members of the president's own party, along with recent political headwinds, could signal a bigger problem for the administration.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/11/27/world/politics/trump-ukraine-republican-lawmakers/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/11/27/508297.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:52:00","author":"Patricia Zengerle,Web Master","authors":["Patricia Zengerle","Web Master"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"JP","sentiment":0.039},{"id":382558464,"title":"What we know about the Washington, D.C., shooting of two National Guard members","text":"Two National Guard members were shot in broad daylight in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday afternoon, just one day before Thanksgiving, in what officials described as a \"targeted\" attack. The guard members are in critical condition, authorities said. They were shot in the head, according to a U.S. official and a senior official directly briefed on the investigation. The suspect was also shot and taken to a hospital. He has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said. Follow live updates National Guard members have been based in Washington since August following President Donald Trump's highly contested directive to curb crime in the nation's capital. The shooting The shooting happened at 2:15 p.m. Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station in the area of 17th and High streets NW, just a few minutes’ walk from the White House. At the time, National Guard members were on “high visibility patrols,” said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Metropolitan Police Department. The two National Guard members were \"ambushed\" by a person who \"came around the corner, raised his arm with a firearm and discharged at the National Guard members,\" Carroll said at a news conference. The suspect was shot “during the interaction,” Carroll said, though it's not clear who shot him, and was taken to a hospital for treatment. Other National Guard members were in the area and intervened by holding the suspect down after he had been shot until he was taken into custody. Officials said there no other suspects. Carroll said both guard members are being treated at a local hospital. Flight tracking data showed a medical helicopter landed on the National Mall, then flew to MedStar Washington Hospital Center following the shooting. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the shooting “targeted,” saying the suspect who was taken into custody “appeared to target these guardsmen.” What we know about the victims The two National Guard members were from the West Virginia National Guard. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially posted on X that both died from their injuries, but he later backtracked and clarified that his office has received \"conflicting reports\" about their conditions. Around 2,100 National Guard troops were serving in Washington as of Wednesday morning, including 181 West Virginia National Guard members, the joint task force operating in the city said. What we know about the suspect Lakanwal, the man law enforcement sources said has been identified as the suspect, is 29, and his last known location was in Bellingham, Washington, the four senior law enforcement sources told NBC News. He has been initially identified as an Afghan national who used a handgun, according to two senior U.S. law enforcement officials. What is the status of the investigation? FBI Director Kash Patel called the attack \"a horrendous act of violence.\" He promised at a news conference Wednesday that the perpetrator \"will be brought to justice\" and said the matter will be treated as an assault on a federal law enforcement officer. The FBI will initially investigate the shooting as possible act of terrorism, two senior U.S. law enforcement officials said. President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that the shooter was “severely wounded” and will “pay a very steep price.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-to-know-dc-national-guard-shooting-rahmanullah-lakanwal-rcna246154","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251126-national-guard-ch-1839-5dd8b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:48:45","author":"Marlene Lenthang,Tom Winter","authors":["Marlene Lenthang","Tom Winter"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":382559042,"title":"‘Russia Has No Vote’ on NATO, Rutte Reminds West","text":"In an interview earlier this week with Spanish daily El Pais, in which he announced $5 billion in military support to Kyiv, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also touched on the subject of Ukraine’s eventually joining the Alliance’s ranks.\n\nRutte insisted that, not matter what the latest draft peace plan may look like between the aggressor and the defenders of their sovereign territory, Russia has no say in Ukraine’s accession to NATO; but rather that this decision depends solely on the unanimity of member states.\n\n “Russia has no vote and no veto over who becomes a NATO member,” he said.\n\n “At the Washington summit, we decided that Ukraine is on an irreversible path toward NATO. At the same time, several allies, including the US have said they are currently opposed to Ukraine joining,” he said.\n\nHe insisted that Ukraine must be provided with sufficiently reliable security guarantees so that Russia will never attempt to attack Ukraine again if NATO membership is not an option.\n\n“The first question is how to keep the Ukrainian Armed Forces strong, the second is what a coalition of the willing can provide, and the third is what the US will contribute, since President [Donald] Trump has said before meeting Putin in Alaska, that he wants to be involved in security guarantees. That discussion is ongoing,” said the Dutch former prime minister, who has managed to build more trust with Trump than the majority of his European counterparts.\n\nWhen asked if Ukraine might join NATO in the future, the NATO chief replied that the 1949 Washington Treaty allows any country in the Euro-Atlantic region to join. “But without unanimity among all allies, it isn’t possible,” he added.\n\nThe only way it would be possible is if the Alliance voted to amend Article 10 of the treaty that demands unanimous votes for new members, but that also would require coming to a consensus among all of its members, not just some, which is a fundamental principle of NATO decision-making.\n\nThe NATO Secretary General also insisted that Russia remains a long-term threat to Europe.\n\n“If a Russian president is willing to sacrifice a million of his own people for this fallacy to correct history, we must be prepared. That’s why we need to spend so much more in our defense. A peace plan doesn’t change the assessment that Russia is a long-term threat to Europe,” he said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said that issues concerning the European Union and NATO within the peace plan will be placed on a separate negotiation track.\n\nThe Kremlin, by contrast, has regularly pointed out NATO’s eastward expansion in the 21st century as a major reason for its unprovoked full-scale invasion.","summary":"Responding to the draft peace plan prepared by Washington, NATO chief insists that Ukraine is on an “irreversible path” to membership, even if some allies are hesitant in order to get deal done.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/65063","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/11/06/519cf07029d1a5417de0bb9b93872f59.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:46:42","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":0.183},{"id":382559478,"title":"Judges Allow North Carolina To Use A Map Drawn In Bid To Give Republicans Another U.S. House Seat","text":"RALEIGH, N.C.

A three-judge panel from the District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina unanimously denied preliminary injunction requests brought by a pair of lawsuits that said the new map was aimed at diluting the voting strength of Black voters. The judges found that the challengers \"presented no direct evidence\" that the North Carola Legislature enacted the map for racially discriminatory purposes. \"Instead, the direct evidence shows that the 2025 redistricting was motivated by partisan purposes,\" the panel wrote Wednesday in a 57-page opinion. The ruling comes after the Republican-controlled North Carolina Legislature last month approved a map aimed at expanding the number of Republican seats in the House. The challengers, in a pair of consolidated lawsuits, asked the court to block the state from using the new borders of two congressional districts for next year's midterms. The map aims to flip North Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, which President Donald Trump narrowly won in 2024. It's represented by Democrat Rep. Don Davis, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Republicans currently hold 10 of the state’s 14 congressional districts. Trump has led the charge for Republican-led legislatures to redraw congressional maps heading into the midterms, when the GOP will be defending a slim majority in the House. That move has prompted some Democrat-led states, like California, to pursue new maps of their own. After the court's ruling Wednesday, state Senate Republican leader Phil Berger said the map is designed to bolster Trump's agenda. “As Democrat-run states like California do everything in their power to undermine President Trump’s administration and agenda, North Carolina Republicans went to work to protect the America First Agenda,\" he said in a statement. \"North Carolinians voted to send President Trump to the White House in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new map reflects that support.

Her two younger siblings were born in the United States.\n\nShe received temporary legal protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that has shielded tens of thousands of people who arrived in the country as children without legal status, and she was in the process of obtaining a green card, according to her legal team.\n\nThat would place Ferreira among more than 20 DACA recipients and dozens of young immigrants who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since January, according to advocacy campaign Home Is Here.\n\nHer arrest is among many in a “random and cruel mass deportation campaign” under an administration that has performed warrantless searches, arrested and deported immigrants without due process, and stripped legal protections for tens of thousands of people who were allowed to live and work in the country, according to Rubin.\n\n“It's outrageous and abhorrent, and the rhetoric alone is disgusting,” he said.\n\nTrump’s government-wide anti-immigration agenda has sought to dramatically reshape DACA, which Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin recently stressed “does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”\n\nDACA is not necessarily a path to permanent legal status, and new applications have been suspended for nearly a decade since the first Trump administration unsuccessfully sought to end the program altogether.\n\nBut there is “a strong bipartisan consensus that people like her should have a path to stay,” according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with immigration advocacy and policy group the American Immigration Council.\n\nFerreira was previously engaged to Michael Leavitt, the brother of Karoline Leavitt, but they broke up more than 10 years ago, according to the family. Ferreira and Leavitt share custody of their son, who lives with Michael and his wife in New Hampshire.\n\nWhen Michael won $1 million from a DraftKings contest eight months after their son was born, Ferreira said the couple was not in want of anything.\n\n“I need the lights fixed on the back of my car,” she told The Cullman Times in 2014. “And we need a lamp for my son’s room. Other than that we don’t really need much. We have our health. We have a nice condo. We really are blessed.”\n\nThey separated shortly after.\n\nHer younger sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, launched a GoFundMe to raise money for her legal defense. “Anyone who knows Bruna knows the kind of person she is,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it. Whether it’s supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.”\n\nShe told the Boston Globe that Michael Leavitt and his father, Bob Leavitt, had urged Ferreira to “self-deport” after her arrest.\n\n“Brazil is not her home,” Dos Santos Rodrigues said. “They’re trying to push it off as a vacation. That’s not a vacation. Bruna barely speaks the language.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt, who has posted several photos with her nephew on social media, has not reached out to Dos Santos Rodrigues or her family, she said.\n\nHer nephew also met Trump earlier this year inside the White House, according to photographs shared by the Leavitts on social media.\n\n“If she were to help in any way, if she were willing to do anything to help us, she would have reached out by now,” Dos Santos Rodrigues told the Boston Globe. “I understand the policies and how it looks. But I also think when it comes to family, you put certain things aside. I don’t care who you work for.”\n\nIn a message to reporters, Michael Leavitt said, “My only concern has always been the safety, well being, and privacy of my son.”\n\nHomeland Security, meanwhile, has described the mother of Karoline Leavitt’s nephew as a “criminal illegal alien” who has been accused of battery. Her lawyers said they have “found nothing” to support those allegations.\n\nOfficials also accused Ferreira of overstaying a tourist visa that required her to leave the country in 1999, when she was seven years old. “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation,” a spokesperson for Homeland Security said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“This is all just rhetoric and turning the law on its head,” Rubin told The Independent.\n\nFerreira’s legal team is requesting a bond hearing in immigration court to secure her release from ICE custody.\n\nThis week, a federal judge in California struck down the Trump administration’s policy that blocked most immigrants who entered the country without legal permission from remaining in detention throughout their removal proceedings.\n\nThat decision could potentially allow thousands of immigrants who have been locked up through the course of their removal cases to be released.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the White House.","summary":"Trump administration has labeled mother of press secretary’s nephew a ‘criminal illegal alien’ as her siblings and legal team fight for her release","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/karoline-leavitt-bruna-ferreira-ice-daca-b2873352.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/26/8/17/96774093_1763693437818024_r-(1).jpeg?crop=607.5,405,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dcSv7wYY-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:30:37","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":382556190,"title":"Trump floats idea of sending $2K tariff ‘dividends’ to taxpayers, economist shares his take","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Bottom Line November 26, 2025 04:49 \n\n Trump floats idea of sending $2K tariff ‘dividends’ to taxpayers, economist shares his take \n The Heritage Foundation chief economist E.J.

domestic market with new steel, lumber tariff supports","text":"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Mark Carney wants the Canadian lumber and steel sectors to look for more opportunities at home as U.S. tariffs and shifting global trade tides limit their opportunities abroad.\n\nCarney unveiled a suite of new supports for the tariff-stricken sectors at an event on Parliament Hill on Wednesday.\n\nHe told reporters that since U.S. President Donald Trump launched his global tariff campaign, many of Canada's \"strengths have become our vulnerabilities.\"\n\nHe pointed out that in 2024, 75 per cent of Canada's exports — and 90 per cent of its lumber, aluminum and steel exports — went to the U.S. Almost half of Canada's steel goes to the U.S. in a typical year, but those exports are now down 24 per cent annually.\n\nThe steel industry continues to be hammered by the 50 per cent tariffs Trump imposed in June.\n\nCarney said steel producers must now find new markets for those products and he wants the domestic Canadian market to help fill that void.\n\nMany of the measures Carney unveiled Wednesday are aimed at boosting the use of Canadian steel and lumber in domestic homebuilding and infrastructure projects.\n\nOttawa's new Buy Canadian plan means firms must prioritize the use of Canadian materials — steel, aluminum, lumber — in federal government defence or construction contracts worth $25 million or more.\n\nThe new measures tighten the quota on steel imports from countries that don't have free trade pacts with Canada from 50 per cent to 20 per cent of 2024 levels.\n\nThat measure is meant to allow Canadian steel producers to fill the gap in the domestic market, opening up an estimated $854 million in domestic demand.\n\nCountries outside of the United States and Mexico that do have trade pacts with Canada will also see their quotas dropped from 100 per cent to 75 per cent of last year's levels.\n\nAny steel imported above those thresholds will be hit with a surtax of 50 per cent.\n\nOttawa is also levying a new global 25 per cent tariff on steel-derivate products such as wind towers, prefabricated buildings, fasteners and wires.\n\nThose measures, which take effect on Dec. 26, include sharper declines in quotas than the measures Carney announced in July.\n\nCarney said Trump's move to tariff more steel derivatives in August and the recent increase in lumber tariffs motivated Wednesday's announcement.\n\nBut he also said that the new supports and restrictions on inflows of foreign steel are not targeted at the United States specifically.\n\n\"It's a global approach that is creating space for Canadian steel producers to fill it,\" he said.\n\n\"We are limiting foreign steel imports to ensure that Canadian steel producers have a bigger share of the Canadian market. Doing so will unlock hundreds of millions of dollars in domestic demand for Canadian producers.\"\n\nTrade talks between Canada and the United States have been on pause since Trump ended negotiations over an Ontario ad campaign featuring former president Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Carney said Wednesday that Canada remains ready to \"re-engage\" when the U.S. comes back to the table.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Wednesday that Carney was spending \"billions more\" to bail himself out from broken promises to negotiate a deal with Trump.\n\nPoilievre said Conservatives \"want to negotiate a hard bargain to protect them and get them re-entry into the American market, tariff-free.\" He also repeated calls to remove the industrial carbon price to offer relief to affected sectors.\n\nWith north-south supply chains to the United States hampered by tariffs, Carney also announced measures to help domestic firms send their products across the country instead.\n\nStarting next spring, the federal government will offer subsidies to rail companies to cut freight fees in half on shipments of steel and lumber across provincial borders for a year.\n\nThis would cost the federal government $146 million annually, based on 2024 figures, according to a senior government official at a media briefing on the announcement Wednesday. The official noted stronger uptake for the program would drive the cost higher.\n\nOttawa is also giving more training and resources to the Canada Border Services Agency to crack down on steel dumping — foreign producers flooding the Canadian market with cheap product to undercut the domestic industry.\n\nCanadian Steel Producers Association president and CEO Catherine Cobden broadly welcomed the measures announced Wednesday, particularly the efforts to crack down on dumping.\n\n“By further tightening and broadening border measures, providing support for workers and lowering freight rail rates, Canada is serious about protecting its domestic industry from the ongoing overcapacity crisis and that the country is prepared to take action to protect our market,\" she said in a media statement.\n\nIndustry Minister Melanie Joly told reporters in a callback from Tokyo earlier Wednesday that Canada will continue to engage with trading partners, including China, while \"defending our national interest.\"\n\nShe said she's hearing from allies in the European Union and South Korea that they're also moving to protect their domestic steel sectors.\n\n\"The internal market can actually be a market that is profitable for our steel sector, as long as they're able to have access to the market without any form of dumping from any other countries that are creating, manufacturing, producing steel,\" she said.\n\nCanada is also extending a remission program launched last spring that offers producers in the manufacturing, food and beverage and agricultural production industries relief from Canada's steel tariffs. That program, which was set to expire on Dec. 15, will now end on Jan. 31 of next year.\n\nCarney said that while that program can't be sustained indefinitely, it will be extended again to give domestic firms more time to adjust their supply chains to use more Canadian steel.\n\nA senior government official told a technical briefing before Carney's announcement that this will be the last extension of the program, which was first expected to end in October but was extended for two months at that time.\n\nSoftwood lumber, which has long been a target of U.S. tariffs, is currently taxed at 45 per cent after the Trump administration increased the rate last month.\n\nCarney said the federal government is adding an extra $500 million in loan guarantees for the softwood lumber industry on top of other measures to encourage homebuilders to use made-in-Canada materials.

The troops are part of the National Guard surge Trump ordered in August to address rising crime in the nation’s capital after a series of high-profile incidents, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern.\n\nDemocrats had long opposed Trump’s deployment of Guard units to the capital and other cities, calling it an overreach of presidential authority. In the hours after the shooting, many revived those criticisms, arguing that the president was to blame.\n\n“Trump put them in harm’s way, fash,” former ESPN and MSNBC host Keith Olbermann posted on X.\n\nJane Mayer, a writer at The New Yorker, argued that the “poor guardsmen should never have been deployed,” adding that they had “virtually nothing to do but pick up trash.”\n\n“It was for political show and at what a cost,” Mayer wrote on X.\n\n“Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are culpable for endangering the National Guard by putting them in harm’s way,” author and activist John Pavlovitz posted on his BlueSky platform, where he has more than 233,000 followers.\n\nWriter Charlotte Clymer similarly told [his] more than 200,000 BlueSky followers that the troops had been “used as political pawns.”\n\n“They sign up to serve their country, not needlessly deploy to American cities to pick up garbage,” Clymer wrote.\n\nMedia personality Keith Edwards also suggested on X that the guardsmen would have been “fine” were it not for “Trump’s illegal deployment of the national guard for a non-emergency.”\n\n“History will wonder what we’re all thinking: why did Trump have to put them in harm’s way for a STUNT?” the X account “Call to Activism,” run by political commentator Joe Gallina, posted to its more than 1 million followers.\n\nMany other users echoed similar sentiments, including one post with thousands of likes that called the incident an “orchestrated tragedy by a president hellbent on creating a tinder box environment across the country.”\n\nWriter and former senior editor at The New Republic Brian Beutler responded to West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s initial—and later retracted—claim that the guardsmen had died, writing that Morrisey had “sent them to die for a stunt.”\n\nDespite the posts downplaying crime in the city, violent crime during the National Guard’s initial one-month surge in the capital fell 39% compared to the same period last year, including a 53% drop in homicides.\n\nOpposition to the deployments has been ongoing for months. Democrat Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker claimed in August that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into his state was an “attack on the American people” and would be used to “stop the 2026 elections.”\n\nWhile the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that one suspect is in custody, officials have not released details about the individual, a possible motive, or whether others were involved.\n\nThe president said in a Truth Social post shortly after the incident that the “animals” who shot the guardsmen will “pay a very steep price,” and Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that 500 additional troops would be deployed in response.\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Two National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday; a tragedy that immediately spurred a deluge of prominent liberal...

Not only did Trump refuse to attend, but he also declined to send any top officials from Washington, DC, to the event.\n\n“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote in a post on November 7.\n\n“No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”\n\nThe G20 has traditionally been a meeting ground for leaders from the European Union, the African Union and other major world economies to discuss technology, environmental initiatives and shared financial growth.\n\nNext year, the summit is scheduled to take place in Miami. Traditionally, the host of the G20 summit closes the meeting by banging a gavel and then passing the little wooden hammer to officials from the next country to hold the meeting.\n\nBut on Sunday, Ramaphosa did not pass the gavel to anyone.\n\nTrump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he had offered to send a member of the US Embassy to accept the gavel, but that the offer had been rejected by Ramaphosa’s administration as a slight.\n\n“At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20.”\n\nHeightened tensions\n\nRamaphosa largely avoided addressing the US absence during the G20 conference, instead highlighting his push for global unity and efforts to combat inequality.\n\n“Our G20 Presidency has been rooted in the conviction that the world needs more solidarity, equality and sustainability,” Ramaphosa wrote on social media on Tuesday.\n\n“While some have sought to create division and polarisation between nations, we have reinforced our shared humanity. We have fostered collaboration and goodwill. Above all, we have affirmed that our shared goals outweigh our differences.”\n\nThe increasingly hostile relations between South Africa and the US began early in Trump’s second term as president.\n\nOn February 7, Trump issued an executive action denouncing South Africa for alleged human rights abuses against white Afrikaners and saying that all aid and assistance to the country would stop.\n\nAs of fiscal year 2023, US assistance to South Africa totalled approximately $441.3m, according to government statistics. In fiscal year 2024, which is only partially reported at present, the total rose to approximately $581m.\n\nIn February’s order, Trump also directed US government agencies to assist in the resettlement of Afrikaners as “refugees” in the US.\n\nHe doubled down on that call in late October, when he set the lowest cap on refugee admissions in US history.\n\nOf the 7,500 available refugee slots, the Trump administration called for the majority to be “allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and other “victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.\n\nIn May, Trump also hosted Ramaphosa at the White House, where he attempted to confront the South African leader with accusations of genocide in his country. Some critics have compared the meeting to an “ambush”.\n\nRamaphosa, for his part, has repeatedly denied the accusations. When asked by reporters about the US boycotting the G20 this year, he said bluntly, “Their absence is their loss.”","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/trump-yanks-g20-invitation-from-south-africa-over-false-genocide-claims/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25330049418771-1764195200-eB3ezi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:08:39","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":382556994,"title":"'This is the scandal': Experts floored as 'staggering' figures undercut key Trump pledge","text":"The libertarian Cato Institute this week further undermined the Trump administration’s claims that it is targeting “the worst of the worst” with its violent immigration operations in communities across the United States by publishing data about the criminal histories—or lack thereof—of immigrants who have been arrested and booked into detention.\n\nDavid J. Bier, the institute’s director of immigration studies, previously reported in June that 65% of people taken by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had no convictions, and 93% had no violent convictions.\n\nMonday evening, Bier shared a new nonpublic dataset leaked to Cato. Of the 44,882 people booked into ICE custody from when the fiscal year began on October 1 through November 15, 73% had no criminal convictions. For that share, around two-thirds also had no pending charges.\n\nThe data also show that most of those recently booked into ICE detention with criminal convictions had faced immigration, traffic, or vice charges. Just 5% had a violent conviction, and 3% had a property conviction.\n\n“Other data sources support the conclusions from the number of ICE book-ins,” Bier wrote, citing information on agency arrests from January to late July—or the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term—that the Deportation Data Project acquired via a public records request.\n\nThe data show that as of January 1, just before former President Joe Biden left office, 149 immigrants without charges or convictions were arrested by ICE. That number surged by 1,500% under Trump: It peaked at 4,072 in June and ultimately was 2,386 by the end of July—when 67% of all arrestees had no criminal convictions, and 39% had neither convictions nor charges.\n\nBier also pointed to publicly available data about current detainees on ICE’s website, emphasizing that “the number of people in detention who were convicted of a crime and had no pending charges increased a staggering 2,370% since January from fewer than 1,000 to over 21,000.”\n\nIn addition to publishing an article on Cato’s site, Bier detailed the findings on the social media platform X, where various critics of the administration’s immigration crackdown weighed in. Among them was Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), who said: “These are the facts. I’ve spoken to dozens of people held inside ICE detention centers in Arizona and this tracks.”\n\nUS Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) declared: “This is the scandal. Trump isn’t targeting dangerous people. He’s targeting peaceful immigrants. Almost exclusively.”\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, also jumped in, as did DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. Responding to Murphy, McLaughlin said in part: “This is so dumb it hurts my soul. This is a made-up pie chart with no legitimate data behind it—just propaganda to undermine the brave work of DHS law enforcement and fool Americans.”\n\nBier and others then took aim at McLaughlin, with the Cato director offering the raw data and challenging her to “just admit you don’t care whether the people you’re arresting are threats to others or not.”\n\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said that “DHS’s spokeswoman lies AGAIN,” calling out her post as “either a knowing lie or an egregious mistake.”\n\n“The data David J. Bier published was distributed to multiple congressional staffers and is just a more detailed breakdown of data, which is publicly available on ICE’s own website,” he stressed.\n\nJournalist Jose Olivares noted that this is “not the first time Tricia McLaughlin has said that ICE’s own data is ‘propaganda.’ Months ago, she slammed me and my colleague at the Guardian on PBS... even though we used ICE’s own data for our reporting.”","summary":"The libertarian Cato Institute this week further undermined the Trump administration’s claims that it is targeting “the worst of the worst” with its violent immigration operations in communities across the United States by publishing data about the criminal histories—or lack thereof—of immigrants who have been arrested and booked into detention.\n\nDavid J.

Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow next week with other senior US officials for talks with Russian leaders about a possible plan to end the nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine, the deadliest in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday said he was ready to advance the US-backed framework for ending the war and to discuss disputed points with the US president in talks that he said should include European allies. Kyiv and its European allies are worried that details of the plan leaked last week show it bows to key Russian demands - barring Ukraine&apos;s NATO entry, enshrining Russian control of one-fifth of Ukraine and limiting the size of Ukraine&apos;s army. US policy toward the war in Ukraine has veered widely since the northern summer. Trump&apos;s hastily arranged Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin spurred worries that Washington was prepared to accept many Russian demands, but ultimately resulted in more US pressure on Russia. The latest peace proposal caught many in Washington, Europe and Kyiv off guard, stirring anxiety that Trump might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted towards Moscow. The plan - and the leaked Witkoff call - prompted unusually harsh criticism from Trump&apos;s fellow Republicans, who have generally marched in lockstep with the president since he began his second term. Trump later said progress was being made and Moscow was making concessions even though the war - in which Russian forces have been advancing - was only going to move \"in one direction.\" But, while welcoming the Trump administration&apos;s efforts, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday: \"There can be no question of any concessions, or any surrender of our approaches to those key points.\" Moscow also raised concerns about the leak to Bloomberg News of the transcript of a call between Witkoff and Putin&apos;s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, in which the US envoy advised Ushakov on how to pitch a peace plan to Trump. Trump, on Air Force One, brushed aside a question from a reporter about why Witkoff appeared to be coaching Russian officials as \"what a dealmaker does\" and \"a very standard form of negotiation.\" But Russia said the leak was an unacceptable attempt to undermine peace efforts and amounted to hybrid warfare. Ushakov said he had used WhatsApp to speak to Witkoff on several occasions and the Russian newspaper Kommersant, which interviewed Ushakov, ran a story headlined: \"Who set up Steve Witkoff?\" Bloomberg said it had reviewed a recording of the call. It was not clear how Bloomberg got the recording. A Bloomberg News spokesperson said: \"We stand by our story.\" Trump on Tuesday said Witkoff would meet Putin and that Jared Kushner, who helped negotiate the deal that brought about an uneasy ceasefire in the Gaza war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, would also be involved. \"As for Witkoff, I can say that a preliminary agreement has been reached that he will come to Moscow next week,\" Ushakov told reporters. Asked by reporters whether a peace deal was close, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agency Interfax as saying: \"Wait, it&apos;s premature to say that yet.\" Russian forces control more than 19 per cent of Ukraine following Moscow&apos;s 2022 invasion, and have advanced in 2025 at the fastest pace since 2022, although the advances remain slow and Kyiv says Russia has incurred heavy losses to achieve them.

That fundamental principle seems, for the moment, to elude Ukraine’s European allies. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has taken the more pragmatic – some would say more cynical – view that Ukraine will never defeat Russia and therefore needs to make the best of a bad lot. Trump’s strategy for peace in Ukraine has been to browbeat Volodymyr Zelensky into approving a deal acceptable to Vladimir Putin. In fairness, Trump has also gone some way to putting the squeeze on the Kremlin too, by sanctioning the oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, authorising the Ukrainians to use US–provided long-range weapons against Russian targets, and threatening to provide Kyiv with Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nThe latest fruit of the White House’s strategy has been a 28-point peace plan – dubbed the 28PPP – drafted during secret meetings between Putin’s Harvard–educated former Goldman Sachs banker envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Trump’s golfing buddy, real-estate lawyer Steve Witkoff. Leaked to the US press last week, the 28PPP reads like a shopping list of Kremlin demands. The 28PPP was quickly eviscerated by Kyiv, backed by Ukraine’s allies in Europe, who threw out clauses that required Ukraine to give up the remaining territory of Donetsk region still unoccupied by Russia, cap the size of its military, and promise never to join Nato. With the plan now filleted down to 19 points during talks with US representatives in Geneva this week, Zelensky says he is ready to meet Trump to thrash out key remaining details. ‘Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed,’ Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s security council, announced. ‘We look forward to… completing final steps and making a deal with President Trump.’\n\nSounds good – except for one crucial detail. It’s not Trump who has to sign off on a deal, but Putin. And Putin himself has given no sign that he agrees with the original 28PPP, let alone its later trimmed-down versions. The ‘final steps’ of which the Ukrainians speak are rather the opposite: the first steps in a negotiating process that is likely to be long, painful and humiliating.\n\nThere is a fundamental misconception at the heart of the negotiations: that Putin is ready to make peace at all. Neither Dmitriev nor Witkoff have any formal diplomatic status – which on balance is a good thing because some talks on a semi-informal basis are considerably better than no talks at all. But so far Dmitriev’s role has been twofold: one, to dangle the prospect of lucrative oil, minerals and metals deals in front of Trump as a potential peace dividend; and the other, to test how many concessions the White House can squeeze out of Zelensky. As for the White House’s 28PPP, the most positive thing that the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has officially said is the plan ‘could be a very good basis for negotiations… We will give it careful consideration.’\n\nAt this moment of the conflict, Putin is, at best, no more than peace-curious. The simple reason is that he believes he is winning. On the ground in Donbas, his troops have seized the strategic heights of Pokrovsk and are advancing fast in the more vulnerable southern sectors of Zaporozhzhia. Politically, Zelensky has been severely weakened by an ugly corruption scandal that implicates some of his closest associates in war profiteering. Russian strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure are poised to plunge whole regions into cold and darkness this winter. Ukraine’s desertion rates are four times what they were a year ago. Even prominent war heroes such as the Ukrainian serviceman blogger ‘Bakhmut Daemon’ wrote this week that ‘people long for the end of war’. Why should Russia take its boot off Ukraine’s throat, reasons the Kremlin, while the war is going its way?\n\nHow to respond to this looming military crisis has divided Ukraine’s allies and Ukrainians themselves. In contrast to Trump’s cold realism – or defeatism – Europe continues to believe that more money, more weapons and more pressure on Russia will help Ukraine eventually win back its lost territories, force Moscow to pay reparations and bring war criminals to justice. ‘We, as Europeans, have always supported a long, lasting and just peace,’ the EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas put it this week. ‘For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.’ The hope is that economic pressure, plus Ukrainian drone and missile strikes deep inside Russia, will eventually force Putin to the negotiating table. \n\nMany Ukrainians, however, including former supporters of Zelensky, fear that Ukraine’s army and economy will crumble faster than Russia’s. ‘Every subsequent deal for Ukraine will only be worse… we are losing people, territory, and the economy,’ Iuliia Mendel, Zelensky’s press secretary, -2019-21, wrote recently. ‘Many who reflexively oppose every peace proposal believe they are defending Ukraine. With all respect, that is the clearest proof they have no idea what is actually happening on the front lines and inside the country right now.’ The EU, Mendel asserts, has paid Russia more than €311 billion for energy since the beginning of the war vs €165 billion given to Kyiv in aid.\n\nThe good news is that for all its flaws, a real peace process has begun. More, the peace plan now on the table contains the framework of what is likely to be the final deal, namely a partition of Ukraine along the line of control, Ukrainian neutrality and security guarantees short of Nato membership. Hopefully, the Kremlin demand for Zelensky to hand over the unconquered portion of Donbas can be negotiated away, not least because such a capitulation would make Ukraine instantly ungovernable. Rights for Russian speakers in Ukraine are actually a policy Zelensky once supported. Caps on Ukraine’s military and its future alliances are matters of fundamental symbolic importance to its future as an independent state, but can perhaps be couched in acceptable diplomatic terms. A demilitarised zone may be possible. Nato members’ boots on the ground is certainly not. \n\nOne thing is clear: the process will be long, repetitive, frustrating and governed by Putin’s stubbornness. Trump’s enthusiasm for an imminent deal may be naive, but it’s nonetheless encouraging. But this will not all be over by Christmas.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-path-to-peace-in-ukraine-will-be-tortuous/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247613598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:05:00","author":"Owen Matthews","authors":["Owen Matthews"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":382555354,"title":"Kash Patel Suffers Fresh Washington Embarrassment Amidst Trump FBI Ouster Rumours","text":"In the high-stakes environment of Washington, D.C., precision is paramount. Yet, FBI Director Kash Patel found himself at the centre of confusion during a critical briefing on a recent shooting. While addressing the violent assault on National Guard members, Patel seemed disconnected from the factual timeline established by local authorities.This latest public stumble comes as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs a potential leadership shake-up at the Bureau. Amidst swirling rumours that the President is considering replacing him with Andrew Bailey, the juxtaposition of Patel's comments against official police statements has only fuelled the ongoing narrative questioning his competence and future in the role.FBI Director Contradicts Police Chief on Suspect's Custody StatusDuring the briefing concerning the bloodshed in Washington, D.C., Patel issued a stern warning to those responsible. 'Make no mistake, they will be brought to justice,' Patel said. 'Since this is an assault on a federal law enforcement officer, this will be treated at the federal level as an assault on a federal law enforcement officer...'However, this declaration created immediate confusion. Patel's comments came after the police chief stated that they are currently focusing on just one suspect, who is already in custody. The disconnect suggested the FBI Director was unaware that the manhunt had effectively ended before his statement began.Senate Hearing Highlighted Patel's History of Premature AnnouncementsThis isn't the first time Patel's competence has been questioned. In September, he was grilled at a Senate hearing about his actions pertaining to Charlie Kirk's murder investigation.At the hearing, Patel was called out for his actions of hastily announcing Charlie's killer was caught hours after the conservative podcaster was gunned down at Utah Valley University, despite not having the gunman in custody at that point. This pattern of miscommunication has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and the public alike.Two National Guard Soldiers Critical After Thanksgiving AttackThe confusion overshadowed the tragic reality of the event. Earlier today, it was confirmed that the two National Guard soldiers gunned down in a Thanksgiving bloodbath in Washington, D.C., are in critical condition.During the briefing, officials said the suspect came around a corner near the Farragut West Metro Station in Downtown Washington, D.C., and immediately began firing at the two National Guard members. Other members on duty nearby were able to intervene and hold down the suspect until law enforcement arrived at the scene.At least one of the soldiers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, an official confirmed. Investigators are working to determine the gunman's motive, including whether the suspect was targeting the troops for any specific reason.West Virginia Governor Retracts Premature Announcement of Soldiers' DeathsPatel was not the only official to stumble during the chaos. Earlier, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey also made a huge blunder, after he said both guards had died, before back-pedalling due to 'conflicting' information.Morrisey wrote, 'It is with great sorrow that we can confirm both members of the West Virginia National Guard who were shot earlier today in Washington, D.C., have passed away from their injuries.' However, just minutes after his announcement he said there were 'conflicting reports' about their condition,' in a follow-up post.Trump Denies Reports of Plans to Replace Embattled FBI DirectorThese operational errors arrive amidst a swirl of political intrigue. MS NOW reported earlier Tuesday that Trump was considering replacing Patel with FBI co-Deputy Director Andrew Bailey, as concerns swirled over the director's social media posts during high-profile investigations and the use of a government jet to visit his girlfriend.Despite the law requiring Senate confirmation for a ten-year term to insulate the bureau, rumours of an ouster persisted. However, President Donald Trump has denied a report that he was considering removing FBI Director Kash Patel amid a string of controversies.'No, he's doing a great job, I think,' Trump told reporters on Tuesday aboard Air Force One. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reinforced this stance on X, claiming the story was completely made up.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/kash-patel-suffers-fresh-washington-embarrassment-amidst-trump-fbi-ouster-rumours-1758377","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1771732/kash-patel.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fc737267061aa7d25738cb75803d5046","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:04:52","author":"Luis Vincent Gochoco","authors":["Luis Vincent Gochoco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":382558380,"title":"U.S. guardsmen in critical condition after ‘targeted’ Washington shooting","text":"A pair of national guardsmen who were shot just blocks from the White House are in critical condition, while a lone gunman has been taken into custody, officials said Wednesday.The soldiers were on a 'high visibility” patrol when the suspect rounded a corner, raised a firearm and 'ambushed,” them, according to Washington’s Metropolitan Police.

Nearly 2,200 troops are currently assigned to the joint task force operating in the city, according to the government’s latest update, as per the Associated Press.Where did the shooting happen?The shooting happened roughly two blocks northwest of the White House near a metro station.Here are 5 top updates to know about Washington DC shooting:1. FBI Director Kash Patel and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Guard members were hospitalised in critical condition.2. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially said the troops had died, but later walked back the statement to say his office was “receiving conflicting reports\" about their condition.3. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said, “This was a targeted shooting.”4. Troops held down the shooter. Jeffrey Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that after hearing the gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the shooter after he was shot.A law enforcement official said the suspect, who was in custody, was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening.“It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said. “At this point, we have no other suspects,” Carroll said at a news conference.5. The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington following the shooting. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said President Donald Trump asked him to send the extra troops.Nearly 2,200 troops are currently assigned to the joint task force operating in the city, according to the government’s latest update.Trump warns, calls suspect ‘animal’US President Donald Trump, who was in Florida for Thanksgiving, warned in a statement on social media that the “animal” who shot the guard members “will pay a very steep price.”“God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!,” he posted.In Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Vice President JD Vance urged “everybody who’s a person of faith” to pray for the two Guard members. He cautioned that much remained unknown, including the motive of the shooter.“I think it’s a somber reminder that soldiers, whether they’re active duty, reserve or National Guard, our soldiers are the sword and the shield of the United States of America,” Vance said as he delivered a Thanksgiving message to troops.What may have led to DC violence?According to the Associated Press, the shooting unfolded as the presence of troops in Washington DC and other cities around the country has been a flashpoint issue for months.It has fueled court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration’s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem.Trump had issued an emergency order in August that federalised the local police force and sent in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later, but the troops remained.Last week, a federal judge ordered an end to the deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal the decision.The Guard members have patrolled neighborhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and been assigned to pick up trash and to guard sports events.(With inputs from AP)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/white-house-shooting-update-two-national-guard-members-shot-in-washington-dc-trump-orders-500-more-troops-5-points-11764201058637.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/27/1600x900/logo/US-JUSTICE-POLITICS-NATIONALGUARD-SHOOTING-51_1764201869256_1764201875077.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:00:06","author":"Akriti Anand","authors":["Akriti Anand"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":382556238,"title":"US attorneys must now prove they’re super racist","text":"Presumably because the Justice Department is now run by people who don’t actually have any idea what attorneys do, it dropped a giant data demand on all 93 offices Monday—with a deadline of Wednesday. \n\nWhat does the DOJ want?

Sure, but not all organized political violence. \n\nTrump’s Sept. 25 executive order, issued after Charlie Kirk’s murder, makes clear that only left-wing political violence is to be investigated. \n\nDon’t forget that Trump declared “antifa”—which is not an actual organization—to be a domestic terrorist organization—which is not an actual thing in U.S. law. \n\nSo essentially, U.S. attorneys are being asked to prove how many leftist organizations they’ve investigated for the crime of being leftist organizations.\n\nThe U.S. attorneys also need to give a book report about any cases with a “nexus to a drug cartel.” Well, not all nexuses to drug cartels, of course. \n\nThe DOJ only wants to know how many indictments have been brought against nationals of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Dominican Republic. No need to hear about any U.S. citizens with a nexus to drug cartels, even though U.S. citizens are by far the biggest group of people smuggling drugs into the country. \n\nThis demand is especially ridiculous in light of the fact that, since the administration has reassigned thousands of federal personnel to its immigration efforts, narcotics investigations have plummeted. \n\nU.S. attorneys are also obliged to show how hard they’re fighting sanctuary cities that “remain in defiance” of Trump’s executive order. Responsible U.S. attorneys would likely decline going after sanctuary cities, given that they are actually legal.\n\nAnd they’re also required to prove the number of adult sponsors of unaccompanied minors they’ve investigated and prosecuted.\n\nLet’s unpack this for a minute: The biggest criminals the administration can think of—so horrendous that it warrants special tracking by every U.S. attorney—are the people who choose to care for children who have no other adults to care for them. Such monsters. \n\nMeanwhile, again, thanks to redirecting thousands of staff to immigration enforcement, federal agents are spending far less time investigating sex trafficking and abuse against children. Priorities!\n\nBut you know who should not be investigated these days, per the DOJ? So much so that each U.S. attorney must prove they’re most definitely not investigating them? The cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAt least that one makes sense. If U.S. attorneys targeted crypto scammers, they’d be going after Trump’s pardon pals and crypto bros. We can’t have that.\n\nThis is a full-scale attack on the independence of U.S. attorney offices, turning them into an arm of Trump’s corrupt and compromised DOJ and pulling them away from fighting actual crime. \n\nThis isn’t going to sit right with U.S. attorneys who are actually qualified, but you can bet that the foursome of interim appointees who the courts have ruled to be illegally in their jobs will be perfectly fine with it. \n\nAfter all, they understand the assignment—to serve Trump no matter what.","summary":"Presumably because the Justice Department is now run by people who don’t actually have any idea what attorneys do, it dropped a giant data demand on all 93 offices Monday—with a deadline of Wednesday. \n\n\n\nWhat does the DOJ want? Not much, really. Just for every U.S. attorney to provide comprehensive data on how much they’ve warped their offices into racist revenge machines. \n\n\n\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi\n\n\nYes, the top federal prosecutor in each district probably didn’t have much to do this week and can definitely spend their time answering what is basically a duplicate of Elon Musk’s “5 things” email. \n\n\n\nIt’s not like U.S. attorneys are overseeing offices handling hundreds—if not thousands—of criminal cases each year. Never mind that each federal district is also juggling hundreds or thousands of civil matters. And pay no attention to the fact that U.S. attorney offices are responsible for collecting all criminal debts. \n\n\n\nAlso, please just skip over the part where those offices are so jammed up that, in ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/11/26/2355596/-US-attorneys-must-now-prove-they-re-super-racist?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1502222/story_image/AP25036594185714.jpg?1764110762","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 00:00:04","author":"Lisa Needham","authors":["Lisa Needham"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":382556926,"title":"2 National Guard members shot in attack just blocks from the White House","text":"Washington, Nov 27 (AP) Two West Virginia National Guard members who deployed to the nation’s capital were shot Wednesday just blocks from the White House in a brazen act of violence that the mayor described as a targeted attack.\nFBI Director Kash Patel and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Guard members were hospitalised in critical condition.\nThe presence of the National Guard in the nation’s capital has been a flashpoint issue for months, fuelling a court fight and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration’s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem.\nJeffrey Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said investigators had no information on a motive. He said the assailant “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops, citing video reviewed by investigators.\n“This was a targeted shooting,” Bowser said.\nWest Virginia Gov Patrick Morrisey initially said the troops had died, but later walked back the statement to say his office was “receiving conflicting reports” about their condition.\nA suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nThe Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington following the shooting. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said President Donald Trump asked him to send the extra troops.\nNearly 2,200 troops currently are assigned to the joint task force operating in the city, according to the government’s latest update.\n Troops held down the shooter The shooting happened roughly two blocks northwest of the White House near a metro station.\nAfter hearing the gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the shooter after he was shot, Carroll said.\n“It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said, adding that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect.\n“At this point, we have no other suspects,” Carroll said at a news conference.\nAt least one of the Guard members exchanged gunfire with the shooter, said another law enforcement official who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\nSocial media video shared in the immediate aftermath showed first responders performing CPR on one of the troops and treating the other on a glass-covered sidewalk.\n Witnesses saw people fleeing Stacy Walters said she was in a car near the scene when she heard two gunshots and saw people running. Almost instantly, law enforcement swarmed the area. “It’s such a beautiful day. Who would do this? And we’re getting ready for the holidays?” Emma McDonald, who exited a metro station just after the shots were fired, said she and a friend sought safety with others in a cafe. McDonald told the AP that minutes later she saw first responders rolling a stretcher carrying a National Guard member whose head was covered in blood.\nMore than 300 West Virginia National Guard members were deployed to Washington in August. Last week, about 160 of them volunteered to extend their deployment until the end of the year while the others returned to West Virginia just over a week ago.\nPolice tape cordoned off the scene where fire and police vehicle lights flashed and helicopter blades thudded overhead. Agents from the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on scene, as National Guard troops stood sentry nearby. At least one helicopter landed on the National Mall.\n Trump vows that shooter will pay Trump, who was in Florida for Thanksgiving, warned in a statement on social media that the “animal” who shot the guard members “will pay a very steep price.” “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!” In Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Vice President JD Vance urged “everybody who’s a person of faith” to pray for the two Guard members. He cautioned that much remained unknown, including the motive of the shooter.\n“I think it’s a sombre reminder that soldiers, whether they’re active duty, reserve or National Guard, our soldiers are the sword and the shield of the United States of America,” Vance said as he delivered a Thanksgiving message to troops.\nTrump issued an emergency order in August that federalised the local police force and sent in National Guard troops from eight states and the District of Columbia. The order expired a month later, but the troops remained.\nLast week, a federal judge ordered an end to the deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal the decision.\nThe Guard members have patrolled neighbourhoods, train stations and other locations, participated in highway checkpoints and been assigned to pick up trash and to guard sports events.

People would make their wish using that vessel and then place it back into the pond, and it would return on its own. This is a living sign of faith. Even today, people come here with their wishes, and their desires are fulfilled. People come from far and wide. There is always a crowd here.

Today, the fort stands as a symbol of Odisha's royal legacy and a popular site for history enthusiasts.

The troops are part of the National Guard surge Trump ordered in August to address rising crime in the nation’s capital after a series of high-profile incidents, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern.\n\nDemocrats had long opposed Trump’s deployment of Guard units to the capital and other cities, calling it an overreach of presidential authority. In the hours after the shooting, many revived those criticisms, arguing that the president was to blame.\n\n“Trump put them in harm’s way, fash,” former ESPN and MSNBC host Keith Olbermann posted on X. (RELATED: CNN’s Charles Ramsey Questions National Guard Training Immediately After 2 Guardsmen Were Shot In DC) \n\nJane Mayer, a writer at The New Yorker, argued that the “poor guardsmen should never have been deployed,” adding that they had “virtually nothing to do but pick up trash.”\n\n“It was for political show and at what a cost,” Mayer wrote on X.\n\n“Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth are culpable for endangering the National Guard by putting them in harm’s way,” author and activist John Pavlovitz posted on his BlueSky platform, where he has more than 233,000 followers.\n\nWriter Charlotte Clymer similarly told her more than 200,000 BlueSky followers that the troops had been “used as political pawns.”\n\n“They sign up to serve their country, not needlessly deploy to American cities to pick up garbage,” she wrote.\n\nMedia personality Keith Edwards also suggested on X that the guardsmen would have been “fine” were it not for “Trump’s illegal deployment of the national guard for a non-emergency.”\n\n“History will wonder what we’re all thinking: why did Trump have to put them in harm’s way for a STUNT?” the X account “Call to Activism,” run by political commentator Joe Gallina, posted to its more than 1 million followers.\n\nMany other users echoed similar sentiments, including one post with thousands of likes that called the incident an “orchestrated tragedy by a president hellbent on creating a tinder box environment across the country.”\n\nWriter and former senior editor at The New Republic Brian Beutler responded to West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s initial — and later retracted — claim that the guardsmen had died, writing that Morrisey had “sent them to die for a stunt.”\n\nDespite the posts downplaying crime in the city, violent crime during the National Guard’s initial one-month surge in the capital fell 39% compared to the same period last year, including a 53% drop in homicides.\n\nOpposition to the deployments has been ongoing for months. Democrat Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker claimed in August that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into his state was an “attack on the American people” and would be used to “stop the 2026 elections.”\n\nWhile the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that one suspect is in custody, officials have not released details about the individual, a possible motive, or whether others were involved.\n\nThe president said in a Truth Social post shortly after the incident that the “animals” who shot the guardsmen will “pay a very steep price,” and Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that 500 additional troops would be deployed in response.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Both soldiers remain in critical condition, while the shooter also suffered injuries during the confrontation.\n\nAccording to NBC News, law enforcement officials have confirmed the suspect’s identity as an Afghan national, and authorities are examining the incident as a possible act of terrorism.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump expressed his outrage, stating that the individual responsible for the attack on the soldiers “will pay a very steep price” for their actions.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel provided an update, noting that the wounded soldiers are receiving treatment at a local hospital. Earlier, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey mistakenly reported the soldiers’ deaths but later retracted his statement.\n\nPhotos from the scene depicted a soldier lying on the ground, bleeding from the head, as a Secret Service agent rendered medical assistance.\n\nAn unidentified trooper was seen on a stretcher inside an ambulance receiving medical attention at the scene of the shooting. \n\nThe FBI, ATF and Secret Service swarmed on the scene as a helicopter landed on the National Mall to evacuate one of the wounded National Guardsmen. \n\nTrump has deployed 2,300 National Guard troops into DC since August as part of his promise to crack down on rampant crime in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe president ordered an additional 500 troops to deploy following the shooting on Wednesday, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said, calling it a ‘cowardly, dastardly act, targeting the best of America.’ \n\nAfter the shooting, the president wrote on Truth Social: ‘God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. \n\n‘These are truly Great People.

I thank all the first responders for their quick action to capture the suspect.’\n\nCommercial flights into Reagan Washington International Airport were briefly paused after the attack. \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said this was due to ‘the locations of aircraft involved in responding to today’s shooting incident.’\n\nNormal operations have since resumed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTwo National Guard soldiers sustained head injuries just steps away from the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Shocking Ambush: National Guard Soldiers Targeted Near White House &#8211; Security Alert Raised first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/shocking-ambush-national-guard-soldiers-targeted-near-white-house-security-alert-raised/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Two-National-Guard-soldiers-shot-in-ambush-near-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 23:55:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":382556898,"title":"Jeffrey Epstein's Secret Network Unmasked! 23,000+ Documents Expose This.. | Big Names Linked?","text":"A new batch of more than 23,000 pages from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has prompted a fresh wave of speculation about the late financier’s circle of contacts. The papers, released online by House Republicans after months of procedural delays, contain emails and administrative correspondence spanning years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. They show he remained in touch with several public figures, including Steve Bannon, Larry Summers, Noam Chomsky, Elon Musk, Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, as confirmed by The New York Times. But the content of the exchanges varies widely, and much of what is now circulating online either misrepresents the material or goes beyond what the documents actually demonstrate.,The release also follows a separate attempt by House Democrats to introduce emails referencing former president Donald Trump. One email from Epstein to journalist Michael Wolff in 2019 asserts that Trump “knew about the girls,” while another to Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011 claims Trump “spent hours at my house” with a woman later identified by Democrats as Virginia Giuffre. These messages are part of Epstein’s own correspondence and do not independently verify the claims they contain, a point acknowledged even by Democratic staff familiar with the files.,,Parties Use Contradictory Selective Leaks,,Both political parties have been criticised for releasing fragments of the documents to support competing narratives. Democrats highlighted the emails referencing Trump, while Republicans moved to publish the estate papers in full only hours later, portraying their transparency as corrective. The White House dismissed the Democratic excerpts as “selectively leaked,” and spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump’s longstanding claim that he expelled Epstein from Mar-a-Lago “decades ago,” asserting the president “was never involved in wrongdoing.”,Giuffre’s own previous testimony complicates attempts to frame the exchanges as conclusive. She has repeatedly stated under oath and in her memoir that Trump was not involved in any misconduct and that her contact with him was limited to a brief meeting at Mar-a-Lago when she worked as a spa attendant.,What the New Documents Actually Establish,,The newly posted estate files are largely administrative — travel logs, routine emails, scheduling notes, and financial paperwork. They confirm Epstein’s extensive attempt to maintain relevance by cultivating high-profile contacts, much as earlier reporting by The New York Times and The Miami Herald had documented. They do not provide proof of new criminal conduct by the individuals mentioned in his correspondence. Nor do they establish personal involvement in Epstein’s trafficking operations.,Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year federal sentence, told Justice Department investigators in July that she “never saw” Trump behave inappropriately and said her own interactions with him were “entirely proper.” Other former household staff previously testified that while Trump visited Epstein’s residence, they did not witness misconduct.,The broader political context remains unchanged: Epstein’s death in 2019 closed the federal criminal case against him but left a long trail of unanswered questions. With Trump’s Epstein Files Act requiring expanded document releases, future batches are expected. But at present, the claim that these 23,000 pages expose a new “secret network” has no evidentiary basis beyond Epstein’s own emails, many of which reflect his habit of overstating his proximity to powerful figures.,Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"A cache of more than 23,000 documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate has reignited political clashes in Washington, with online posts alleging explosive revelations about high-profile figures.

This was the wrong thing to say, as our sister site Townhall reported. \n\n\"[O]f course, you know, there's so much controversy happening in the United States right now with ICE, who are also wearing uniforms and wearing masks.

And so apparently this shooting has happened.\"\n\nThat's pretty disgusting, \n\nThen this was this rambling from ABC's Aaron Katersky. \n\n\"Focus will turn to whether these guardsmen were specifically targeted. If that's the case, it would fit with what we've been hearing from law enforcement officials for a number of months now that some political flashpoints in the country, whether that's immigration policies by the administration, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, even amid a tenuous cease fire, those kinds of flashpoints have made people in uniform, be they military, law enforcement, government officials, people in uniform have increasingly been targets, and that is going to be one focus of the investigation going forward.\"\n\nJane Mayer of The New Yorker also jumped in with a horrible take. The twisted effort to somehow blame the administration and diminish the service of the National Guard in D.C. is truly vile. \n\nThis is so tragic, so unnecessary; these poor guardsmen should never have been deployed. I live in DC and watched as they had virtually nothing to do but pick up trash. It was for political show and at what a cost.\n\nSo it's the fault of being \"deployed,\" not the fault of the person who shot them. And their deployment wasn't a \"political show\" - it helped drop the crime rate in D.C., and even the Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser had to acknowledge that. Mayer doesn't seem to understand the concept that their very presence tends to deter people who would engage in criminal activity. She's also attacking them when she says they are doing nothing, when they have been very effective. \n\nAs we reported, the FBI believes this was an ambush. So why are these members of the legacy media trying to blame the administration and \"uniforms\"? Where was their condemnation for people demonizing the National Guard before this? \n\nREAD MORE: The Sickening Media Clip on the Military and 'Illegal Orders' Folks Are Pointing to After NG Shootings\n\n NEW: Investigators Say National Guardsmen Shot Near White House Were Ambushed in Targeted Attack\n\nThe media, of course, doesn't want to go there.","url":"https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2025/11/26/media-remarks-on-shooting-of-national-guard-members-n2196601","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/330/c565c59e-e68f-4cbe-83c2-d624ac79952b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 23:54:00","author":"Nick Arama","authors":["Nick Arama"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.492},{"id":382554070,"title":"ICE detains mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew","text":"US authorities detained the mother of Karoline Leavitt’s nephew, reflecting the wide reach of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

But her attorney, Jeffrey Rubin, said she was pursuing permanent residence and had previously had protection from deportation under a programme for immigrants brought to the US illegally as children.\nMost arrested by ICE had no convictions \nTrump, a Republican, has surged immigration officers to major cities across the US in an effort to reach historic levels of deportations, sweeping in many long-term residents and non-criminals.\nMore than two-thirds of the roughly 53,000 people arrested by US immigration and customs enforcement and detained as of Nov 15 had no criminal convictions, according to ICE statistics.\nDHS said Ferreira had a previous arrest for battery, but did not provide further details. Reuters could not independently confirm the alleged charge.\nIn response to a request for comment to the White House, a source familiar with the matter confirmed that Ferreira was the mother to Leavitt's nephew. The source said the nephew had lived full-time with Leavitt's brother, Michael Leavitt, in New Hampshire since birth and had never resided with Ferreira.\nDHS said Ferreira was being held in an ICE detention centre in Louisiana.\n\"Under President Trump and secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation,\" the spokesperson said.\nRubin, a Boston-based attorney representing Ferreira, said in a statement that his firm hoped to secure her quick release.\nShe previously had been enrolled in the deferred action for childhood Arrivals programme, which offers deportation relief and work permits to immigrants brought to the US as children, he said.\nRubin said the same government that offered her a path to citizenship had now chosen to \"abuse its entrusted powers\" with \"random mass deportation.\"\nA GoFundMe page organised by Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, aims to raise US$30,000 for her legal expenses, describing her as a selfless and hardworking mother.\n\"She has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,\" the page said. \"She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing.\"\nHer detention has been \"especially painful\" for her 11-year-old son, \"who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she’ll be home in time for the holidays,\" the page said.","summary":"Brazilian Bruna Caroline Ferreira reportedly overstayed her US tourist visa while attempting to obtain permanent residence.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/11/27/ice-detains-mother-of-white-house-press-secretary-karoline-leavitts-nephew","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/22302367-karoline-leavitt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 23:52:02","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":382552880,"title":"Trump Highlights Efforts in Navigating Complex Ukraine-Russia Peace Talks","text":"President Donald Trump has expressed optimism about the ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, noting they are making “progress” towards a peace agreement.

He mentioned that U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to engage in dialogues in Moscow, possibly accompanied by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\n“We’re having productive discussions,” Trump stated. “Ukraine is doing well, and I believe they’re fairly pleased with the direction. I’d like to see a resolution soon, but it will take some time. Nonetheless, we’re making headway.”\n\nTrump remarked, “We settled eight conflicts, and I assumed this one would be simpler due to my relationship with President Putin, but it turns out to be among the more challenging ones. There’s significant animosity involved.”\n\nTrump also highlighted Europe’s significant role in ensuring security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent any further Russian aggression.\n\nThe Trump administration had come under scrutiny last week after presenting a 28-point peace plan to U.S. lawmakers. Some lawmakers, including Republicans, initially described it as a “wish list” for Russia.\n\nTrump downplayed that plan while speaking Tuesday night, telling reporters that it was “just a map.”\n\n“All that was was a map.
