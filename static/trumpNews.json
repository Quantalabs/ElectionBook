'I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off. \n\n'So I was like, if I'm not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don't even want to have a dress ready, right?'\n\nBy refusing to even pack the appropriate clothes, Michelle knew she was preventing herself from taking the easy route and 'just saying, let me do the right thing [and attend].'\n\nMichelle said she was stunned that a decision she made for herself led to such intense speculation about her 30-year marriage. \n\n'My decision to skip the inauguration... or my decision to make choices at the beginning of this year that suited me were met with such ridicule and criticism,' she said. \n\n'People couldn't believe that I was saying no for any other reason, that they had to assume that my marriage was falling apart, you know?' \n\nHer latest comments come amid a charm offensive to dispel rumors of marital problems.\n\nThe couple made a show of unity at the weekend when they were spotted on a romantic date night at one of their favorite Italian restaurants in Washington DC.\n\nThey were all smiles as they made their way through the busy Osteria Mozza in Georgetown on the weekend, stopping to wave at patrons as they swatted away rumors of marital woes.\n\nBarack shook hands with a worker at the Italian eatery, where a main course ranges between $34 to $175.\n\nAnd the former first lady addressed the speculation during a recent interview with actress Sophia Bush for an episode of her podcast Work in Progress. \n\n'That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with disappointing people,' she said. \n\n'So much so that this year people were, you know, they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.\n\n'That this couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?'\n\nHer 61st birthday was three days before the inauguration. \n\nBut at the time, reports swirled that Michelle couldn't stand the thought of fake niceties with Trump.\n\nAt Carter's funeral, Barack was seen laughing and cozying up to Trump.\n\nThe duo shared a warm interaction ahead of the service, having a whispered conversation with one another in a moment which set the internet alight.\n\n'It did look very friendly, I must say,' Trump later said.\n\nBut according to a source who spoke to Page Six, Michelle wasn't interested in playing nice with Trump.\n\n'She's never been fake and she's never been phony. She's always been very deliberate about where and how she shows up,' the source said.\n\n'She showed up reluctantly for the election. They were united, but she doesn't have to unify around [Trump]. She doesn't have to say anything. \n\n'Her absence speaks volumes.'\n\nWhen she missed Carter's funeral, it was immediately cleared up that she had a 'scheduling conflict' which prevented her from attending. She was enjoying an extended holiday in Hawaii at the time.\n\nHer decision not to attend Trump's inauguration historically would have been seen as a monumental snub given all former presidents and first ladies have attended the following inauguration - even for the president of the opposite party - unless they were suffering from health issues. \n\nBut Trump himself blew up that modern precedent four years ago when he refused to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, President Joe Biden. \n\nFirst lady Melania Trump also skipped Biden's inauguration.","summary":"Barack infamously attended both Jimmy Carter's funeral and Trump's inauguration, which took place just weeks apart in January, solo.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14641705/Michelle-Obama-trump-inauguration-excuse.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/24/01/97625491-0-image-m-92_1745456079108.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/09/5221688015063136076/1024x576_MP4_5221688015063136076.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 01:13:28","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":314169422,"title":"Celebrity Big Brother star Patsy Palmer stays stone-faced during awkward interview as studio audience falls silent on spin-off Late & Live","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 'British' man lynched and burned alive in the Amazon... and the dark series of events that led to the 'English teacher's' horrific demise \n\nAndrew Flintoff wished he had died in the aftermath of his horror Top Gear crash and admits 'I thought my face had come off' as harrowing new details emerge - including how his cricket instincts saved his life\n\nDonald Trump launches scathing attack on Zelensky and warns wartime leader to back his peace deal and forfeit land to Putin or lose ALL of Ukraine\n\nRichard Gere's wife reveals why they are planning a RETURN to the US months after relocating to Spain\n\nI was diagnosed with cancer after strange things began happening to my hands - here are the symptoms you can't ignore\n\nI can see so much of Prince Philip in Louis.

In the beginning it was really tough for me to be in there. \n'We'd been through a lot, personally, before I went in. As certain energies left the house we all relaxed and we all got through stuff together.\n'It takes me a while to be fully relaxed with people I don't know, I started to enjoy myself when I knew them more. Then I thought I didn't want to go.'\nHost Will said: 'You ended on a high.'\nHe then threw it to Oti Mabuse as the audience cheers and the studio atmosphere lifted.\nFans rushed to X - formerly known as Twitter - to question why Patsy is 'so serious' and 'such a downer'. \nThey wrote: 'Patsy Palmer can put anyone to sleep with her monotonous dull tones; \n'Patsy's so serious and such a downer in these interviews. Maybe it's just me but...;\n'Patsy Palmer always looks like she's gonna throw punches.'\n\nPatsy replied: 'Erm, no I didn't want to walk.' The guest then burst out laughing, but Patsy remained stony-faced, she added: 'We're all there to do a job and I wanted it to be good for them'\n\nCrypitically taking a swipe at ex housemate Mickey Rourke, Patsy added: 'As certain energies left the house we all relaxed and we all got through stuff together. It takes me a while to be fully relaxed with people I don't know, I started to enjoy myself when I knew them more'\n\nFans rushed to X - formerly known as Twitter - to question why Patsy is 'so serious' and 'such a downer'\nIt comes just after Patsy refused to speak when she was quizzed about former housemate Mickey Rourke during her live eviction interview on Wednesday.\nDespite it initially all going well, things took a very awkward turn when Will and AJ asked her about Mickey, 72, criticising her cooking on the show.\nMickey had previously confronted Patsy about her 'inedible' broccoli before she left the room and broke down in tears while sat in the Diary Room.\nBringing up the ordeal didn't go down well with the soap star, who refused to discuss the exchange and Mickey, who was kicked off the show for unacceptable behaviour.\nAsking her about their conflict, Will said: 'There were a few tricky moments that you had to deal with in there, people complaining about broccoli - that was one, but you seemed to move past that?\nPatsy looked furious and simply shook her head, refusing to say more.\nWill said: 'You don't want to talk about the broccoli?'\nTrying to get her to open up, AJ added: 'Did it upset you that Mickey complained to your face about the food?'\nStill looking upset and angry, Patsy added: 'Not really that...'\nBoth presenters then agreed it would be best to move on from the topic of Mickey.\nDuring his time on the programme, Micky made homophobic remarks to co-star JoJo Siwa, which later saw him removed from the house.\nHe asked the YouTuber and singer, 21, if she 'likes girls or boys', and when she explained she is attracted to women and has a partner, who is non-binary, he responded saying 'If I stay longer than four days, you won't be gay anymore'.\nMickey also made a sexual comment that made Ella Rae Wise and threatened Chris Hughes during a task when he accused the reality star of 'eyeballing' him. \n\nIt comes hours after Patsy refused to speak when she was quizzed about former housemate Mickey during her live eviction interview on Wednesday\n\nHowever, despite it initially all going well, things took a very awkward turn when they asked her about Mickey (pictured), 72, criticising her cooking on the show\n\nMickey's run of bad behaviour resulted in him being removed from the show after previously receiving a warning about how he was expected to act.\nAfter the awkward moment with Patsy during Wednesday's show, fans admitted they were convinced more occurred between her and Mickey that wasn't aired.\nSharing their thoughts on X, viewers said: 'Need to know the lore behind Mickey and Patsy, she was seething at the sheer sound of his name'; 'Wow that was super awkward. Patsy was NOT impressed with the broccoli question';\n'I haven't seen any posts about Patsy's interview. I thought it was as clear as glass that she was uncomfortable talking about his behaviour. More went down with Mickey than the viewers were shown - for sure!!';\n'Ohh Patsy really didn't want to talk about Mickey. And to be honest... rightly so!'; 'I'm continuously torn between thinking Patsy is hilarious & the most iconic woman and also feeling like she's about to lamp someone in the face... I could feel Will's heartbeat through the screen when he asked about the broccoli';\n'Absolutely obsessed with ar Patsy/Julie refusing to discuss broccoli with Will and AJ #CBB #CCBBUK'; 'Patsy is really not giving Mickey anymore airtime. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BROCCOLI';\n'I think she, along with all the women in there, were repulsed by his sexist misogyny and volatile behaviour. They know how to not give him any more airtime. It must have been unsettling living with such a sleazeball. It wasn't about the broccoli';\n'With Patsy's reaction to the Mickey questions and Ella's comments about it in the face to face nominations, do we think there's more to it that we haven't seen/heard?'; 'What was going on there with Patsy? Bit odd'.\n\nMickey had previously confronted Patsy about her 'inedible' broccoli before she left the room and broke down in tears while sat in the Diary Room\n\nAfter the awkward moment with Patsy during Wednesday's show, fans admitted they were convinced more occurred between her and Mickey that wasn't aired\n\n Tearful Angellica Bell FINALLY breaks silence on Martin Lewis axe on Celebrity Big Brother before brutal eviction \n'Never ever mention her broccoli cooking skills to Patsy... death stare'; 'Patsy walking off the stage crying. Like genuinely is she ok, she seems very sad almost in a depressive state'; \nElsewhere in the interview, presenter Will asked Patsy what she thought about some of the housemates claims that she 'brought the mood down'.\nPatsy said: 'The person that said I was bringing the mood down [JoJo], literally I must be magician to bring their mood down because I've never known anyone with so much energy. \n'Beautiful energy, but energy. So I was amazed that I had that much power.'\nWill said: It's interesting you talk about energy, because I had never met you before, this is the first time we've spoken, and you do have a very calm energy even now. I guess that is very different to some of the other characters in the house. \nPatsy said: 'Yes, that's what makes it brilliant. That's why we all - it's a great experiment, mixing a lot of people together that are all very different, different ages, different backgrounds, beliefs, different everything.\n'It just shows what we need now in the world, that we can all live together despite our differences.'\nPatsy PalmerWill BestElla Rae WiseITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCelebrity Big Brother star Patsy Palmer stays stone-faced during awkward interview as studio audience falls silent on spin-off Late & Live\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

We've moved on from seduction to strategy,\" one EU diplomat said about dealing with Trump. \"We'll take decisions to protect ourselves.\"The diplomat added: \"We need to strike a path that works without Washington.\"Less than three months into Trump's term, his pursuit of a transactional, mercantilist, and imperialist foreign policy has rattled leaders across the globe. It started with the president's persistence in talking about annexing Canada and Greenland, his eagerness to end the war in Ukraine largely on Russia's terms, and Vice President JD Vance's caustic comments describing Europe as freeloaders. But Trump's market-cratering move this month to impose massive tariffs on nearly all US trading partners — based on a formula scores of economists found bizarre — caused many longtime allies to shed any last remnants of magical thinking that they could manage or contain this predictably unpredictable American president as they did during his first term.Leaders from London to Warsaw, Helsinki to Rome, are continuing efforts to de-escalate and maintain productive relationships with Washington, while considering how to \"de-risk\" by protecting themselves from Trump's havoc. Their initial moves could be the first cracks in a dam that could break wide open, unleashing a torrent of increasingly punitive actions that, ultimately, could unravel a transatlantic alliance that has tied America to Europe for eight decades and refashion the global order.The White House, however, downplayed the potential for a rift, asserting that Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine — which he has undertaken with little input from NATO allies — are aimed at making Europe more secure, even though many of the continent's leaders fear that any potential concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin will make their collective security even more precarious.\"The President has led in an effort to bring the biggest conflict since WWII in Europe to a peaceful resolution, and he is helping restore international shipping lanes in the Red Sea that will also benefit European markets,\" said National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes. \"We will continue to work with our European allies on ways to improve security cooperation — be that through foreign military sales, encouraging our allies to increase their defense budgets, and holding our adversaries like the Houthis accountable.\"Of course, private Signal messages during the attack on the Houthis laid bare how some of the president's most senior aides view Europe as \"free-loading,\" with Vance lamenting that he \"hated\" bailing the continent out. Trump officials \"seem to think Europe is this dying continent that has no future and is not capable of independent action, that Russia is the more formidable power,\" said Minna Ålander, a fellow on transatlantic defense and security at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \"They may soon find out that the opposite is true.\"Few countries across Europe are more indebted or unconditionally loyal to the US than Poland. And yet, posters are now showing up around Warsaw merging two silhouettes: Putin and Trump.It's an indication of the extent to which two months of direct threats and challenges from Washington are rapidly changing public opinion — and the private calculations of government officials — in Warsaw and in other European capitals.Trump has been pushing NATO members to increase their spending on defense, saying that the alliance's requirement that nations allocate 2% of GDP should be raised to 5%. But the result of his pressure may well be that NATO allies shift their defense investments away from American contracts, shrinking a lucrative financial arrangement upon which the US relies.Poland, which borders Ukraine and Russia-aligned Belarus, is already spending 4.7% of its GDP on defense, the most of any NATO member. And it buys more American defense equipment than any other country in the world. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have praised Poland as an exemplary ally. But Warsaw is reconsidering that partnership. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ruled out the cancellation of any existing contracts, but there are qualms in Warsaw about entering new ones.\"Confidence in the USA has been severely shaken,\" said Pawel Kowal, the Ukraine envoy in Tusk's office. \"I don't think we will be placing any more major orders with the American arms industry for the time being after analyzing our experiences with what is happening now.\"That's no small statement given how much Poland's procurement of American defense equipment, Kowal added, has helped to solidify relations with Washington, and the Trump administration in particular. Poland plans to spend $47.1 billion on defense in 2025, more than half of which will go to US contractors. But Kowal says Poland now needs \"to diversify our arms purchases\" and \"to buy in Europe or rely more on our own Polish arms industry.\"Cezary Tomczyk, Poland's deputy defense minister, said that maintaining strong ties to the US remains important, noting that Trump has encouraged Europe to be more self-reliant and saying investing more in production in Poland is part of that. But Tomczyk offered a word of caution, noting that the US has tangible interests in Poland as well. \"If the US alienates Poland, it would not be good for the US,\" he said.As Trump prepared to take office for the second time, European leaders strategized that they could keep him engaged with NATO by meeting his demand that they increase defense spending with commitments to direct most of their outlays to American companies. Now, they're moving in the opposite direction.\"Europe is now going to heavily increase its investments to defense. And it will be very logical that Europe is turning this money to its own economy,\" said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna, who also referred to the sudden questions about the reliability of American-made weapons systems. \"There must be a political trust that if you buy something, you must be sure that you can use them as well.\"Many of the countries determined to boost defense spending are loath to invest in America's defense industrial base — and newly aware that placating Trump isn't as simple as it was during his first term.\"In previous years, under Trump 1.0 and even afterward, we said, yes, we can appease him. He wants to make deals, he wants us to go on a big shopping spree from him: Buy F-35s, Patriots, liquified natural gas, and all sorts of other things … and then he'll be appeased,\" said Peter Beyer, a member of Germany's Bundestag from the conservative Christian Democrats, the party expected to lead Germany's incoming government. \"I think that's a much too simplistic calculation. It all doesn't add up, at least not today. It won't work.\"Trump's willingness to use US-controlled weapons systems as leverage over Ukraine in the midst of a war has given rise to new worries. Canada, Portugal, Denmark and Germany have publicly expressed reservations about continuing to purchase F-35 fighter jets from the US given that Trump, in the event of a political disagreement, could block access to spare parts and software upgrades needed to keep the aircraft flying and combat-ready.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has asserted that Berlin will continue to honor its F-35 contracts, calling the US \"an important ally for us.\" But he has also made clear that's at least partly due to a lack of other options when it comes to upgrading a current fleet that is about to age out.Beyer, a former transatlantic coordinator for the German government, said that even if concerns about an F-35 \"kill switch\" aren't reality-based, it would be \"daft\" for Berlin to continue relying so heavily on America's security backing given the administration's approach.\"If we purchase weapons systems, be it Patriot, F-35 or whatever, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, we have to be aware that it's like a Damocles sword that a shutdown could occur,\" Beyer said. \"This thought is now there in people's minds, also in connection with Starlink, Elon Musk and the data for Ukraine — this discussion is in full swing.\"Given that Europe is so integrated into America's defense industrial base after decades of procurement, finding European alternatives to US systems won't happen overnight.But even the US-made Patriot system has its challengers. The French-Italian SAMP/T, which takes only two years to produce, is now going through upgrades to put its range on par with Patriots. And confidence about it being a viable alternative has grown after its widespread usage by Ukraine over the last few years.On April 2, Trump levied 20% tariffs on the EU as part of a sweeping policy shift aimed at erasing trade deficits, only to abruptly hit the pause button less than a week later to halt a global economic panic that was starting to affect even America's bond market.Some countries — and their citizens — are now looking at how to hit back at individual companies or industries to cause pain or grab headlines in the United States.Some EU governments are considering weaponizing agricultural and environmental standards to discriminate against American products. They could ban specific products from certain Trump-supporting states, like Kentucky bourbon or Florida orange juice.As boycotts of Tesla have already shown — European sales were down 45% in January — public sentiment alone could drive people to stop buying American products on their own.Across the continent, Facebook groups devoted to organizing boycotts of American products have amassed tens of thousands of followers. In Denmark, a survey showed that roughly half the population has avoided buying American products since Trump's inauguration. And the country's largest grocery store operator now marks whether products sold are from European companies on its electronic price tags.There's also tourism. Canada is among a handful of countries that have issued advisories warning about traveling to the US, going as far as to ask citizens to \"reconsider\" visiting the States. Passenger bookings on airline routes between the US and Canada are down 70% compared to the same period a year ago, a shift that industry analysts believe will cost $2 billion in lost travel and business revenue. Similarly, travel from Europe to the US has dropped by 35% in the last two months.If Trump imposes tariffs he is weighing on pharmaceuticals coming into the country, the EU might decide to add export controls on top of that — making Americans pay even more for popular drugs like Ozempic, Novo Nordisk's obesity and diabetes drug, which is largely produced in Denmark.Some countries are also looking at ways to limit — or make more costly — essential products or services the US depends on.The EU could impose export tariffs on EU-produced machinery, electrical equipment or pharmaceuticals — creating immediate price pressure on US supply chains. That would come at a high cost for European countries, but some officials and analysts aren't ruling it out.\"Europe can have some chokepoints vis à vis America. Europe trades in machinery and optical equipment, we can effect a standstill of American production,\" Swedish economist Frederik Erixson said. \"These products are not easily substitutable.\"For instance, Europe could impose export controls on products made by Dutch company ASML, the world's biggest provider of photolithography machines which are used to produce computer chips. This would force US manufacturers that use ASML technology — American consumers — to pay more. Other choke points could be highly advanced technology products made by Nokia and Erikson that are essential to network operators.Erixon described such moves as \"the nuclear option\" in a transatlantic trade war, given how intertwined their supply chains are. But, he said, \"America is in a predicament because it wants to impose general tariffs, whereas the EU has the possibility of rearranging trade flows.\"Some European companies have taken to disrupting supply lines on their own. A Norwegian fuel supplier refused to refuel the US Navy warships and submarines after Trump and Vance berated Ukraine's president in the Oval Office. It was an isolated incident, but illuminated how much American interests rely on and benefit from strong alliances — and what stands to be lost if relationships deteriorate.And allies closer to home have other levers to pull. Canada supplied 27,220,531 megawatt hours of electricity to the US last year, not to mention 59% of the crude oil America imports — a point of leverage, some leaders have noted, in the event of a protracted trade war. The premier of Canada's largest province threatened last month to shut off the electricity that powers much of New England and the Great Lakes. states, vowing that Americans \"need to feel the pain\" from Trump's trade war.At the same time, the premier of Nova Scotia said American companies would no longer be able to bid on provincial procurement contracts and could see their existing contracts cancelled, remarking that \"some people need to touch the hot stove to learn.\"Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency and the presence of a raft of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration have highlighted the extent to which US tech leaders are increasingly in league with Trump. The EU had already been in the lead on regulating tech companies and attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on privately owned platforms like Musk's X. But there had been a sense of wanting to work together with the US on policies and standards.That's changing.In the Netherlands, lawmakers last month approved funding for a new Dutch-controlled cloud services platform to reduce the country's reliance on US tech companies.That followed a call from Dutch Prime Minister Alexander De Croo for the EU to \"take action\" in response to Musk's involvement in recent European elections where he advocated for far-right candidates. The EU has been investigating X, the social media platform Musk owns, for nearly a year and a half over suspected breaches of Europe's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms with over 45 million monthly users to comply with a raft of stringent rules designed to keep users safe and curb the spread of illegal, harmful content.Cutting against the grain, Britain is considering a cut to the digital services tax levied on tech giants, although the optics of doing so would be extremely uncomfortable at a time when the government is also drawing up plans to reduce welfare payments for disabled people.In a sign of how countries can leverage their own tech markets and companies that are important to the US, China is harnessing its control over TikTok's future in the US. Trump has been forced to delay the enforcement of a law requiring that TikTok find a new owner in the US or be banned over security concerns. That's because Beijing, upset about being hit with additional tariffs, scuttled a tentative deal giving a group of American investors a 50% stake in the company.Whether allies in Europe or the Americas end up implementing some of the more aggressive responses they're now discussing, Trump's unilateral approach and disregard for the interwoven economic and security interests at the core of longstanding alliances has heightened the urgency of lessening their dependence on Washington.No one put it in more stark terms than Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, responding to Trump's tariffs: \"The old relationship we had with the United States, based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over,\" he said in late March.Increasingly, Europe's sudden seriousness about defense spending isn't driven by the idea that placating Trump will help maintain American hard power as a backstop for the continent's defense — but by the realization that in many ways Europe is already on its own.That's a message Hegseth and Vance have conveyed directly both in private meetings and public statements.Following his election two months ago, Germany's new chancellor, Freidrich Merz, declared his top priority to be strengthening Europe to \"achieve independence from the USA,\" lamenting that Trump has made clear that \"the Americans … are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.\"To that end, Merz succeeded in winning the Bundeswehr's approval to skirt Germany's \"debt brake\" and dramatically boost defense spending, a striking about-face for a country that has been wary of greater militarization since the end of World War II.And as more countries follow suit, there is growing interest in forming new coalitions. Several countries in Europe's north and east appear interested in joining the six-member Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation, or OCCAR, which manages armament programs on behalf of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Belgium.Denmark, which has long contributed more to NATO defenses than many larger member countries, has joined the European Sky Shield Initiative to create a multi-layered air defense system in Europe.\"In three to five years, we need to be totally able to defend ourselves in Europe,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told POLITICO last month.Similarly on the trade front, allies are eager to insulate themselves from Trump's erratic approach by replacing trade with the US with new partners. French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said last week that Paris was suddenly re-thinking its opposition to a massive EU trade pact with several South American nations, calling on leaders in Brussels to address French concerns so that the \"Mercosur\" deal could be finalized. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement, Saint-Martin said, was \"a wake-up call.\"After Trump's reversal on tariffs left China as his primary target under an increased 145% tariff, Beijing opened negotiations with the EU to abolish the bloc's tariffs on imported vehicles from China. Those discussions, if successful, could dramatically reduce the volume of American-made vehicles sold in the European market.In the long run, Trump's belief that he has better cards could weaken America's hand, reducing its leverage over longtime allies once they're more independent from Washington.\"We need to take advantage of the crisis with the US, to rebuild our economic, defense and energy sovereignty,\" said a former French minister. \"And we need to carry on hitting back.\"Stokols reported from Washington; Fritz reported from Warsaw; Caulcutt reported from Paris and Schultheis reported from Los AngelesNicholas Vinocur in Brussels and Esther Webber in London contributed to this report.This text is a collaboration of the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network.

In 2024, former \"SEAL Team\" script coordinator and writer Brian Beneker sued Paramount Global, CBS Entertainment and CBS Studios for unlawful discrimination for repeatedly denying him career advancement based on his race, sex and sexual orientation. According to America First Legal (AFL), who represented Beneker in the case, both sides ultimately agreed to a settlement after what AFL senior counsel Nick Barry described as satisfactory moves by Paramount to publicly back away from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) polices. '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER'S ABRUPT EXIT FUELS DRAMA AT CBS NEWS AS NETWORK BATTLES TRUMP LAWSUIT \"America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations. Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note,\" Barry said in a statement on Monday. Fox News Digital reached out to CBS and Paramount for comment. An AFL spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that there will be no further legal action in the case. The original lawsuit claimed that, despite working on the show since its first season in 2017, Beneker was repeatedly denied promotion to full-time staff writer while minority writers were hired with little to no experience. When confronting the showrunner, Beneker claimed he was told that he did not \"check any diversity boxes\" to warrant advancement. The AFL also cited past comments from then-CBS CEO George Cheeks in 2020 announcing efforts to ensure 40% of all writers’ rooms have \"BIPOC representation\" for the 2021-22 season, with the goal of increasing the figure to 50% for the 2022-23 season. In February 2025, Paramount Global heads informed employees that it would be rolling back these initiatives in the wake of Trump’s re-election and anti-DEI policies. This included no longer using \"aspirational numerical goals\" for hiring and ending its policy of collecting race, ethnicity, sex or gender data of potential applicants except when legally required. CNN'S JAKE TAPPER RIPS PARAMOUNT OWNER AS CBS FIGHTS HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE WITH TRUMP This announcement came as Paramount Global agreed to mediation with Trump’s legal team earlier this month, signaling a settlement of the $20 billion lawsuit against them. Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

We want to get the right deal that’s in our national interest.\n\n‘Those talks are ongoing but it’s clear that the US as well wants a deal, and so those discussions continue. I’ve always been really clear that I believe in free trade.’\n\nThe issue of imports into the UK of hormone-enhanced beef and chlorinated chicken has long been seen as a barrier to wide-ranging free trade with America.\n\nMs Reeves insisted: ‘We have talked regularly with the farming sector on these issues.\n\n‘This never has been on the table in these discussions with the US – and the food and farming sector in the UK can be confident that we’re not going to be reducing our standards.’\n\nShe was confident that there is enough common ground for an agreement to eventually emerge, saying: ‘I think that there is a deal to be done, both on tariffs and also a wider deal beyond the media issue of tariffs, around technology, a technology partnership building on the National Security and Defence Partnership.\n\n‘We’re not going to be relaxing our food standards. The US like that and they respect that and understand that. So that is not something that’s on the table in these discussions.’ Appearing later at the World Economy Summit in Washington DC, Ms Reeves suggested that she would look to go beyond an arrangement on tariffs, including a ‘technology partnership’ and ‘building on the close relationship we have on security and national defence’.\n\nShe said: ‘This isn’t just about damage limitation, it’s also about what the next step is.’ Adding that she would like to see a reduction in tariffs and non-tariff barriers on both sides of the Atlantic, Ms Reeves said: ‘I think that can be a bilateral process between our two countries to remove those remaining trade barriers that do exist.\n\n‘And if we work on that basis, there is a deal to be done that will benefit industry both in the UK and the US and jobs in our countries as well.’\n\nShe also hinted that Labour is ready to slash tariffs on American cars to help seal a pact – with ministers reportedly considering cutting import tariffs on US cars from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAsked about the proposal, Ms Reeves told the BBC: ‘I want to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US but also with other countries around the world.’\n\nDowning Street also left open the door to cutting the UK’s tariffs on American goods to help get a deal that will see a reduction in the 25 per cent tariff on British cars imposed by the US President. The urgency of removing tariffs on imported cars has been underlined by the problems of Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover, which has temporarily halted exports to the US.\n\nMs Reeves said: ‘The Prime Minister and I went to Land Rover [in the West Midlands] a few weeks ago to meet with workers and the management team. There were no illusions about the scale of the challenges that tariffs pose to UK car manufacturers.’\n\nMeanwhile, the US raised hopes last night that its trade war with China, which has spooked global markets, could be resolved.\n\nSpeaking to bankers in Washington, Mr Bessent said that ‘there is an opportunity for a big deal here’ on trade issues between America and China.","summary":"The Chancellor told a summit the White House is 'keen' to thrash out a trade arrangement.

But the initiative as such, as the first step toward detente, naturally, deserves attention,\" he said.\n\nTrump said earlier that the United States may reduce its military contingent in Europe. According to Bloomberg, the number of US military personnel in Europe is constantly changing, with about 65,000 US troops stationed there before 2022, with their number increasing to 85,000 soon after the onset of the Ukrainian conflict and then peaking to as many as 100,000 for a short period of time. That said, Bloomberg does not rule out that US President Donald Trump may pull out the 20,000 additional soldiers that former President Joe Biden deployed to Eastern Europe immediately following the onset of the Ukraine crisis.","summary":"Commenting on reports that US President Donald Trump may withdraw more than 20,000 US troops from Europe, Sergey Shoigu noted, \"So far, this is only a statement of intent","url":"https://tass.com/politics/1948551","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:58:06","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":314167562,"title":"BHP gears up to find new CEO as Mike Henry could exit early next year","text":"BHP Group is preparing to begin looking for a new chief executive officer in the coming months, with key lieutenants already jostling for position to succeed Mike Henry at the top of the world’s biggest miner.\n\nThe understanding at BHP is that Henry is now heading toward the end of his tenure, according to company insiders.

A slight majority, 51 percent, said that the president is setting too much policy via executive order.\n\nWhile there were wide partisan differences in the responses to many questions in the Pew poll, there was bipartisan support for the idea that Trump should have to follow court rulings.\n\nOn the question of whether the Trump administration would need to stop an action if a federal court ruled it illegal, 91 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of Republicans said yes. Those numbers rose to 95 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans for a Supreme Court ruling. \n\nOn other issues, though, the divide was deep. \n\nOn Trump’s overall job performance, 75 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approved; among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents, 93 percent disapproved. \n\nAmong Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 78 percent approved of his cuts to government; 70 approved of increases in tariffs; and 78 percent approved of his ending diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government.\n\nMeanwhile, among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents, 89 percent disapproved of his cuts to government; 90 disapproved of increases in tariffs; and 86 percent disapproved of his ending DEI policies.\n\nIn the Reuters-Ipsos poll, 37 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, down from 42 percent in January. The 37 percent number is also lower than at any point in Trump’s first term of office, although it is higher than the numbers Joe Biden had in the final year-and-a-half of his presidency. Biden’s approval numbers on his handling of the economy dipped as low as 32 percent in 2023. \n\nIn the Reuters poll, 87 percent of respondents said they were worried about inflation, and 76 percent said they were concerned about a possible recession. Meanwhile, 52 percent said they agreed with the statement “Trump’s actions could make it harder for me to live comfortably when I retire.”\n\nThe Pew poll was conducted from April 7 to 13 and surveyed 3,589 adults, with a margin of error for the full sample of respondents at 1.8 percentage points. The Reuters poll surveyed 4,306 adults nationwide between April 16 and 21, with a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.","summary":"His overall approval rating slipped in one poll, while the approval of his handling of the economy dipped in the other.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/04/new-polls-show-dip-in-trumps-approval-numbers.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/G2BWECDKB5EG3FAFR2C5Z7KNEA.jpg?auth=389dc7bb73d4bfed8e09c4afdd225ee0a3a588f5b80cfab3caf7268d6f49d091&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:45:06","author":"George Owens","authors":["George Owens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":314168720,"title":"Trump signs executive orders targeting colleges, plus schools' equity efforts","text":"President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America’s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls \" wokeness ” and diversity efforts in education.\n\nIn a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.\n\nTrump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.\n\n Foreign money is at issue in clash with Harvard \n\nColleges’ financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump’s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.\n\nThe White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more. \n\nLast week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing “incomplete and inaccurate disclosures.” Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nIn the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.\n\nThe Trump administration intends to “end the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions” and protect against “foreign exploitation,” the order said.\n\nIt was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and “indoctrinate students.”\n\n Accreditors ordered to drop DEI \n\nAnother order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was “dominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.”\n\nOften overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges’ governing boards to classroom curriculum.\n\nTrump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump’s DEI crackdown.\n\nTrump’s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.\n\nThe president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump’s order said it should be “transparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.”\n\n“Instead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates’ performance in the labor market,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.\n\n De-emphasizing equity in school discipline \n\nTrump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to “common sense school discipline,” allowing decisions to be based solely on students’ behavior and actions, McMahon said. \n\nAnother executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on “disparate impact theories.” Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.\n\nIn many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the “school-to-prison pipeline” — the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later. \n\nFederal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama’s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump’s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don’t receive federal money.\n\nAnother order creates a federal task force focused on giving America’s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.\n\nTrump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools’ workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

And girl, same,' Kelce said before reacting with a surprised face.\n\nShe continued: 'But this was the top comment under our announcement video. It had 48,000 likes.

'I fear that you guys think that I'm kidding when I emphasize that I have no business speaking to the people that I get to speak to. \n\n'I was very nervous to speak to Mrs. Obama. I am so incredibly grateful that she was able to come on. I absolutely love how excited people were in the comments on things because it validated how hype I was about getting that opportunity. \n\n'It's so much fun to get to do things that are full circle, and it's so cool to get to speak to people that you never thought in your entire lifetime that you would get to speak to. \n\n'And it just keeps happening. People that I'm like, why? I don't know why you agreed to this, but I am so happy you did.'\n\nThat episode came at a time where rumors suggested that Michelle and her husband, Barack Obama, were headed for a separation in their marriage.\n\nFurther fuel was added to those rumors when Kylie dropped a promotional clip for the episode, wherein Michelle made a joke at the former President's expense.\n\nDuring the footage, Michelle discusses Barack mocking how early she goes to bed.\n\n'Bedtime is the best time of the day,' she says. 'My husband teases me about how early I can go to bed. He doesn't understand the idea of getting into some good sheets and it is cool.\n\nIt came amid rumors that Michelle and husband Barack Obama were headed for a divorce \n\n'If we have got people in the house, I'm game. I'm there, I'm talking. You know, the minute we finish up, I'm trying not to go to bed before the sun goes down.'\n\nMichelle and Barack have been married for 32 years but have faced ongoing rumors about their marriage status over the last few months.\n\nRecently, Michelle was seen in Los Angeles without Barack - but proudly wore her diamond engagement ring as well as her wedding band. \n\nEarlier this month, Michelle addressed the rumors directly on an episode of actress Sophia Bush's podcast.\n\nShe said her decision to skip President Jimmy Carter's funeral, and President Donald Trump's inauguration, were simply decisions she made for herself. \n\nHer absence at both high-profile political events stoked divorce rumors, as did President Obama's admission last week that he was in a 'deep deficit' with his wife.\n\nBut Michelle pushed back on those rumors in another podcast appearance earlier this month \n\nPresident Obama admitted that he was in a 'deep deficit' with his wife earlier this month\n\n'That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with disappointing people. I mean, so much so that this year people were, you know, they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing,' Obama said in the podcast episode, released Tuesday.\n\n'That this couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?' she continued. \n\nObama added: 'That's what society does to us.' \n\n'We start actually, finally going, \"What am I doing?

Video game studio Game Science developed the hugely popular Black Myth: Wukong.\nLee paid visits to brain-machine interface innovator BrainCo and humanoid robot maker Unitree Robotics. A source said the reason was because both companies valued Hong Kong’s talent pool “very much”, with the city having five Top 100 institutions in Times Higher Education’s 2024 World University Rankings.\nBrainCo told the Post it was “in talks” with the government for future expansion into the city. Founder and CEO Han Bicheng said the company had a great interest in Hong Kong given the talks were at an initial stage.\nUnitree founder Wang Xingxing said it was possible for the company to list in the city although the plan was not yet confirmed. According to Hong Kong’s Companies Registry, Unitree Robotics Limited was incorporated on March 6 as a private company limited by shares and located in Kowloon Bay.\nLawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong, an entrepreneur who has incubated tech start-ups in Hong Kong, the mainland and South Korea, said the city could serve as a key intermediary and bridge for mainland companies looking to tap into global markets.\n“It’s easier for tech companies to raise international funds through financing in Hong Kong … Mainland companies are also able to list on the stock exchange under HKEX’s Chapter 18C listing rules,” Ng said.\nThe rules, introduced in April 2023, allow tech firms worth at least HK$10 billion (US$1.3 billion) to sell shares even before they make any revenue. The threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion for those with at least HK$250 million in revenue in the financial year before the share sale.\nNg said cutting-edge mainland tech firms establishing a presence in Hong Kong would bring tremendous benefits to the city, such as helping it overcome the challenges of commercialising technologies.\n“These companies, in their pursuit of research projects, are likely to partner with local universities, which will draw in international talent … These innovative [enterprises] will also be a magnet for local young people, ultimately elevating Hong Kong’s overall R&D capabilities,” Ng said.\n\nI&T sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu said the advantages for these mainland companies to come to Hong Kong lay in the city’s mature infrastructure such as data flow, intellectual property, logistics and legal frameworks – all of which would help them expand internationally.\n“Beyond serving the domestic market, they also need to go global, providing products and services to other countries,” he said.\n“Hong Kong is exactly the right place for them regardless of whether the US imposes tariffs as technological development cannot stagnate.”\nThe firms’ potential expansion into Hong Kong comes amid the ongoing US tariff war. US President Donald Trump had imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on all Chinese goods over several rounds, with the White House also revealing the figure to be as high as 245 per cent on some goods.\nProfessor William Wong Kam-fai, associate dean of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s faculty of engineering, said the city should seize opportunities to strengthen its role as a “superconnector” to facilitate mainland firms to avoid “putting all its eggs in one basket” amid the trade tensions.\nVeteran political commentator Sonny Lo Shiu-hing said Lee’s high-profile visits to tech firms in Hangzhou was a gesture to align with Beijing’s point man on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, who saw the Northern Metropolis megadevelopment near the mainland border as being of utmost importance.\nXia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, inspected two special cooperation zones operated by the city and neighbouring Shenzhen in February.\n“I believe Lee also wants to encourage more Hong Kong businesses and tech firms to go to Hangzhou to learn from its advancements and explore opportunities amid the US-China trade tensions,” Lo said.\n“The goal is to facilitate breakthroughs in Hong Kong’s R&D, particularly in AI … This trip demonstrates his efforts to strengthen those mainland connections.”","summary":"Presence of mainland tech firms in Hong Kong would also improve local R&D landscape, observers say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3307665/hong-kong-know-how-can-help-mainland-tech-firms-expand-overseas-experts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/24/3176667d-b58a-4169-b60a-72646ce7196f_e0e917d9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:30:08","author":"Oscar Liu,Willa Wu","authors":["Oscar Liu","Willa Wu"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":314164084,"title":"Alaska Air lost $166M in 3 months. What does that mean for expansion?","text":"Alaska Airlines lost $166 million in the first quarter of 2025 but is confident it will weather the impact of tariffs and economic uncertainty as it looks to launch new trans-Pacific nonstop routes later this year.\n\nSeaTac-based Alaska Air Group, with newly absorbed Hawaiian Airlines, reported quarterly revenue of $3.1 billion, according to financial results filed Wednesday.\n\nThat’s up 41% from $2.23 billion in the first three months of 2024, before the airline merged with Hawaiian and when it was reeling from the impacts of the Alaska flight where a fuselage panel blew out of the plane.\n\nAlaska expected to lose some money in the first quarter this year but the net loss of $1.35 per share — up from a loss of $1.05 per share in the first quarter last year — is slightly more than the company had expected.\n\nMuch of that loss was due to new trade and immigration policies that have put the global economy in limbo. In April, President Donald Trump enacted a 10% blanket tariff on most imports and a 145% tax on goods coming from China. Beijing, in response, enacted its own 125% tariff on imports from the United States.\n\nWhile those tariffs don’t impact Alaska Airlines in the same way they would impact a retailer who relies on products from overseas, the levies could lower travel demand as the cost of other goods goes up and consumers are more cautious with their spending. Several countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, have recently issued travel guidance related to scrutiny at border crossings and immigration law violations.\n\nAlaska is optimistic that it’s prepared to weather the storm, even if the economy does slow down in the near-term.\n\n“We feel like we’re set up for whatever comes our way,” Ryan St. John, Alaska’s vice president of finance, planning and investor relations, said in an interview Tuesday ahead of the earnings release.\n\nAside from the “softening” macro environment, St. John said the elements of its business that Alaska can control are “going very well” and “costs are on track.”\n\nHe was referring to a range of initiatives, from a new loyalty program set up to capture customers following its merger with Hawaiian Airlines in September to expanding premium cabins to a new credit card, which saw sign-ups increase 25% year-over-year in the first quarter.\n\nAlaska hasn’t seen direct impacts from the ongoing tariffs battle in terms of costs but has seen differences in bookings, depending on the market, St. John said. Planes are full, but seats may have been sold at lower fares than they would have otherwise.\n\n“I think there is a certain portion of the population sitting back and waiting to see what is happening with the economy,” St. John said.\n\nAlaska expected it would lose money in the first quarter this year because travel usually slows down then.\n\nThis year, a lot of the challenges are coming from the Hawaiian network. Unrelated to the new tariffs, the demand for flights from Asia to Hawaii has been depressed for some time because of the weakness of currencies like the Yen, St. John said.\n\nBut the economic uncertainty hasn’t stopped all interest in international travel. Bookings on Alaska’s new Seattle-to-Tokyo nonstop flight, launching May 12, have been in line with expectations.\n\nThat’s especially important for Alaska right now, as it’s making a big bet on international travel across the Pacific with its $1.9 billion merger with Hawaiian Airlines.\n\nThe acquisition will expand Alaska’s fleet to include widebody planes flying longer distances and tapping into new markets. It plans to introduce at least 12 nonstop global destinations with long-haul widebody aircraft from Seattle by 2030.\n\nSt. John said it’s too early to know if the tariffs will impact consumer’s travel patterns long term.\n\n“We said we’re going to roll out this international travel through 2030, so there’s quite a lot of time. We’re still very bullish about it,” he said. “It’s still the right move long term.”\n\nAs part of the merger, Alaska will integrate widebody planes from Boeing’s European rival Airbus into its fleet. That means Alaska could theoretically have to pay tariffs on those imported planes, but it doesn’t have any Airbus aircraft on order, St. John said.\n\nIt does expect to receive seven 737 planes and one 787 plane from Boeing this quarter, along with two Embraer 175 jets. St. John said again it’s too soon to know if those deliveries would be impacted by the tariffs but, he said, “up until this point, Boeing’s been delivering on schedule.”\n\nAlaska spent $40 million in costs associated with the Hawaiian acquisition this quarter.\n\nContract negotiations with the two companies’ workforces, which will operate under a single contract, are ongoing. In February, Alaska’s flight attendants overwhelmingly approved a contract after two years of negotiations. Hawaiian flight attendants voted last week to extend their labor agreement.\n\nUnited Airlines maintained its full-year revenue forecast but released a second prediction if the U.S. does slip into a recession. Delta withdrew its full-year guidance entirely and told investors it would scale back on planned growth.\n\n-- Paige Cornwell and Lauren Rosenblatt, The Seattle Times\n\n©2025 The Seattle Times.

Their complaint is available here. The arguments advanced by the multistate plaintiffs are similar to those presented in the lawsuit the Liberty Justice Center and I presented in a similar lawsuit filed on behalf of five US businesses severely harmed by the tariffs (also filed in the CIT). They also resembled those made by the state of California in a case filed in federal district court.\n\nLike California and us, the twelve states argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) doesn't authorize tariffs at all, and that Trump administration's position runs afoul of constitutional nondelegation rules (though they shy away from the term \"nondelegation.\" I think it might help if they were more explicit in indicating the tariffs also go against the\"major questions\" doctrine, and that the trade deficits that supposedly justify the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are not an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" (which IEEPA says must be present to allow use of the law). But perhaps they may go into these issues more fully as the case progresses.\n\nI cover these and other reasons why the Trump IEEPA tariffs are illegal in more detail in my recent Lawfare article, \"The Constitutional Case Against Trump's Trade War.\"\n\nWhile our lawsuit is limited to the massive \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the multistate plaintiffs - like California - also challenge earlier IEEPA tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China, supposedly justified by the threat of fentanyl smuggling. I argued that these tariffs are also illegal in a February post where I first outlined the idea of challenging IEEPA tariffs under the nondelegation and major questions doctrines.\n\nThere are also two narrower lawsuits challenging the Trump IEEPA tariffs: one brought by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (challenging tariffs against China on behalf of an importer), and one brought by members of the Blackfeet Nation Native American tribe (challenging tariffs against Canada). I expect there will be more lawsuits filed by other groups.\n\nWe welcome the twelve states to this fight!\n\nIt's impressive this issue has united such a diverse array of people and institutions, including the conservatives at the NCLA, libertarians like myself and many of the LJC lawyers I am working with, blue and purple state governments, Native Americans, and a bipartisan group of prominent legal scholars and former government officials.\n\nTrump's tariff power grab has brought us all together.

Since 2022 the Fed has been allowing bonds it owns to mature and not be replaced. It has twice slowed the pace of that contraction to better allow policymakers to ensure they are not pulling out liquidity too swiftly.\n\nHammack said she supported the slower drawdowns. While there were still enough reserves in the system to press forward, \"I expect that by slowing the pace of runoff, we will be able to let the process continue for longer,\" she said.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV578503 \nAbout ConnatixV578503 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\n\"I interpret this slower pace to emphatically not be a signal of a permanently larger balance sheet than would have been the case without a slowdown.\"\n\nVia QT, the Fed has been withdrawing money it added during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Bond purchases aimed at stabilizing markets and providing stimulus more than doubled the size of Fed holdings to $9 trillion. The contraction process has brought the balance sheet down to $6.8 trillion.\n\nIt is unclear how far the Fed will be able to shrink its holdings, as it works toward a landscape where there is enough liquidity to allow for normal market volatility and for the Fed to retain firm control over its short-term interest rate target.\n\nFed officials believe the newly reduced pace of drawdown will allow QT to reach its natural endpoint without creating market disruptions.\n\nComments from Hammack ahead of the Fed's March policy meeting suggest she would have preferred another path for the balance sheet. In a February Reuters interview, she noted her desire for a steady QT pace and the use of repo operations to deal with any liquidity needs the market might have around market volatility tied to government efforts to manage its cash.\n\nFocus on the Fed balance sheet has been renewed amid high levels of market volatility tied to the twists and turns of President Donald Trump's tariff regime. Stress has been such that some have wondered if the Fed might have to intervene with market-stabilizing bond purchases if trading became truly disordered.\n\nHammack said that markets have appeared orderly amid the high levels of volatility, with investors being able to reposition money. Echoing recent comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Hammack said, \"I think there has to be incredibly high bar for the Fed to step in and say things aren't working. We need to be there\" to support markets.\n\nReporting by Michael S.

That will be bad because the wealthy people pay the tax.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told Fox News he was not supportive of a tax rate increase for millionaires “because our party is the group that stands against that traditionally,” noting “There were lots of ideas thrown out on the table” as Republicans built an upcoming bill that looks to establish Trump’s agenda for domestic policies.\n\nThe proposal that was reportedly being considered would have created a 40% tax rate for those earning $1 million or more per year, according to Bloomberg, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter (the highest-earning taxpayers currently have a tax rate of 37%, which applies to income above $609,351 a year).\n\nTrump and Johnson’s comments come after Vice President JD Vance and budget director Russell Vought were reportedly open to the idea of raising taxes on Americans making over $1 million a year, according to The Washington Post, while longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon openly embraced the idea, calling it “a no-brainer.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed openness to the idea of raising taxes on those earning over $5 million per year, the Post reported.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

If the GOP lets the top tax rate revert to 39.6%, about $400 billion could be raised over the next decade, according to the Post, which cited Kyle Pomerleau, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump’s inner circle weighs push for higher taxes on millionaires (The Washington Post)\n\nMillionaire Tax Hike Gains Steam as Trump Signals Openness (Bloomberg)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The arrogant remark comes as Canadians prepare for the country's general election , a campaign dominated by the US-Canada relationship. This issue has become more divisive in recent weeks as Mr Trump, 78, has repeatedly threatened to make Canada the US's 51st state through economic coercion. And the world leader has stoked the fire again today by stressing Canada would \"cease to exist\" if it weren't for the US. During a signing ceremony inside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: \"I have to be honest, as a state, it works great... We don’t really want Canada to make cars for us, to put it bluntly. We want to make our own cars.\" Canada exports, including to the US, automotives and oil, both of which Mr Trump insists the US can produce itself - or get elsewhere. His arrogant attitude continues despite a poignant call with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney recently . Mr Trump has a 25% tariff on cars. He has separate 25% tariffs on Canadian goods, believed to be his ploy to address drug smuggling into the US. He continued: \"I really don’t want cars from Canada. So when I put tariffs on Canada, they’re paying 25%, but that could go up in terms of cars. When we put tariffs on, all we’re doing is we’re saying, 'We don’t want your cars in all due respect.\" Before Mr Trump's latest dig, Canadians spoke to the BBC about what makes the country different from the US. A student in Ontario described his nation as \"very multicultural\" while a pensioner in British Columbia said Canada is \"a patchwork made of different languages and cultures.\" The thoughts jar directly with Mr Trump's attitude on immigration. Earlier this month, the politician classified more than 6,000 living immigrants as \"dead\" in a brutal move to make them leave the country. It meant the individuals suddenly lost their ability to work or receive benefits, couldn't use banks or other basic services - because their Social Security numbers were erased from the US system. Canada, described in the BBC feature by many residents as \"a country of freedom\", goes to the polls on Monday April 28. During his campaign, Mr Carney, 60, has said the relationship Canada has had with the United States for the past 40 years has fundamentally changed because of Mr Trump’s tariffs. Mr Trump’s trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state led to a surge in Canadian nationalism which has reportedly bolstered Liberal Party poll numbers.","summary":"Donald Trump had previously threatened to make Canada the US's 51st state through economic coercion - a vow which sparked anger across Mark Carney's proud nation","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-arrogant-eight-word-35107827","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35107846.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-Inspects-White-House-North-Lawn-For-New-Flagpole-Placement.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:07:10","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":314164324,"title":"Trump Kills US Agency Funding Africa Infrastructure","text":"President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered the closure of a US agency that invested billions in African and other developing countries' infrastructure in return for good governance, effectively ceding ground to China.The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will immediately exit projects around the world, from building roads to modernizing electricity grids, likely leaving the works under construction unless other partners step in. An MCC executive at a staff meeting on Wednesday told staff that \"we are coming to an orderly close\" with all programs to be discontinued, according to an employee who was present.The meeting came after a staff-wide memo, seen by AFP, informed that billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was imposing a \"significant reduction\" at MCC and laid out practicalities for the majority of staff who will lose jobs.Founded in 2004 under former president George W. Bush with bipartisan support, MCC signs contracts for US investment in developing countries that meet standards on economic transparency and good governance.MCC has since invested $17 billion with numerous prominent projects underway.Just in October, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema -- who has consolidated democracy at home -- vowed to keep upholding \"shared values\" with the United States as he signed a half-billion-dollar agreement to improve roads, irrigation and electricity.Trump has made clear he has limited interest in sub-Saharan Africa and that he opposes development aid, which he sees as not directly benefiting the United States, earlier shuttering the US Agency for International Development, a much larger government body.The MCC employee, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution, said the organization differed significantly from USAID.\"We're not doing humanitarian assistance. We're not doing social justice. We're very much building up an environment for private-sector investment in foreign economies,\" she told AFP.\"This is a very different thing, something that actually does put America first,\" she said.\"It's interesting, if we're worried about China's influence in the world, that we would shutter MCC, which builds large-scale infrastructure that counters China's influence.\"Infrastructure projects -- roads, hospitals and other buildings -- have been a signature selling point for China, which the United States sees as its primary adversary.Chinese President Xi Jinping in September vowed another $51 billion of investment in Africa over the next three years.The United States under former president Joe Biden acknowledged it cannot keep up with such high-profile, state-led spending but argued it can offer a more sustainable model.MCC will inform countries on Friday that compacts will be terminated within 40 days, the staffer said. After negotiations with Musk's team, MCC was allowed extensions in four countries -- Ivory Coast, Mongolia, Nepal and Senegal.In Nepal, Mongolia and Senegal, the MCC will have up to three months, with hopes of making construction sites safe.The goal is \"so someone is not going to fall into a pit or something,\" the employee said. \"Whether or not we'll be successful, I don't know.\"MCC was granted slightly longer in Ivory Coast where the project, which includes support for integrating major road arteries, is nearing completion.The Nepal project was sealed in 2022 despite street protests against it by leftists in Kathmandu.The $500 million grant in China's small Himalayan neighbor aims to improve roads and increase cross-border electricity trading with US-friendly India.In Senegal, a $600 million initiative -- $550 million from MCC and $50 million from the Senegalese government -- has included ramping up electricity outside urban areas.Elizabeth Hoffman, executive director for North America at ONE, the anti-poverty group co-founded by Bono, voiced alarm at the shutdown.\"MCC brings an innovative and entrepreneurial approach to development assistance that holds governments accountable and effectively counters malign foreign influences like China,\" she said.MCC and Trump administration did not immediately comment on the cuts, which were first reported by development specialist site Devex.","summary":"President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday ordered the closure of a US agency that invested billions in African and other developing countries' infrastructure in return for good governance, effectively ceding ground to China.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-kills-us-agency-funding-africa-infrastructure-3771149","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4596005/view-2012-chalatenango-tech-institute-el-salvador-built-funding-us-millennium-challenge.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:06:21","author":"Shaun Tandon","authors":["Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.018},{"id":314169100,"title":"Trump speaks out against sports teams abandoning Native American names","text":"President Donald Trump addressed the wave of sports teams that underwent name changes in recent years to remove references to Native American heritage.

He is a bogeyman who matters to strongly committed Labor and Greens voters, and to some strongly committed Coalition and nationalist parties he is someone who should be emulated.\n\n“Both those groups spend much more time than most reading and thinking about politics.”\n\nIn fact, in multiple elections, the right-side of politics has often been accused of importing U.S.-style politics or culture wars into the country.\n\nFor example, in last year’s Queensland state election, the Liberal National Party was accused of potentially cutting abortion services if it won power, while the Victorian Opposition Leader Brad Battin has often been labelled as “hard right.”\n\nYet Young said federally, Labor had engaged in a scare campaign focused on local issues, including concerns that Dutton would cut Medicare and health funding to support the Coalition’s $600 billion pledge to develop civilian nuclear power.\n\n“If I have criticism of the media coverage it is that they are not asking the tough questions of either leader, like, ‘How much debt is too much debt?’ or ‘When do you expect to get the budget back into balance?’ or ‘You say we live in time of unprecedented international risk, but apart from AUKUS where the equipment will arrive in 10 years’ time, what do you plan to do?’\n\nBut Williams says the Liberal Party drifted too much into “culture wars” issues, which was not going to resonate as much with disinterested voters or the wider public who were dealing with higher prices.\n\n“Lack of focus cost him dearly,” he said.\n\nWilliams also said backing down from signature policies was damaging the Liberal Party’s campaigns, noting the uncertainty around the Coalition’s “work from home” policy, and the sudden change in enthusiasm for nuclear.\n\nYoung had similar views adding that the backdown on forcing Canberra-based public servants to return to the office was needless.\n\n“In my polling ‘work from home’ was mentioned by three or four respondents, all women, and all rusted-on Labor or Greens.

But, as the administration of US President Donald Trump steadily pushes for a stricter immigration policy, the lawyers said foreign nationals with plans to visit the US should be better prepared.\nHere is what to know when crossing the border into the US and what to do.\n\nPrepare for interviews\nBe honest and clear.\nNo matter how you arrived in the US – by air, land or sea – a CBP officer will usually ask routine questions about the purpose of the visit, duration and where the visitors plan to stay, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. Some people or items might get a quick check, while others could get a more detailed examination, depending on the officer’s assessment.\nFor those visiting the US for the first time, or those who are shy or timid, it could be a good idea to practise in advance, according to Shih-Han Lin, an immigration lawyer at Akula & Associates, a law firm in Texas.\n“Don’t give irrelevant answers and don’t lie, because lying to a US immigration officer can have more serious consequences than some other violations,” Lin said.\nJian Joe Zhou, an immigration lawyer in Houston, Texas, said another one tip for foreign visitors was to prepare necessary travel documents before flying to the US, even if the traveller had visited the country before.\nZhou cited a recent case of a business client who was asked for detailed hotel arrangements for his full trip despite records of previous travel to the country.\n“As a CEO of a listed company, the hotel arrangements are usually done by his assistant. He happened to have screen shots of reservations the assistant sent to him via phone. So, he showed it to the CBP officer and he got in.”\nA Chinese student studying on the US’ east coast said that when he went through pre-clearance at a Canadian airport on his way to the US this month, he was asked to show not only an I-20 student visa but also his lease and US driving licence.\nWhat is a secondary inspection?\nLawyers say that if a CBP officer finds a problem that cannot be resolved quickly or believes there is a security risk, foreign visitors – including tourists, visa holders and permanent residents, commonly known as “green card” holders – could be subjected to a longer and more extensive secondary inspection or, in some cases, extended detention at immigration facilities.\nThat may also involve searches of the traveller’s belongings and electronic devices, for example, and law enforcement officers may check text messages, photos or the contact list on your phone.\nIf CBP denies you admission to the US, immigration lawyers say visitors should ask for a copy of the interview transcript and a justification for the denial of admission. This could be useful if you wanted to seek help from an immigration lawyer in the future, Lin said.\nA secondary inspection does not mean denied entry and it does not mean there is anything suspicious about the traveller.\nHowever, a secondary inspection may take as long as a few hours of waiting, during which no mobile phones can be used. Communication can resume after the secondary inspection.\nIn 2019, the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles issued a “reminder” for Chinese visitors to be “cooperative”, “rational” and “respectful” during a secondary inspection.\n“It is also recommended that relatives and friends wait patiently, and that the person concerned take the initiative to contact his or her relatives and friends to report that he or she is safe after resumption of communication,” the consulate said.\n\nWhat are my rights?\nVisitors can ask for an interpreter if they are not confident speaking English.\nThey also have the right to remain silent, but doing so could result in a denial of entry.\nIf the questions become intrusive or improper then visitors, including non-citizen visa holders, should complain and ask to speak to a supervisor, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\nLin noted that foreign nationals had few rights, for example, to a lawyer, during a primary or secondary inspection.\n“You can ask for [a lawyer], but CBP may permit or reject your request, depending on the situation,” she said.\nMeanwhile, travellers who encounter problems at the US border and decide to leave on the next flight home can “withdraw” their intention to enter. This may not prevent them from trying to enter again in the future – unless they were denied entry for a reason that invalidated their visa.\nDo B1/B2 visas guarantee six months?\nThe duration of your stay is determined by CBP, and even if the maximum duration of stay is six months under a B visa, that does not mean you will be given six months.\nIn 2021, CBP started to eliminate ink stamps on passports for foreign nationals flying into the US. Visa holders should visit the CBP I-94 website to check their own record to avoid overstaying their visa.\nLin said that as the US government tightened its immigration policy, visa overstays could have serious consequences, including re-entry bans, visa denial and even deportation.\n“This is very important, that what actually governs your lawful stay in the US is not your passport, petition approval notice or your visa but the I-94 form.”\nEffective from April 11, foreign nationals who will be staying in the US 30 days or more must register online with the Department of Homeland Security in compliance with the Alien Registration Requirement.\nLin said that under the new rules, visa holders or those with I-94 admission records were already registered, and foreign nationals turning 14 years of age must re-register within 30 days of turning 14.\nDo I have to unlock electronic devices?\nCBP has the authority to search belongings, including electronics, and may retain a copy of information if they believe it relates to immigration, customs or evidence of a violation of law.\nAfter the events of September 11, border searches became more aggressive under the “border search exception” that allows warrantless searches at ports of entry, such as airports.\nVisa holders risk being denied entry if they refuse to allow access to their device, but as the policy is still legally contested, the ACLU advises travellers to directly input their own passwords rather than divulging them to CBP officers.\nCBP said last week that device searches were rare – less than 0.01 per cent of cases – and meant to “detect digital contraband, terrorism-related content and information relevant to visitor admissibility, all of which play a critical role in national security”.\nUS Citizenship and Immigration Services has said it will begin screening social media for signs of antisemitic activity when processing applications for green cards, visas or citizenship. This has raised concerns over whether comments on social media could affect entry to the US.\nImmigration lawyers said foreign visitors should think twice before making comments on social media and in text messages that could lead to unnecessary misunderstandings, or consider using a temporary phone when travelling.\n“Even if these are just jokes between friends, there’s no universal formula for the interpretation, and the power ultimately lies in the hands of CBP,” Lin said.\n\nShould I rethink travelling to the US?\nChinese visitors with valid visas can still travel to the US as normal, according to immigration lawyers, Chinese students and travel agents in China.\nHowever, Zhou, the lawyer in Houston, warned there remained a risk of being denied entry if a foreign visitor had an arrest record in the US, even if there was no criminal charge or conviction made.\n“For those with potential issues, such as green card holders that have been out of the US for more than one year, the [chance of getting in] without a re-entry permit will be slimmer,” Zhou said.\nOn China’s caution about travel to America, the US embassy in Beijing said recent travel warnings by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism were “just another example of how China has chosen to retaliate against US tariffs rather than seek a path forward on reciprocity”.\n“The [US] Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,” the embassy said.","summary":"Visitors are advised to be ready for routine questions and have documents and additional information at the ready at the border.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307650/how-chinese-citizens-can-prepare-travel-united-states","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/23/9c212ded-2819-4be9-9ac3-fbc46ce3e3b3_68cd070f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:00:14","author":"Laura Zhou","authors":["Laura Zhou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.166},{"id":314162422,"title":"South Korea's first-quarter GDP contracts 0.1% as construction activity plunges","text":"South Korea's GDP contracted 0.1% year on year in the first quarter, according to advance figures, marking the first contraction in its economy since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe GDP figure missed the 0.1% rise expected by a Reuters poll, and is a reversal compared to the 1.2% rise in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nData from the Bank of Korea showed that the drop was mostly due to a fall in construction, with the sector contracting 12.4% year on year.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, GDP shrank 0.2%, reversing from the 0.1% gain in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nIn its monetary policy statement on April 17, the Bank of Korea had warned that South Korea's GDP growth for 2025 is expected to fall below its February forecast of 1.5%.

Cambodia has denied the claims, but the United States has repeatedly voiced alarm over the issue.\nThe Japanese port call comes on the heels of a major expansion at Ream, widely believed to have been funded by China. Phnom Penh maintains that the base remains open to all “friendly countries” and has pointed to the Japanese visit as proof of its commitment to a non-exclusive policy.\nFor Japan’s part, Kawashima said Tokyo wanted to demonstrate that it shared the concept of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) with Cambodia.\nIntroduced by former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and formalised as a strategy in 2016, the FOIP is aimed at promoting the rule of law, freedom of navigation and free trade.\n\nKawashima noted that port calls were “an extremely effective means” of gaining insight into the Ream Naval Base, and the choice of mine-sweeping ships rather than escort vessels was Japan’s way to avoid conveying the message that it was “militarily countering” China.\n“The [move] was likely intended to convey the meaning of activities for international contribution or training for such purposes,” he added.\nChhay Lim, a research fellow at Cambodia’s Institute for International Studies and Public Policy’s Centre for Southeast Asian Studies, described the arrival of the Japanese vessels as a meaningful moment in Cambodia-Japan ties.\n“[It] sends a strategic message [that] Cambodia is open for cooperation beyond just China,” Lim said.\nWhile one visit would not erase deeper concerns about possible Chinese military access, Lim said it still helped Phnom Penh “show that it still holds the pen in shaping its defence relationships”.\nThe foreign policy recalibration under Prime Minister Hun Manet, who assumed leadership in 2023, also indicated a “more deliberate effort to keep partnerships diversified” and that Cambodia “retains agency over how the country engages with its partners”, Lim said.\n\nCiting the Khmer saying “we do what’s best for ourselves, let others think what they want”, Lim noted that the Japanese vessels’ visit was about reminding the world that Cambodia still had “room to manoeuvre, and intends to keep it that way”.\nIn light of the unpredictable US policy under the Donald Trump administration, Lim said Japan understood that countries in the region were increasingly worried about a riskier world.\n“It is a good time for Tokyo to project itself as a steady, predictable, and non-threatening partner in the region,” Lim said. “Japan has always played the long game in Southeast Asia, and this visit shows it is willing to quietly step into complex spaces without making too much noise.”\nThe Japanese vessels arrived one day after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s two-day state visit to Cambodia last week.\nApart from highlighting China’s “ironclad” friendship with Cambodia, Xi last week called on the kingdom to “resist protectionism” and “oppose hegemonism”. The two countries also signed 37 documents during Xi’s visit, including on investment, trade and finance.\nChina, a close partner of Cambodia and also its largest creditor, has in recent years invested billions of dollars in projects in the kingdom, including roads and airports.\n\nIn recent years, Tokyo has also strengthened ties with Cambodia in what is widely seen as an attempt to offset Beijing’s influence in the region.\nA statement on Saturday from Japan’s embassy in Cambodia said the two vessels were on a mission that began in January to 11 countries across Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia.\nKawashima said Japan was also concerned about the suspension of projects by the US Agency for International Development under the Trump administration that had led to anxiety among many developing countries in the region.\nTokyo must collaborate with other US allies and like-minded countries to address how to respond to such changes and mitigate concerns about Washington’s withdrawal, he added.\n“The recent port call by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force at Ream’s port likely carries such significance,” Kawashima added.","summary":"Port call shows Cambodia remains ‘open for cooperation’ with other nations and Ream Naval Base is not exclusively for China’s use, analysts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3307633/cambodia-flexes-agency-japan-ships-visit-china-funded-naval-base","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/23/72def111-9312-4929-a0e5-1fe6b2b4e53b_baf79703.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 00:00:09","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":314159716,"title":"Mass deportations are critical to America’s future","text":"In a late-night order, the Supreme Court on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal aliens. The administration had relied on the law to expedite removals of some of the most dangerous individuals in the country, including alleged MS-13 gang members.\n\nThis wasn’t a final ruling on the statute, but it froze current deportation efforts and signaled a likely loss for the White House. Once again, Donald Trump faces betrayal from the very justices he appointed — only Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. The president now finds himself at odds with a politically driven judiciary that seems to believe unelected lawyers, not the commander in chief, should run the executive branch.\n\nThe implication is clear. If Biden can import millions without due process, but Trump can’t deport them without it, then the system has no future.\n\nMass deportations remain essential if the United States hopes to remain a functioning nation. But the legal system isn’t the only obstacle. Mass democracy — often hailed as a bulwark against tyranny — turns out to be remarkably easy to rig.\n\nWhen the ruling classes can’t depend on the current electorate to keep them in power, they simply replace it. Democrats understand that new immigrants overwhelmingly support the party that promises wealth redistribution — from the established population to the newly arrived.\n\nIllegal immigrants may not vote immediately, but many will gain amnesty or eventually naturalize. Their children will all receive birthright citizenship. That’s the plan: long-term voter replacement to eliminate serious opposition in national elections.\n\nThe crisis at the southern border never threatened Democrats. They designed it. It wasn’t a policy failure. It was an electoral strategy.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court saw no urgency in stopping a border policy designed to rig American elections for generations.\n\nThe Biden administration ran a cell phone app that fast-tracked illegal entry. It didn’t just leave the southern border wide open — it flew planeloads of Haitian migrants directly into the United States and dumped them in small Midwestern towns, where they overwhelmed local infrastructure. At no point did Chief Justice John Roberts step in, despite the administration’s blatant disregard for federal law and its constitutional duty to protect citizens.\n\nWhen government officials at every level violated core constitutional rights during the pandemic — freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and more — the Supreme Court barely stirred. When federal intelligence agencies colluded with social media platforms to censor Americans and manipulate the outcome of a presidential election, the justices stayed silent. No emergency orders. No late-night rulings.\n\nEven when January 6 defendants were charged under a statute that clearly didn’t apply to them, the court dragged its feet for years before taking up the case.\n\nBut when MS-13 gang members faced deportation under a long-standing federal statute, the Supreme Court sprang into action — issuing a midnight order to protect their due process rights.\n\nDifferent rules for different people. And we’re all supposed to pretend not to notice.\n\nThe situation has become so absurd — so transparently political — that Justice Alito called it out in a blistering dissent, highlighting the irony of denying due process in an emergency order supposedly aimed at protecting due process:\n\nIn sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order. I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate. \n\nThe absurdity doesn’t end with the timing. Millions of illegal immigrants already lived in the U.S. before Biden took office. Since then, more than six million (at least) have entered illegally — an estimate even generous analysts won’t dispute.\n\nNow consider the implications: If each of those six million requires a full court hearing before deportation, Trump could devote every waking moment of his presidency to the task and still fall short of removing even that cohort.\n\nThe implication is clear. If Biden can import millions without due process, but Trump can’t deport them without it, then the system has no future. Democrats get to flood the electorate with a new dependent voting class during their terms, while Republican presidents get bogged down in endless legal entanglements trying to undo the damage.\n\nEvery Republican president becomes a man with a bucket, bailing water from a cruise ship with a hole the size of Mexico.\n\nThe left keeps warning that Trump’s battles with the courts risk plunging us into a constitutional crisis. But that crisis began tens of millions of illegal immigrants ago.\n\nFederal judges have already blocked Trump administration efforts to reform the military, reduce spending, and rein in foreign aid. They act as though they — not the president — command the executive branch. Now, the Supreme Court has taken the absurd position that the due process rights of illegal alien gang members matter more than the rights of American citizens.\n\nA government that fails to secure its borders or remove those who violate them abandons its most basic responsibility. No country that tolerates mass illegal presence can long remain a country at all — certainly not for long.\n\nThe judiciary isn’t defending the rule of law. It’s eroding it — obstructing legitimate executive action, undermining democratic accountability, and weakening national sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has ambitious and vital goals: restoring American industry through tariffs, ending the globalist drift in foreign policy, removing progressive rot from universities, and dismantling the administrative state.\n\nBut none of it will matter without mass deportations.\n\nTens of millions of people live in the United States in defiance of our laws. They must be expelled. The only question is how far the courts will go to damage their own credibility trying to stop it.","summary":"In a late-night order, the Supreme Court on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal aliens.

The policies were rescinded that year but then implemented again in 2023, resulting in an increase in school violence and classroom disorder.  \n\nTrump's order called on schools to discipline students based purely on their behavior, with no regard to racial disparities as a result of disciplinary action. \n\n“","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-executive-order-school-discipline","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/trump-signs-executive-order-on-commonsense-school-discipline-policies-artificial-intelligence-foreign-gifts-and-hbcus.jpg?id=60029171&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C167%2C0%2C167","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:58:35","author":"Blaze News","authors":["Blaze News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":314169424,"title":"Demi Moore gives very telling four-word response on her future Oscar chances","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 'British' man lynched and burned alive in the Amazon... and the dark series of events that led to the 'English teacher's' horrific demise \n\nAndrew Flintoff wished he had died in the aftermath of his horror Top Gear crash and admits 'I thought my face had come off' as harrowing new details emerge - including how his cricket instincts saved his life\n\nDonald Trump launches scathing attack on Zelensky and warns wartime leader to back his peace deal and forfeit land to Putin or lose ALL of Ukraine\n\nRichard Gere's wife reveals why they are planning a RETURN to the US months after relocating to Spain\n\nI was diagnosed with cancer after strange things began happening to my hands - here are the symptoms you can't ignore\n\nI can see so much of Prince Philip in Louis.

The secretary said 90 U.S. trading partners had contacted the administration so far.\n\n“They all want to make deals,” the president said. “But they’re going to be fair deals. They’re not going to be rip-off deals.”\n\nTrump told reporters that for countries that fail to reach deals, the administration will set a rate.\n\n“If we don’t have a deal with a company or country, we’re gonna set the tariff,” the president said. “‘I’d say, over the next couple of weeks.”\n\nWhen asked if this plan would apply to China, Trump said he may work out a “special deal” with Beijing.\n\n“We’re dealing with a lot of countries right now, and could be with China, but maybe we‘ll make a special deal, and we’ll see what it will be,” he said, adding that his administration has been in contact with China “every day.”\n\nDuring a Tuesday press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was discussing trade deals with 34 countries this week, with 18 proposals already on paper.\n\n“Not at all,” Bessent said when asked if Trump would lower tariffs on China unilaterally. Bessent was asked about the tariff war with China after a keynote address at an Institute of International Finance event in Washington.\n\n“As I’ve said many times, I don’t think either side believes that the current tariff levels are sustainable, so I would not be surprised if they went down in a mutual way,” he added.\n\nThe White House also denied reports that Trump is considering a significant reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\n“President Trump has been clear: China needs to make a deal with the United States of America,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Epoch Times. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the president. Anything else is just pure speculation.”\n\nThe president’s tariffs have grown to 145 percent on Chinese imports after initially levying lower tariffs on Beijing to pressure the regime to curb China’s export of fentanyl precursor earlier this year. China retaliated by imposing 125 percent tariffs on U.S. imports, including other measures.\n\nThe president has paused targeted tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners until July 9 while negotiating deals. Additional targeted tariffs are also in place for products such as steel, aluminum, automobiles, and semiconductors.","summary":"'They all want to make deals,' President Trump said.

To the right, in big white-and-red text reads, “Have Dinner With President Trump,” and in not-so-fine print below: “The most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World.”\n\n The dinner with President Donald Trump will take place on May 22 at his members-only golf club, reads the site, and invites the top 220 investors in his memecoin to have a seat at the table in Washington, D.C. The offer is part of the Trump family’s latest effort to profit from the president’s personal cryptocurrency, which he launched right before his inauguration. News of the announcement saw $TRUMP surge 55 percent over the previous day, per CoinDesk.\n\n Trump’s crypto fortune has continued to grow since he returned to the White House. In addition to the president and First Lady Melania Trump debuting his-and-hers meme coins — which have been lucrative — the Trump family leads the decentralized finance exchange World Liberty Financial, which has sold at least $550 million worth of its first digital token, $WLFI.\n\n Widespread concern among experts has been raised as World Liberty Financial — where Trump’s sons Barron, Eric, and Donald Trump Jr. all hold official titles — offers a potential way to funnel money to the family. DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company linked to the family, has the right to 75 percent of revenue from token sales. The Trump administration’s push to deregulate the crypto sector could further expand the opportunity for bad operators in the crypto space to essentially pay the family off in exchange for favors. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that World Liberty Financial has explored taking a financial stake in disgraced crypto exchange Binance, whose criminally convicted founder has been itching for a pardon. Binance was reportedly encouraged by Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission asking a court to pause a fraud lawsuit against Chinese-born investor Justin Sun, who invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial last fall.\n\n Trump’s Justice Department indicated earlier this month that it will no longer pursue any investigations into crypto fraud.\n\n There’s also plenty of ethical concern around someone being able to sit down for an exclusive dinner with the president if they pour enough money into his personal meme coin venture.\n\n A previous analysis reviewed by The New York Times found that the early rise in value of Trump’s meme coin helped some investors to earn massive profit while its crash caused more than 810,000 crypto wallets to lose $2 billion combined. Meanwhile, the Trump family raked in approximately $100 million in trading fees alone.\n\n While many are alarmed to see the president’s flashy invitation to top meme coin investors, he held a similar lavish “Gala VIP Dinner” back in January 2024 for people who bought at least $4,700 worth of “Trump Cards,” an NFT collection of digital trading cards that portrayed Trump as a superhero, a cowboy, or a god.\n\n This time around, the president of the United States has plastered a leaderboard of his meme coin’s biggest investors on the site, which states it will keep track of rankings from April 23 and May 12. Per the page, the coin’s 25 top holders would will get access to a private VIP reception with Trump and a tour of the White House.\n\n Trump doesn’t seem to have any issue offering access to financial backers — despite the myriad of ethical issues over the practice. Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, who gave heavily to Trump’s 2024 campaign, bragged on a podcast recently about how easily he can access the administration. “The Trump administration is totally different,” he said. “There’s not a single person there you can’t get on the phone and talk to.”","summary":"The meme coin’s price surged more than 50 percent after the announcement on Wednesday","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-meme-coin-explodes-access-investors-1235323786/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Memecoin-trump-holders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:52:15","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.006},{"id":314158872,"title":"Trump signs education-focused executive orders on AI, school discipline, accreditation, foreign gifts and more","text":"President Donald Trump signed multiple Executive Orders relating to education Wednesday afternoon, with several tied to the theme of returning meritocracy back to the education system. The orders, seven in total, included actions to integrate artificial intelligence into K-12 school curricula, reforms to school discipline and accreditation guidelines, requirements related to the disclosure of foreign funding to schools and enhancements to the country's workforce development programs. Trump's slew of education-focused orders also included another directive demanding an end to DEI ideology in schools, specifically the use of \"disparate impact theory,\" on top of his previous executive order from January ordering an end to DEI-like programming and ideology in K-12 schools. An Executive Order setting up a White House initiative supporting the efficiency and effectiveness of Historically Black Colleges and Universities was also signed by the president on Wednesday. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TO RESUME COLLECTIONS ON DEFAULTED FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2020 \"They're allowing people into school – they can't do math – and yet kids who have worked really hard and are number one in their class out of high school – some place in New Jersey or Mississippi – they can't get into the best schools,\" Trump said as he signed his order implementing new school accreditation requirements. \"What is that all about?\" \"I think that gets to your policy, sir, of meritocracy – that we should be looking at those who have real merit to get in,\" Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who was standing over Trump's shoulder as he signed, chimed in. \"And we have to look harder at those universities that aren't enforcing that.\" The accreditation reforms, along with the president's Executive Orders on school discipline and \"disparate impact theory,\" were all connected to pulling back from the Biden administration's era of prioritizing DEI over meritocracy. Specifically, the accreditation reforms seek to prevent accreditors from imposing \"discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards,\" while compelling them to \"prioritize student outcomes.\" ‘THIS IS INDOCTRINATION, NOT EDUCATION': PLAINTIFF IN SCOTUS CASE SLAMS SCHOOLS FOR FORCING LGBTQ+ CURRICULUM Meanwhile, under the Biden administration, the Department of Education released student discipline guidance contending that persistent racism clouds school disciplinary systems. Trump's Wednesday Executive Order rescinds that guidance. \"Under, I believe it was the Biden administration – first Obama and then Biden – the Department of Justice issued guidance that made it almost impossible for schools to enforce adequate disciplinary policies,\" Trump's executive assistant Will Scharf said of the order as Trump was signing it. \"Basically they focused on CRT and diversity ideology, instead of actually just enforcing the rules in classrooms to ensure a safe learning environment.\" The prohibition of \"disparate impact theory\" builds on the president's past orders on ridding \"discriminatory\" DEI programs and influences from educational settings. \"This is a theory that underlies a lot of the modern DEI and CRT-driven diversity culture,\" Scharf explained. \"The basic idea is instructing your department and agencies to no longer rely on disparate impact theory as they're regulating, as they're issuing guidance, as they're making rules. We want to focus on results, we want to focus on actual fairness, we want to focus on merit, not things like disparate impact theory and the whole sort-of diversity, equity and inclusion cult.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SCOTUS TO APPROVE DEI-RELATED EDUCATION CUTS Besides focusing on returning meritocracy to the education system, the president's Executive Orders also sought to modernize American education and workforce preparation through the implementation of AI education in schools and through a commitment to add 1 million new apprenticeships. The AI order, Trump's latest pro-AI measure, established a White House task force for AI and education that will work with federal agencies and the private sector to help draft AI programs for schools.

The improvement, though modest, points to a sector that is adapting to volatile conditions while benefiting from stronger domestic demand.\n\nThe data comes as the Trump administration continues to implement sweeping tariffs as part of a broader effort to revive America’s long-declining industrial base. President Donald Trump’s trade strategy aims to close trade deficits, encourage the reshoring of U.S. production, and fund tax cuts through increased tariff revenue. While the policy has rattled markets, it has also begun to alter sourcing decisions and drive some gains in domestic manufacturing.\n\n“While tariffs had in some instances reportedly helped drive new sales to domestic customers, trade policy was widely linked to falling foreign sales,” the S&P Global report states, noting that the overall uptick in factory orders was constrained by a drop in export orders.\n\nInventories held steady, and longer delivery times for manufactured products were once again reported—a sign typically associated with busier supply chains. However, factory employment fell for the first time since October, signaling caution on labor investment.\n\nBusiness sentiment, meanwhile, continued to deteriorate. According to S&P Global, manufacturers’ confidence in future output fell to its lowest level since last August, reflecting concerns about higher input costs, supply disruptions, and weakening export demand. Still, some manufacturers expressed optimism about the long-term benefits of trade protectionism.\n\nThe somewhat brighter manufacturing picture in the S&P Global report was generally reinforced by the Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book.\n\nMeanwhile, several Fed Districts reported that businesses were pausing hiring or scaling back plans due to a lack of clarity on trade policy and broader economic direction. Labor availability appeared to improve in some regions, but firms remained cautious, with “scattered” reports of companies preparing for potential layoffs amid tepid demand and rising costs.\n\nPrice pressures also emerged as a central concern. The S&P Global report found that average prices charged by manufacturers rose in April at the fastest pace in nearly two and a half years, driven by a combination of tariff-related cost increases, supply constraints, and higher wages.

The elimination of California’s Clean Air Act waiver could lead to greater freedom for consumers and cheaper vehicle prices in the state, the District of Columbia and in the 17 other states that follow aspects of California’s emissions standards, the policy experts said.\n\n“The entire future of the auto industry, and what kinds of automobiles people are allowed to buy, what choices they have … All of that is at stake in this ruling, in this court case,” Myron Ebell, former senior fellow and director for the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told the DCNF. “Now we finally are at the point where we can win this debate.”\n\nStates are generally held to the EPA’s standard of emissions, though they can choose to follow the more strict California standard instead under the 1970 Clean Air Act. According to the law, only California is allowed to request a waiver from federal vehicle emission standards, permission which was granted to address “extraordinary conditions” in the state, such as poor air quality.\n\n“The Los Angeles Basin has intractable air pollution problems, and it’s not just caused by people,” he said. The Golden State has received several waivers to enforce different emissions standards for vehicles over the years, he noted, as the Los Angeles Basin traps emissions due to its topography. (RELATED: Blue State Democrats Take Another Crack At Putting Gov’t In Driver Seat Of Americans’ Cars)\n\nThe case now before the Supreme Court examines whether petitioners, like Diamond Alternative Energy which is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, have the legal standing to challenge the EPA’s 2022 decision to reinstate California’s waiver for stricter vehicle emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA reinstated the 2013 waiver which the first Trump administration partially withdrew in 2019. The EPA on Feb. 14 announced that it would be “transmitting to Congress the Biden administration’s rules granting waivers that allowed California to preempt federal car and truck standards,” and Republican lawmakers have since sought ways to repeal the state’s ability to create the de facto EV mandate.\n\nA court decision in favor of Diamond Alternative Energy could upend California’s ability to foist its emissions standards on the nation, and would allow other companies that represent key oil and gas producers to challenge the EPA’s other regulatory actions. The petitioners further argue that the California standard pins an unfair burden on fuel producers, which would lose business as a result of regulators’ push for EVs, and that they should have the standing to challenge it in court. A lower court previously ruled that the petitioners lack the standing to challenge the EPA’s waiver grant.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that the EPA has granted at least 75 waivers to California under the Clean Air Act since its inception.\n\n“If California gets away with having the waiver, they are in control of our entire automobile transport policy,” Ebell told the DCNF.\n\nCalifornia’s Advanced Clean Cars I program, which had its waiver reinstated in 2022, combines several regulations into one package, including zero-emission vehicle regulation and low emission vehicle criteria. The state’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, implemented in 2022 on a separate waiver, builds on this, mandating that all new cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the state — and any other state that adopts the California standard — be zero-emission by 2035.\n\nTo date, 17 states and the District of Columbia have adopted all or part of California’s emissions standards as allowed under a section in the Clean Air Act, according to the California Air Resources Board.\n\nUnder the emission standards, manufacturers are required to produce a greater amount of EVs and hybrids, or they must purchase “credits” from another auto manufacturer.\n\n“Manufacturers are required to produce a number of [zero-emissions vehicles] ZEVs and plug-in hybrids each year, based on the total number of cars sold in California by the manufacturer,” California Air Resources Board explains. “Manufacturers with higher overall sales of all vehicles are required to make more ZEVs. Requirements are in terms of percent credits, ranging from 4.5% in 2018 to 22% by 2025.”\n\n“The founding fathers would be rolling over in their grave if they ever thought the government would be in the business of dictating the type of transportation that Americans can choose,” Tom Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research (IER) told the DCNF. “The public is behind President Trump and the effort to preserve our ability to choose the types of cars that best suit our needs as consumers,” Pyle said.\n\nTrump has been an outspoken critic of the previous administration’s push to produce more EVs as nationwide interest in the vehicles waned.\n\n“I don’t believe that it was fair for the lower courts to argue that the plaintiffs didn’t have standing because their product is going to be severely impacted by the EV mandate because you don’t put gasoline in an EV, right?” Pyle continued.\n\nHe added that if the court does not rule in favor of Diamond Alternative Energy, the waiver can eventually “still be undone through regulatory review, but both the courts and the Trump administration’s review process will take a bit longer.” Pyle noted that the “shortest path” would be through the Congressional Review Act. (RELATED: Senate Republicans Move To Nuke California EV Mandate Despite Procedural Hurdle)\n\n“There is a ton at stake,” Amy Gunasekara, author and former EPA Chief of Staff under the first Trump administration, told the DCNF. “This would be the first time that an administration that has been very scrutinous of this waiver authority in the past that would also be calling the shots from the Department of Justice legal strategy perspective.”\n\nThis ruling will determine who has the authority to file lawsuits against the Clean Air Act waiver, which is “one of the biggest barriers” when it comes to this issue, Gunasekara said. “It would be huge if the Supreme Court finds that these parties do, in fact, have standing to challenge the California waiver,” she continued.\n\n“The merits have never actually been challenged in the courts, and that’s because the parties bringing the suit haven’t gotten a standing test,” Gunasekara said.\n\nVehicles in states that have adopted the more strict emissions standards are “ultimately subsidizing California’s decision” Gunasekara added.\n\nEbell also noted that the higher emission standards lead to limited choice for consumers when it comes to selecting a new vehicle, calling it a “naive belief” that the government can “order automobile manufacturers to design more efficient engines and cars that get better mileage without increasing the price or lowering the performance of the engine.”\n\nManufacturers have the “cloud of California hanging over them,” Gunasekara also said, adding that most regulatory attorneys would recommend auto companies take the “most risk averse approach,” which is to comply with the California standard. This means that car manufacturers must build pricier cars — like electric vehicles or hybrids — or buy special zero emissions credits to make up for not meeting the strict California emissions rules. “The ultimate loser here is the consumer,” she said.\n\nValero Energy Corporation, the EPA and the City of Los Angeles did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MILLY VEITCH FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:36 BST, 24 April 2025 |Updated:00:38 BST, 24 April 2025 \n\nJason Statham and his fiancée Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have reportedly sparked ire in a South London neighbourhood, after making several helicopter landings in a nearby field.\nThe action star, 57, and the model, 38, have frequently opted for the unusual mode of transport for their trips, along with their two children, Jack, seven, and Isabella, three.\nHowever, according to The Sun, the couple recently angered residents by being dropped off by the chopper in a playing field next to a riding school and scaring two horses.\nA mother-of-one, 35, told the publication that Jason and Rosie had made one such landing last Friday, which sent the horses into a panic.\nShe said: 'After landing, the pilot ran across the field to say sorry. It looked like he was really apologetic and made an effort to make sure everyone was OK. But if a horse bolts with a six-year-old on it, it won’t be pretty.'\nThe Hollywood actor and Transformer star allegedly made another landing the following day, with the pilot taking extra caution to avoid the riding school.\n\nJason Statham and his fiancée Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have reportedly sparked ire in a South London neighbourhood, after making several helicopter landings in a nearby field (pictured in 2023)\n\nThe action star, 57, and the model, 38, have frequently opted for the unusual mode of transport for their trips, along with their two children, Jack, seven, and Isabella, three (seen last year) \nBut it's not just animals feeling the adverse effects, with several other residents complaining about the level of noise of the chopper.\nA father-of-two living in a property that backs on to the field described Jason and Rosie's helicopter to The Sun as 'very noisy'.\nAnd another resident echoed his concerns, telling the publication: 'It’s been quite frequent. It flies low over our houses and it’s very loud. It’s not something we appreciate. I won’t be happy if it becomes a regular occurrence. \n'There’s a reason we chose to live far out from Heathrow or City airports. It’s not great, especially with people working from home and elderly people living here.'\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for the couple for comment.\nJason and Rosie moved back to London for the safety of their children in 2021, after living in California for 11 years.\nThey invested an eye-watering £15million in three luxury homes in the capital, including seven-bedroom mansion and a £7.5 million three-bedroom townhouse in Chelsea.\nSpeaking in Los Angeles in 2019 on her desire to return to her homeland, Devon-born Rosie said: 'I have always seen a move back in the future, which I feel excited by. It'll be a new chapter.\n\nA father-of-two living in a property that backs on to the field described Jason and Rosie's helicopter to The Sun as 'very noisy'\n\nJason and Rosie moved back to London for the safety of their children in 2021, after living in California for 11 years (Jack and Isabella pictured) \n'Since becoming a mother, I have found a growing desire to be close to my roots. I'm very proud to be British and I think the UK is a really special place to raise a family.'\nAnd after finally making the big move during the pandemic, she gushed that getting away all the paparazzi attention in Los Angeles had been 'really grounding' and detailed why it had been so important for their children's privacy.\nSpeaking to the Telegraph in October, the Victoria's Secret star said: 'Living back in the UK has been a really grounding experience for us.\n'The fact that we can walk out of our front door and go and get a coffee and a loaf of bread [without paparazzi].\n'We'd leave our home in LA and there'd be five cars following us down the block to the gym. Both Jason and I felt like it was really important for our children to not be impacted by our line of work.\n'We wanted our kids to have a childhood away from cameras as much as we could. Because I've seen that.\n'I've seen children of celebrities whose parents didn't give them that choice. It's Jack's choice and it's Bella's choice, whether they live in the public eye.\n'If they want to, that won't be a problem. But I just always feared my son turning round to me one day and saying, \"You and Daddy didn't protect me, I don't want this\".'\n\nAnd after making the big move, she gushed that getting away all the paparazzi attention in LA had been 'really grounding' and detailed why it had been so important for their kid's privacy\n\nRosie and Jason first began dating in 2009 after meeting at a party in London and experiencing what Rosie called 'instant chemistry'.\nThey made their red carpet debut in February 2011 at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party, and later that year attended the Met Gala together as well.\nThe couple then revealed their engagement after Rosie flashed her impressive diamond ring at the 2016 Golden Globes.\nHowever, DailyMail.com reported that the couple are in no rush to tie the knot any time soon, as they love being engaged so much.\nAccording to a source close to them, Rosie and Jason are on the 'same page' when it comes to their relationship and insisted they 'will' get married one day, but there's 'no rush'.\nThey assured: 'They are also very private but Jason knows how lucky he is and loves the life he has; he is very happy.\n\nRosie and Jason first began dating in 2009 after meeting at a party in London and experiencing what Rosie called 'instant chemistry' (pictured in 2015)\n'When it comes to them, they will get married eventually but they feel like they are already married and there is no rush. \"If it isn't broken, why fix it\" is their overall mentality.'\nThe source also suggested the couple may even add to their brood rather than plan a wedding and their children may be the ones to push them into a wedding.\nThey explained: 'And as it comes to their kids, their kids are still very young and their thoughts on expanding their family being such a very plausible thing, they might wait to have a wedding once their kids get older so they can enjoy it themselves.\n'They both anticipate that their kids will ask them to have one in the future and if that happens, that would be the tipping point to actually have one.'\nRosie Huntington-WhiteleyLos AngelesJason Statham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's personal helicopter trips 'spark rage from residents after noisy landings spook their horses'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The White House criticized him for revealing sensitive details of the negotiations – while President Trump warned that he risks losing the entire country if he continues to stall talks with Moscow.\n\n“I think Russia is ready… I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky,” Trump told journalists at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nAnd I hope that Zelensky… I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky – so far it’s been harder.\n\nThe US president added, “that’s okay, it’s alright,” expressing hope that “we’ll have a deal with both.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump warned in a post on Truth Social that Zelensky holds a weak bargaining position. “The situation for Ukraine is dire – He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” he wrote.\n\nTrump declined to say whether he intends to meet Zelensky when both are expected to attend the funeral of Pope Francis later this week. “I don’t know if he is going to the funeral or not… I just hope he gets this thing solved,” Trump told reporters.\n\nAsked whether he expects to meet Putin during a planned visit to Saudi Arabia next month, Trump said it was “possible, but most likely not… I think we’ll meet with him shortly thereafter.”\n\nThe US has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, while also seeking to secure a minerals extraction agreement with Ukraine to help offset the billions of dollars it has spent supplying weapons and aid.\n\nHowever, Trump and his administration have grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations on both fronts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Tuesday that if progress stalls, the US may walk away from the talks. “If not enough movement is happening, we may need to move on to other priorities,” he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also voiced Trump’s frustration with Zelensky. “Unfortunately, Zelensky has been trying to litigate this peace negotiation in the press, and that’s unacceptable to the president,” Leavitt said on Wednesday.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that a peace deal with Ukraine is unlikely to be concluded in an expedited manner due to the complexities of the negotiations. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict – while any temporary ceasefire would be used by Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm the country’s military.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has previously accused Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky of stalling his peace efforts \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/616179-zelensky-harder-to-deal-with-trump/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/6809789485f54005761e70a6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:35:59","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":314159534,"title":"Four creepy words girl, 7, heard from 'man's voice' before grossly indecent act in woman's changing room","text":"The chilling voice of a Kansas man echoed through a women's changing room as he uttered four haunting words, all while exposing himself to a young girl and her mother. \n\nA mother and her seven-year-old daughter were changing in the women's locker room of a North Kansas City YMCA fitness center earlier this month when the sound of a man's voice sent chills down their spine, prompting them to leave the stall, Fox 4 KC reported.\n\nBut on their way out, the disturbing sight of a naked man with his genitals exposed left them in utter disbelief.\n\nWhen confronted about what he was doing, the indecent man simply responded: 'Honey, I'm a woman'. \n\nOn April 12, the unnamed seven-year-old girl had just finished her swimming lessons at the YMCA when she and her mother went to the locker rooms to dry off and change. \n\nIt was while the pair were still in the stall that they heard the distinct sound of a man's voice coming from inside the women's dedicated changing room. \n\nTogether, they left the stall - only to be confronted seconds later with a naked man exposing himself.\n\nThe genitals were out in the open for anyone - including her young daughter - to see.\n\nThe mother immediately questioned the man's vile act, demanding to know what in the world he was doing - naked - in a space where women are supposed to feel safe. \n\n'Honey, I'm a woman,' the mother recalled the man bluntly responding.\n\nSprinting out of the changing room, she and her daughter then went to a staff member to report the unsettling incident.\n\n'This is not a case of transitional status,' the mother, who wishes to remain anonymous to protect her family, told Fox 4.\n\n'This is an issue of somebody showing their body parts to my child in a room where she should be safe from such things.' \n\nDozens of mothers were left unsettled as news of the incident spread, particularly given that hundreds of children attend swim lessons at the facility and likely use the women's locker room to change after their session ends.\n\n'Shock, because I have an 11-year-old that comes here often with me and works out,' Angela Bush, a YMCA member, told Fox 4. 'It's definitely a shock.'\n\n'My 11-year-old does use that locker room, especially after we go to the pool,' Bush added.\n\n'In there, you either have to use the closed-off showers or try to change as quickly as possible. It's definitely shocking and something we'll be looking out for a little bit more.'\n\nFollowing the mother's report, the YMCA of Greater Kansas City launched its own formal investigation into the matter, stating that they are 'aware of a reported incident in the locker room' but are 'unable to provide further details at this time'. \n\n'We follow all state and local laws, and individuals are allowed to use the locker room or restroom that they identify with,' the facility said in a statement to Fox 4.\n\n'At the North Kansas City YMCA, we also have four private universal changing rooms available, separate from the larger shared locker rooms, for anyone who prefers the privacy they offer,' the statement added.\n\n'The safety and well-being of all of our members is a priority, and we take this concern seriously.'\n\nIn the statement, YMCA also emphasized the importance of wearing a towel, wrap or other clothes at all times while using any of the facility's shared spaces - a rule that is stressed to members upon joining.\n\nAlong with the YMCA, the North Kansas City Police Department also confirmed an active investigation into the mother's indecent exposure report, though they did not share any further details.\n\nIn August of last year, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey launched an investigation into Life Time Fitness - a separate fitness chain - for a similar problem within the establishment's locker rooms.\n\nLife Time reportedly allowed Eric Montano, a transgender-identifying male, to access the female spaces throughout the gym, National Review reported. \n\nHowever, the decision was met with numerous complaints from female members, particularly because Montano exposed himself while in the women's changing room before.\n\nThe gym ultimately revoked Montano's membership, citing that 'Life Time was presented with multiple, publicly available statements which could affect the safety and security at one of our clubs', a spokesperson told National Review.\n\nIn a notice of investigation addressed to the facility's CEO, Bailey wrote that he will 'vigorously defend and enforce Missouri's laws'.\n\n'If you insist on endangering women and young girls in our state, in open defiance of the law, be assured you will face the consequences,' the document read.\n\nIn January, Donald Trump signed a one-day executive order declaring that the government will only recognize two sexes - male and female.\n\nThis meant that all 'intimate spaces designated for women, girls or females' will be determined by sex rather than gender identity. \n\nJust last week, the United Kingdom's Supreme Court announced in a landmark judgement that the definition of a woman is based on biological sex, signaling a revolt against woke policies. \n\nLord Hodge said that five Supreme Court justices had unanimously decided that 'the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a 'biological woman and biological sex'. \n\nHe recognized 'the strength of feeling on both sides' and cautioned against seeing the judgement as a triumph for one side over another, stressing that the law still gives trans people protection against discrimination. \n\nIn an 88-page ruling, the justices said: 'The definition of sex in the Equality Act 2010 makes clear that the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man.'\n\nThe decision could have far-reaching implications on how sex-based rights apply, including how women-only spaces are allowed to operate.\n\nLawyers suggested that transgender women may be asked to use disabled bathrooms at work following the Supreme Court's decision, as they are set to be barred from both female bathrooms and sports. \n\nEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) chairwoman Baroness Kishwer Falkner described the ruling as 'enormously consequential' and vowed to pursue organizations which do not update their policies. \n\nOn issues such as toilets, changing rooms and sports, Baroness Falkner echoed the Government in saying the ruling had brought 'clarity' to providers on their duties under equality law around single-sex spaces. \n\nOn changing rooms and toilets, Baroness Falkner said: 'Single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex.' \n\nShe said there is no law against organizations providing a third space, such as unisex toilets, and suggested that trans rights organizations 'should be using their powers of advocacy to ask for those third spaces'.","summary":"The chilling voice of a Kansas man echoed through a women's changing room as he uttered four haunting words, all while exposing himself to a seven-year-old girl and her mother.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14641213/creepy-words-girl-mans-voice-womans-changing-room-kansas-NEW.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/23/23/97621091-0-image-m-17_1745446654364.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:35:05","author":"Editor,Kelly Garino","authors":["Editor","Kelly Garino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":314163594,"title":"A running list of RFK Jr.'s controversies","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nA running list of RFK Jr.'s controversies \n\nThe man atop the Department of Health and Human Services has had no shortage of scandals over the years\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThough Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine, his record suggests otherwise\n\n(Image credit: Illustration by Julia Wytrazek / Getty Images)\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US, Brigid Kennedy \n\n23 April 2025\n\nFrom his beginnings as an acclaimed environmentalist to his transformation into a purveyor of vaccine denial and conspiracy theories, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spent a lifetime in the public eye. Throughout it all, the scion of the fabled Kennedy political dynasty has courted controversy; enough to prompt his own family to publicly denounce his more extreme positions as spreading \"dangerous misinformation\" that leads to \"heartbreaking consequences\" in an essay for Politico. Nevertheless, those familial red flags did nothing to dissuade President Donald Trump from naming Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, placing a man whose positions on firmly-established science are in direct odds with the overwhelming majority of the medical community atop one of the largest, most consequential federal bodies of its type.\n\nHaving wasted little time since his narrow Senate confirmation in putting his science-skeptical imprimatur on the department he now leads, Kennedy — under the banner of his iterative \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement —continues to court controversy amidst multiple national health crises including a measles outbreak and the threat of a wide-scale bird flu epidemic. Now fully entrenched in the Department of Health and Human Services' bureaucracy, once-theoretical questions of how his past comments might shed light on his future decisions have become decidedly more pointed and more urgent in equal measure.\nSpread falsehoods about the causes of autism, its history and impact\n\nSpeaking at his first official press briefing as the Health and Human Services Secretary, Kennedy in mid-April claimed without evidence or further explanation that autistic children \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date, many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\" The remarks were \"plainly untrue,\" said Jessica Grose at The New York Times. By implying that \"those who are not able to be gainfully employed are somehow lesser citizens,\" Kennedy has shown he is \"not fit to be in charge of the health of the country,\" Grose said. The \"backlash\" over Kennedy's \"anti-scientific, offensive and belittling remarks\" comes as the secretary plans to launch a federal database of Americans with autism, said MSNBC. Not only do those plans raise a \"host of data security concerns,\" but they also have alarmed advocates who worried about how Kennedy might use the data \"to advance his conspiratorial and harmful health agenda.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Most notably, he has promoted the \"scientifically discredited belief that childhood vaccines cause autism,\" The New York Times said, a notion that has \"been rejected by more than a dozen peer-reviewed scientific studies across multiple countries.\"\n\nMoreover, he has repeatedly questioned the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine, made numerous misleading claims about the way vaccines are tested, and even falsely alleged that HIV, the virus that later leads to AIDS if left untreated, originated from a vaccine program, CNN fact checker and reporter Daniel Dale said in an appearance on CNN. \"So what do you call someone like Mr. Kennedy who devotes their time, energy, public remarks to devoting entirely fake claims about vaccines killing people in all manner of ways?\" Dale added.\"I think 'anti-vax' is a fair descriptor.\"\n\nInvoked Hitler when speaking out against vaccine mandates\nSpeaking at a rally against mandates in Washington, D.C. in early 2022, Kennedy invoked Hitler and Nazi Germany as he lampooned Covid-19 jab policies in the United States. \"Even in Hitler Germany (sic), you could … cross the Alps into Switzerland. You could hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did,\" Kennedy said. \"I visited, in 1962, East Germany with my father and met people who had climbed the wall and escaped, so it was possible. Many died, true, but it was possible.\" He quickly drew backlash for the comments, which critics saw as a suggestion that things were better for those alive during the Holocaust than they are today, said Politico.\nDownplayed the Texas measles outbreak while touting medically questionable alternatives to vaccinations\nAfter a measles infection killed an unvaccinated child in Texas in February, 2025, the then-newly confirmed Secretary Kennedy downplayed the seriousness of the ongoing outbreak as \"not unusual\" during a cabinet meeting. Measles has a \"very, very low infection fatality rate,\" Kennedy said in a lengthy Fox News interview shortly thereafter. Kennedy's measles responses have \"strayed far from mainstream science\" and relied heavily on \"fringe theories about prevention and treatments\" such as cod liver oil and vitamin A, The New York Times said. Kennedy's insistence on alternate measles treatments are \"concerning some infectious disease doctors,\" said National Public Radio, as he \"didn't strongly encourage people to get their children vaccinated, which is usually a key part of the public health response during an outbreak.\"\nSuggested Covid was designed to spare Jews and Chinese people\nIn July 2023, Kennedy claimed that Covid could have been a bioweapon designed to target and disproportionately attack \"certain races,\" like Caucasians and Black people, and spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, who he said are the \"most immune\" to the virus. \"We don't know whether it was deliberately targeted or not,\" he said during a press dinner captured on video, \"but there are papers out there that show the racial or ethnic differential and impact.\" He later insisted that he never \"suggested that the Covid-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews\" and was instead referring to a study that \"serves as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons,\" CNN said.\nBlamed gender dysphoria on chemicals in the environment\nKennedy has repeatedly alleged that exposure to chemicals — endocrine disruptors, namely — is causing gender dysphoria in children and contributing to a rise in LGBTQ+ youth. Speaking on a June 2022 episode of his podcast, Kennedy said he wants to \"pursue just one question on these … endocrine disruptors\" because \"we're seeing these impacts that people suspect are very different than in ages past about sexual identification among children and sexual confusion, gender confusion.\"\n\nMAHA moms: the cohort of women backing RFK Jr.'s health agenda\nCaroline Kennedy urges Senate to reject RFK Jr.\nHow much of RFK Jr.'s health care agenda could he deliver in Trump's Cabinet?\nHis comments were based on a study that found that one endocrine disruptor, in particular, can cause a small percentage of male frogs to become female, though experts say there is no evidence that such chemicals cause gender dysphoria in human children. Kennedy's remarks have been \"mischaracterized,\" a spokesperson said to CNN. He was \"merely suggesting that, given copious research on the effects on other vertebrates, this possibility deserves further research.\"\nLinked school shootings with antidepressants\nSpeaking to comedian Bill Maher on an episode of the podcast \"Club Random with Bill Maher,\" Kennedy linked an increase in school shootings to the increased prescription of antidepressants. \"Kids always had access to guns, and there was no time in American history or human history where kids were going to schools and shooting their classmates,\" Kennedy said, repeating a claim he previously made to Canadian broadcaster Mark Steyn. \"It really started happening conterminous with the introduction of these drugs, with Prozac and the other drugs.\" Scientists have found \"no biological plausibility\" of a link between the use of antidepressants and mass shootings, Ragy Girgis, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University, said to The New York Times. Were there a link, \"one would expect it to be pronounced, or at least much greater than we are seeing,\" Dr. James Knoll of SUNY Upstate Medical University said to Politifact in 2019.\nMistreated animal corpses\nThis past summer, Kennedy blamed \"the little bit of the redneck in me\" for his decision to dump a dead bear carcass in Central Park in 2014, admitting to the convoluted scheme in an interview with comedian Rosanne Barr he shared to his X account. \"Maybe that's where I got my brain worm,\" Kennedy later said to The New Yorker, referencing his 2012 admission in a court deposition obtained by The New York Times that he had once contracted a parasite which \"got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\"\nShortly after Kennedy fessed up to his ursine adventure, daughter Kick Kennedy said in an interview with Town & Country that when she was six, her father had heard a dead whale had washed ashore near Hyannis Port. The elder Kennedy \"ran down to the beach with a chainsaw, cut off the whale's head, and then bungee-corded it to the roof of the family minivan,\" Town & Country said. \"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,\" Kick added.\nEarlier that summer, Kennedy emphatically denied a Vanity Fair report that he'd eaten dog while on vacation in Korea in 2010. \"The article is a lot of garbage,\" Kennedy said on the \"Breaking Points\" podcast. \"The picture that they said is of me eating a dog, it's actually me eating a goat in Patagonia on a whitewater trip many years ago on the Futaleufu River.\"\n\nExplore More\n\n2024 presidential election\n\nDonald Trump\nVaccinations\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nBrigid Kennedy\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nBrigid Kennedy worked at The Week from 2021 to 2023 as a staff writer, junior editor and then story editor, with an interest in U.S. politics, the economy and the music industry. \n\nFilm reviews: Sinners and The King of Kings\n\nVampires lay siege to a Mississippi juke joint and an animated retelling of Jesus' life\n\nByThe Week US \n\nMusic reviews: Bon Iver, Valerie June, and The Waterboys\n\n\"Sable, Fable,\" \"Owls, Omens, and Oracles,\" \"Life, Death, and Dennis Hopper\"\n\nByThe Week US \n\nAre bonds worth investing in?\n\nthe explainer\nThey can diversify your portfolio and tend to be a safer investment than stocks\n\nByBecca Stanek, The Week US \n\nYou might also like\n\nIMF sees slump from tariffs, Trump tries to calm markets\n\nThe International Monetary Fund predicts the U.S. and global economies will slow significantly due to the president's trade war\n\nByPeter Weber, The Week US \n\nClimate: Trump's attempt to bring back coal\n\nTrump rolls back climate policies with executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry\n\nByThe Week US \n\nRFK Jr.: A public-health wrecking ball\n\nRobert F.

You shouldn't be playing now. You now have a real important job. And literally, he's coming in with a gauze thing on his lip.\" \n\nRoss appeared to be shocked at the story, saying: \"What?!\"The mother-of-two explained: \"I mean, his lip was – I saw it. He took the thing away and I was like, 'Oh, your lip!' And he had some major speech. \n\n\"This was probably Saturday. He needed like 30-something stitches. He had some major speech on Monday, and I was, like, 'This is what I'm saying. You know, you're playing like you're 10 and now your lip is split.'\"\n\nShe added: \"So we digress.\"Since the episode dropped, Michelle has been accused of \"embellishing\" Barack's busted lip story. \n\nWhile she claimed he needed \"30-something stitches,\" Barack reportedly needed 12 stitches in 2010 following a basketball injury. \n\nThen-White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement: \"After being inadvertently hit with an opposing player's elbow in the lip while playing basketball with friends and family, the president received 12 stitches today administered by the White House medical unit. \n\n\"They were done in the doctor's office located on the ground floor of the White House.\"Meanwhile, Michelle and Barack have been rocked by divorce rumors. \n\nMichelle sparked concern after the former president attended back-to-back events in Washington D.C. solo, including Donald Trump's inauguration and former President Jimmy Carter's funeral. \n\nThe Becoming author recently claimed on her podcast that the \"hard\" choice to not attend Trump's inauguration was sparked by therapy and deciding to do what was \"right\" for her life.","summary":"Michelle Obama described then-President Barack Obama getting hurt in an 'I told you so' moment.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/michelle-obama-barack-basketball-injury-stitches/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/oMcUwCuLw/0x0/barack-michelle-obama-marriage-1745279738768.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:30:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153}]}
