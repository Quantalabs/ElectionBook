Russia was building up troops on the southern frontline and Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, he said.\n\nRussia said on Thursday that Ukraine did not appear to be interested in \"long-term\" peace, accusing Kyiv of seeking security guarantees completely incompatible with Moscow's demands.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump is trying to end Russia's three-and-a-half-year invasion of Ukraine through talks with Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\nWhile he has upended a years-long Western policy of isolating the Russian leader, he has made little tangible progress towards a peace deal.\n\n\"We want to have an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days,\" Zelenskyy said, in comments to reporters released for publication on Thursday.\n\n\"We need to understand which country will be ready to do what at each specific moment,\" he added.\n\nA group of allies led by Britain and France are putting together a military coalition to support the guarantees.\n\nFRESH RUSSIAN BARRAGE\n\nOnce an outline of the security guarantees is agreed upon, Trump would like to see a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian leader said.\n\nBut any meeting with the Russian leader should he held in a \"neutral\" European country, he added, ruling out any summit in Moscow.\n\nHe also rejected the idea of China playing a role in guaranteeing Ukraine's security, citing Beijing's alleged support for Moscow.\n\nIn a daily address on Thursday, Zelenskyy accused Russia of avoiding the \"necessity\" of holding a meeting between the two countries' leaders.\n\n\"Current signals from Russia are, to be honest, indecent. They're trying to avoid the necessity to meet. They don't want to end this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHis comments came as Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles against Ukraine overnight - the biggest barrage since mid-July - killing one person in the western city of Lviv and wounding many others.\n\nRussian missiles also targeted an American-owned factory complex in town of Mukachevo in the west of Ukraine, wounding 19 people, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media.\n\nThe president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, Andy Hunder, said that the factory was \"one of the largest American investments in Ukraine\".\n\n\"Russia continues to destroy and humiliate US businesses in Ukraine, targeting companies that invest and trade on the US stock markets,\" Hunder said on Facebook.\n\nFrance on Thursday condemned the overnight strikes as showing Moscow's \"lack of will to seriously engage in peace talks\", describing them as the \"most massive attack in a month\".\n\nA later shelling of the city of Kherson killed one person and wounded more than a dozen, a local official said.\n\nMeanwhile in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine's Donetsk region, two people were killed and at least 21 wounded after a Ukrainian shelling, the Russian-installed regional chief, Denis Pushilin, said on Telegram.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-first-security-guarantees-then-putin-summit-zelenskyy-says-5308131","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--_cFc3zDC--/c_crop,h_573,w_1019,x_5,y_1/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/08/22/000_723p9t3.j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 01:03:17","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":353090120,"title":"Trump Praises National Guard During DC Crime Crackdown Visit, Hands Out Pizza | Watch","text":"Following his announcement on Thursday morning, US President Donald Trump stepped out in Washington, D.C., to join National Guard members and law enforcement officers in what he described as a crackdown on crime in the capital. As part of the visit, Trump stopped at a command center located at the US Park Police Anacostia Operations Facility.\nThough his earlier statement had suggested he would patrol the city alongside the guards, the president instead made a brief visit to meet and speak with the troops.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump departed the White House in the presidential limousine, accompanied by Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, en route to the Anacostia facility.\nUsing a handheld mic, the president praised the efforts of law enforcement personnel. “I feel very safe now, and I’m hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks … it’s going to be at a level that’s even far superior,” Trump said.\nDuring the visit, Trump handed out pizza and hamburgers to a group of police officers and National Guard troops deployed in the city in response to rising concerns over crime and homelessness. “You’re incredible people. You make the country run, frankly,” he told the group.\n\n.@POTUS to the National Guard and law enforcement in D.C.: “We have great hamburgers cooked by the White House and we have pizza… I’ll eat with you and we’re going to have a little fun… then we’re going to get back to work and we’re going to take care of these criminals.” pic.twitter.com/Ca0z4Xp99s\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) August 21, 2025\n\nIn his remarks, Trump also announced future plans for the capital, saying the city would be “maxxed out in terms of beauty” over the next six to 12 months, with plans to clean graffiti, repair grass in public parks, and restore road medians.\nThe visit came just one day after Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Stephen Miller visited National Guard members stationed at Union Station, another heavily patrolled location in D.C.\nEarlier Thursday, Trump had said in an interview that Memphis would be placed “early” on the list of additional cities where federal patrols might be introduced.\nIn D.C., troops have been stationed near key tourist areas, including the National Mall and Union Station, despite lower crime rates in those zones compared to other parts of the city. No end date for the troop deployment has been announced by the administration.","summary":"Trump also announced future plans for the capital, saying the city would be “maxxed out in terms of beauty”

coming down from 3.3% in June and marking its lowest since November 2024.\n\nThe so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which strips out prices of both fresh food and energy and is closely monitored by the BOJ, held steady at 3.4%.\n\nRice inflation eased to 90.7% in July, down from 100.2% in June, and after two months during which prices had more than doubled.\n\nRice prices have shown signs of easing after a rice shortage and skyrocketing rice prices dominated headlines in the country earlier this year, with data from Japan's agricultural ministry showing that the average bag of five-kilogram rice in supermarkets was being sold for 3,737 Japanese yen ($25.34) for the week of Aug. 4.\n\nAt its highest, rice was retailing at an average of 4,285 yen per five-kilogram bag, while premium rice brands reached 4,469 yen.\n\nJapan's central bank had upgraded its inflation forecasts in its economic outlook report released on July 31, saying that core inflation would come in at 2.7% for its 2025 fiscal year — ending March 2026 — up from its previous forecast of 2.2%.\n\n\"Core-core\" inflation expectations were raised to 2.8% from 2.3%.\n\nThe inflation figure comes after Japan's economy grew a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter from the previous three months, mainly supported by net exports.\n\nHowever, Japan's trade saw sluggish numbers in July, with exports falling at its sharpest pace in over four years as shipments to its two largest markets — the United States and China — declined.\n\nJapan reached a deal with Washington on July 22 that saw its

The sale was made by an international brokerage firm, owned by Boulos’ cousin, which overcharged the seemingly business savvy Kushner by millions of dollars and worked to conceal the true price.\n\nBoulos married Donald Trump’s fourth child in a lavish wedding at his Mar-a-Lago private club in November 2022, around the time he announced he would run again for his second term in the White House. But even before the wedding, Boulos, the son of a Lebanese-born business tycoon, began to use Trump family connections to make deals, the New York Times reported.\n\nSometime after he knelt down one one knee in the White House Rose Garden in January 2021 to propose to Tiffany Trump, he specifically identified Kushner, the husband of Tiffany’s big half-sister, as a potential client, the Times said.\n\nBoulos and his cousin, Jimmy Frangi, a yacht broker, pitched Kushner on the idea of buying an unfinished, 50-meter yacht, suggesting he could pay to refurbish and sell it or lease it out for other rich people to use, the New York Times reported. By June 2021, documents show that Boulos sent Kushner sales presentations about the boat, which was later named the Solstice.\n\nFrangi’s company told Kushner that the price to acquire the yacht was 12.5 million euros, or about $15 million at the time, the Times reported. That included a flat brokerage commission of 1 million euros for Boulos, Frangi and their colleagues.\n\n“Just so we understand the business deal,” Kushner said on a call, according to portions of a transcript viewed by the New York Times. “You are going to make 1 million on the closing.”\n\nBut the Times reported that Frangi’s firm stood to make much more than that, according to text messages he sent. That’s because the brokers were spending millions less to acquire the yacht than they told Kushner. “THIS MAKES US 3.5,” Frangi told an associate, according to the Times.\n\nThe firm also worked to conceal the true terms of the deal from Kushner, with an executive saying it would be “difficult to hide” and that it was important that Kushner not hire an independent appraiser.\n\nIt’s not clear if Boulos knew about this effort to conceal the details of the yacht sale from his future wife’s brother-in-law because he was not copied in on these messages, the Times reported. But Boulos expressed displeasure when the firm learned that Kushner’s lawyer was trying to hit pause on the deal. He even invoked his future wife’s name in telling his colleagues: “Me and Tiffany are pissed off.”\n\nThe sale eventually closed in early 2022, with Frangi saying he made about $400,000 from the commission and Boulos earning $300,000, the Times reported. But Kushner eventually realized he had been overcharged by about $2.5 million, according to another broker, who recounted the deal during a financial dispute with Frangi.\n\nAt one point, Kushner confronted Frangi, but it’s not known if he ever had any words with Boulos, the Times reported. It’s also not known if the super yacht issue caused any ongoing friction between the two future in-laws or their wives. A spokesperson for Kushner declined to comment on the deal to the Times, saying only that Boulos was doing a “great job” working to find a new buyer for the yacht, which still hasn’t been finished. A representative for Tiffany Trump and Boulos also told the Times: “Mr. Boulos is proud of and honored by his close, familial relationship with Mr. Kushner.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tiffany and Ivanka Trump were all about sisterly solidarity on Nov. 12, 2022, when Tiffany Trump married Boulos.\n\nOn social media, Ivanka Trump gushed about her “baby sister” the day after the wedding, according to Us Weekly. Tiffany is the only daughter of Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples.\n\n“When I was 12 years old my dream of having a baby sister came true!” Ivanka Trump wrote the day after the wedding. “From the first moment I held @tiffanytrump in my arms and looked into those big, kind, curious eyes I was smitten.”\n\nIvanka Trump has long been known as their father’s favorite child and was his White House senior adviser during his first term, as was Kushner. On her Instagram post, Ivanka Trump added: “I wish Tiffany and Michael an abundance of happiness and joy as they begin their lives together as husband and wife! May their love be a source of light in this world!”\n\nIn reply, Tiffany Trump wrote: “I love you.”","summary":"What was Michael Boulos really thinking when he proposed to Tiffany Trump in the White House Rose Garden in January 2021?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/21/tiffany-trumps-husband-lured-jared-kushner-into-iffy-yacht-deal-report/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MichaelTIffany_e40ee1.jpeg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 00:06:40","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":353090460,"title":"Newsom Sends Redistricting Proposal To California Voters To Counter GOP’s Texas Redistricting","text":"California Gov.

While the department maintains that those students have either “broken the law or expressed support for terrorism”, many documented cases have involved students who took part in pro-Palestinian protests or even simply wrote an opinion piece – all of which are protected free speech.

Businesses not increasing their commitments may need to offer equity to the government in exchange for subsidies. \n\n\"The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,\" the official told WSJ. \n\nTSMC executives have already had discussions about giving back their subsidies if the administration asks to become a shareholder, according to the report.\n\nThe White House and TSMC did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nTSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple as key clients, announced plans for a $100 billion investment in the United States during an event with President Donald Trump at the White House in March. This investment is in addition to $65 billion committed for three manufacturing facilities in the state of Arizona.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees the $52.7 billion CHIPS Act, formally known as the CHIPS and Science Act, late last year finalized subsidies of $6.6 billion for TSMC to produce semiconductors in the United States.\n\nBesides Intel, Micron, TSMC and Samsung were among the biggest recipients of CHIPS Act funding.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. government has taken stakes in companies during periods of economic uncertainty to provide financial support and restore confidence.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/trump-administration-not-eyeing-equity-companies-are-increasing-us-investment-wsj-reports-5308086","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--0apzmcQ---/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-08-21t235825z_1_lynxmpel7k10k_rtroptp_3_usa-intel-trump.jpg?itok=BN","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:58:25","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":353084120,"title":"The House Is on Fire and Democrats Are Debating Paint Colors | Opinion","text":"In less than seven months, we have watched America slip into fascism with zero meaningful resistance. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become a weapon aimed at anyone who dares dissent. Elected officials who speak out are targeted. Law firms are shaken down into submission. TV networks have been brought to their knees through threats. In Florida, they built what can only be called a concentration camp.Washington D.C., a city where nearly half the population is Black, has been stripped of its autonomy and placed under federal control. This isn't dystopian fiction. This is happening right now, while Democratic leadership stands paralyzed. Fascism isn't coming to America; it is already here, meeting no resistance from those sworn to uphold the Constitution.Over the past several weeks, I have had dozens of conversations with sitting members of Congress, donors, organizers, and voters desperate to get involved. The overwhelming sentiment isn't frustration anymore. It's anger. Pure, unbridled anger at Democratic leadership's paralysis.I understand Democrats don't control the House or Senate, but they are not powerless. They can use the bully pulpit to force issues into public consciousness and use every tool to delay harmful legislation. They can coordinate with state attorneys general winning court battles. They can mobilize their base and dominate the narrative. Instead, Hakeem Jeffries admitted at a February press briefing, \"I'm trying to figure out what leverage we actually have.\"The House minority leader is publicly admitting he doesn't know how to fight back. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has weaponized federal agencies, frozen billions in federal grants, and launched attacks on academic freedom. He's using the federal government to crush dissent, while Democrats issue strongly worded letters.We know from 2024 that some Democrats know how to undermine a sitting president. We watched them coordinate a campaign that forced President Joe Biden to step aside. George Clooney wrote an opinion piece asking Biden to end his campaign. Donors threatened to withhold funds. Where is that energy now? Where is Clooney's passionate op-ed about fascism taking root? Where are the donors threatening to withhold funds unless Democrats fight?All the planning and coordination aimed at undermining President Joe Biden has evaporated when facing an actual authoritarian. While Schumer and Jeffries still believe decorum will win the day, the Trump administration has taken a jackhammer to our Constitution. These men, and Democrats overall, have been unable to meet the moment, and millions of Americans looking for leadership feel abandoned.Back in March, CNN polling found that 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said the party's caucus in Congress was doing too little to oppose Trump. That's not only a poll result; that's a scream for help from a base watching their representatives sleepwalk through a self-coup. This is a base screaming for someone to stand up and fight back. Waiting, hoping judges will keep Trump in check, or that the 2026 midterms will save us, is dangerously naive. Courts are being stacked. Election systems are being dismantled. By 2026, the damage may be irreversible.Since Democrats only have a concept of a plan, let me offer advice.First, if the Democratic leadership in Congress isn't equipped or unwilling to lead, they need to get out of the way. Memes and social media posts aren't enough to fight a convicted criminal wielding presidential power like a weapon.Second, Ken Martin needs to resign as DNC chair. We don't need someone who thinks the answer to authoritarianism is better fundraising emails. We don't need another X post. We don't need another strongly worded statement. We need leaders who understand that when fascism comes knocking, you don't politely ask it to leave. You bar the door. You sound the alarm. You fight with everything you have. We need someone who has faced voter suppression and won. We need Stacey Abrams.Abrams doesn't just understand voting rights; she knows how to mobilize communities Democrats have taken for granted. She knows how to fight back when the rules are rigged against you. We need someone who has been in the trenches, felt the boot of oppression, and fought back anyway.The world is watching America fail. Our allies are making contingency plans for a post-democratic United States. Authoritarian regimes are taking notes on how quickly democracy can crumble when its defenders refuse to fight. Every day Democrats delay, every moment they prioritize civility over survival, Trump's fascist infrastructure becomes more entrenched.If Democratic leadership cannot find the courage to meet this moment, if they cannot transform their fear into fury, then they are failing millions of Americans who still believe democracy is worth saving. They are failing history itself.The house is on fire, and Democratic leadership is debating what color to paint the kitchen. Either grab a hose or get out of the way because if we lose this fight, there won't be a democracy left to save.Christopher Bouzy is an American tech entrepreneur who founded the non-partisan research firm Bot Sentinel and the social media network Spoutible. His ventures leverage innovative technologies to create safer digital spaces and promote authentic online discourse.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"The house is on fire, and Democratic leadership is debating what color to paint the kitchen.

Metropolitan Police Department, at the United States Park Police Headquarters in Anacostia, according to the White House press pool.\n\nTrump commended the officers for doing “an amazing job” since he took federal control of the city due to out-of-control crime.\n\n“We appreciate it, and the numbers are down like we wouldn’t believe, but we believe it,” he said.\n\n“We’ve had some incredible results… And it’s like a different place. It’s like a different city. It’s the capital. It’s going to be the best in the world,” Trump went on to add.\n\nAs Vice President JD Vance noted Wednesday, there has been a 35 percent drop in violent crime and a 50 percent drop in robberies in the first nine days since Trump took federal control of law enforcement.\n\nTrump emphasized that his efforts to restore D.C. to greatness will not end with a crime crackdown, as he will seek money from Congress to spruce up the city.\n\n“We’re going to do what you’re doing with law enforcement, and very importantly, also, we’re going to physically do it. We’re going back to Congress for some money, and we’re going to redo a lot of the pavement, a lot of the medians, a lot of the graffiti’s all coming off real fast,” he said.\n\n“We’re going to be not so much building; it’s cleaning, and fixing, and redoing, and putting brand new surfaces down on your roads and streets,” he added.\n\nTrump brought White House burgers and pizza from an undisclosed business for the members of law enforcement in attendance.\n\n“We’ll eat, and I’ll eat with you. We’re going to have a little fun. We’re going to celebrate, but then we’re going to get back to work and we’re going to take care of these criminals,” he said. “We’re going to put them where they have to be.”\n\nBurgum lauded Trump “for bringing respect back” to law enforcement professionals. Bondi commended the law enforcement officers for “working midnights every night because they love our country, they love our city, ” and the president.\n\nTrump returned to the White House after the meeting, per the press pool.","summary":"President Donald Trump brought pizza and hamburgers for members of law enforcement and the National Guard on Thursday and thanked them for their efforts in cracking down on crime in Washington, DC.\n\n\nThe post Trump Treats Police, National Guard to Dinner While Thanking Them for D.C.

Kennedy Jr., from regularly criticizing the concept.\n\nHe often highlights the pyramid, misrepresenting dietary standards and criticizing health initiatives of the Biden administration. Such claims were featured in a video aired Tuesday, before his appearance on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters Primetime.”\n\nHere’s a closer look at the facts.\n\nKENNEDY: “The dietary guidelines that we inherited from the Biden administration were 453 pages long. They were driven by the same commercial impulses that put Froot Loops at the top of the food pyramid.”\n\nTHE FACTS: The original food pyramid did not mention any specific products. But at the very top, it recommended that oils, fats and sugar be consumed “sparingly.” Grains such as bread, cereal, rice and pasta were on the bottom tier, where six to 11 portions a day were recommended. The current dietary guidelines are 164 pages long, not 453. They were released in December 2020 during Trump’s first term, along with a four-page executive summary.\n\nA scientific report used to develop the dietary guidelines is published every five years by an advisory committee. The latest report, released in December by the Biden administration, is 421 pages long. Trump’s first administration released an 835-page scientific report in July 2020 that informed the current guidelines.\n\n“The dietary guidelines include several documents, including a scientific report which summarizes the scientific evidence supporting the dietary guidelines,” said Laura Bellows, an associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University. “It can be long due to the comprehensive nature of the document. That said, these findings are distilled down into concise guidelines that are foundational to the creation of consumer information and educational materials.”\n\nExperts said that Froot Loops, a breakfast cereal, would have fallen into multiple categories under the pyramid concept, offering vague guidance to consumers.\n\n“It’s a bit trickier than just one grouping,” Bellows said in an email. She said Froot Loops “would fall more in foods that we should ‘moderate’ … but does contribute to the grain group.” The cereal is high in sugar, she added, but does have fiber and other key nutrients.\n\nThe Agriculture Department introduced an updated pyramid guide in 2005 that incorporated new nutritional standards. It retired the pyramid idea altogether in 2011 and now uses the MyPlate concept, which stresses eating a healthy balance of different foods based on factors such as age and sex.\n\nMyPlate recommends making half of the grains one eats in a day whole grains and cutting back on added sugars. Similar to the food pyramid, this puts Froot Loops, which has whole grains and added sugars, in both categories.\n\n“MyPlate, not the Food Pyramid, has been the visual graphic for the US Dietary Guidelines since 2011,” said Bellows. “So, referring to the ‘top of the pyramid’ is a dated reference.”\n\nKennedy’s other criticism of Froot Loops has focused primarily on its manufacturer’s use of artificial dyes to enhance its color. He has made getting rid of artificial colors in foods an important part of his “Make America Healthy Again” plan.\n\nAsked for comment on Kennedy’s remarks, the Health and Human Services Department said work is on track to release the final 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\nThe agency said Kennedy is committed to ensuring those guidelines “are grounded in gold-standard science and reflect a clear focus on healthy, whole, and nutritious foods.”\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.","summary":"The original food pyramid recommended limiting foods high in sugar, while encouraging consumption of grains.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/08/21/fact-check-rfk-claims-dietary-guidelines/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_04644_69d640-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:51:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.303},{"id":353083344,"title":"GOP rep highlights 'eerily similar' crime trends between DC and California cities","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit August 21, 2025 03:45 \n\n GOP rep highlights 'eerily similar' crime trends between DC and California cities \n Rep.

All this makes Trump look rather weak.\n\nIt's two fingers to the president, though interestingly, the Russian language has been carefully calibrated not to poke Trump but to mock European leaders instead. That's telling.\n\nRead more on Ukraine:Trump risks 'very big mistake'NATO-like promise for Ukraine may be too good to be trueEurope tried to starve Putin's war machine - it didn't go as planned\n\nThe bilateral meeting hailed by Trump on Monday as agreed and close - \"within two weeks\" - looks decidedly doubtful.\n\nMaybe that's why he went along with Putin's suggestion that there be a bilateral, not including Trump, first.\n\nIt's easier for the American president to blame someone else if it's not his meeting, and it doesn't happen.\n\nNATO defence chiefs met on Wednesday to discuss the details of how the security guarantees - the ones Russia won't accept - will work.\n\nEuropean sources at the meeting have told me it was all a great success. And to the comments by Lavrov, a source said: \"It's not up to Lavrov to decide on security guarantees. Not up to the one doing the threatening to decide how to deter that threat!\"\n\nThe argument goes that it's not realistic for Russia to say from which countries Ukraine can and cannot host troops.\n\nWould Trump threaten force?\n\nThe problem is that if Europe and the White House want Russia to sign up to some sort of peace deal, then it would require agreement from all sides on the security arrangements.\n\nThe other way to get Russia to heel would be with an overwhelming threat of force. Something from Trump, like: \"Vladimir - look what I did to Iran...\". But, of course, Iran isn't a nuclear power.\n\nSomething else bothers me about all this. The core concept of a \"security guarantee\" is an ironclad obligation to defend Ukraine into the future.\n\nFuture guarantees would require treaties, not just a loose promise. I don't see Trump's America truly signing up to anything that obliges them to do anything.\n\nA layered security guarantee which builds over time is an option, but from a Kremlin perspective, would probably only end up being a repeat of history and allow them another \"justification\" to push back.\n\nRead more from Sky News:Inside the ISIS resurgence10 years since one of UK's worst air disastersHow Republicans are redrawing maps to stay in power\n\nImage and reality don't seem to match\n\nAmong Trump's stream of social media posts this week was an image of him waving his finger at Putin in Alaska. It was one of the few non-effusive images from the summit.\n\nHe posted it next to an image of former president Richard Nixon confronting Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev - an image that came to reflect American dominance over the Soviet Union.\n\nThat may be the image Trump wants to portray.

Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (or CMS) Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz have doubled down, expanding their partnership with ICE to include nationwide Medicaid data.\n\nTo help their effort, Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Tex.) demanded that Gov. Kathy Hochul cough up the data on Medicaid-receiving illegal immigrants in the Empire State, citing her legal obligations to regularly report enrollment and eligibility data to the federal government.\n\nThe Democrats’ lawsuits continue their track record of fighting beyond the limits of their power to protect illegal aliens — in this case by keeping their Medicaid data “safe” — while endangering law-abiding Americans.\n\nTheir claims that no illegal aliens take advantage of Medicaid benefits also fly in the face of Medicaid’s own records. \n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, taxpayers spent at least $16 billion on emergency services for illegal immigrants, CMS has reported, with federal taxpayers covering more than 70% of those costs.\n\nWhen you add in the billions likely spent on non-emergency services in direct circumvention of federal law, the total figure of Medicaid resources going to illegal aliens is incalculable — an enormous transfer of wealth from Americans to non-citizens who shouldn’t be here at all.\n\nWelfare benefits like Medicaid have been some of the strongest magnets spurring mass migration into this country and encouraging people to illegally stay.\n\nHalting those perks, as Trump and Republicans in Congress are rightly doing, will do much to turn the magnet off.\n\nStealing from Medicaid is especially grievous because the program is intended to help America’s most vulnerable, including low-income children and people with disabilities.\n\nWhen illegal aliens or other ineligible people take Medicaid, they not only suck up taxpayer resources, they reroute precious resources from legitimate Medicaid recipients who already have to compete for a limited pool of providers.\n\nIt’s downright despicable — yet Democrats in Congress and in at least 20 blue states seem more than happy to run interference to ensure that it continues.\n\nSome Democrats are begging for their party to moderate after November’s resounding defeat. \n\nSome — like New York City primary voters — are sprinting further to the left.\n\nIf they want to appeal to the majority of voters in the coming midterms, though, they need to get their Medicaid stories straight.\n\nMore important, they need to get their priorities straight.\n\nInstead of robbing from taxpayers to give to law-breakers, Democrats should protect Medicaid for the Americans who truly need it.\n\nThey could do that by following the lead of Republicans like Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana, who just signed a law referring illegal aliens fraudulently receiving welfare to ICE so they can be deported.\n\nIf Democrats can’t make up their minds about illegal aliens and welfare, the American people will make up their minds about the Democrats — and keep rejecting them at the ballot box.\n\nHayden Dublois is the Data and Analytics Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.","summary":"By suing to stop President Trump from sharing Medicaid data with ICE, Dems practically confessed: Illegal aliens ARE getting Medicaid benefits, and blue states want to keep it that way.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/21/opinion/trump-caught-democrats-in-a-trap-torn-by-medicaid-lies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/DJT454647.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:32:36","author":"Hayden Dublois","authors":["Hayden Dublois"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.413},{"id":353079414,"title":"Judge Removes Alina Habba Due to Conflict with US Attorney","text":"In a surprising twist, President Donald Trump’s dedicated lawyer, Alina Habba, has been prohibited from prosecuting two different groups of criminal defendants. These defendants challenged her authority as the alleged Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\nThe associated case, which dates back to 2021, involves Julien Giraud Jr. and Julien Giraud III, who are facing several charges regarding a supposed marijuana distribution scheme. At the end of July, the Girauds sought to have the charges dropped, arguing that Habba was not officially appointed.\n\nThe ensuing legal kerfuffle called for outside help.\n\nAfter some initial evaluations by local magistrate and district judges, Chief U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann from the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who was appointed by Barack Obama, was assigned to lead the case.\n\nIn one of his first major decisions, Judge Brann stated that the defendants “are not entitled to dismissal” because the requested relief “is not available.” He criticized the defense’s claim that Habba’s appointment status “somehow retroactively taints the indictment, or any aspect of the prosecution that preceded it.”\n\nBut that was then.\n\nFollowing requests for additional motions regarding Habba’s alleged appointment as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, the court concluded that she is not authorized to prosecute the Girauds.\n\nIn his 77-page memorandum opinion, Brann took the federal government to task for the ways in which he said officials have tried to game the constitutional system establishing the U.S. Senate’s advice and consent role for the people called to lead the U.S. Attorneys office.\n\n“The Executive branch has perpetuated Alina Habba’s appointment to act as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey through a novel series of legal and personnel moves,” the opinion begins. “Along the way, it has disagreed with the Judges of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and criminal defendants in that District about who should or may lead the office. Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not.”\n\nIn essence, Habba is not an appointed U.S. Attorney because senators telegraphed their intention to shoot down her nomination. So, the DOJ played a game of musical chairs aimed at keeping the 45th and 47th president’s former personal attorney secure in the post.\n\nIn short, to keep Habba atop her perch, Trump pulled her nomination to the permanent role and Habba herself resigned before the 120-day statutory period for the acting role expired. Then, Habba’s first assistant was fired and Habba was reinstated in that inferior position under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act – whether or not that onetime first assistant was appointed to serve as U.S. Attorney.\n\nThe switcheroo with the fired first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, was important because, after Habba’s interim position timed out, Grace was appointed to serve as U.S. Attorney by a judicial order of New Jersey’s federal bench. To hear the DOJ tell it, however, Grace was fired before that order took effect. In the ensuing vacancy and chaos, Habba was the last woman standing – and remains in charge.\n\nBut that’s not how it works, Brann said.\n\nUnder the law governing the appointment of interim U.S. Attorneys, the 120-day period is spelled out – and so is what happens next. If that time period expires, the district court itself steps in.\n\n“Accepting the Government’s reading would give the Executive a permanent means of thwarting that provision by terminating every section 546(a) appointment on its 119th day,” Brann writes. “Taken to the extreme, the President could use this method to staff the United States Attorney’s office with individuals of his personal choice for an entire term without seeking the Senate’s advice and consent.”\n\nIn real terms, the judge’s order dispenses with the practice of presidents repeatedly using interim appointments to circumvent Senate difficulties. The court acknowledges “successive section 546 appointments” have been a “historical practice” of attorneys general but opines that “past practice does not, by itself, create power.”\n\n“Based on the text, context, and statutory history of section 546, the Attorney General is vested with 120 total days to appoint an Interim United States Attorney from the date that she first invokes section 546(a),” the court observes. “Termination of an appointment before the 120-day deadline does not allow another 120-day term.”\n\nThe upshot is that Habba’s assumption of the Giraud case is invalid. The court’s ruling also rendered “defective” an indictment she signed off on in a consolidated case involving Cesar Humberto Pina.\n\n“I disqualify Ms. Habba from engaging in the prosecutions of the Girauds and Mr. Pina, and from supervising the same,” Brann concludes. “Any Assistant United States Attorney who prosecutes the Girauds or Mr. Pina under the supervision or authority of Ms. Habba in violation of my Order is similarly subject to disqualification.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlina Habba, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump, is seen discussing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Removes Alina Habba Due to Conflict with US Attorney first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-removes-alina-habba-due-to-conflict-with-us-attorney/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lawyer-questions-Alina-Habbas-legitimacy-as-US-attorney.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:31:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":353081110,"title":"Trump Gives Two Weeks to Assess Russia-Ukraine Peace Prospects","text":"Donald Trump on Thursday set a two-week time frame for assessing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, as the US president ramps up his efforts to negotiate an end to the war. \n\n“I would say within two weeks we’re going to know one way or the other,” he said in a telephone interview when asked about the chances of a peace agreement.\n\n“After that, we’ll have to maybe take a different tack,” Trump told Todd Starnes, a host for right-wing media outlet Newsmax, without giving further details. \n\nThe Republican, who had promised during last year’s presidential election to end the war in one day, has so far failed to achieve any major breakthroughs – more than three years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe met Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday at a highly anticipated summit in Alaska that failed to reach an accord and saw Trump drop his push for an initial ceasefire. \n\nOn Monday, the US president held talks at the White House with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and a handful of European allies. \n\nThose meetings raised hopes that Putin and Zelensky could meet directly for a peace summit, as both leaders initially appeared open to that option. \n\nBut Zelensky on Thursday accused Russia of “trying to avoid the necessity to meet” and said that it did not want to end the war. \n\nRussia, meanwhile, said that Ukraine did not seem to be interested in “long-term” peace, accusing Kyiv of seeking security guarantees completely incompatible with Moscow’s demands.\n\nTrump has a track record of issuing two-week deadlines to deliberate on Ukraine and other issues. \n\nIn late May, he said he would assess within that period whether Putin was serious about achieving a peace deal, promising to respond “differently” if not.","summary":"Meanwhile, Zelensky on Thursday accused Russia of “trying to avoid the necessity to meet” and said that it did not want to end the war.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/58726","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/08/17/4412cedc33f6ef5356a39f1b7ce535fa.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:30:40","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":353080388,"title":"Newsom signs redistricting bills, takes fight over congressional map to voters","text":"“We’re responding to what occurred in Texas,” Newsom said. “We’re neutralizing what occurred, and we’re giving the American people a fair chance because when all things are equal, we’re all playing by the same rules.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers tried several parliamentary maneuvers to delay the vote, but were unsuccessful. They have called for a federal investigation and promised to keep fighting.\n\n“I am proud of this chamber, proud of my colleagues, for meeting this moment with courage,” Democratic Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said. “President [Donald] Trump wants us to be intimidated, and his playbook is a simple one. Bully, threaten, silence, then rig the rules to hang on to power.” \n\nDemocratic Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel likened Trump’s push to get more seats to that of a 5-year-old losing a game and demanding the rules change. \n\n“That is transparently what is happening with this president,” Gabriel said. “[Trump] understands that his policies are not popular, he understands that people do not want him to be able to continue to be unchecked in Washington, and so rather than change his policies or play by the rules, he’s trying to change the rules.” \n\nGabriel said his Republican colleagues have suggested Democrats turn a blind eye, but added that “there are deep moral implications to that unilateral surrender.”\n\nDemocratic Assemblywoman Rhodesia Ransom argued that lawmakers in California are not “forcing” a new map on voters but said, “We can’t be bystanders when bullies come to push us around.”\n\n“We’re not forcing anything down anyone’s throat,” she said. “We’re giving Californians a choice. Do you want to bow down or do you want to fight back?”\n\nRepublican Assemblywoman Laurie Davies said she believed the money that would go toward a special election would be better spent on fixing the state’s current insurance crisis or giving first responders pay raises. \n\nGOP Assemblyman David Tangipa said the Democratic push to redraw the map was “neither bold nor principled.”\n\n“It is, in plain terms, a blatant attack on the most transparent process our state has ever had for drawing congressional districts,” he said. “It undermines what has become the gold standard for the nation, the independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.”\n\nUnlike Texas, where state lawmakers have control over drawing the state’s congressional map, California’s process is more complicated. Its constitution requires that an independent redistricting commission draw the map and that voters approve any changes. That means even though the state legislature passed the proposed map, it will now be up to the voters in California to decide during a Nov. 4 special election whether the map will be used for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections.\n\nIf voters greenlight them, it would turn three Republican-held seats into safe Democratic seats and turn two others into seats that lean Democratic. \n\nThe map would change districts held by Reps. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) and Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) in Northern California. In the southern part of the state, Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ken Calvert (R-CA) are at risk, and in the Central Valley, Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) would have a much harder time getting reelected.\n\nThe coast-to-coast redistricting fight erupted after Trump publicly called on Texas to redraw its map to give Republicans a five-seat boost heading into the 2026 midterm elections. California called its push for a new map a countermeasure to “neutralize” the pressure Trump put not only on Texas Republicans but also on lawmakers in other red states, including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, to follow suit. On Thursday morning, Trump announced on social media that Republicans in Missouri had also agreed to redraw their map, writing, “We’re going to win the Midterms in Missouri again, bigger and better than ever before!” \n\nDemocrats in Illinois and Maryland have pledged to fight back. However, it’s harder in the blue states because most have commission systems like California or other imposed redistricting rules, giving Republicans the edge in easily changing their map. \n\nNew York, for example, has floated the idea of changing its map, but can’t legally redraw it until 2028, two years after the midterm elections, and even then, only with voter approval. \n\nIn Texas, the governor’s signature is all that’s needed after the map passes the state legislature. \n\nAt stake is control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have a seven-seat edge in the House, with four vacancies.\n\nTrump has been able to enact his agenda, including passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, because the GOP controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. If Democrats flip the House, they could render Trump a lame duck during his last two years in office by blocking his legislation and launching congressional investigations.\n\nDemocrats have said stopping Trump is their No. 1 priority, and the party has turned to Newsom, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Texas Rep. Nicole Collier (D-TX) to lead the cause. \n\nWHO WINS AND LOSES IF EVERY STATE GETS ITS WAY ON REDISTRICTING?\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said Thursday evening that the DNC “stands with Gov. Newsom and the California legislature in putting the power in the hands of the people of California.” \n\n“Every Californian should vote for Democrats’ measure to level the playing field,” he added. “This isn’t just about California. The basic premise of Americans — instead of Donald Trump — choosing their elected officials is at stake.”","summary":"Gov.

A third, Cesar Humberto Pina, was accused of laundering drug proceeds and participating in a “multi-million-dollar Ponzi-like investment fraud scheme”.\n\nLawyers for Pina released a statement praising the judge’s decision later on Thursday and calling for the Trump administration to follow federal procedure for appointing US attorneys.\n\n“Prosecutors wield enormous power, and with that comes the responsibility to ensure they are qualified and properly appointed,” lawyers Abbe David Lowell and Gerald Krovatin wrote in the statement.\n\n“We appreciate the thoroughness of the court’s opinion, and its decision underscores that this Administration cannot circumvent the congressionally mandated process for confirming US Attorney appointments.”\n\nTrump clashes with judicial branch\n\nThursday’s court decision is likely to continue the power clash between President Trump and the judiciary, whom he has accused of being politically biased against him and his allies.\n\nWhile Habba awaits a confirmation hearing before the US Senate, she has served in the US attorney position on an interim basis.\n\nBut such interim appointments are capped at a period of 120 days. Continuing beyond that time span requires approval from a panel of judges in the district.\n\nThe panel, however, declined Habba’s bid to stay in the role on July 22. It named her second-in-command, career prosecutor Desiree Grace, to replace her as US attorney.\n\nBut the Trump administration swiftly moved to reject the judges’ decision. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace and said Habba would continue in her role regardless of the July 22 court order.\n\n“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges,” Bondi wrote on social media.\n\nThe Justice Department, under Trump, has sought to retain term-capped interim US attorneys elsewhere as well.\n\nBut Habba’s handling of her position has drawn particular scrutiny, as has her close relationship with the president.\n\nHabba was an early appointment to Trump’s second term. In December, just weeks after winning the 2024 presidential election, Trump revealed he would bring her into the White House as a counsellor for his administration.\n\nThen, on March 24, he announced she would be his pick for US attorney for the New Jersey district.\n\nPreviously, Habba has represented Trump as a personal lawyer in several civil cases.\n\nWhile she won one defamation suit brought against Trump by former reality TV contestant Summer Zervos, she lost two high-profile cases: a defamation suit brought by writer E Jean Carroll and a civil fraud case led by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump is currently appealing both of those decisions.\n\nQuestions surrounding Habba’s leadership\n\nSince taking on the role of interim US attorney, Habba told a podcaster that she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red” – an indication she may use her traditionally nonpartisan position for partisan aims.\n\nShe has also led probes and prosecutions that critics denounced as politically motivated. In one instance, she opened an investigation into New Jersey’s Democratic Governor Phil Murphy over his immigration policies.\n\nIn another, she charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing after he attempted to join several Congress members on a tour of the Delaney Hall immigration detention facility.\n\nThose charges were later dropped, and a member of Habba’s office was rebuked in court. “An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool,” Judge Andre Espinosa told the prosecutor.\n\nBaraka has since filed a civil complaint accusing Habba of “subjecting him to false arrest and malicious prosecution”.\n\nStill, Habba has continued to pursue criminal charges against US Representative LaMonica McIver for assault during the same incident at Delaney Hall. McIver has called the charge a “blatant political attack”.","summary":"The Trump administration has ignored a July decision from a panel of judges replacing Habba as interim US attorney.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/judge-rules-trump-lawyer-alina-habba-is-unlawfully-serving-as-us-attorney?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-05-24T153213Z_1242448577_RC2EOEAOGK10_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-WEST-POINT-1755808627.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:28:38","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":353081114,"title":"Zac Goldsmith cuts £1million from price of his sprawling manor ahead of his third wedding: RICHARD EDEN'S DIARY","text":"He invariably seems able to manifest whatever he desires, whether it’s a parliamentary seat, a peerage or a prospective bride – not to mention a brood of children, of which he has six so far.\n\nBut Zac Goldsmith – more formally Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park, as he’s been since 2020 – has just been reminded that, in the words of family friend Mick Jagger, you can’t always get what you want.\n\nThat might sound improbable, given that Goldsmith, 50, has the delightful Hermione ‘Hum’ Fleming – 35-year-old great-niece of 007 author Ian Fleming – lined up to become his third wife when they marry next month in the Cotswolds. But there is, I can disclose, a £6.95million niggle in their residential arrangements.\n\nThat’s the new asking price forthe fabulous, 11-bedroom Arts and Crafts manor house in Hampshire that Zac shared with his second wife, Alice Rothschild. The price represents a £1million discount on the £7.95million tag it had when first put on the market last year – despite the fact that, in the words of estate agents Knight Frank, Zac and Alice took ‘great care to keep the house true to its heritage’.\n\nBut even with the discount – and such essentials as a tennis court, swimming pool, staff kitchen, library, lake and 65 acres of land – there’s no guarantee that there’ll be a buyer in Keir Starmer’s Britain.\n\nAfter all, more millionaires are expected to flee this year than any country has experienced in the past decade.

'If due to fat deposits, targeted liposuction and body contouring are the solution.'\n\nAblation destroys or removes abnormal tissue, sclerotherapy destroys varicose veins, while compression simply involves putting pressure on an affected area. \n\nHe added that patients often benefit from a 'staged or combined' treatment plan, dependent on whether the 'primary problem is fluid or fat'.\n\nBut Dr Shokrian warned that liposuction - a notoriously painful procedure - can take weeks to recover from, ruling it out for the President of the United States. \n\nThe White House confirmed Trump's chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis last month, saying it is a 'common condition' in individuals over the age of 70 and that the president showed 'no evidence' of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. \n\nPresident Trump's former personal physician Dr. Ronny Jackson forcefully refuted speculation about Trump's health Thursday - but did not address the cankle issue.\n\n'As President Trump's former personal physician, former Physician to the President, and White House physician for 14 years across three administrations, I can tell you unequivocally: President Donald J. Trump is the healthiest president this nation has ever seen' Jackson said.\n\n'I continue to consult with his current physician and medical team at the White House and still spend significant time with the President. He is mentally and physically sharper than ever before.'\n\nTrump blasted O'Donnell from his Truth Social account - but avoided drawing further attention to the unflattering cankle claims that had started the ball rolling.\n\nHe blasted MSNBC on his Truth Social platform, branding them 'fake news' and alleging the content they create is 'garbage'. \n\nBut the president publicly denouncing MSNBC's credibility has not stopped critics and fans alike from expressing concern over his health.\n\nTrump's swollen ankles were also on full display as he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit in Alaska last Friday, causing an uproar online.\n\nSome social media users alleged that Trump appeared to 'struggle walking a straight line down red carpet laid out for Putin's arrival'.\n\nOthers highlighted how while Putin sported a 'sardonic smile', Trump merely showcased his 'swollen ankles'.\n\nMany Trump supporters insist Trump's cankles are just an unfortunate side-effect of his ferocious work ethic. \n\nTrump won his second term in office in large part to the evidence cognitive decline of his Democrat predecessor Joe Biden, 82.\n\nUnlike Biden, Trump is still in sharp command of his mental facilities and has not repeatedly tripped while walking up the stairs of Air Force One. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last month that Trump was checked out by his doctor after noticeable 'swelling' and revealed he had been diagnosed with 'chronic venous insufficiency'.\n\nA letter released by White House Physician Sean Barbarella, DO, references 'mild swelling' in Trump's lower legs, and states the diagnosis emerged after a series of vascular studies. \n\nLeavitt said during her rare medical update that the president underwent a 'comprehensive examination' which included 'diagnostic vascular studies.'\n\n'Bilateral, lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency,' Leavitt stated. \n\nShe also addressed the 'minor bruising' on the back of Trump's hand. \n\n'This is consistent with minor soft-tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. This is a well-known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.'\n\n'The president remains in excellent health,' Leavitt continued and reiterated that there was 'no discomfort from the president at all.'\n\nShe then pointed to his daily activities, highlighting how 'on a day-to-day basis, he's working around the clock'.","summary":"Trump is taking extreme steps to try and hide his unsightly issue, critics have claimed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15022277/donald-trump-accused-hide-cankles-burning-out.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/21/22/101441425-0-image-a-17_1755811299737.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:22:39","author":"Editor,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":353083082,"title":"Newsom signs California redistricting plan","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed into law a contentious congressional redistricting plan, as state Democrats seek to counter a Trump-backed effort to add to the GOP's House majority by redrawing Texas' congressional maps. The new map — which still needs to be approved by voters — would shift five of California's Republican U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. The legislation easily passed the Democratic-led Assembly and Senate on Thursday. After Newsom's signature, it will be added to the ballot on Nov. 4 for the voters' final say. That election is likely to be expensive and unpredictable, given how quickly the effort has come together and how little time there is between the state Legislature's actions and voters starting to have their say. California Democrats insisted they had no choice but to undertake the new maps after President Trump intervened in Texas and asked Republican lawmakers to redraw the districts to preserve the GOP's razor-thin majority in the U.S. House. Following Newsom's declaration that he would redraw California's maps, several other states said they would undertake similar efforts. \"They fired the first shot, Texas. We wouldn't be here had Texas not done what they just did,\" Newsom said during a signing ceremony Thursday. \"We're neutralizing what occurred [in Texas] and we're giving the American people a fair chance.\"Although California Republicans have denounced the redistricting plan as a \"tit-for-tat strategy,\" the state's Democrats on Thursday touted that the effort is different from Texas since it ultimately needs approval from the state's voters. \"In California, we will do whatever it takes to ensure that voters, not Donald Trump, will decide the direction of this country,\" Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said. \"This is a proud moment in the history of this assembly. Californians, we believe in freedom. We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism, and today, we give every Californian the power to say no. To say no to Donald Trump's power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.\"California responds to Texas' redistrictingThe Republican-led Texas House on Wednesday approved the new congressional maps after a two-week delay when Democrats left the state to deny a quorum to bring the measure to the floor. The measure now goes to the Texas Senate, where it is likely to pass. Shortly after the Texas House passed the maps, Newsom posted to social media: \"It's on.\" When Texas first launched its redistricting effort, Newsom had vowed to redraw the Golden State's congressional districts to counter the Lone Star State's plan and neutralize any potential GOP gains. Newsom — who is widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender — sarcastically congratulated Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott on X, saying, \"You will now go down in history as one of Donald Trump's most loyal lapdogs. Shredding our nation's founding principles. What a legacy.\"Mr. Trump late Wednesday congratulated Texas Republicans for advancing the new maps, writing on social media that \"Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.\" He also encouraged GOP-led Indiana and Florida to take on redistricting. The relatively rare mid-decade redistricting gambit comes as both parties prepare to face off in 2026 and has major implications nationwide. Republicans have a narrow majority at the moment, and Democrats winning back three seats in the 2026 midterms could be enough to flip control of the chamber if the lines used in the 2024 election were still in place. Redistricting in red states could change that dynamic significantly, however, and with it the impact of the final two years on Mr. Trump's second term in office. Texas and California are the two biggest redistricting battlegrounds, but Mr. Trump has pushed similar efforts in GOP-led Indiana and Florida, and New York Democrats have floated redrawing their House map. The Republican-led state of Missouri could also try and redraw a Democratic district in the coming weeks, and new maps are also expected in Ohio, where a redraw brought about by state law could impact some of the red state's Democratic members of Congress. Earlier this week, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that he was not a fan of partisan gerrymandering, but he backed Newsom's redistricting plan anyway at a fundraiser in Martha's Vineyard and on social media, calling it a \"smart, measured approach.\"Less than 24 hours before California's scheduled vote, Newsom joined a press call with Democratic party leaders, urging support for his state's redistricting effort. \"This is about taking back our country,\" Newsom told reporters. \"This is about the Democratic Party now punching back forcefully and very intentionally.\"A draft congressional map unveiled by California Democrats late last week would heavily impact five of the state's nine Republican U.S. House members. It would redraw Reps. Doug LaMalfa and Kevin Kiley's Northern California districts, tweak Rep. David Valadao's district in the Central Valley and rearrange parts of densely populated Southern California, impacting Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa. And some more competitive Democrat-held districts could be tilted further from the GOP.There's no guarantee that Democrats will win in all five newly recast districts.California Republicans push back against redistrictingDemocrats hold large majorities in both chambers of California's state legislature. But some legal hurdles still lie ahead, and Republicans in the state have pushed back against the redistricting plans.Unlike Texas, California has an independent redistricting commission that was created by voters earlier this century. To overhaul the current congressional map, a constitutional amendment would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in California's Assembly and Senate and be approved by voters in the fast-moving fall election. On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court denied a GOP attempt to stop the mid-cycle redistricting. California Republicans had legally challenged Democrats' efforts, claiming the state's constitution gives Californians the right to review new legislation for 30 days. But Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said they \"failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time.\"The GOP legislators who filed the legal challenge told CBS News the ruling is \"not the end of this fight,\" vowing to keep fighting the redistricting plan in the courts.In a phone interview with CBS News on Wednesday, California Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a Republican, condemned Newsom's redistricting efforts. \"This whole process is illegal from the beginning and violates the current California Constitution,\" Jones said. \"The voters spoke with a loud voice in 2008 and 2010 that they were taking this process out of the politicians' hands and putting the responsibility into an independent commission.\" Democrats faced a flurry of questions from Republican lawmakers during hearings this week on the alleged lack of transparency in the drafting of these maps and the financial implications of the Nov. 4 special election. \"If we're talking about the cost of a special election versus the cost of our democracy or the cost that Californians are already paying to subsidize this corrupt administration, those costs seem well worth paying at this moment,\" said Democratic state Assemblyman Isaac G. Bryan. Democratic lawmakers and Newsom have repeatedly emphasized that these redistricting efforts would not get rid of the independent commission and that the new maps he's hoping to put in place will be the lines used through the 2030 election. The commission would go back to drawing the state's congressional maps after the 2030 census, according to Newsom, who says this is only being done as a response to Mr. Trump and Texas' redistricting. That notion was rejected by Jones, who said: \"Growing up, I was taught two wrongs don't make a right, so no, it is not justified.\"","summary":"The new map would shift five of California's Republican House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-redistricting-gavin-newsom-vote/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/21/e8f2cee4-9904-43e0-9040-12bae7fd43de/thumbnail/1200x630/8c1aeaa67d334a1d8c8351fb4bc3ec2a/gettyimages-2231380413.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:22:00","author":"Hunter Woodall,Nidia Cavazos","authors":["Hunter Woodall","Nidia Cavazos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":353079408,"title":"Trump Allegedly Takes Drastic Measures to Conceal His Ankles","text":"Donald Trump is taking extreme steps to try and hide his unsightly swollen ankles from public view, liberal critics have claimed. \n\nMSNBC star Laurence O’Donnell, 79, started a frenzy of speculation on his show The Last Word earlier this week. \n\nHe mentioned that the president, who is also 79 years old, sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office when meeting with visiting European leaders to conceal his ‘cankles’.\n\n‘Presidents typically do not sit at the Oval Office desk during meetings with visitors from outside the White House staff,’ O’Donnell remarked.\n\n‘He ensured that no one could compare his ankles to those of a French president, a German chancellor, or a British prime minister,’ O’Donnell added.\n\n‘Donald Trump now has an extra incentive to stay behind the desk because the Resolute Desk will help him hide, at least one of his problems.’ \n\nLater that day, Trump joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky away from the desk, on the couches where such discussions usually happen.\n\nHowever, an official White House photograph cleverly hid Trump’s ankles by placing a model of Trump’s new Air Force One plane on a nearby coffee table.\n\nOther shots taken by wire photographers gave a better view of the president’s cankles – an unflattering term used when a person’s calves and feet are not visually separated by their ankles. \n\nAnd even MAGA fans addressed ‘Cankle-gate’. \n\nFar-right Infowars host Alex Jones claimed they’re a symptom of the president working too hard and warned that Trump faces a health ‘crisis’ if he ‘doesn’t take his foot off the gas pedal.’ \n\nTrump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that occurs when a leg vein is damaged and struggles to send blood back to the heart.\n\nDr David Shokrian, a plastic surgeon with Millennial Plastic Surgery, told the Daily Mail Thursday that Trump’s diagnosis can indeed cause cankles.\n\n‘Venous insufficiency and varicose veins are closely linked to the development of lower limb edema and “cankles” through impaired venous return and increased hydrostatic pressure,’ Dr Shokrian said.\n\n‘It’s likely that the combination of his weight, diet, lack of cardiovascular exercise and stress are all contributing to this problem.’\n\nThe plastic surgeon – who is an expert in contouring procedures such as liposuction, Brazilian butt lifts, facelifts and mini tummy tucks – suggested two types of treatments for Trump’s condition. \n\n‘If swelling is due to venous disease or edema, vascular procedures – ablation, sclerotherapy, compression – are most effective,’ Dr Shokrian said. ‘If due to fat deposits, targeted liposuction and body contouring are the solution.’\n\nAblation destroys or removes abnormal tissue, sclerotherapy destroys varicose veins, while compression simply involves putting pressure on an affected area. \n\nHe added that patients often benefit from a ‘staged or combined’ treatment plan, dependent on whether the ‘primary problem is fluid or fat’.\n\nBut Dr Shokrian warned that liposuction – a notoriously painful procedure – can take weeks to recover from, ruling it out for the President of the United States. \n\nThe White House confirmed Trump’s chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis last month, saying it is a ‘common condition’ in individuals over the age of 70 and that the president showed ‘no evidence’ of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. \n\nPresident Trump’s former personal physician Dr. Ronny Jackson forcefully refuted speculation about Trump’s health Thursday – but did not address the cankle issue.\n\n‘As President Trump’s former personal physician, former Physician to the President, and White House physician for 14 years across three administrations, I can tell you unequivocally: President Donald J. Trump is the healthiest president this nation has ever seen’ Jackson said.\n\n‘I continue to consult with his current physician and medical team at the White House and still spend significant time with the President. He is mentally and physically sharper than ever before.’\n\nTrump blasted O’Donnell from his Truth Social account – but avoided drawing further attention to the unflattering cankle claims that had started the ball rolling.\n\nHe blasted MSNBC on his Truth Social platform, branding them ‘fake news’ and alleging the content they create is ‘garbage’. \n\nBut the president publicly denouncing MSNBC’s credibility has not stopped critics and fans alike from expressing concern over his health.\n\nTrump’s swollen ankles were also on full display as he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit in Alaska last Friday, causing an uproar online.\n\nSome social media users alleged that Trump appeared to ‘struggle walking a straight line down red carpet laid out for Putin’s arrival’.\n\nOthers highlighted how while Putin sported a ‘sardonic smile’, Trump merely showcased his ‘swollen ankles’.\n\nMany Trump supporters insist Trump’s cankles are just an unfortunate side-effect of his ferocious work ethic. \n\nTrump won his second term in office in large part to the evidence cognitive decline of his Democrat predecessor Joe Biden, 82.\n\nUnlike Biden, Trump is still in sharp command of his mental facilities and has not repeatedly tripped while walking up the stairs of Air Force One. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last month that Trump was checked out by his doctor after noticeable ‘swelling’ and revealed he had been diagnosed with ‘chronic venous insufficiency’.\n\nA letter released by White House Physician Sean Barbarella, DO, references ‘mild swelling’ in Trump’s lower legs, and states the diagnosis emerged after a series of vascular studies. \n\nLeavitt said during her rare medical update that the president underwent a ‘comprehensive examination’ which included ‘diagnostic vascular studies.’\n\n‘Bilateral, lower extremity ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency,’ Leavitt stated. \n\nShe also addressed the ‘minor bruising’ on the back of Trump’s hand. \n\n‘This is consistent with minor soft-tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. This is a well-known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.’\n\n‘The president remains in excellent health,’ Leavitt continued and reiterated that there was ‘no discomfort from the president at all.’\n\nShe then pointed to his daily activities, highlighting how ‘on a day-to-day basis, he’s working around the clock’.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is taking extreme steps to try and hide his unsightly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Allegedly Takes Drastic Measures to Conceal His Ankles first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-allegedly-takes-drastic-measures-to-conceal-his-ankles/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump-accused-of-taking-extreme-steps-to-hide-his-CANKLES.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:19:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":353077264,"title":"California Advances Redistricting Plan in Texas Counter-Punch","text":"The California state legislature has passed a redistricting plan that favors Democrats on the same day that Texas looks to pass its own redistricting plan that would favor Republicans as the two parties keep an eye on the 2026 midterm elections and control of Congress.The redistricting plan, pushed by California Governor Gavin Newsom to counter what he called President Donald Trump's efforts to \"rig\" the next elections, adds five seats that favor Democrats in a direct counterweight to the five seats the Republicans could gain in Texas.The State Assembly passed the new map by 57 to 20, and the State Senate again approved the new map just hours later on a party-line vote with 30 to 8.\"Open your eyes to what is going on in the United States of America in 2025,\" Newsom said at a press conference following the vote. \"That's what this is about.

Additional penalties for executives at his company, the Trump Organisation, including sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr, have brought the total to $527 million with interest.\n “While harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award” to the state, Judges Dianne Renwick and Peter Moulton wrote in one of three opinions shaping the appeals court’s ruling.\n They called the penalty “an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.” Both were appointed by Democratic governors.\n Engoron’s other punishments, upheld by the appeals court, have been on pause during Trump’s appeal, and the president was able to hold off collection of the money by posting a $175 million bond.\n Donald Trump Jr celebrated the decision by mocking James, who had periodically posted a running tally of the fraud penalty, with interest. Over a post from James in February 2024, when the tally was nearly $465 million, Trump Jr wrote: “I believe you mean $0.00. Thank you for your attention to this matter.” The five-judge panel, which split on the merits of the lawsuit and Engoron’s fraud finding, dismissed the monetary penalty in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for an appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals.\n In the meantime, Trump and his co-defendants, the judges wrote, can seek to extend the pause to prevent any punishments from taking effect.\n While the Appellate Division dispatches most appeals in a few pages in a matter of weeks, the judges weighing Trump’s case took nearly 11 months to rule after oral arguments last fall and issued 323 pages of concurring and dissenting opinions with no majority.\n Rather, some judges endorsed parts of their colleagues’ findings while denouncing others, enabling the court to rule.\n Two judges wrote that they felt James’ lawsuit was justifiable and that she had proven her case but the penalty was too severe.\n One wrote that James exceeded her legal authority in bringing the suit, saying that if any lenders felt cheated, they could have sued Trump themselves, and none did. Another wrote that Engoron erred by ruling before the trial that James had proven Trump engaged in fraud.\n In his portion of the ruling, Judge David Friedman, appointed by a Republican governor, was scathing in his criticism of James for bringing the lawsuit.\n “Plainly, her ultimate goal was not market hygiene’ … but political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump’s political career and the destruction of his real estate business,” Friedman wrote. “The voters have obviously rendered a verdict on his political career. This bench today unanimously derails the effort to destroy his business.” Trump and his co-defendants denied wrongdoing. At the conclusion of the civil trial in January 2024, Trump said he was “an innocent man” and the case was a “fraud on me”.\n The Republican leader has repeatedly maintained the case and the verdict were political moves by James and Engoron, both Democrats.\n Trump’s Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an investigation into whether she violated the president’s civil rights.\n James’ personal attorney Abbe D Lowell has said investigating the fraud case is “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign”.\n Trump and his lawyers said his financial statements weren’t deceptive, since they came with disclaimers noting they weren’t audited. The defence also noted bankers and insurers independently evaluated the numbers, and the loans were repaid.\n Despite such discrepancies as tripling the size of his Trump Tower penthouse, he said the financial statements were, if anything, lowball estimates of his fortune.\n During an appellate court hearing last September, Trump’s lawyers argued that many of the case’s allegations were too old and that James had misused a consumer protection law to sue Trump over private business transactions that were satisfactory to those involved.\n State attorneys said that while Trump insists no one was harmed by the financial statements, his exaggerations led lenders to make riskier loans and that honest borrowers lose out when others game their net worth numbers.\n The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.\n On Jan 10, he was sentenced in his criminal hush money case to what’s known as an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction on the books but sparing him jail, probation, a fine or other punishment. He is appealing the conviction.\n And in December, a federal appeals court upheld a jury’s finding that Trump sexually abused writer E Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, affirming a $5 million judgment against him. The appeals court declined in June to reconsider. Trump still can try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.\n Trump also is appealing a subsequent verdict that requires him to pay Carroll $83.3 million for additional defamation claims.

But that right is only applicable in response to an actual or imminent armed attack, not on activities of a non-state group that cause harm to the nation, which I believe is the case.\"The increased enforcement action would come after the Trump administration classified select cartels and transnational criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in February. The president has long argued that the U.S. needed to be firmer in how it dealt with the groups, widely seen as the driving force feeding the cross-border drug trade.Sending a MessageWhen Newsweek asked the Department of Defense about the report, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon's spokesperson, reaffirmed the president's FTO designation and the belief that the groups are a \"direct threat\" to national security.\"These cartels have engaged in historic violence and terror throughout our Hemisphere—and around the globe-- that has destabilized economies and internal security of countries but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs,\" Parnell said.Klippenstein's report is not the first to detail potential military action, however, with the U.S. moving personnel into the seas around Mexico and Latin America in recent weeks.\"On the practical level, we have to clarify what 'military action' means. One could think of drone strikes on infrastructure, but fentanyl production and trafficking in Mexico is highly fragmented—small networks, labs inside houses in cities like Culiacán. Drone strikes there would be complicated and dangerous,\" David Mora, senior analyst for Mexico at International Crisis Group, told Newsweek Thursday.\"If it were instead a deployment of U.S. troops to capture or eliminate a criminal leader, Trump might sell it as a victory. It would sound good and grab headlines, but it would be an empty victory. History shows that this strategy does not solve drug trafficking or organized crime.\"On the contrary, it increases violence. Even the Department of Justice and the DEA have admitted this.\"Military Action Could Backfire on the BorderWhen the FTO designation was first signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, policy experts raised concerns about the unintended consequences the move could have, particularly around immigration.While Trump has all but shut down the southern border with Mexico, one critic said branding cartels as terrorist organizations could lead to stronger claims for asylum – a concern echoed by Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, the head of the North American Observatory at Global Initiative Against Transational Organized Crime.\"It is mutually exclusive from the border and migration objectives the administration has. Evidence shows that violence drives internal displacement,\" Farfán-Méndez told Newsweek. \"U.S. military action in Mexico, and potential responses by criminal groups in Mexico, could generate displacement of communities.\"As with other episodes of violence and displacement, it is not unthinkable these communities migrate to the border and seek asylum in the US. This prevents the orderly migration process the Trump administration has sought.\"All three experts Newsweek spoke with raised concerns about the viability and constitutionality of making such moves, when cartels have not necessarily carried out a coordinated attack on the U.S. that could be defined as military action that would require like-for-like retaliation.Farfán-Méndez said she believed there was a misdiagnosis on the part of the White House regarding how criminal gangs operate, explaining that the drug trade was not \"three men hiding in the Sierra Madre that you can target and eliminate\", and that there were actors working in concert on both sides of the border.U.S. Sentencing Commission data for 2024 backed that up, showing 83.5 percent of those sentenced for fentanyl trafficking within the U.S. were American citizens, rather than foreign nationals.Sheinbaum Could Be Political VictimThe experts also questioned how operations could affect the relationship between the U.S. and its southern neighbor, where President Claudia Sheinbaum has been clear publicly in her efforts to stem the flow of immigrants and drugs across the border while managing her relationship with Washington over other issues like trade.\"Mexico has always had less leverage,\" Mora said. \"If during Sheinbaum's government there were any kind of unilateral U.S. action, it would be extremely politically sensitive. In Mexico, any unilateral action is equal to invasion.\"Imagine the slogan: being the president under whom the United States invaded Mexico again. Politically, it would be almost the end for her.\"For the Trump administration, which came into office in January promising strong border security and the end of fentanyl trafficking into the U.S., the likelihood of stronger actions on cartels appears clear, if the methods and strategy are less so.Parnell told Newsweek that taking action against cartels, at the president's directive, required a \"whole-of-government effort and thorough coordination with regional partners\" to eliminate the abilities of cartels to \"threaten the territory, safety, and security\" of the U.S.Corn said any use of military force against the cartels would ultimately do more harm than good.\"I think this also is consistent with a trend we are seeing: when you think your best tool is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail,\" the lawyer said. \"This administration seems determined to expand the use of military power for all sorts of what it designates as 'emergencies.' But this is fundamentally not a problem amenable to military attack.\"","summary":"The Trump administration is reportedly planning for the possibility of military operations south of the border.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-plans-military-action-mexico-cartels-2117318","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2707254/us-military-mexico-border.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5f402dfe2f3dcd3b4e4e41596850888d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:14:52","author":"Dan Gooding,Jesus Mesa","authors":["Dan Gooding","Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":353082072,"title":"Tariffs: Quebec liquor board prepares to destroy $300,000 worth of American alcohol (Canada)","text":"The Quebec liquor board may be forced to destroy $300,000 worth of American alcohol that the province has banned from stores.\n\nThe provincial government on March 4 ordered the state-owned corporation to empty shelves of U.S. alcohol in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nSince then, U.S. alcohol purchased before the boycott has been kept in storage, but Quebec's liquor board says that unless the government changes its guidelines it will have to destroy some products set to expire. Affected products are mainly rosé and boxed wines, ready-to-drink cocktails, and certain beers and liqueurs not suitable for prolonged storage.\n\n\"The scenario surrounding these products has not yet been finalized and the operation is still ongoing,\" liquor board spokesperson Laurianne Tardif said in a written statement. \"Several factors, including the duration of the operation, the number of products involved and future decisions regarding their fate, will have a direct impact on the potential costs.\"\n\nThe $300,000 worth of stock represents only a small portion of the $27 million of American products in storage.

are going to be like and they are just not spending what they used to spend.”\n\nMitton said eight in 10 B.C. businesses are exposed to the U.S. for trade in some way, and more than half (56 per cent) of B.C. businesses are exposed to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs or Canada’s own tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n“The result of tariffs and counter tariffs is raising prices for everyone, we’re seeing increased costs, reduced profits, and small businesses are having to completely change their supply chains,” he said.\n\n“They’re confused when it comes to orders, in fact, one in three small businesses have had orders pause lately as a result of the impacts of not just U.S. tariffs, but counter tariffs as well.”\n\nOn top of that, a quarter are being affected by U.S. duties on softwood lumber, according to the CFIB data.\n\n“That includes small businesses, restaurants in lumber communities, forestry communities that work on serving those workers, providing supplies, or even contracting with forestry operations themselves,” he said.\n\nWhile coming to a clear and stable agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump is a riddle no country has yet solved, Mitton said there are actions provincial and federal governments can take to give small businesses some breathing room.\n\nAt the top of the list is ensuring all revenue from Canadian counter-tariffs is returned to domestic businesses being hurt by the trade war.\n\nThe group is also calling for action to cut the cost of doing business and reduce taxes, including temporarily cutting the small business tax rate to zero or offering a tariff rebate similar to the former carbon tax rebate.\n\nThat’s an approach Nakazawa would support.\n\n“The government puts a lot of Band-Aids on situations and there isn’t a lot of actual help,” she said.\n\n“We pay a lot in taxes, a lot more than these big corporations are paying when you look at percentages.”","summary":"The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses

released from jail Friday. Here’s what to know","text":"By BEN FINLEY\n\nA U.S. magistrate judge is expected to order the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a Tennessee jail Friday while he awaits trial on federal human smuggling charges.\n\nThe release will provide the closest thing to freedom Abrego Garcia has felt since he was wrongfully deported to a notorious El Salvador prison in March, making him a face — if not the face — of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s lawyers stated in a court filings Tuesday that a private security firm will take Abrego Garcia from Tennessee to Maryland when he’s freed.\n\nBut Abrego Garcia’s liberty before trial could be short-lived. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may detain him once he arrives in his adopted state of Maryland and could try to deport him again.\n\nDepending on who’s telling his story, there are two very different versions of Abrego Garcia.\n\nTrump and his administration cast him as an MS-13 gang member and a tireless smuggler of migrants across the country. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys portray him as a family man and construction worker who was arbitrarily deported and then vindictively charged to save political face.\n\nAs Abrego Garcia’s story takes yet another turn, here’s what to know:\n\n‘Well-founded fear’\n\nAbrego Garcia, 30, grew up in El Salvador and fled at 16 because a local gang extorted and terrorized his family, court records state. He traveled to Maryland, where his brother lives as a U.S. citizen, but was not authorized to stay.\n\nAbrego Garcia found work in construction and met his future wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. In 2018, he moved in with her and her two children after she became pregnant with his child. They lived in Prince George’s County, just outside Washington.\n\nIn March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records state. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing.\n\nA criminal informant told police that Abrego Garcia was in MS-13, court records state, but police did not charge him and turned him over to ICE.\n\nA U.S. immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia’s subsequent asylum claim because more than a year had passed since his arrival. But the judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, determining that he had a “well-founded fear” of gang persecution there, court records state.\n\nAbrego Garcia was released and placed under federal supervision. He received a federal work permit and checked in with ICE each year, his lawyers said. He joined a union and was employed full-time as a sheet metal apprentice.\n\n‘Audacity to fight back’\n\nIn February, the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization. In March, it deported Abrego Garcia to the prison in El Salvador, violating the U.S. immigration judge’s 2019 order.\n\nAbrego Garcia later claimed in court documents that he was beaten and psychologically tortured, while El Salvador President Nayib Bukele denied the allegations.\n\nThe Trump administration described its violation of the immigration judge’s 2019 order as an administrative error. Trump and other officials also doubled down on claims Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.\n\nVasquez Sura filed a lawsuit to bring her husband back. Following mounting political pressure and a Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in early June. But it was to face the human smuggling charges.\n\nThe smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Police in Tennessee suspected human smuggling, but he was allowed to drive on and wasn’t charged with anything.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges filed in June. The case relies on the testimony of cooperating witnesses, some of whom have requested or received help with immigration and criminal matters, according to pre-trial testimony.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s lawyers on Tuesday filed a rarely used motion to dismiss the case based on “vindictive and selective prosecution.”\n\n“This case results from the government’s concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back,” his lawyers wrote.\n\nThe government’s response is due in court by Tuesday.\n\nDeportation fears realized\n\nU.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes in Nashville ruled in June that Abrego Garcia has a right to be released from jail while he awaits trial, determining that he’s not a flight risk or danger to the community.\n\nHolmes discussed at a court hearing conditions of release that would require Abrego Garcia to stay with his brother in Maryland. He would also have electronic monitoring and be placed on home detention.\n\nBut Abrego Garcia has remained in jail at his attorneys’ request for about 11 weeks over fears that ICE would immediately try to deport him. Those fears were confirmed in federal court in Maryland, where Abrego Garcia’s wife is suing the Trump administration.\n\nThomas Giles, an assistant director for ICE, testified last month that Abrego Garcia would be detained as soon as he’s freed. He added that Mexico or South Sudan may be willing to accept Abrego Garcia, but the Trump administration hadn’t decided on anything yet.\n\nU.S. officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.\n\nJudge provides some protections\n\nDespite the fears of deportation, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have asked Holmes to finally release him from jail in Tennessee. A stay of release that they had requested expires Friday.\n\nIn a filing Thursday, Holmes wrote that she will enter an order regarding Abrego Garcia’s pretrial release on conditions. The order was not published as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s expected release comes after a federal judge in Maryland provided some protections for him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the lawsuit, has prohibited ICE from immediately detaining Abrego Garcia when he’s released in Tennessee.\n\nIn a late July order, Xinis required that any removal proceedings begin in Baltimore. That’s where they should have begun when the Trump administration wrongfully deported him to El Salvador, Xinis wrote.\n\nXinis also ordered that ICE provide three business days notice if it intends to initiate removal proceedings. The time will give Abrego Garcia and his attorneys the opportunity to raise any credible fears of persecution or torture in the country to which ICE plans to send him.\n\nXinis wrote that the Trump administration has “done little to assure the Court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected.”\n\nIf ICE wanted to return him to El Salvador, it would have to reopen his 2019 case before an immigration judge, Xinis wrote. And that would require formal notice and “an opportunity to be heard.”\n\nXinis acknowledged that Abrego Garcia may be ordered to appear in Baltimore for immigration proceedings, which “may or may not include lawful arrest, detention and eventual removal.\n\n“So long as such actions are taken within the bounds of the Constitution and applicable statutes, this Court will have nothing further to say,” Xinis wrote.","summary":"His lawyers have said he will travel to Maryland, where his family lives.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/21/deportation-error-things-to-know/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deportation_Error_Abrego_Garcia_77205_15775e.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:00:56","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":353081064,"title":"Kilmar Abrego Garcia could be released from jail Friday.

The case relies on the testimony of cooperating witnesses, some of whom have requested or received help with immigration and criminal matters, according to pre-trial testimony.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s lawyers on Tuesday filed a rarely used motion to dismiss the case based on “vindictive and selective prosecution.”\n\n“This case results from the government’s concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back,” his lawyers wrote.\n\nThe government’s response is due in court by Tuesday.\n\nDeportation fears realized\n\nU.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes in Nashville ruled in June that Abrego Garcia has a right to be released from jail while he awaits trial, determining that he’s not a flight risk or danger to the community.\n\nHolmes discussed at a court hearing conditions of release that would require Abrego Garcia to stay with his brother in Maryland. He would also have electronic monitoring and be placed on home detention.\n\nBut Abrego Garcia has remained in jail at his attorneys’ request for about 11 weeks over fears that ICE would immediately try to deport him. Those fears were confirmed in federal court in Maryland, where Abrego Garcia’s wife is suing the Trump administration.\n\nThomas Giles, an assistant director for ICE, testified last month that Abrego Garcia would be detained as soon as he’s freed. He added that Mexico or South Sudan may be willing to accept Abrego Garcia, but the Trump administration hadn’t decided on anything yet.\n\nU.S. officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.\n\nJudge provides some protections\n\nDespite the fears of deportation, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have asked Holmes to finally release him from jail in Tennessee. A stay of release that they had requested expires Friday.\n\nIn a filing Thursday, Holmes wrote that she will enter an order regarding Abrego Garcia’s pretrial release on conditions. The order was not published as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s expected release comes after a federal judge in Maryland provided some protections for him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing the lawsuit, has prohibited ICE from immediately detaining Abrego Garcia when he’s released in Tennessee.\n\nIn a late July order, Xinis required that any removal proceedings begin in Baltimore. That’s where they should have begun when the Trump administration wrongfully deported him to El Salvador, Xinis wrote.\n\nXinis also ordered that ICE provide three business days notice if it intends to initiate removal proceedings. The time will give Abrego Garcia and his attorneys the opportunity to raise any credible fears of persecution or torture in the country to which ICE plans to send him.\n\nXinis wrote that the Trump administration has “done little to assure the Court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected.”\n\nIf ICE wanted to return him to El Salvador, it would have to reopen his 2019 case before an immigration judge, Xinis wrote. And that would require formal notice and “an opportunity to be heard.”\n\nXinis acknowledged that Abrego Garcia may be ordered to appear in Baltimore for immigration proceedings, which “may or may not include lawful arrest, detention and eventual removal.\n\n“So long as such actions are taken within the bounds of the Constitution and applicable statutes, this Court will have nothing further to say,” Xinis wrote.","summary":"His lawyers have said he will travel to Maryland, where his family lives.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/21/deportation-error-things-to-know/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deportation_Error_Abrego_Garcia_77205_15775e.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 23:00:56","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":353074898,"title":"Trump's crackdown in D.C. leaves residents on edge as federal agents set up checkpoints (World)","text":"Federal authorities have set up checkpoints around the nation's capital, sometimes asking people for their immigration status and detaining them, as President Donald Trump's crackdown ensnares more residents each day.\n\nTrump claimed that a crime crisis required his Republican administration’s intervention in the Democratic-led city this month, brushing aside statistics that showed the problem was already waning. However, immigration enforcement appears to be a priority, as more than a third of people arrested in the last two weeks were in the country illegally, according to the White House.\n\nHundreds of federal agents and National Guard soldiers have surged into Washington, leaving some residents on edge and creating tense confrontations in the streets.\n\nA daycare was partially closed on Thursday when staff became afraid to go to work because they heard about federal agents nearby. An administrator asked parents to keep their children at home if possible.\n\nOther day cares have stopped taking kids on daily walks because of fears about encountering law enforcement.\n\nTrump visits cops and troops\n\nThe White House said there have been 630 arrests, including 251 people who are in the country illegally, since Aug. 7, when Trump began surging federal agents into the city. Trump has been ratcheting up the pressure since then, seizing control of the D.C. police department on Aug. 11 and deploying more National Guard troops, mostly from Republican-led states.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Trump visited with officers and troops at a U.S. Park Police facility in the latest show of force from the White House.\n\n“We’re not playing games,\" he said.\n\nTrump suggested that operations in the city could be drawn out and serve as a model for others around the country.\n\n“We’re going to make it safe, and we’re going to go on to other places, but we’re going to stay here for a while,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited some of the troops at Union Station, showing their support while protestors chanted “free D.C.”\n\nSoldiers have been largely stationed in downtown areas, such as monuments on the National Mall and transit stations. However, federal agents are operating more widely through the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the proliferation of traffic checkpoints on Thursday.\n\n“The surge of federal officers is allowing for different types of deployments, more frequent types of deployments, like checkpoints,” Bowser said.\n\nA crowd of people gathered outside a municipal office building at the corner of 14th and U Streets NW to protest Trump's crackdown, waving signs and cheering speakers who denounced the president's plans. Several police cars and National Guard troops were parked nearby.\n\nNot a normal traffic stop\n\nOn Thursday morning, as Martin Romero rode through Washington’s Rock Creek Park on his way to a construction job in Virginia, he saw police on the road up ahead. He figured it was a normal traffic stop, but it wasn’t.\n\nRomero, 41, said that U.S. Park Police were telling pickup trucks with company logos to pull over, reminding them that commercial vehicles weren’t allowed on park roads. They checked for licenses and insurance information, and then U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came over.\n\nRomero said there were two agents on one side of his truck and three on the other. He started to get nervous as the agents asked where they were from and whether they were in the country illegally.\n\n“We just came here to work,” Romero said afterwards. “We aren’t doing anything bad.”\n\nTwo people in his truck were detained and the agents didn't give a reason, he said. He also saw three other people taken from other vehicles.\n\n“I feel really worried because they took two of our guys,\" he said. \"They wouldn’t say where they’re taking them or if they’ll be able to come back.”\n\nRomero said he called his boss, who told him to just head home. They wouldn’t be working today.\n\nEnrique Martinez, a supervisor at the construction company, came to the scene afterwards. He pondered whether to call families of the detained men.\n\n“This has never happened to our company before,\" Martinez said. \"I’m not really sure what to do.”\n\nCheckpoints are legal, to a point\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the use of law enforcement and government checkpoints for specific purposes, such as for policing the border and for identifying suspected drunk drivers.\n\nBut there are restrictions on that authority, especially when it comes to general crime control. Jeffrey Bellin, a former prosecutor in Washington and professor at Vanderbilt Law School who specializes in criminal law and procedures, said the Constitution doesn’t allow “the government to be constantly checking us and stopping to see if we’re up to any criminal activity.”\n\nHe said checkpoints for a legally justifiable purpose — like checking for drivers’ licenses and registrations — cannot be used as “subterfuge” or a pretext for stops that would otherwise not be allowed. And though the court has affirmed the use of checkpoints at the border, and even some distance away from it, to ask drivers about immigration status, Bellin said it was unlikely the authority would extend to Washington.\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, a professor at Georgia State College of Law, said the seemingly “arbitrary” and intrusive nature of the checkpoints in the capital could leave residents feeling aggrieved.\n\n“Some of the things could be entirely constitutional and fine, but at the same time, the way that things are unfolding, people are suspicious — and I think for good reason,” he said.\n\nLilly Burchfield, 25, said she's seen people in her neighborhood come out of their homes to yell at federal agents.\n\n“It feels like we’re all coming together as a community and everyone that I’ve talked to has been outraged by what’s happening,” she said.\n\nFrom Los Angeles to D.C.\n\nThere are few places in the country that have been unaffected by Trump's deportation drive, but his push into D.C. is shaping into something more sustained, similar to what has unfolded in the Los Angeles area since early June.\n\nIn Los Angeles, immigration officers — working with the Border Patrol and other federal agencies — have been a near-daily presence at Home Depots, car washes and other highly visible locations.\n\nIn a demonstration of how enforcement has affected routines, the bishop of San Bernardino, California, formally excused parishioners of their weekly obligation to attend Mass after immigration agents detained people on two parish properties.\n\nImmigration officials have been an unusually public presence, sending horse patrols to the city’s famed MacArthur Park and appearing outside California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s news conference last week on congressional redistricting. Authorities said an agent fired at a moving vehicle last week after the driver refused to roll down his window during an immigration stop.\n\nThe National Guard and Marines were previously in the city for weeks on an assignment to maintain order amid protests.\n\nA federal judge blocked the administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops in Southern California but authorities have vowed to keep the pressure on.","summary":"Federal authorities have set up checkpoints around the nation's capital, sometimes asking people for their immigration status and detaining them, as President Donald Trump's crackdown ensnares more residents each day.

There is no stay order in place — which means that at any moment, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency could come and kill our healthy ostriches,” she wrote, adding that the farm would try to secure a legal stay order next week.\n\n“These animals are not just ‘livestock.’ They are living beings that have thrived against all odds. They are a symbol of resilience, of natural immunity, and of what’s possible when we stand up against broken policies that destroy life instead of protecting it.”\n\nPasitney said she was “opening our farm gates” on the weekend and calling on supporters to come and “sit with animals” and record interactions with the CFIA.\n\n“Absolutely no violence. Peaceful only,” she added.\n\nThe CFIA ordered Universal Ostrich Farms to cull about 400 birds after 69 ostriches died in December and January.\n\nThe agency tested two of the dead birds in January and found a “novel reassortment” of the highly contagious avian flu virus, which had not been seen anywhere else in Canada.\n\nAt trial, the farm had challenged the CIFA’s “stamping-out” policy, which requires the depopulation of animals that risk transmitting highly-pathogenic avian flu (HPAI).\n\nThe farm argued the CFIA had failed to consider the particularities of ostriches, did not consult with ostrich owners in developing the policy, and had not conducted additional testing on birds at the farm or allowed for a more targeted culling.\n\nIn its decision, the court concluded that the stamping-out policy overall was a reasonable response to “the risks of HPAI to domestic disease control, public health, and Canada’s ability to export poultry to its international trading partners,” and was authorized under Canada’s Health of Animals Act.\n\nThe court ruled that while the CFIA had not consulted with ostrich owners in developing the policy, it had reviewed scientific studies demonstrating ostriches’ susceptibility to avian flu.\n\nIt further ruled that culling the entire flock without additional testing was reasonable, as the Health of Animals act “explicitly allows for destruction in the face of a mere suspicion of infection or exposure to suspected infection.”\n\n“It is apparent that the Exemption Committee considered the health status of the flock, the biosecurity measures in place, and the importance of the flock to the appellant and its principals,” the court ruled.\n\n“After considering whether it could allow the appellant to keep a subset of the ostriches, the Committee determined that it was just too risky to undertake ‘selective culling’ or otherwise allow the infection to ‘burn out’ on the farm as the appellant proposed.”\n\nOver the course of the marathon court battle, the fate of the ostriches has become national and international news, with the farm drawing the support of Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and officials in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration including U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Dr. Mehemet Oz and Secretary for Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nEditor’s Note: A previous version of this story said the ruling was handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada.
