Miller was stopped near to the former President's rally on Saturday with a shotgun and a loaded handgun with a high-capacity magazine.\n\nBut while figures close to the Trump campaign have been quick to downplay any real threat to the Republican nominee, the local Sheriff's department has said it was \"probably\" the third attempt made on the former President's life during this campaign. Speaking to the press, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, after being grilled about Miller's intent, said: \"Holy crap, what did he show up with all that stuff for and loaded guns?\"\n\nPrecise details around how Vem Miller was apprehended are yet to be confirmed, though police in California have indicated that he was arrested while purporting to have a VIP pass for the Trump rally - which could have got him within \"40 feet\" of the candidate with multiple guns in his possession.\n\nYet Miller was taken into custody after being stopped at a checkpoint while driving a black SUV near the rally in Coachella, California. Officers booked him on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm and possessing a high-capacity magazine, before he was released on a $5000 bail.\n\nLocal sheriffs confirmed that Vem Miller was the individual's name, but he also had \"multiple\" identity cards and passports bearing different names in his possession. His vehicle was unregistered and had to be traced through its VIM number, with the police identifying him as a sovereign citizen, someone who believes society's laws and taxes do not apply to them.\n\nSheriff Bianco said the number plate on his vehicle is believed to have been handmade, a common sign of the far-right-aligned sovereign citizen group. \"The vehicle had an obviously fake licence plate, and that prompted further investigation from our deputy into why the person was where... and what he was doing,\" he said.\n\nOn his LinkedIn profile, Vem Miller identifies himself as a \"citizen journalist\" and co-founder of the far-right media network \"America Happens\", as well as a gun rights advocate who wants to \"stop voter fraud\". \n\nMiller also ran for election in 2022, as an assemblyman in Nevada's 13th district, however, Sheriff Bianco was quick to shut down questions about his political allegiances during a press conference, telling reporters: \"He's just a lunatic.\"\n\nThis marks the third attempt on Trump's life during this election cycle, with the near-miss attempt in July, and the Secret Service-foiled plot to shoot him on his Florida golf course, last month. In this case, Miller was arrested long before Trump would take to the stage.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign is yet to issue a statement on the incident. A spokesperson for the Secret Service said: \"We were contacted as it happened and secret service agents conducted a productive intelligence interview.\n\n\"It had no impact on the event and we are looking into the circumstances and the backgrounds of the individuals.\"","summary":"Vem Miller, 49, has been identified as the man arrested with 'multiple' guns near to Donald Trump's campaign rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/vem-miller-donald-trumps-third-33883867","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33883887.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot_2024-10-13_at_231719.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:20:40","author":"William Morgan","authors":["William Morgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.623},{"id":259561288,"title":"US sheriff says ‘probably prevented’ third Trump assassination attempt","text":"A United States sheriff has said law enforcement officers likely prevented a third assassination attempt against Donald Trump after a man was arrested with unregistered firearms near the Republican candidate’s California campaign rally at the weekend.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said deputies stopped the man at a security perimeter outside the former president’s event in the city of Coachella a day earlier.\n\nBianco said the suspect “showed up with multiple passports with different names, an unregistered vehicle with [a] fake license plate, and loaded firearms”.\n\n“If you’re asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that prevented the third assassination attempt,” the sheriff told reporters.\n\nThe man, identified as 49-year-old Nevada resident Vem Miller, was taken into custody without incident, the sheriff’s office said in a statement earlier in the day.\n\nMiller faces gun charges after he was found in possession of two guns and a high-capacity magazine, authorities said. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear in court on January 2, 2025.\n\nIn an interview with Southern California News Group, Miller – who said he is a Trump supporter – denied trying to harm the former president.\n\n“These accusations are complete bulls**t,” Miller said. “I’m an artist, I’m the last person that would cause any violence and harm to anybody.”\n\nTrump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press news agency on the arrest.\n\n“The US Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger,” the US Attorney’s Office said in a statement on Sunday. “While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing.”\n\nThe incident comes just weeks after authorities in late September charged a man with attempting to assassinate Trump at his Florida golf course.\n\nProsecutors have accused Ryan Routh of intending to kill the former president as he golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on September 15.\n\nRouth has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.\n\nThe arrest in Florida marked the second apparent assassination attempt against Trump in the past few months. In July, he was shot in the ear after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat shooting prompted fierce criticism and questions about the security protocols that were put in place for the event.\n\nLast month, the US Secret Service acknowledged a series of failures it made during the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, including “deficiencies” in advanced security planning and poor coordination with local police.","summary":"Suspect faces firearms charges but denies he tried to harm ex-US president and Republican candidate at California rally.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/13/us-sheriff-says-probably-prevented-third-trump-assassination-attempt?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-13T020311Z_1702122566_RC2DJAAGLIQL_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-1728859474.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:16:54","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.532},{"id":259560788,"title":"Trump camp thumps chest as Kamala Harris fumbles swing states","text":"Top operatives from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign are very confident in their ability to close strong in swing states, contending Kamala Harris’ metrics have collapsed in the seven battlegrounds likely to decide the presidential election in just over three weeks.\n\nA memorandum senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles and pollster Tony Fabrizio sent reporters Sunday says the Democratic nominee’s campaign is “cracking,” with fissures revealed at the worst possible time for her — and the best possible time for Republicans.\n\nNoting RealClearPolitics’ model projects the former president ending up with 296 electoral votes, which is more than enough to win even if a state or two ends up in Harris’ hands in November, Team Trump contends the supposed Harris’ “momentum . . . never really existed beyond the confines of July” and, per its “internal Battleground State data,” Harris “actually slipped marginally post-Labor Day until now in her image and ballot position.”\n\nShe’s 5 points underwater in terms of favorability, while she was -3 early last month. And in a head-to-head test with Trump, the vice president is 2 points down; she was dead even with the Donald last month.\n\nA deeper dive reveals the changes in the dynamic. Trump is, his campaign says, +13 with independents compared with his 2020 level. He leads Harris by 5 with that pivotal group.\n\nAnd while he’s still down 61 points with black voters, that’s better than the 81-point loss with the cohort he experienced four years ago — and a good reason for Barack Obama’s recent lecturing of black males to support Harris despite qualms supported by this and other data.\n\nTrump is +7 with Hispanics, a group he lost by 25 points in 2020. And he’s just 4 points behind Harris with voters under the age of 45.\n\nPart of that seismic shift in the race can be explained by Harris being seen as an agent of the status quo, despite her best efforts to distance herself from the administration for which she’s worked for nearly four years, says the Trump camp. She can’t “convince the voters that she is ‘the change agent’ in the race, that she will be better on the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, or improving people’s financial situation.”\n\nThese major topics are meaningful, given public polling that delves into these issues in a single battleground or multiples thereof finds Trump with the advantage on all of them — sometimes a double-digit lead.\n\nPer Team Trump’s data, he’s seen as likely to do a better job than Harris as president (49% to 45%) and more likely to bring change (47% to 43%), create jobs (47% to 42%), fight inflation (50% to 40%), improve the economy (50% to 41%) and improve respondents’ personal financial positions (52% to 40%).\n\nBut, as the saying goes, it’s not “just the economy, stupid.”\n\nIt’s also about public safety, and the Trump data say voters don’t trust Harris to guard against menaces, whether they are foreign or domestic.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting crime and keeping neighborhoods safe, an anemic 38% of respondents believe Harris can accomplish that.\n\nAnd on the issue of repelling hostile immigrants and securing the border, a pitiful 28% of those polled think Harris is the one. Trump has a nearly 2-to-1 advantage on this critical matter.\n\nBeyond the issues, Team Trump thinks Harris’ flip-flops on cashless bail, fracking and electric vehicles are tough to square for voters who take in the full context of her radical career notwithstanding a media apparatus that’s facilitated the glow-up.\n\n“She’s tried to re-invent herself at every level. And despite once being dubbed the ‘worst Vice President in the modern era’ by many in the media, they gave her a free pass (much like Harris did with hardened criminals on her watch) as she tried to pull a fast one on the voters. However, as has been reported by a few courageous members of the media, voters in focus group after focus group aren’t buying it and are uncertain about who Kamala really is,” Team Trump says.","summary":"Top operatives from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign are very confident in their ability to close strong in swing states, contending Kamala Harris’ metrics have collapsed in the seven battlegrounds likely to decide the presidential election in just over three weeks.

When I went to receive my MBE from the Queen back in June 2019, the headline next day was all about Musk. The stigma is always there.’\n\nExtraordinarily, Musk’s surveillance targets are also understood to include Amber Heard, his former partner.\n\nIn 2017, when the couple were dating, Musk’s security team is understood to have employed an Australian private investigations firm to monitor Heard’s movements when she was filming Aquaman on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe surveillance is said to have been extensive and to have involved multiple operatives as well as infrared cameras and drones. Musk did not respond to requests for comment on this or other allegations. But more on that later.\n\nFor the Unsworth case is, in many ways, the most shocking.\n\nOn June 23, 2018, a group of 12 boys, aged 11-16, and their 25 -year-old soccer coach went to explore the Tham Luang cave system in northern Thailand. They didn’t come out. Rising flood water after heavy rain had trapped them inside.\n\nUnsworth, 69, who lives between Thailand and the UK and who had explored the Tham Luang cave before, was one of the first on the scene. ‘I arrived very early on the morning of the 24th,’ he says. ‘It all started from there.’\n\nSoon the cave’s mouth was crowded with people trying to help, including a group of Thai Navy Seals.\n\nBut Unsworth knew the very people who could be key in effecting a rescue and passed a note to the Thai authorities with the names of ‘the three people’.\n\nThe next day, British cave-divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, and British caver Robert Harper, arrived at the scene.\n\n‘The four of us had between us over 150 years of caving experience,’ Vernon remembers. ‘The problem was that all the Navy Seal command saw was four old guys… dressed in scruffy T-shirts and shorts.’\n\nDespite their dress sense, the British cavers came up trumps. On July 2, Volanthen and Stanton found the boys alive, huddled together on a muddy slope about three miles into the cave system. But the biggest challenge remained: getting them out.\n\nAn audacious plan was put in place to anaesthetise the boys using ketamine, equip them with breathing apparatus and take them out while unconscious. It worked. By July 10, all the boys and their coach were rescued alive.\n\n‘Obviously I was proud to be part of what happened,’ Unsworth says. ‘Because I don’t think many people gave the boys much of a chance.’ He’s underselling it. According to the other divers, if it wasn’t for him, the boys would be dead.\n\nIt was the happy ending everyone hoped for. Except that the story of the trapped boys didn’t go unnoticed by Elon Musk.\n\nDays into the rescue attempt, he announced that he would build a ‘tiny, kid-sized submarine’ to bring the children out. It was a typically bold move by the swashbuckling billionaire. A consequence of a mindset that says every obstacle is just an engineering problem waiting to be solved.\n\nTo Unsworth, Musk’s submarine was completely impractical. When he was asked about it by a CNN reporter, he didn’t mince his words. ‘He can stick his submarine where he hurts,’ said Unsworth, a self-described ‘brash Northerner’.\n\nElon Musk is not someone to let an insult lie. In a series of tweets that he later deleted, Musk called Unsworth a ‘paedo guy’. A few days later, Musk apologised. But then he posted another tweet, implying that the reason Unsworth hadn’t sued him yet was because the allegation was true.\n\nIn August, 2018, Musk emailed Ryan Mac, a reporter at Buzzfeed News, claiming without evidence that Unsworth was a ‘child rapist’ who had moved to the south-east Asian country to take a child bride.\n\n‘He’s an old single white guy from England who’s been travelling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years,’ Musk wrote. ‘I fucking hope he sues me.’\n\nUnsworth did, in fact, go on to sue Musk in the US but lost the case after Musk’s lawyer portrayed his tweets as ‘a joke’.\n\nUnsworth didn’t know it at the time, but Musk had been fed ‘information’ on Unsworth by a private investigator called James Howard Higgins. A British man who said he’d worked for tycoon George Soros, Howard Higgins had been engaged by Musk’s right-hand man, Jared Birchall, a few weeks before. Emails between Howard Higgins and Birchall show how Howard Higgins was prepared to go to almost any lengths to get the information Musk wanted.\n\nHe promised to go through Unsworth’s bins, to put him under 24/7 surveillance, to infiltrate his partner’s Facebook account and to pose as a charity worker to get information. He even said he had inside information on Unsworth’s British legal team, including the name of the lawyer representing the caver.\n\nMark Stephens, Unsworth’s British lawyer, told me that these techniques, if they had been implemented, were ‘pretty obviously unlawful’. Musk is understood to deny any wrongdoing.\n\nJames Howard Higgins was, in fact, a fraudster. Almost every bit of information he passed back to Musk about Unsworth was false.\n\nFor instance, far from having spent decades in Thailand and marrying a ‘child bride’, Unsworth had first visited Thailand only in 2011 and met his partner, Tik, when she was in her 30s.\n\nIf Birchall or Musk had simply Googled Howard Higgins’s name before hiring him, they might have seen that he was jailed in 2016 for stealing from his own company.\n\nAt Unsworth’s defamation trial against the Tesla founder, Musk’s team portrayed Howard Higgins as a one-off – a fraudster who had scammed a billionaire. In fact, our investigation reveals that Musk tasked a second investigation firm to get information on Unsworth.\n\nIn August 2018, Orion Investigations emailed one of Unsworth’s friends, making ‘discreet’ inquiries about the caver. Orion’s representative assured the friend, incorrectly, that he was ‘working on behalf of Vernon’.\n\nIn fact, evidence suggests Orion’s ultimate client was Musk. Unsworth now wants answers. ‘Musk needs to reveal exactly what surveillance he used on me: which firms, and what methods,’ he says. ‘His defamation still hangs over me six years later.’ Musk, so far, has declined to comment.\n\nUnsworth was far from the only individual targeted by Musk, however. Several former Tesla employees also allege they witnessed surveillance. Karl Hansen, a former security executive at Tesla’s Nevada gigafactory, told me that he believed Musk’s team hacked into the phone of a Tesla employee called Martin Tripp, whom Tesla suspected of speaking to the press.\n\nEvidence filed by another security executive, Sean Gouthro, in a case brought by Tripp against Tesla appears to substantiate some of Mr Hansen’s account.\n\nGouthro says external private investigators followed Tripp ’24 hours a day’. In a video deposition, Gouthro says he witnessed what appeared to be Tripp’s emails and personal text messages being accessed in real time.\n\n‘There was a delay, but you could see the text messages coming in,’ he said. ‘Emails, notification bars popping up. The name of his wife was brought up. We saw pictures of his kids.’\n\nTesla strongly denies that any hacking or any illegal or disproportionate activity took place. The company has said Gouthro was let go for poor performance, including ‘repeated failure to demonstrate and understand best practices in the security industry.’\n\nBut perhaps the most unexpected accusation to emerge from my investigation concerns Amber Heard, Musk’s one-time partner.\n\nAccording to sources, Musk suspected Heard was cheating on him during a period in 2017 when she was filming the movie Aquaman on the Gold Coast in Australia.\n\nI’ve been told that Musk’s security team contacted a well-known Australian investigations firm, specialising in infidelity, who put Heard under surveillance for weeks, if not months, at a cost of more than AUS$100,000 (£51,000).\n\nAccording to my source, the investigation apparently spared no expense and involved infrared cameras and drones. If the operatives were ever caught, they were allegedly told to pretend they were paparazzi.\n\nDuring Heard’s stay on the Gold Coast, the city’s local newspaper received an anonymous tip that an Aussie Rules footballer was ‘spending many nights at Amber Heard’s house’ and ‘leaving early in the morning looking like the cat that swallowed the canary’. At the time, Heard’s address was not public knowledge.\n\nThe paper traced the message to SpaceX, one of Musk’s companies. When Sally Coates, one of its reporters, spoke to Musk on the phone, he accepted that someone close to him had sent the tip but claimed it was done without his knowledge. Heard and Musk both declined to comment.\n\nAlexi Mostrous is head of investigations at the media group Tortoise. Elon’s Spies ( is now available wherever you get your podcasts.

It's also a state with a law that prevents the early processing of mail-in ballots, which dragged out the state's count in 2020. The anticipated lag this year has election officials bracing for conspiracy theories, protests and violence.\"That window of time between the polls closing and races being called, I think, has shown to be a real vulnerability, where people seeking to undermine confidence in those results if they're going to lose have really exploited,\" Schmidt said. Pennsylvania's mail-in ballot processUnlike many other states, Pennsylvania can only begin processing mail-in ballots on the morning of Election Day. It took four days to call the election in Pennsylvania in 2020. As those days passed, leaving the 2020 election results hanging in the balance, all eyes were on the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. Police and protesters were outside while Schmidt and his fellow members of the Board of Elections oversaw the counting of a record 375,000 mail-in ballots, most of them from Democratic voters.\"When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020, counting those votes takes time,\" Schmidt said.At a ballot intake center in Chester County, elections administrator Karen Barsoum showed the two different envelopes each mail-in ballot arrives in.\"So, hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of the envelopes, which is a long process,\" Barsoum said. Then the ballot comes out and it needs to be unfolded and flattened out to remove creases. In all, it takes several minutes to process each mail-in ballot. Conspiracy theories take off Hours after the polls closed in 2020, then President Trump demanded the counting stop. Schmidt happened to be passing by a TV and heard Trump's speech.\"We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK?\" Trump said at the time.Schmidt brought together his communications team so they could reassure voters that the count would continue. Allegations of fraud spread as the mail-in ballots were counted.\"That's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots. And that's when you start hearing about, you know, zombie voters,\" Schmidt said. \"That's when all this other stuff really starts pouring in.\"At the end of Pennsylvania's days-long count, the state was called for Joe Biden and, with that, he won the White House. But Trump continues to say that he won Pennsylvania in both 2016 — when he won by about 44,000 votes — and in 2020, when he lost by about 80,000 votes. \"I understand that he's a sore loser,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said. \"I understand that he wished he would have won in 2020. But attacking this system made up of our neighbors from communities all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, is not the answer.\"Calls for reform, patience and faith In the wake of those four days in 2020, there were widespread calls to bring Pennsylvania in line with the majority of other states, where election workers get a head start on opening envelopes and flattening mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. \"Pennsylvania's unique in that we have a divided legislature. We have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate,\" Schmidt said. \"So getting anything done related to election reform has certainly been a challenge.\"He has urged people to be patient with Pennsylvania. \"Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes,\" Schmidt said. \"They're doing so as quickly as they can, and with integrity.\"In the leadup to Election Day, Schmidt is doing everything he can to take on the fears Trump continues to spread about Pennsylvania and to assure residents their votes will count.\"Elections in Pennsylvania have never been more safe and secure with a voter verified paper ballot record of every vote that's cast, whether you vote in person on Election Day or you vote by mail,\" Schmidt said.Shapiro appointed Schmidt, who previously worked for a decade on Philadelphia's Board of Elections, to the role of secretary of state last year. The governor was succinct when asked what Schmidt's marching orders were.\"Do your job,\" Shapiro said he told Schmidt. \"Make it so legal, eligible voters have access to the ballot box and that we again have a free and fair, safe and secure election.\"Schmidt is now visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties and meeting with voters. At a fair in deep red Columbia County, Schmidt spent more than 35 minutes trying to convince local Republicans that they can trust the voting system.\"Everything is on the line\"A recent poll found around a third of Americans – and nearly 70% of Republicans – still believe Biden didn't legitimately win the 2020 election. Trump has refused to commit to accepting the results if he loses in November. If that happens, it could cause violence in the state, Shapiro said. It could also mean election officials face threats from Trump supporters.\"Am I worried about that? Am I concerned about that? Of course I am,\" Shapiro said. Schmidt was threatened by Trump supporters after the 2020 vote when Trump called him out by name in a Twitter post. \"There were threats early on that were pretty generic in nature,\" Schmidt said. \"As days went on, they became a lot more specific.\"Those threatening him put out his address and graphically described what they would do to his family, Schmidt said. A picture of his home was shared and his children's names were listed repeatedly. Schmidt temporarily moved his family for their safety. There was round-the-clock security for months. Still, Schmidt is sticking with his job. \"Everything is on the line,\" he said. \"Our entire system of government, our country as it was founded, is on the line.\"","summary":"Voters in Pennsylvania will likely need to wait until after Election Day to find out which presidential candidate won the state's 19 electoral votes.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pennsylvania-election-mail-in-ballot-processing-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/10/842e2017-ba13-4514-adec-37077b8d5a79/thumbnail/1200x630/e4f76907f236b45487a46ba0031fc62f/pa-vote-article.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42effd073","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/10/13/2379935299740/3262672_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:00:26","author":"Aliza Chasan,Cecilia Vega","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Cecilia Vega"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":259560600,"title":"Pennsylvania's top election official fights misinformation in swing state","text":"Pennsylvania is the most pivotal battleground in the race for the White House. With its 19 electoral votes, it is the state where former President Trump and Vice President Harris are spending the most time and money - a combined $436 million between them and their allies. It's also where the results could take days to count, due to a state law that prevents mail in ballots from being processed early. The anticipated lag, which dragged out Pennsylvania's count in 2020, now has election officials bracing for a repeat of conspiracy theories and violence.At the helm - lifelong Republican Al Schmidt. He stood up to former President Trump and refused to join attempts to overturn his loss four years ago. As secretary of state, Schmidt is doing everything he can between now and election day to assure residents their votes will count - and to take on the lies Trump continues to spread about Pennsylvania.Cecilia Vega: What's the reality? Voter fraud is widespread? Voter fraud never happens?Al Schmidt: There is no evidence whatsoever that voter fraud takes place-- in any way that is widespread at all.Cecilia Vega: If a non-citizen tried to cast a ballot, would you be able to catch it?Al Schmidt: That's just not something that happens, because when it gets identified, there are severe consequences, whether it's prosecution and or deportation from the country.We met Secretary of State Al Schmidt last month in the state capitol in Harrisburg.Former President Donald Trump (during Indiana, PA rally on Sept. 23 2024): We have to win Pennsylvania…The night before, former President Trump held a rally just a few hours away where he stoked fears about voting in Pennsylvania.Former President Donald Trump (during Indiana, PA rally on Sept. 23 2024): Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45–- let's move– see these votes. We got about a million votes in there, let's move them. We're fixing…Cecilia Vega: Have you heard what the former president said last night at his rally here in Pennsylvania?Al Schmidt: No.Cecilia Vega: He seems to be saying that there is cheating going on with mail-in ballots here.Al Schmidt: There is not. Elections in Pennsylvania have never been more safe and secure with a voter verified paper ballot record of every vote that's cast, whether you vote in person on Election Day or you vote by mail.Schmidt once had his own doubts about election security.Before becoming secretary of state he spent a decade on Philadelphia's Board of Elections where he investigated hundreds of claims of voter fraud… and changed his mind.Al Schmidt: Whenever it has occurred, however rarely, it's to affect some very down ticket race that is decided by a handful of votes. It's not to decide who the president of the United States is, or who the governor is, or who a senator is, or anything else like that.As secretary of state, Schmidt is visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties…Part roadshow, part public relations tour spreading the gospel of election security…including a stop at a fair in deep red Columbia County.He spent more than 35 minutes trying to convince these local Republicans that they can trust the voting system.Al Schmidt: Like dead people voting in Philadelphia. You have a public record of when somebody died. You have a public record of when they cast their vote. Female Voice: They have found cases where-- quote, dead people have voted.Al Schmidt: The only cases that I've encountered are when a voter has cast their ballot by mail and then passed away in-between mailing in their vote and their vote being counted. And you can see that. Cecilia Vega: You know, former President Trump's got the rallies and he's got the microphone and he's got the audiences and he can spread his message to thousands, if not millions, of people, and you're here at the county fair and you've got a stand and you're doin' it one to three voters at the time.Al Schmidt: Yes, you're one-- one-at-a-timing it. So--Cecilia Vega: You-- you kinda can't compete.Al Schmidt: But it's also important to have that one-on-one contact, to go to-- a county fair-- to engage with people to answer their questions.Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro told us that choosing Al Schmidt, a lifelong Republican, as his first Cabinet pick last year, was intended to send a clear message.Cecilia Vega: Of all the cabinet appointments that you could have made first, why was it Al Schmidt?Gov. Josh Shapiro: I made a commitment during my campaign that I was going to appoint a pro-democracy secretary of state.Cecilia Vega: What were your marching orders to him?Gov. Josh Shapiro: Do your job. Make it so legal, eligible voters have access to the ballot box and that we again have a free and fair, safe and secure election.Cecilia Vega: When you think about secretaries of state, the role, you tend to think that it, respectfully, is a boring job (laugh), a mundane job, an administrative job. How's that workin' out for ya? Al Schmidt: (laugh) It is. I mean-- elections should be-- not something to dread. They should be something to celebrate. And voters should feel confident that if they cast their vote, whether it's by mail or in person on Election Day, that their vote is gonna be counted.Cecilia Vega: So in 2020, it took four days to call the election in Pennsylvania. What took so long?Al Schmidt: When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020-- counting those votes takes time.We saw for ourselves at a ballot intake center in Chester County outside Philadelphia.Karen Barsoum: So this is the actual envelope, and these where the ballots are returned-in…Cecilia Vega: And this is a sample?Karen Barsoum: Correct. Yes and-Elections Administrator Karen Barsoum showed us how each ballot arrives inside two different envelopes.Processing them is a tedious task, which under Pennsylvania law cannot start until 7 a.m. on Election Day.Karen Barsoum: So when we do open it, there is another envelope. So, hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of the envelopes, which is-- a long process and then the ballot comes out.Cecilia Vega: And you can't count it folded like that?Karen Barsoum: Correct we will need to have a whole different team (rustling) unfold them, (rustling) backfold them to get the creases out as good as we can.Cecilia Vega: How long does it take to process each ballot?Karen Barsoum: Several minutes. It's not-- it's not, like, done in a sec.Al Schmidt: That window of time between the polls closing and races being called I think has shown to be a real-- vulnerability, where people seeking to-- undermine confidence in those results if they're gonna lose-- have-- have-- really exploited.Cecilia Vega: Those four days allowed the big lie to take off.Al Schmidt: And that's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots. And that's when you start hearing about, you know, zombie voters. And that's when all this other stuff really starts pouring in.There have been widespread calls to bring Pennsylvania in line with the majority of other states - where election workers get a head start on opening envelopes and flattening ballots ahead of Election Day.Cecilia Vega: Why hasn't that changed? You've had four years, Pennsylvania.Al Schmidt: Pennsylvania's unique in that we have a divided legislature. We have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate. So getting anything done related to election reform is-- has certainly been a challenge.Cecilia Vega: The message is what? Be patient with Pennsylvania?Al Schmidt: The message is please be patient. Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes. They're doing so as quickly as they can, and with integrity.For Secretary Schmidt, getting out the message can mean late nights answering questions about the electoral process in granular detail.As we saw at this law school in Harrisburg.He's teamed up with fellow Republican, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett.Cecilia Vega: The former president has a refrain at his rallies. He says Democrats rigged the election in 2020 and he's not gonna let them get away with it this year.Tom Corbett: Evidence. Bring it. Any U.S. attorney, any district attorney. Bring the evidence and show them. Not what you want. You've got to convince a prosecutor and a court.Cecilia Vega: You've got polls that show some 34% of Americans, nearly 70% of Republicans who still, to this day, believe that Joe Biden didn't win the 2020 election.Tom Corbett: But I can't change that. Because they believe it. Because they've heard it too many times.Cecilia Vega: You've said there's a huge amount of people in the middle that can be influenced by the extremes. Is that who you're trying to educate?Tom Corbett: Yes. The extremes we're not gonna change. But right here, and in a close election that's very important.Former President Donald Trump (during NRA event in Harrisburg, PA on Feb. 9, 2024: We won Pennsylvania twice. We won it twice. We did much better the second time than we did the first time...Cecilia Vega: He continues to say that he won Pennsylvania twice.Gov. Josh Shapiro: Donald Trump won in 2016 by about 44,000 votes. And Donald Trump lost in 2020 by about 80,000 votes. I understand that he's a sore loser. I understand that he wished he would have won in 2020. But attacking this system made up of our neighbors from communities all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, is not the answer.Cecilia Vega: Former President Trump is refusing to commit to accepting the results if he loses. If he does refuse what happens here in Pennsylvania? What does that look like?Gov. Josh Shapiro: I think it can look unfortunately like what it looked like in 2020 with violence in our communities, --with threats to public officials, good public officials like Al Schmidt and the Republican and Democratic clerks of elections. Am I worried about that? Am I concerned about that? Of course I am.In 2020, as the presidential election hung in the balance - all eyes were on the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. Outside, police and protesters surrounded the building… while inside Al Schmidt oversaw the counting of a record 375,000 mail-in ballots… most of them from Democratic voters.Former President Donald Trump (on Nov. 4, 2020): We're winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of votes…Hours after the polls closed, then President Trump demanded the counting stop.Former President Donald Trump (on Nov. 4, 2020): We don't want them to find any ballots at four o'clock in the morning and add them to the list, okay?Al Schmidt: We were working day and night. There was one television that was working and I happened to be passing it when I heard that speech. So immediately brought together our communications team to begin-- through social media platforms, assuring the rest of the world whose eyes were on Pennsylvania that our vote counting was going to continue.Cecilia Vega: But at that point you've got the president of the United States saying, \"Stop the count.\" Did you ever feel like you had to stop the count?Al Schmidt: No, not for a second.After four days, the race in Pennsylvania was finally called for Joe Biden and with that - he won the White House.Former President Trump went after Al Schmidt by name on Twitter… and violent threats from Trump's supporters followed.Cecilia Vega: Do you remember the first threat that made you go, \"I gotta take this one seriously?\"Al Schmidt: There were-- threats early on that were pretty generic in nature. But-- as days went on they-- they became a lot more specific, providing my address-- graphic descriptions of, you know, what they would do-- to my family.Cecilia Vega: They used a picture of your house at one point, I understand. Listed your–Al Schmidt: Yes.Cecilia Vega: –children's names repeatedly.Al Schmidt: Correct.Cecilia Vega: You had to move your family out of your house for safety?Al Schmidt: Yes, they had to-- to relocate for a period. And we had-- security around the clock for many months.Cecilia Vega: Given all the threats that you faced personally, I've gotta ask why you would agree to take this job?Al Schmidt: Well, everything is on the line. Our entire system of government, our country as it was founded is on the line.Produced by Sarah Koch and Madeleine Carlisle. Broadcast associate, Katie Jahns.

In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3–46.5, a slight gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.2.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nLast Monday, Harris led by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). In the last week, Trump has gained in all these states in Silver’s aggregates, reducing Harris’ lead to about one point in these states.\n\nIf Harris wins these four states, she probably wins the Electoral College by at least a 276–262 margin. Trump leads by less than one point in Georgia and North Carolina, which both have 16 electoral votes.\n\nWhile Harris is still barely ahead in the Electoral College, her margins have been reduced in the states where she’s leading. As a result, Silver’s model now gives Harris a 52% chance to win the Electoral College, down from 56% last Monday. \n\nThis means the presidential election is effectively a 50–50 toss-up. There’s a 23% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. The FiveThirtyEight model\nis giving similar results to Silver’s model, with Harris a 53% favourite.\n\nThere’s still over three weeks until the election, and polls could change in that time. The polls could also be biased against either Trump or Harris, and in this case that candidate could win easily. With the polls across the swing states so close, either candidate could sweep all these states.\n\nI wrote about the US election for The Poll Bludger last Thursday, and also covered the UK Conservative leadership election, the far-right winning the most seats at the September 29 Austrian election and Japan’s October 27 election.\n\nFavourability ratings and economic data\n\nHarris’ net favourability peaked about two weeks ago at +1.4 in the FiveThirtyEight national poll aggregate, but it has now dropped back to net zero, with 46.8% favourable and 46.8% unfavourable. Harris’ net favourability had surged from about -16 after becoming the Democratic nominee, and she gained further ground after the September 10 debate with Trump.\n\nTrump’s net favourability has been steady in the last two months, and he’s now at -9.4, with 52.6% unfavourable and 43.2% favourable. Harris’ running mate Tim Walz is at +4.2 net favourable and Trump’s running mate JD Vance is at -9.6 net favourable. Biden’s net approval remains poor at -14.0.\n\nUS headline inflation rose 0.2% in September, the same increase as in August. In the 12 months to September, inflation was up 2.4%, the smallest increase since 2021. Core inflation increased 0.3% in September, the same as in August, and is up 3.3% in the 12 months to September.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) hourly earnings were up 0.2% in September after a 0.3% increase in August, while real weekly earnings slid 0.1% after a 0.6% increase in August owing to changes in hours worked. In the 12 months to September, real hourly earnings were up 1.5% and weekly earnings up 0.9%.\n\nCongressional elections\n\nI wrote about the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate that will be held concurrently with the presidential election three weeks ago. The House has 435 single-member seats that are apportioned to states on a population basis, while there are two senators for each of the 50 states.\n\nThe House only has a two-year term, so the last House election was at the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans won the House by 222–213 over Democrats. The FiveThirtyEight aggregate of polls of the national House race gives Democrats a 47.1–45.9 lead over Republicans, a gain for Republican from a 46.7–44.5 Democratic lead three weeks ago.\n\nSenators have six-year terms, with one-third up for election every two years. Democrats and aligned independents currently have a 51–49 Senate majority, but they are defending 23 of the 33 regular seats up, including seats in three states Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nWest Virginia is a certain Republican gain after the retirement of former Democratic (now independent) Senator Joe Manchin at this election. Republicans have taken a 5.4-point lead in Montana in the FiveThirtyEight poll aggregate, while Democrats are just 2.3 points ahead in Ohio.\n\nRepublicans are being challenged by independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska, and he trails Republican Deb Fischer by just 1.5 points. Democrats did not contest to avoid splitting the vote. In other Senate contests, the incumbent party is at least four points ahead.\n\nIf Republicans gain West Virginia and Montana, but lose Nebraska to Osborn, and no other seats change hands, Republicans would have a 50–49 lead in the Senate. If Harris wins the presidency, Osborn would be the decisive vote as a Senate tie can be broken by the vice president, who would be Walz. This is the rosiest plausible scenario for Democrats.\n\nAdrian Beaumont does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.","summary":"The US election will come down to the results in a handful of key states - and polling indicates it will be very close.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/kamala-harris-dips-in-key-states-making-us-election-contest-a-toss-up-279884.html","image":"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241216/count.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:00:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":259561386,"title":"“Terrifier 3” wins the clown showdown, debuts at No. 1, while “Joker: Folie à Deux ”suffers 81 percent drop","text":"The Clown Prince of Crime is no match for this weekend’s box office victor: Art the Clown.\n\n In a clown-versus-clown faceoff, Terrifier 3 has emerged victorious, leaving Joker: Folie à Deux in the dust. Scaring off its competition, the slasher about a demonic clown debuted to an estimated $18.3 at the domestic box office, per Comscore. This is a stellar beginning for the ultra-gory, independently-made film, which was produced on a budget of just $2 million. Abroad, the film picked up $4.8 million bringing its worldwide total to $23.1 million.\n\n The film’s success continues a trend for the franchise, which follows Art the Clown as he brutalizes a small town just in time for the holidays. Terrifier 2 became something of a box office miracle in 2022, grossing $1 million in its opening weekend on an even smaller budget of $250,000. \n\n Writer-director Damian Leone described the sequel's success to Entertainment Weekly as \"overwhelming,\" saying, \"Every morning I wake up, it's like Christmas morning. Since it hit theaters, the hype's been building, so it's really exciting.\"\n\n Leone added that the first film was over a decade in the making, ever since he first came up with the idea of Art, his surreal horror movie villain.\n\n \"I had this idea of a clown terrorizing a woman on a city bus,\" said the filmmaker. \"She's all alone, coming home from work or whatever, in the middle of the night, and then this clown gets on, and sits across from her, and starts staring at her and toying with her. It's awkward and uncomfortable, and maybe even funny, but then it gets progressively more intimidating and aggressive.”\n\n Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\n This weekend’s box office wasn’t all gore and chaos though: Dreamworks’ The Wild Robot is still charming audiences across the country, three weeks into its release. The lighthearted animated feature — which follows a shipwrecked robot who befriends the animals of a forest — raked in an additional $13.4 million towards its domestic total of $83.7 million. Finding even more success abroad, the film earned another $24 million for a worldwide total of $148.4 million.\n\n Featuring Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the titular bot, the film hails from Chris Sanders, the filmmaker behind Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon.\n\n Elsewhere, in less family-friendly news, another criminal clown has yet to recoup at the box office. After a disappointing debut, Joker: Folie à Deux has suffered an 81 percent drop at the domestic box office. Coming in at third place, the offbeat, genre-bending musical earned a measly $7 million domestically, during its second weekend in theaters, bringing its global total to $51.6 million ($165.3 million globally).\n\n The followup to Todd Phillips Oscar-winning smash hit Joker has been tepidly received by critics and audiences alike, as the numbers can attest, despite touting the combined star power of Lady Gaga and Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix. The sequel sees Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck confined to Arkham Asylum, where he forms an anarchic bond with Harley Quinn that leads to death and destruction across Gotham City.\n\n “After the first Joker, Joaquin and I were really sad. Like, really sad. We didn’t want it to end,” Phillips told EW of his reason for plotting a sequel. “Not only because we like working together, but because we didn’t want to leave Arthur. We loved Arthur and became attached to that character. Simply put, it was to spend more time with Arthur.\"\n\n Now six weeks into its run, Tim Burton's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is still clinging tightly to the top 5, dropping by just 30 percent from last weekend. An additional $7 million brings the film's domestic tally to $275 million ($420 million globally).\n\n The sequel to the 1988 classic sees Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, and Michael Keaton reprising their roles while welcoming Jenna Ortega as Astrid, the rebellious daughter of Ryder’s Lydia Deetz, who accidentally opens a portal to the Afterlife. As the title implies, the family is forced to call upon a certain trickster to save her before time runs out.\n\n Rounding out fifth is an unconventional biopic from Pharrell Williams. The artist and legendary music producer has opted to tell his life story via Legos, and thus far it seems theatergoers are intrigued: Piece by Piece debuted to $3.8 million domestically. Described as a “by-the-numbers — or rather, by-the-brick — biographical documentary,” in EW’s review, the film features talking heads as Pharrell traces his story from Virginia to the recording studio. Also appearing in Lego form are such artists as Neville, Jay-Z, Gwen Stefani, Snoop Dogg, and Justin Timberlake.\n\n Other new openings this week saw Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice tank at the box office with an estimated domestic pull of only $1.6 million. \"As a bomb-tossing cultural buzz film, it was probably always destined to be a tempest in a teapot,\" Variety's Owen Gleiberman wrote on Sunday. \"The Apprentice doesn't tell us anything we don't already know,\" Maureen Lee Lenker wrote in her EW review.\n\n Saturday Night, the account of Saturday Night Live's very first night on air told from behind the scenes, pulled an estimated $3.4 million domestically. SNL alum Dan Aykroyd, who is portrayed in the film, sang the film's praises on social media: \"What a propulsive, engaging, funny, beautifully cast and acted, suspenseful, adventurous, music-filled ride, A perfect window into the creative process at its highest level.\"","summary":"Audiences have crowned a new Clown Prince of Crime.","url":"https://ew.com/terrifier-3-debuts-no-1-while-joker-folie-a-deux-drops-81-percent-8727698","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/pJNs9MSe3IAevkUDYqk5wKDdTgI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Terrifier-3-101124-d2ada0d173fe4796a63b76a0c0d8b9c4.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/zl7NCsI9-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:59:24","author":"Shania Russell","authors":["Shania Russell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":259560172,"title":"JD Vance Makes Rare NASCAR Appearance at Charlotte Motor Speedway","text":"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance made a rare appearance at the highly anticipated Bank of America Roval 400 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.

Miller had allegedly tried to gain entry to the campaign event using a fake VIP ticket and press pass, with agents carrying out a search finding he was in possession of multiple firearms.\n\nIn a press conference this afternoon, local police providing an update on the arrest clarified that the incident took place on Saturday, and added the man has been since released on bail after being taken into custody. Speaking to the press, Riverside County sheriff Chad Bianco said Miller was arrested ahead of the former president's arrival in Coachella.\n\nHe said the department had a \"very detailed plan\" in place, with deputies monitoring larger outside and inside perimeters around the location of the event. Sheriff Bianco said his deputies became suspicious when Miller approached the perimeter.\n\nHe \"gave all the indications that he belonged there\" when he arrived, but the sheriff added that, when he arrived, there were \"many irregularities that popped up\", with officers noticing the \"interior of the vehicle was in disarray\" and that it \"had an obviously fake licence plate\". Bianco continued, saying the man was also in possession of multiple passports and driving licences.\n\nHe added that Miller was booked on charges of possessing loaded weapons and ammunition before former president Trump arrived. The sheriff's department is now working with the FBI and Secret Service - which is responsible for protecting former and current presidents and candidates - to establish further details about the incident.\n\nWhile taking questions, Mr Bianco - who had earlier said he believed his department had \"probably\" averted a potential third Trump assassination attempt - was asked whether he had reacted dramatically to the incident. In response, he suggested he had acted with \"common sense and reason\".\n\nHe said in response: \"If we are that politically lost that we have lost sight of common sense and reality and reason, that we can't say 'Holy crap, what did he show up with all that stuff for and loaded guns', and I'm going to be accused of being dramatic, we have a serious problem in this country because this is common sense and reason.\"","summary":"Sheriffs in Coachella, California, said they believe that the arrest of Vem Miller, from Las Vegas, could have foiled third assassination attempt on the former president","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/police-issue-major-update-after-33883878","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33883847.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAP_CHP_131024Vem_26991Vem.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:55:07","author":"Liam Doyle","authors":["Liam Doyle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.636},{"id":259560076,"title":"Elon Musk is accused of using private investigators to spy on Amber Heard with infrared cameras and drones when he suspected her of cheating... amid rumours about visits from footballer","text":"Last week, Elon Musk appeared at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania, jumping up and down and telling the crowd that the November vote was the 'most important election of our lifetime'.\n\nThe billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X/Twitter has become a key figure in US politics in recent months, as he throws his weight behind Trump in his quest to retake the presidency in November.\n\nMusk has long publicly styled himself as a free-speech absolutist, telling his 200million Twitter followers that free speech is the 'bedrock of democracy' and that anyone trying to silence another person is a 'liar'.\n\nBut my new podcast investigation called Elon's Spies reveals how Musk, or those working on his behalf, have used private investigators and surveillance tools to control information and suppress critics.\n\nAnd one of his prime targets has been Vernon Unsworth, the British cave explorer who helped rescue 12 children from a Thai cave in 2018.\n\nAt the time, the Tesla billionaire called Unsworth a 'paedo guy' on Twitter after the caver criticised his plans to help with the rescue.\n\n'It's the most disgusting thing that you can call anybody, really', says Unsworth.\n\nAlthough Musk eventually apologised, the baseless slur hangs over the financial consultant to this day.\n\n'I've not spoken to anyone in depth about Musk or the effect it had on me,' he says. 'I'll be tarred for the rest of my life. When I went to receive my MBE from the Queen back in June 2019, the headline next day was all about Musk. The stigma is always there.'\n\nExtraordinarily, Musk's surveillance targets are also understood to include Amber Heard, his former partner.\n\nIn 2017, when the couple were dating, Musk's security team is understood to have employed an Australian private investigations firm to monitor Heard's movements when she was filming Aquaman on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe surveillance is said to have been extensive and to have involved multiple operatives as well as infrared cameras and drones. Musk did not respond to requests for comment on this or other allegations. But more on that later.\n\nFor the Unsworth case is, in many ways, the most shocking.\n\nOn June 23, 2018, a group of 12 boys, aged 11-16, and their 25 -year-old soccer coach went to explore the Tham Luang cave system in northern Thailand. They didn't come out. Rising flood water after heavy rain had trapped them inside.\n\nUnsworth, 69, who lives between Thailand and the UK and who had explored the Tham Luang cave before, was one of the first on the scene. 'I arrived very early on the morning of the 24th,' he says. 'It all started from there.'\n\nSoon the cave's mouth was crowded with people trying to help, including a group of Thai Navy Seals.\n\nBut Unsworth knew the very people who could be key in effecting a rescue and passed a note to the Thai authorities with the names of 'the three people'.\n\nThe next day, British cave-divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, and British caver Robert Harper, arrived at the scene.\n\n'The four of us had between us over 150 years of caving experience,' Vernon remembers. 'The problem was that all the Navy Seal command saw was four old guys… dressed in scruffy T-shirts and shorts.'\n\nDespite their dress sense, the British cavers came up trumps. On July 2, Volanthen and Stanton found the boys alive, huddled together on a muddy slope about three miles into the cave system. But the biggest challenge remained: getting them out.\n\nAn audacious plan was put in place to anaesthetise the boys using ketamine, equip them with breathing apparatus and take them out while unconscious. It worked. By July 10, all the boys and their coach were rescued alive.\n\n'Obviously I was proud to be part of what happened,' Unsworth says. 'Because I don't think many people gave the boys much of a chance.' He's underselling it. According to the other divers, if it wasn't for him, the boys would be dead.\n\nIt was the happy ending everyone hoped for. Except that the story of the trapped boys didn't go unnoticed by Elon Musk.\n\nDays into the rescue attempt, he announced that he would build a 'tiny, kid-sized submarine' to bring the children out. It was a typically bold move by the swashbuckling billionaire. A consequence of a mindset that says every obstacle is just an engineering problem waiting to be solved.\n\nTo Unsworth, Musk's submarine was completely impractical. When he was asked about it by a CNN reporter, he didn't mince his words. 'He can stick his submarine where he hurts,' said Unsworth, a self-described 'brash Northerner'.\n\nElon Musk is not someone to let an insult lie. In a series of tweets that he later deleted, Musk called Unsworth a 'paedo guy'. A few days later, Musk apologised. But then he posted another tweet, implying that the reason Unsworth hadn't sued him yet was because the allegation was true.\n\nIn August, 2018, Musk emailed Ryan Mac, a reporter at Buzzfeed News, claiming without evidence that Unsworth was a 'child rapist' who had moved to the south-east Asian country to take a child bride.\n\n'He's an old single white guy from England who's been travelling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years,' Musk wrote. 'I fucking hope he sues me.'\n\nUnsworth did, in fact, go on to sue Musk in the US but lost the case after Musk's lawyer portrayed his tweets as 'a joke'.\n\nUnsworth didn't know it at the time, but Musk had been fed 'information' on Unsworth by a private investigator called James Howard Higgins. A British man who said he'd worked for tycoon George Soros, Howard Higgins had been engaged by Musk's right-hand man, Jared Birchall, a few weeks before. Emails between Howard Higgins and Birchall show how Howard Higgins was prepared to go to almost any lengths to get the information Musk wanted.\n\nHe promised to go through Unsworth's bins, to put him under 24/7 surveillance, to infiltrate his partner's Facebook account and to pose as a charity worker to get information. He even said he had inside information on Unsworth's British legal team, including the name of the lawyer representing the caver.\n\nMark Stephens, Unsworth's British lawyer, told me that these techniques, if they had been implemented, were 'pretty obviously unlawful'. Musk is understood to deny any wrongdoing.\n\nJames Howard Higgins was, in fact, a fraudster. Almost every bit of information he passed back to Musk about Unsworth was false.\n\nFor instance, far from having spent decades in Thailand and marrying a 'child bride', Unsworth had first visited Thailand only in 2011 and met his partner, Tik, when she was in her 30s.\n\nIf Birchall or Musk had simply Googled Howard Higgins's name before hiring him, they might have seen that he was jailed in 2016 for stealing from his own company.\n\nAt Unsworth's defamation trial against the Tesla founder, Musk's team portrayed Howard Higgins as a one-off - a fraudster who had scammed a billionaire. In fact, our investigation reveals that Musk tasked a second investigation firm to get information on Unsworth.\n\nIn August 2018, Orion Investigations emailed one of Unsworth's friends, making 'discreet' inquiries about the caver. Orion's representative assured the friend, incorrectly, that he was 'working on behalf of Vernon'.\n\nIn fact, evidence suggests Orion's ultimate client was Musk. Unsworth now wants answers. 'Musk needs to reveal exactly what surveillance he used on me: which firms, and what methods,' he says. 'His defamation still hangs over me six years later.' Musk, so far, has declined to comment.\n\nUnsworth was far from the only individual targeted by Musk, however. Several former Tesla employees also allege they witnessed surveillance. Karl Hansen, a former security executive at Tesla's Nevada gigafactory, told me that he believed Musk's team hacked into the phone of a Tesla employee called Martin Tripp, whom Tesla suspected of speaking to the press.\n\nEvidence filed by another security executive, Sean Gouthro, in a case brought by Tripp against Tesla appears to substantiate some of Mr Hansen's account.\n\nGouthro says external private investigators followed Tripp '24 hours a day'. In a video deposition, Gouthro says he witnessed what appeared to be Tripp's emails and personal text messages being accessed in real time.\n\n'There was a delay, but you could see the text messages coming in,' he said. 'Emails, notification bars popping up. The name of his wife was brought up. We saw pictures of his kids.'\n\nTesla strongly denies that any hacking or any illegal or disproportionate activity took place. The company has said Gouthro was let go for poor performance, including 'repeated failure to demonstrate and understand best practices in the security industry.'\n\nBut perhaps the most unexpected accusation to emerge from my investigation concerns Amber Heard, Musk's one-time partner.\n\nAccording to sources, Musk suspected Heard was cheating on him during a period in 2017 when she was filming the movie Aquaman on the Gold Coast in Australia.\n\nI've been told that Musk's security team contacted a well-known Australian investigations firm, specialising in infidelity, who put Heard under surveillance for weeks, if not months, at a cost of more than AUS$100,000 (£51,000).\n\nAccording to my source, the investigation apparently spared no expense and involved infrared cameras and drones. If the operatives were ever caught, they were allegedly told to pretend they were paparazzi.\n\nDuring Heard's stay on the Gold Coast, the city's local newspaper received an anonymous tip that an Aussie Rules footballer was 'spending many nights at Amber Heard's house' and 'leaving early in the morning looking like the cat that swallowed the canary'. At the time, Heard's address was not public knowledge.\n\nThe paper traced the message to SpaceX, one of Musk's companies. When Sally Coates, one of its reporters, spoke to Musk on the phone, he accepted that someone close to him had sent the tip but claimed it was done without his knowledge. Heard and Musk both declined to comment.\n\nAlexi Mostrous is head of investigations at the media group Tortoise.

Since Hamas’s October 7 attack last year on Israel triggered a wave of regional hostilities between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants, officials in Tehran have warned the Islamic republic could change its nuclear doctrine if it faced an existential threat. But they have been deliberately vague about what that might entail.\n\nSanaei-Rad, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, told the Financial Times : ‘Nuclear facilities have their own protocols that both parties must consider during wartime. Any potential response from Iran would undoubtedly reflect on this and have an impact, just as attacks on oil and gas facilities could affect regional energy security and global energy prices,’ he said, hinting that Iran could retaliate by targeting Israel’s nuclear facilities.\n\nIn the past weeks, Israel’s military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group’s setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.\n\nBeth Sanner, a former US deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is ‘higher now than it has been’ and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. ‘They can’t get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,’ said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.\n\nIran threatening to change its nuclear weapons doctrine in the event of an Israeli revenge strike against its key facilities comes after Biden officials in the US said they still believe Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran’s leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.\n\n‘We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,’ said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain US opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion.\n\nHis remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. US officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran’s nuclear weapons program might only delay the country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran’s resolve to do so. ‘We’re all watching this space very carefully,’ the Biden administration official said. Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt comes after Tehran has secretly threatened to strike America’s oil-rich allies in the Middle East if their territory or airspace is used for an Israeli attack on Iran. Israeli officials are pushing for damaging strikes on nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure after Tehran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this month. But Iran has now warned that it will respond with ‘devastating hits’ on Israel’s civilian infrastructure and against any Arab states that helped facilitate the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIran has reportedly threatened several countries hosting American troops, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These states told the Biden Administration that they do not want the US or Israel to use their military infrastructure or airspace in offensive operations against Iran, the officials added. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, close to the 90 per cent of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.\n\nThe expansion in Iran’s enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to ‘a week or a little more,’ according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran’s attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the US military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran’s nuclear program as an existential threat.\n\nThe conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, saying: ‘That’s the thing you wanna hit, right?’ Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. ‘The Iranians have to recalculate what’s next. I don’t think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,’ he said. ‘They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.’\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He traveled from South Carolina to D.C. for then-President Donald Trump’s speech and then made his way toward the Capitol.\n\nHe climbed the stairs and entered the building through the northwest Senate Wing door shortly before 2:30 p.m., prosecutors said. He then entered an office where he recorded a video of himself “saying, ‘Well we in this b— now. What now? This is our house,’ upon entering the office, and ‘Where you at, Nancy?’ upon leaving the office.\n\nAfter that, Norwood went to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office with a group of people. He swiped a coaster with the words “U.S. Congress” and the Congressional seal on it, per prosecutors. Norwood then walked through the Rotunda and toward the East Rotunda doors which were closed and being guarded by at least three Capitol police officers, prosecutors wrote.\n\n“Norwood yelled at officers to open the doors, but the officers repeatedly told Norwood and the others that the doors would not be opened. Norwood knew that the officers were attempting to keep the doors closed, yet he continued to push on the doors with his arms,” prosecutors said.\n\nWith the help of several people, Norwood pushed the doors open, allowing “hundreds of rioters” outside to enter the Capitol. Norwood decided to make another video of himself in front of a line of cops.\n\n“Oh these a——-, trying to push us out. . . . Should we take our house back? Our house. Y’all are a bunch of p——. It’s about to go down bro.” Norwood then points the camera to himself and says, “It’s about to go down. Cause I’m gonna go … attack these m—– f—— later. No f—— around, no no.”\n\nAfter leaving the Capitol, he allegedly took a U.S. Capitol Police helmet and plate carrier. As Law&Crime previously reported, it was Norwood’s relatives who informed on him.\n\nTen days after the deadly events at the Capitol, a relative referred to only as “J.D.” told the FBI that another relative, “T.D.,” had a brother (Norwood) who “claimed to have assaulted federal officers.” on Jan. 6th.\n\nFBI agents met J.D. to get more of the story. J.D. said that he or she was at dinner with T.D. when he or she learned the information.\n\nThe next day, agents met with T.D.; T.D. gave them Norwood’s phone number and copies of text messages from Norwood which prosecutors cited in court papers.\n\n“I’m dressing in all black. I’ll look just like ANTIFA,” Norwood is alleged to have texted a small group on Jan. 5th, one day before the Capitol siege. “I’ll get away with anything,” he then added.\n\n“It worked,” he said on Jan. 7th. “I got away with things that others were shot or arrested for.”\n\n“I tested a theory. I was right. I saw ANTIFA being bussed in and escorted by the police,” he dubiously claimed. “Trump has announced he [w]ill leave in a peaceful way on Jan. 20th. It[‘]s not right on so many levels[] that this fraudulent election could not be investigated to the fullest.”\n\n“The cop shot a female Trump supporter[], [t]hen allowed ‘ANTIFA Trump Supporters’ to assault him. I was one of them,” Norwood texted the group on Jan. 7th in an apparent reference to the killing of Ashli Babbitt. “I was there. I took his shit.”\n\nImmediately following that message is an image prosecutors believe shows Norwood wearing a police vest under his own coat.\n\n“He deserved worse,” Norwood is alleged to have continued. “His life was not threatened.”\n\n“Y’all are wild,” T.D. replied.\n\n“I fought 4 cops[;] they did nothing,” Norwood then said. “When I put my red hat on, they pepper balled me.”\n\n“No[,] not wild[;] we can sniff BS when we see it,” someone named Angela added to the thread.\n\n“They were ordered to allow Antifa to get away with anything,” Norwood then claimed.\n\n“I got a nice helmet and body armor off a cop for God’s sake and I disarmed him,” Norwood went on to muse. “Tell me how that works.”\n\nT.D., who shared the messages with the FBI, then jumped in again.\n\n“Robbie [the defendant] literally bragged about pretending to be this mysterious Antifa y[‘]all go on and on about, and then you say no REAL [A]ntifa did this,” T.D. said.\n\nSome of his reply text is cut off in the available photos.\n\n“He thought I was ANTIFA,” Norwood said with apparent reference to an officer.\n\n“Listen to yourselves,” T.D. said.\n\nNorwood then shared a screen shot of a message which purported that Antifa operatives were going from Portland to D.C. and were planning “to wear camouflage, cut-offs, and Trump paraphernalia to blend in, but turning their MAGA hats backward for identification.”\n\n“You admitted to going and being something you’re accusing other people of being,” T.D. said. “And then got mad and blamed others for the same thing you did. What the actual fuck is wrong with you?”\n\nNorwood attempted to claim the high moral ground.\n\n“I saved several cops from being killed by Antifa,” Norwood said. “I defended them after they assaulted me. They were scared for there [sic] lives.”\n\nT.D. then issued a few lines to mock Norwood.\n\n“The one cop who deserved it, got it,” Norwood replied.\n\n“Unbelievable,” T.D. said.\n\n“I’m anti shitty cop,” Norwood said, per the texts referenced in federal court documents. “The cops who acted shitty got exactly what they deserved. The ones who were cool, got help.”\n\nNorwood decided to speak to the FBI on Jan. 22. In what agents describe as a noncustodial interview, Norwood admitted traveling to D.C. with his wife to attend Trump’s rally, then admitted going to the U.S. Capitol. There, he became separated from his wife in the crowd.\n\n“[H]e was close enough to law enforcement to be sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant,” charging documents say.\n\nDespite that, Norwood “then admitted to entering the U.S. Capitol, including, at one point, the Capitol Rotunda.”\n\nThe defendant then claimed a Capitol Police officer told him, “I’m in your side.”\n\nNorwood said the crowd prevented him from leaving. He also “claimed to have helped protect multiple officers from being assaulted, including by forming a human chain to protect certain officers.”\n\nHe then claimed he left the capitol building and that an “unknown person took a police vest from a pile of police equipment that was lying on the ground outside the west side of the Capitol building and put it on” him. He said he took a helmet from the pile, put it on, and reunited with his wife.\n\n“N[orwood]’s description of how he acquired the vest and helmet is consistent with U.S. Capitol Police officers’ accounts of how their equipment was stolen by rioters on January 6, 2021,” the FBI agent said.\n\nNorwood told the FBI that he stayed with “an older couple from Ohio, who invited them to stay in their hotel room at the Hampton Inn for the night.”\n\nHe could provide no further details about the hotel room, but he claimed he ditched the police gear inside when he split town.\n\nNorwood also denied to the feds that he had assaulted any law enforcement officers. Rather, he said his statements in the aforementioned text messages were merely uttered so he would “sound tough.”\n\n“N[orwood] repeatedly claimed that he only attempted to help law enforcement, not hurt them,” the charging documents say.\n\nNorwood turned photos of himself at the Jan. 6 events over to the FBI.\n\nAgents also recovered surveillance video which purports to show him inside the Capitol complex.\n\nA judge will sentence Norwood on Feb. 21, 2025.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn the left side, there is a photo of William Robert Norwood&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Person at Capitol riot who wore Antifa attire admits guilt first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/person-at-capitol-riot-who-wore-antifa-attire-admits-guilt/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Capitol-rioter-who-dressed-like-Antifa-pleads-guilty.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:50:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.503},{"id":259560836,"title":"Biden unveils $612 million in post-hurricane aid on Florida trip","text":"“This funding will not only restore power, but will make the region’s power system stronger and more capable and reduce the frequency and duration of power outages while extreme weather events become more frequent,” Biden said Sunday during a stop in St. Pete Beach.\n\nBiden said Friday that the damage from Milton alone could be around $50 billion based on early assessments.

In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3–46.5, a slight gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.2.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nLast Monday, Harris led by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). In the last week, Trump has gained in all these states in Silver’s aggregates, reducing Harris’ lead to about one point in these states.\n\nIf Harris wins these four states, she probably wins the Electoral College by at least a 276–262 margin. Trump leads by less than one point in Georgia and North Carolina, which both have 16 electoral votes.\n\nWhile Harris is still barely ahead in the Electoral College, her margins have been reduced in the states where she’s leading. As a result, Silver’s model now gives Harris a 52% chance to win the Electoral College, down from 56% last Monday. \n\nThis means the presidential election is effectively a 50–50 toss-up. There’s a 23% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. The FiveThirtyEight model\nis giving similar results to Silver’s model, with Harris a 53% favourite.\n\nThere’s still over three weeks until the election, and polls could change in that time. The polls could also be biased against either Trump or Harris, and in this case that candidate could win easily. With the polls across the swing states so close, either candidate could sweep all these states.\n\nI wrote about the US election for The Poll Bludger last Thursday, and also covered the UK Conservative leadership election, the far-right winning the most seats at the September 29 Austrian election and Japan’s October 27 election.\n\nFavourability ratings and economic data\n\nHarris’ net favourability peaked about two weeks ago at +1.4 in the FiveThirtyEight national poll aggregate, but it has now dropped back to net zero, with 46.8% favourable and 46.8% unfavourable. Harris’ net favourability had surged from about -16 after becoming the Democratic nominee, and she gained further ground after the September 10 debate with Trump.\n\nTrump’s net favourability has been steady in the last two months, and he’s now at -9.4, with 52.6% unfavourable and 43.2% favourable. Harris’ running mate Tim Walz is at +4.2 net favourable and Trump’s running mate JD Vance is at -9.6 net favourable. Biden’s net approval remains poor at -14.0.\n\nUS headline inflation rose 0.2% in September, the same increase as in August. In the 12 months to September, inflation was up 2.4%, the smallest increase since 2021. Core inflation increased 0.3% in September, the same as in August, and is up 3.3% in the 12 months to September.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) hourly earnings were up 0.2% in September after a 0.3% increase in August, while real weekly earnings slid 0.1% after a 0.6% increase in August owing to changes in hours worked. In the 12 months to September, real hourly earnings were up 1.5% and weekly earnings up 0.9%.\n\nCongressional elections\n\nI wrote about the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate that will be held concurrently with the presidential election three weeks ago. The House has 435 single-member seats that are apportioned to states on a population basis, while there are two senators for each of the 50 states.\n\nThe House only has a two-year term, so the last House election was at the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans won the House by 222–213 over Democrats. The FiveThirtyEight aggregate of polls of the national House race gives Democrats a 47.1–45.9 lead over Republicans, a gain for Republican from a 46.7–44.5 Democratic lead three weeks ago.\n\nSenators have six-year terms, with one-third up for election every two years. Democrats and aligned independents currently have a 51–49 Senate majority, but they are defending 23 of the 33 regular seats up, including seats in three states Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nWest Virginia is a certain Republican gain after the retirement of former Democratic (now independent) Senator Joe Manchin at this election. Republicans have taken a 5.4-point lead in Montana in the FiveThirtyEight poll aggregate, while Democrats are just 2.3 points ahead in Ohio.\n\nRepublicans are being challenged by independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska, and he trails Republican Deb Fischer by just 1.5 points. Democrats did not contest to avoid splitting the vote. In other Senate contests, the incumbent party is at least four points ahead.\n\nIf Republicans gain West Virginia and Montana, but lose Nebraska to Osborn, and no other seats change hands, Republicans would have a 50–49 lead in the Senate. If Harris wins the presidency, Osborn would be the decisive vote as a Senate tie can be broken by the vice president, who would be Walz. This is the rosiest plausible scenario for Democrats.","summary":"The US election will come down to the results in a handful of key states - and polling indicates it will be very close.","url":"https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-dips-in-key-states-making-us-election-contest-a-toss-up-241216","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/625395/original/file-20241013-21-4j3qu4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=11%2C0%2C7708%2C3854&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:43:36","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":259560090,"title":"Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna dies in Russian detention, Kyiv says","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories\n\n BREAKING | \n\n Israeli airstrike kills at least 20 people including children at a school in central Gaza\n\n An Israeli airstrike has killed at least 20 people including children at a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza, according to local hospitals.\n\n Thousands of miles from home, Trudeau learns of dissension in his caucus\n\n The free trade agreement with ASEAN is expected to be signed at the end of 2025.

Adam Schiff was the impeachment manager on Trump’s first impeachment and is likely to become California’s next senator. Trump called Schiff “a total sleazebag” and “Adam shifty Schiff” during the Bartiromo interview. On Saturday, Trump held a rally in Coachella, California, where Schiff responded to Trump’s bashing of him and California.\n\n“Yet another nonsensical rant about me filled with tired insults, lies about voting booths, and more, this time in my home state of California,” Schiff said in a post on X during Trump’s rally. “Seriously, Donald. Why are you so obsessed with me?”\n\nIn the interview, Trump also revealed new information on other topics, such as how if he is elected president, he plans to give Elon Musk a “cost-cutting” position. Trump said it would not be a Cabinet position — “he doesn’t want to be in the Cabinet, he wants to be in charge of cost-cutting” — and that it is a job Musk is “dying to do.”\n\n“He’s a great guy. He’s given us a really powerful endorsement,” Trump said about Musk, who he noted was campaigning for him in Pennsylvania during the interview. “He’s actually campaigning because he says if we don’t win, we’re not going to have a country.”\n\nTrump also said he was aware of conspiracy theories that the coronavirus was manufactured to help push him out of office, but did not believe them. \n\n“A lot of people said they did the Covid thing because they wanted to see if they could get this guy out of office. I don’t believe that, I think it was just incompetence,” Trump said. “I think somebody came out of the Wuhan lab, had lunch with his girlfriend, she caught it and died.”\n\nAs for the next three weeks to the election, Trump said he is confident in his position in the polls in the swing states. He also added that he thinks the border is now a bigger issue than the economy.\n\n“We’ve been led by a man who’s in great decline, and now we have a woman who’s worse than he is. And we have to win the election,” Trump said later in the interview. “November 5th is going to be the most important day in the history of our country.”","summary":"His suggestion would represent an unprecedented encroachment on the democratic process.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/13/trump-military-election-day-00183565","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a80137d/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F1c%2F20%2Fd704aed14db6a13042e2b24eec29%2Felection-2024-trump-41467.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:31:36","author":"Mia McCarthy","authors":["Mia McCarthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"eu","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":259559090,"title":"Trump hears at a Latino campaign event from someone who lived in the US illegally","text":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Minutes after Donald Trump delivered his standard warnings about drug dealers and criminals illegally crossing the border during a Saturday campaign event, the former president heard from someone who was once in the country illegally but now plans to vote for him.\n\nElias Trujillo was one of several people who spoke Saturday at a Latino roundtable in Las Vegas intended to spotlight Trump’s economic ideas. After Trump finished addressing a small crowd inside the warehouse of a women’s cosmetics company, members of the roundtable spoke. Trujillo began by telling his personal story, how his mother brought him and his brothers from northern Mexico to Utah in 1995 to rejoin their father, who was working in construction.\n\n“We came here legally, but you know, we overstayed, and we were able to make life here in the United States,” Trujillo said, referring to the action of entering the U.S. on a legal visa but not departing when that visa expires.\n\nAt least one person in the audience began laughing and applauding, leading Trujillo to laugh and acknowledge, “It is funny.” Trump smiled as he looked at Trujillo.\n\nThe moment highlighted the contradictory ways the facts and rhetoric of immigration play in the campaign. \n\nThe paradoxes are sharper as Trump has simultaneously counted on increased support from Latinos returning him to the White House even as he has centered his campaign on a dark view of immigration.\n\nTrump has said migrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, called the recent influx across the southern border an “invasion” and pledged to launch mass deportations if he returns to the White House.\n\nThe day before his Las Vegas roundtable, Trump was in Aurora, Colorado, darkly warning that a Venezuelan gang is terrorizing a city of 400,000 that has become a magnet for migrants from that country. The city’s Republican mayor said Trump is distorting an isolated problem in the city.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump launched his usual criticisms of border policy before pivoting to general praises of the demographic he was courting.\n\n“Hispanic people — they say you can’t generalize, but I think you can — they have wonderful entrepreneurship and they have — oh, do you have such energy. Just ease up a little bit, OK? Ease up,” Trump said. “You have great ambition, you have great energy, very smart, and you really do, like natural entrepreneurs.”\n\nAfter the Las Vegas event, Trump headed to Coachella, California, and accused Harris of having “imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World.” There is no evidence to support Trump’s claims.\n\nTrump has usually smoothed over any apparent conflict between his warnings on immigration and his support from Latino voters since 2016, when he kicked off his first run by warning of “rapists” crossing the southern border. Many Hispanic voters entered the country legally — or have roots in the U.S. going back generations — and oppose illegal immigration.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee has argued his economic and immigration policies would help Latinos and other minorities, often suggesting contrary to economic data that immigrants are taking what he calls “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs.” Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is “one of the most important issues” during this election season, according to a recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Opinion Research poll.\n\nOverall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent. Trujillo said during his speech that he was initially wary of Trump but has grown to support the former president.\n\nTrujillo described how his lack of legal status made him feel uncertain about what he could accomplish, but how he “had to make the best of my life.” He said he graduated from high school, got married and had two children, now 12 and 5.\n\nHe opened a restaurant that he said is struggling due to the high cost of labor and goods, and said he was hopeful Trump would usher in better economic times.\n\n“I’m happy with the opportunity that Trump has again to run and hopefully get us back on track,” Trujillo said. “I think there’s room to make America greater.”\n\nAfterward, Trujillo said in an interview that though his parents overstayed their visas, they achieved legal status. Likewise, Trujillo has been a U.S. citizen since 2011.\n\nHe said he has come to understand Trump’s vocal opposition to those entering the country illegally due to concerns about drug and sex trafficking.\n\nBut, unprompted, Trujillo said he supports a way for people in the country illegally to obtain legal status, specifically people who have been working and following the law.\n\n“I mean, not an easy pathway, perhaps,” he said. “But there should be a pathway for the ones that are already here illegally, but who have created a life.”\n\nThat proposal has been a hallmark of immigration reform policies for decades. Labeled as “amnesty” by immigration hardliners, opposition to letting people who lived in the country illegally become citizens is part of what led to Trump’s political rise.\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.","summary":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Minutes after Donald Trump delivered his standard warnings about drug dealers and criminals illegally crossing the border during a Saturday campaign event, the former president heard from someone who was once in the country illegally...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-hears-at-a-latino-campaign-event-from-someone-who-lived-in-the-us-illegally-279882.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:30:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.017},{"id":259560826,"title":"Coalition seizes Newspoll lead, but other polls have Labor improving","text":"A national Newspoll, conducted October 7–11 from a sample of 1,258, gave the Coalition a 51–49 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the previous Newspoll, three weeks ago. After three 50–50 ties in a row, this is the first time this term the Coalition has led in Newspoll.\n\nPrimary votes were 38% Coalition (steady), 31% Labor (steady), 12% Greens (down one), 7% One Nation (up one) and 12% for all Others (steady). By 2022 election preference flows, these primary votes would normally give a 50–50 tie, so rounding probably contributed to the Coalition’s lead.\n\nAnthony Albanese’s net approval slumped six points to -14, his worst this term in Newspoll, with 54% dissatisfied and 40% satisfied. Peter Dutton’s net approval improved one point to -14. Albanese led Dutton as better PM by 45–37 (46–37 previously).\n\nThe graph below shows Albanese’s Newspoll net approval ratings this term. The data points are marked with plus signs and a smoothed line has been fitted. Albanese’s net approval has been below -10 in two of the last three Newspolls, causing the trend line to turn down.\n\nOther federal polls last week had improvements for Labor, and Essential and Resolve last week both suggest the Middle East conflict has had virtually no impact on Australian party support. It’s possible this Newspoll is a pro-Coalition outlier.\n\nLabor’s primary improves in Resolve poll\n\nA national Resolve poll for Nine newspapers, conducted October 1–5 from a sample of 1,606, gave the Coalition 38% of the primary vote (up one since September), Labor 30% (up two), the Greens 12% (down one), One Nation 5% (down one), independents 12% (steady) and others 3% (down one).\n\nResolve doesn’t usually give a two-party estimate, but applying 2022 preference flows to the primary votes would give Labor about a 51–49 lead, unchanged from September.\n\nAlbanese’s net approval was unchanged at -18, with 53% giving him a poor rating and 35% a good rating. Dutton’s net approval improved one point to -1. Albanese led Dutton by 38–35 as preferred PM, a slight increase from 35–34 in September.\n\nThe Liberals led Labor by 38–26 on economic management (37–26 in September). On keeping the cost of living low, the Liberals led by 31–24 (32–25 previously).\n\nBy 58–29, respondents said they would struggle to afford an expense of a few thousand dollars (57–31 in May). This is the highest “struggle to afford” since Resolve started tracking this question in February 2023, but Labor can take some comfort from the little change since May.\n\nAsked who was most responsible for rising living costs, 36% selected the federal government, 13% global factors, 13% businesses, 12% the Reserve Bank and 8% state and territory governments. Labor incumbent Jim Chalmers led the Liberals’ Angus Taylor as preferred treasurer by 24–18.\n\nIf Australians could vote in the US presidential election, Kamala Harris would lead Donald Trump by 52–21 (50–25 in September). Before Joe Biden’s withdrawal in July, he led Trump by just 26–22 with Australians with 31% for “someone else”. Harris’ net likeability is +24, Trump’s is -47 and Biden’s is -25.\n\nLabor gains lead in Essential poll\n\nA national Essential poll, conducted October 2–6 from a sample of 1,139, gave Labor a 49–47 lead including undecided (48–47 to the Coalition in late September). Primary votes were 34% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (up three), 12% Greens (steady), 8% One Nation (steady), 1% UAP (down one), 9% for all Others (steady) and 5% undecided (steady).\n\nOn Israel’s military action, 32% said Israel should permanently withdraw from Gaza (down seven since August), 19% said Israel is justified (up two), 18% said Israel should agree to a temporary ceasefire (down three) and 32% were unsure (up eight). \n\nOn the Australian government’s response, 56% were satisfied (up five since August), 30% thought the government too supportive of Israel (down two) and 14% too harsh on Israel (down two).\n\nBy 40–27, voters would support a road user tax for electric vehicle drivers. Just 2% thought the gap between the rich and poor was decreasing, 71% thought it was increasing and 27% staying the same. On Australia’s political system, 48% thought it needs reform but is fundamentally sound, 40% said it needs fundamental change and just 12% said it’s working well.\n\nMorgan poll tied\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted September 30 to October 6 from a sample of 1,697, had a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for Labor since the September 23–29 poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 37.5% Coalition (down 0.5), 31.5% Labor (up 1.5), 12.5% Greens (down one), 5.5% One Nation (up one), 9% independents (down 0.5) and 4% others (down 0.5).\n\nThe headline figure uses respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by 52–48, a 0.5-point gain for Labor.\n\nACT election and NSW byelections this Saturday\n\nThe ACT uses the Hare Clark proportional method with five five-member electorates to elect its 25-member parliament, so a quota for election is one-sixth of the vote or 16.7%. The ACT is easily Australia’s most left-wing jurisdiction, and Labor has governed since 2001, often in coalition with the Greens. In 2020, Labor won ten seats, the Liberals nine and the Greens six.\n\nThere will also be three NSW state byelections this Saturday in the Liberal-held seats of Epping, Hornsby and Pittwater. Labor won’t be contesting any of these byelections. In Pittwater, Liberal Rory Amon defeated independent Jacqui Scruby by 50.7–49.3 at the 2023 state election. Amon resigned after being charged with child sex offences and Scruby will contest the byelection.\n\nNSW and Victorian state polls\n\nA NSW state Resolve poll for The Sydney Morning Herald, conducted with the federal September and October Resolve polls from a sample of 1,111, gave the Coalition 37% of the primary vote (down one since August), Labor 32% (up two), the Greens 11% (down one), independents 14% (steady) and others 6% (steady).\n\nThe Poll Bludger said the primary votes suggested a “slight two-party advantage to Labor”. Labor incumbent Chris Minns led the Liberals’ Mark Speakman as preferred premier by 37–14 (38–13 in August).\n\nBy 61–23, voters thought the NSW government is not doing enough to help renters. By 53–19, they thought the government should put aside money towards future metro rail projects.\n\nA Victorian state Redbridge poll, conducted September 26 to October 3 from a sample of 1,516, gave the Coalition a 51–49 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since a late July Redbridge poll. Primary votes were 40% Coalition (steady), 30% Labor (down one), 12% Greens (steady) and 18% for all Others (up one).","summary":"The latest Newspoll has bad news for the Labor government, but it is out of step with other recent polls.","url":"https://theconversation.com/coalition-seizes-newspoll-lead-but-other-polls-have-labor-improving-240785","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/625393/original/file-20241013-16-2gc3cd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=21%2C75%2C7106%2C3553&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:29:55","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":259558374,"title":"JD Vance Doubles Down Defending Donald Trump's False FEMA Claims","text":"On Sunday, Ohio Senator JD Vance doubled down on defending his running mate former President Donald Trump's false claims about the federal response to Hurricane Helene.After Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane late last month, leaving a trail of destruction along the southeastern United States, Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, began spreading falsehoods about recovery efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).While appearing on ABC News' This Week on Sunday morning, the network's chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz confronted Vance about the claims.\"During Hurricane Helene, as we heard, former President Trump suggested the federal government was not only sending FEMA aid meant for the hurricane to migrants but 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' Do you think that is true?\" she asked.During a campaign rally in Michigan on October 3, Trump said that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, \"spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country.\"The former president also wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform, on September 30 that he didn't \"like the reports that I'm getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,\" referring to North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.In response, FEMA had to make a webpage dedicated to debunking the false claims. On its webpage, the agency writes, \"No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.\"The agency also wrote that it \"provides assistance to survivors regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, English proficiency or economic status.\"In response to Raddatz's question, Vance said, \"What the [former] president said is that fundamentally FEMA aid is distracted by going to illegal migrants...we've got Republican congressmen who are on the ground who represent that area, saying that they have to call the White House to get food and water to [sic] FEMA.\"He added: \"I don't frankly think there's anything malicious going on here Martha, but I do think that we've had an incompetent response to this particular crisis, particularly in Western North Carolina, which to be fair was hit harder than a lot of us expected it...\"Raddatz later interjected and said, \"I want to go back to what former President Trump said. He said, they're 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' There is no truth to that.\"She added: \"Pentagon officials say that active duty troops were staged and ready to go before being called upon and were instantly out the door. So former President Trump is saying things that aren't true about that money being withheld from Republican areas.\"\"I think you're actually confusing staging of resources from the rapid response of the U.S. military,\" Vance responded. \"And I think all the [former] president has said is frankly, what some of Kamala Harris' surrogates have said, which is that if these areas were a little bit more Democratic, maybe Kamala Harris would have focused on them more. That acknowledgment is not to attack, frankly, the good folks of FEMA, it's to suggest that Americans are feeling left behind by their government, which they are Martha...\"Newsweek reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaigns as well as Vance's office via email for comment late Sunday afternoon.Last Monday Harris criticized Trump to reporters for pushing \"disinformation\" about \"what is available, in particular to the survivors of Helene\" from FEMA.\"It's extraordinarily irresponsible. It's about him; it's not about you,\" Harris said. \"And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go.\"Hurricane Helene has caused over 250 deaths across the Southeast, with 123 deaths in North Carolina, according to Fox Weather. Meanwhile, the American Red Cross has received over 9,000 reunification requests from people searching for their loved ones, according to The Washington Post.","summary":"After Hurricane Helene left a trail of destruction along the southeastern United States, Trump spread falsehoods about recovery efforts by FEMA.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-doubles-down-trump-fema-claims-1968282","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494267/vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:21:55","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":259558068,"title":"Gunman arrested near rally after allegedly attempting to assassinate Donald Trump","text":"DONALD Trump was targeted in a third assassination attempt with a gunman saying he wanted to “kill the president”, sheriffs said.\n\nA resident of Las Vegas, Vem Miller, aged 49, was apprehended by law enforcement officials near Saturday’s event in Coachella, California, without any issues.\n\nThe Riverside County Sheriff’s Department suspects that Miller had intentions to harm Trump.

I was actually very nervous, mostly because I’ve never played a real person before,” Bakalova told Collider. “I knew that Sebastian [Stan] and Jeremy [Strong] have both played real people before, and they did a great job. I just wanted to be on their level. I wanted to not disappoint them. I was trying my best to listen to as many recordings of her, watch as many videos of her, and know as much about her story as possible so I could deliver what they deserve.”\n\nDonald’s first wife from 1977 to 1990, Ivana was the mother of his children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, and she served as president and CEO of Trump’s Castle casino resort. Ivana died at age 73 when she fell down the stairs in her Manhattan home in 2022.\n\n“I honestly didn’t know a lot about her,” admitted Bakalova. “I knew that she’d been a model. I knew that she had a fashion line, an interior design line — any kind of a line that had her name. And I knew that she was the first wife of Donald Trump, the former president of America, but nothing apart from that. I knew that she was from somewhere around my region of the world, but not that she’s been competitive, not that she’s been a hard-working woman, not that she built both of their lives in a lot of ways because she’s been the brain behind everything in the beginning.”\n\nShe continued, “I found myself really fascinated by her achievements and the fact that she’s been so outspoken. It’s still challenging to demand your position and your equality, even though we’re living in 2024. That’s been happening since the ’70s, [her] standing up for herself and demanding to be treated equally, to be his equal — not just a trophy wife sitting at home, but work hand-in-hand with him. It’s been a really remarkable achievement.”\n\nWritten by Gabe Sherman, The Apprentice charts a young Donald Trump’s (Stan) ascent to power through a Faustian deal with the influential right-wing lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn (Strong). The movie also stars Martin Donovan as Fred Trump Sr.\n\n“It’s such a great film. I honestly think it’s a great film,” said Bakalova. “The relationship between these two people, I get a sense of why, for example, Ivana and Roy have hated each other so much. Because it’s like competition for the same guy in a way. It’s like a relationship. It’s like a throuple. You have one human being at home, and you have another one that you’re dealing with as a work relationship, a semi-work relationship. But still, it is a relationship. It’s like three people in this relationship.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor her first nonfiction role, Maria Bakalova had quite the undertaking.

He is a professor at Columbia University and a former chief economist at the World Bank.\nStiglitz spoke to the Post about the US-China trade war, the economic ramifications of next month’s presidential election in the United States and the future of globalisation. This interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nThe US Federal Reserve announced a half a percentage point rate cut last month, the first in more than four years. What is your view of the US’ economic situation right now and what do Fed rate cuts mean for the US economy and the world?\nI thought that the Fed increased interest rates too far and too fast, because it made a fundamental error of judgment that the inflation we were experiencing was due to excess demand but, in fact, it was a result of the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. I thought that the higher interest rates might actually worsen the problems, not improve them.\nSo, for instance, if we have supply side interruptions, you want to make investments to alleviate them, and the higher interest rates make those investments more difficult. A significant contributor to inflation has been the price of housing, and raising interest rates exacerbates the shortage of housing. So it was exactly the wrong medicine. It was a medicine that hurt the economy. So I am very pleased that they’re lowering interest rates, and I think it will be good for the economy.\nI think the US economy has been very robust. The data says it’s slowing, so the rate cut was a little late. I think they have made a double mistake in that sense, because I didn’t think they should have increased it as much or as fast. I think their rates should have been lower, and we will pay a price for their mistake. I don’t think it’s going to be too high of a price, it’s just that I think they should have cut it earlier.\nLet’s talk about the impact of the US presidential election. What are the respective prospects for the US economy when either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins the November election?\nI think it’s unambiguous that Harris will be much, much better for the economy than Trump. I think Trump’s policy will result in higher inflation and a weaker GDP and more inequality and poorer health. Just to go over them very quickly, the higher inflation is going to be a result of his extremely high increases in the tariffs on China, which particularly hurt ordinary Americans with increased prices of apparel and appliances and so forth.\nHarris may increase the tariffs, but it will be much more moderate. [Trump’s] threat to reduce or eliminate the independence of the Fed will create more uncertainty, which will weaken the economy. The higher inflation will result in the Fed raising interest rates wrongly, but they will do it anyway … and that will weaken the economy. The tax cuts for the rich, if he gets them, won’t stimulate the economy much, but will create more inequality. And of course, if he has his way, he’ll eliminate Obamacare, which will worsen the health status of ordinary Americans. So in every dimension, he’s a danger to our economy.\nWhat will the outcome of the US presidential election mean for trade and economic ties with China?\nI think, quite frankly, both [candidates] are pushing for weaker economic ties, but I think the difference is that Harris will be de-risking, making the US less dependent on China, and in particular making the West, more generally, less dependent on China in certain areas of technology.\nWhereas Trump has a mistaken zero-sum view of the world, and he has no sense of the capacity of economies to adjust. So raising tariffs very rapidly will be a major distortion to the economy, a major disturbance to the economy, both in China and the US, but more in the US, which we will have a hard time adjusting. Tariffs of 10 per cent is one thing, 50 or 60 per cent is another.\n\nApart from China, how do you see the outcome of the election playing out when it comes to the US’ economic ties and cooperation with other countries?\nThe Harris administration will believe in multilateralism, and will be engaged very strongly with promoting good relations with most economies around the world. Not with Russia, obviously, and we’ve already talked about China, but with most other countries a Harris administration will be working very hard to improve relations. There’s often a tension in a country like the US, where money has such an influence in our political system, so that special interests prevail over the national interest. So, for instance, the US has not, I think, pushed for global policies with respect to intellectual property or multinational taxation that would be supported by most countries in the world. So that is going to be a problem. It has been a problem in the Biden administration.\nSome people argue that the Biden administration turned out to be not so different from the Trump one when it came to policies on China. What is your view?\nWell, I think the distinction, as I said before, is that the US wants de-risking and the current administration does not see the world in the same zero-sum way. But it has been, you might say, equally strong, aggressive, in certain areas where they have contended that China has unfairly subsidised, areas which are of particular importance, like electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.\nThere is a big debate in the US. There are two arguments going on. One is the allegation that China’s advantage in EVs and solar panels is because of government subsidies. Many people believe that is not true. The advantage China has in EVs is a result of a process that began 25 years ago of moving in that direction, the larger EV market in China, and the commitment of so much more resources. So it is not that it has been subsidised, but that there has just been more momentum in China.\nThe second is that even if China subsidised solar panels, the need for a green transition is more important than the need to create solar panel jobs, and that we should accept a gift from China of cheap solar panels, because it is very important for the rapid green transition. So my own view is very much that we need to have the capacity to produce both EVs and solar panels, but that the imperative of making a green transition rapidly means that we should not exclude cheap EVs and solar panels from our market, and we should find other ways of developing our capacity.\nWhat I think is, we really are behind in addressing climate change, and so it is really important to use every cheap thing we can, including cheap EVs and cheap solar panels, to make the green transition. But we have to also have our capacity. That is the point of de-risking. We have to have our production capacity.\nSo my view would be, we accept the cheap goods from China and subsidise, if necessary, the production of solar panels and EVs to develop the capacity ourselves. Maybe China will continue being the cheapest producer. We will just have to develop our own capacities, in case something happens.\n\nThe US-China trade war has entered its seventh year. Did you expect it to last this long when it started in 2018?\nWhen it started, I thought of it as mostly a Trump phenomenon, but to be frank, I did hear rumblings from the national security people and bipartisan concerns about excessive exposure to China and that we needed to de-risk. So I think I did [expect it to last]. And one more thing. Trump politicised relations with China in a way that would make it difficult for a Democratic administration to alter the course too much.\nWhat I mean is, you never know the direction of politics, but Trump has, I think, falsely sold the notion that America’s political economic problems were due to China. There was evidence that the rapid increase of imports from China after the accession of China to the [World Trade Organization] did have a very negative effect on the American economy. There is evidence that those places in the country where there was a surge of imports have lower wages, more unemployment and lower property values. So that view is pretty well established now.\nThe question is, do you blame China, or do you blame the US government for not having provided education and help for adjustment to that? We said globalisation was good, but rapid globalisation was a shock. And we didn’t help the people who were hurt by the shock to adjust. It is always much easier to blame others than to accept your responsibility for not having done what you could have done to help adjust to the changing global economic situation.\nWhile the trade war has certainly lasted beyond Trump and does not have a clear end in sight, what do you expect down the road?\nI have three strategic concerns. If we were engaged in a new cold war, including a strategic trade war, I am disappointed that we have not managed our global policies better.\nThe first is we imposed restrictions on sales to China, for instance, of the very nano chips, the most advanced semiconductors. That only motivated China to work faster to develop its own capacity. So I think we were a little bit myopic in not understanding that that was actually helping China. We had a short-term advantage. But by imposing those sanctions, we are actually encouraging China to develop its own capacity faster.\nThe second thing is, we passed a very important bill, the Chips and Science Act in 2022.\nBut at least from my discussions with several people in the industry, and at least in Europe, their view is that as big as that bill was, it was not going to really be able to develop America’s capacity to make chips on its own, at least to the extent necessary for adequate de-risking. So it is naive thinking that we could, in this way, very rapidly increase our own competence in this area.\nAnd the third is if you were waging a new cold war, I would have put more emphasis on winning the hearts and minds of those in the rest of the world, in the emerging markets and developing countries. And I think what we have done there has been a disaster. Just to name a few issues: vaccine apartheid, the position that we have taken in multinational taxation and many arenas where we’ve not been as helpful in the debt crisis. So I think overall, we have failed to win the hearts and minds of the people in the Third World. And you see that in some of the votes at the United Nations.\nThe US government has said these tariffs will benefit and protect the US economy, do you share that view?\nI think I would say it has benefited, but I think we paid a cost, a price, for it. But I think we made a mistake, beginning in 1980 with then-president Ronald Reagan, in weakening our industrial capacity too far, and [the tariffs] are beginning to restore our industrial capacity.\n\nEconomic protectionism appears to have re-emerged around the world. A recent example would be Canada announcing the imposition of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese EVs on August 26. What do you think the impact of this trend has been, and do you see an end to it?\nI think yes, there will be an end to it. I think we’re not going to go to autarky. I think [economic protectionism] has remained very selective so far. I think we may wind up moving towards more regional trade groups, and also political trade groups.\nI could easily see a weakening of trade between China and the West, but a strengthening of trade between the West and other countries in the emerging markets.\nThat is what you would expect, because part of the basis of trade is differences in costs, like the cost of labour. And still with the US, we will want to import goods produced where labour is less expensive.\nBut one of the things that the data has showed so far is that it seems as if China is exporting a lot of goods to countries in Southeast Asia, and those countries are exporting them to the US. So there is indeed a change in the overall patterns of trade, but I am not sure that there is a significant reduction in overall trade, so that we’re not moving into autarky, with every country on its own.\nYou mentioned there will be a rise in regional and political trade groups. Can you give some examples of how you’ve seen this already happening?\nI think this is true. I have not looked at the data that closely, but for example, there has been an increase in trade between the US and Mexico. And I think if China manages its politics correctly, there could be an increase in trade within Asia.\nOne of the problems is that, for a reason that I don’t fully understand, China has been very aggressive in the South China Sea, and that of course is alienating, is a source of concern, for all the countries in the region, and that may be counterproductive for China’s economic relations with those countries. So for very little benefit in security, China seems to be risking its very deep economic integration with the countries in the region. I don’t understand why they are doing it.\nGlobal supply chains appear to be undergoing a shift, with countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico seemingly becoming increasingly attractive manufacturing hubs in comparison to China. What has been the impact of this?\nI have not studied that closely enough to really make a judgment now, but one of the important things I would emphasise here is that the pandemic showed that our supply chains were not very resilient, and so there is going to be a lot of re-examination of our supply chains in order to make sure that they’re more resilient. And that means, to some extent, having our supply chains closer to home, but also a move away from just-in-time for inventory [management] and other practices that made our supply chains insufficiently resilient.\nHas the world come to the end of globalisation?\nSome people describe the era before 2008 as the era of “hyper-globalisation”. I think that era is over. And actually, in some of the financial flows, you see a decrease, even beginning with the global financial crisis of 2008. I think Trump and the new cold war have accelerated that. But as I said before, it’s not the end of the era of globalisation. It’s the end of “hyper-globalisation”, and it is a restructuring of the patterns of globalisation.\nWhat keeps me up at night, really, is the war in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression\n\nWith trade relations changing, do you think there is hope that economic protectionism can be overcome and will countries be able to find ways to cooperate again?\nI think there will be lots of cooperation, as I mentioned before, in regional groups and politically aligned groups. I think tensions will remain, but I hope that there will be a lot of cooperation in many areas as well. We need to cooperate on the area of climate change. And so the need for cooperation on climate change may itself motivate more cooperation in trade.\nOne thing I could imagine is countries signing on to narrower trade agreements, like green trade agreements. So the next rounds of trade discussion probably may not be of the comprehensive kind, and it has been 30 years since we’ve had a successful comprehensive trade negotiation. It will be more towards a particular sector, and green is the sector that I am the most optimistic about.\nI think the political reality is that the old regime didn’t work out well for a lot of people. It worked out very well for some people, but for many people it did not work out well. And we have to accept where we are and figure out how to work best within the current reality.\nWhat is the thing about the global economy that keeps you up at night?\nWhat keeps me up at night, really, is the war in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression, its attempt to annex an independent country, and what would happen if it were successful to the international rule of law and democracy.\nIf Russia were to prevail – and I worry that if Trump were to win, he might force a settlement that would be a victory, even if only a partial one, for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin – that would undermine the international rule of law, democracy, and would only lead to more problems down the line. So that is one issue that keeps me up, and I think it has a very big implication for the whole era of globalisation.\nI think if that dispute saw Putin defeated and that China was no longer seen as supporting Putin, that would be a big help for the global economy.","summary":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump likely to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, Nobel laureate says, but former president threatens ‘every dimension’ of US economy.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3282186/economist-joseph-stiglitz-china-us-trade-war-and-death-hyper-globalisation","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/13/88742554-a09e-49b2-b5eb-c502790adad8_607af4d1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:00:23","author":"Kinling Lo","authors":["Kinling Lo"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":259557972,"title":"Larson dominates at The Roval to lead all 4 Hendrick cars into next round of NASCAR playoffs","text":"CONCORD, N.C.

He beat longtime rival and title contender Christopher Bell by 1.511 seconds.\n\n“It was good to have a little bit of a stress-free weekend,” Larson said.\n\nIt was Larson’s second victory of the playoffs, but he’s the first championship-eligible driver to win in the round of 12. The elimination race cut the field from 12 drivers to eight, and those knocked out of title contention were the Team Penske drivers of Joey Logano and Austin Cindric, Daniel Suarez of Trackhouse Racing and Chase Briscoe of Stewart-Haas Racing.\n\nAll four Hendrick drivers — Larson, William Byron, Alex Bowman and Chase Elliott — advanced into the round of eight. Joining them for the next three-race series are reigning Cup champion Ryan Blaney of Penske, Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Denny Hamlin and Christopher Bell in Toyotas, and Tyler Reddick, the regular-season champion who squeezed through in a Toyota for 23XI Racing.\n\nThere is only one Ford driver still eligible for the Cup title in Blaney.\n\nReddick won the first stage but was involved in a spin with Austin Dillon in the second stage that dropped him to 37th in position and below the cutline. He had to scramble the rest of the race to finish 11th and preserve his spot in the playoffs.\n\nMichael Jordan, Hamlin’s business partner in ownership of 23XI Racing, embraced both Hamlin and Reddick on pit lane for advancing.\n\nLogano, meanwhile, finished eighth and was eliminated by four points from advancing to the next round. Two of three Penske cars being eliminated came a day after Team Penske won the IMSA sports car championship at Road Atlanta.\n\nFirst driver eliminated\n\nBriscoe was eliminated when he went to the garage with 66 laps remaining with mechanical damage that officially ended Stewart-Haas Racing’s shot at a championship. The team is scaling back from four cars to one next year without Tony Stewart as part of the ownership group and Briscoe will drive for Gibbs in 2025.\n\n“I wish we were racing for a championship still. It stings,” Briscoe said. “Not even really for myself, just all the employees at Stewart-Haas. They were all kind of living through the 14 car, and the environment we have had these last few weeks has been really exciting to be a part of.\n\n“I hate that it is coming to an end. I know what that means for Stewart-Haas not to be racing for a championship anymore. That was keeping a lot of people, honestly, in the building.”\n\nVance stops by NASCAR race\n\nThe race was attended by Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, who was accompanied by Donald Trump Jr. in both the pre-race driver meeting and on the starting grid. Former President Donald Trump attended the Coca-Cola 600 at the same track in May.\n\nTurtles changed\n\nNASCAR announced another course change ahead of the race Sunday race when Charlotte officials replaced the 4-inch “turtles” on the track with 2.25-inch curbing.\n\nThe smaller curbing should help lessen the impact Cup Series drivers feel when going over the speed bump with the car bottoming out when it lands.\n\nSome drivers complained Saturday after practice and qualifying that the impact after their car launched over the turtle was too hard, with Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch said they felt like they suffered a concussion when the car landed.\n\nNASCAR also sent out a reminder about track limits when it comes to penalties for cutting the chicane. NASCAR reiterated that cars must run the full course at all times and going straight at the chicane(s) may result in a stop-and-go penalty in an assigned location for the violation.\n\nNASCAR opens the third round of the playoffs Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where Kyle Larson is not only the defending race winner but also won in the spring.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing","summary":"CONCORD, N.C.

He was talking to men who we're talking about sitting on the sidelines.”\n\nWarnock may well be correct in his prediction; a CBS News national poll released on Sunday found that the percentage of Black voters who said they planned to vote Democratic on the presidential ticket this year matched the 2020 total percentage won by Joe Biden.\n\nBiden remains an enigma, too; while some polling had shown Harris behind her ex-running mate’s 2020 totals among Black men, the incumbent president’s age had already contributed to a falling-off of his support from Black voters from which Harris has already at least partially rebounded.\n\nPolling continues to show the race deadlocked at both the national level and in several swing states. The two candidates are separated by margins in the low single digits in more than a half dozen states, according to surveys.","summary":"Obama, nation’s first Black president, suggested Black men were uncomfortable supporting a woman for the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/barack-obama-black-voters-harris-trump-election-warnock-b2628594.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/13/22/warnock_cnn_oct2024.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WpKV6b9l-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-13 21:55:56","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":259557782,"title":"Cheney says Mike Johnson ‘knew’ Trump’s election fraud claims were false","text":"Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and is supporting her on the campaign trail, pointed to how Johnson has supported former President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of not legitimately losing the 2020 presidential election.

In the end, all were trounced by an ax-wielding clown.\n\n“Terrifier 3,” a gory, low-budget slasher from the small distributor Cineverse, topped the weekend box office with $18.3 million, according to estimates Sunday.\n\nThe film, a sequel to 2022’s “Terrifier 2” ($15 million worldwide in ticket sales), brings back the murderous Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) and lets him loose, under the guise of Santa, at a Christmas party.\n\nThat “Terrifier 3” could notably overperform expectations and leapfrog both major studios and awards hopefuls was only possible due to the disaster of “Joker: Folie à Deux.”\n\nAfter Todd Phillips’ “Joker” sequel, starring Phoenix and Lady Gaga, got off to a much-diminished start last weekend (and a “D” CinemaScore from audiences), the Warner Bros. release fell a staggering 81% in its second weekend, bringing in just $7.1 million.\n\nFor a superhero film, such a drop has little precedent. Disappointments like “The Marvels,” “The Flash” and “Shazam Fury of the Gods” all managed better second weekends.\n\nSuch a mass rejection by audiences and critics is particularly unusually for a follow-up to a massive hit like 2019’s “Joker.” That film, also from Phillips and Phoenix, grossed more than $1 billion worldwide against a $60 million budget.\n\nThe sequel was pricier, costing about $200 million to make. That means “Joker: Folie à Deux” is headed for certain box-office disaster. Globally, it’s collected $165.3 million in ticket sales.\n\n“This is an outlier of a weekend if ever there was one,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “If you had asked anyone a month ago or even a week ago: Would ‘Terrifier 3’ be the number one movie amongst all these major-studio films and awards contenders? To have a movie like this come along just shows you that the audience is the ultimate arbiter of what wins at the box office.”\n\nThe “Joker” slide allowed “The Wild Robot,” the acclaimed Universal Pictures and DreamWorks animated movie, to take second place in its third weekend with $13.4 million.\n\nStrong reviews for Chris Sanders’ adaptation of Peter Brown’s book have led the movie, with Lupita Nyong’o voicing the robot protagonist, to $83.7 million domestically and $148 million worldwide.\n\nThe young Donald Trump film “The Apprentice,” distributed by Briarcliff Entertainment in 1,740 theaters, opened in a distant 10th place, managing a paltry $1.6 million in ticket sales.\n\nWhile expectations weren’t much higher, audiences still showed little enthusiasm for an election-year origin story of the Republican nominee.\n\nIf headlines translated to ticket sales, Ali Abbasi’s film might have done better. “The Apprentice,” starring Sebastian Stan as Trump under the mentorship of Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), has been making news since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, up to its last-minute release just weeks before the election. The Trump campaign has called the movie “election interference by Hollywood elites.”\n\nAbbasi’s film, set in the 1970s and 1980s, tested moviegoer’s appetite for a political film in an election year. Major studios and specialty labels passed on acquiring it in part because of the question of whether a movie about Trump would turn off both liberal and conservative moviegoers, alike.\n\n“The Apprentice” will depend on continued awards conversation for Strong and Stan to make a significant mark in theaters before voters turn out at the polls.\n\nJason Reitman’s “Saturday Night” failed to ignite its nationwide expansion. The film, with an ensemble cast led by Gabriel LaBelle’s Lorne Michaels, collected $3.4 million from 2,288 locations.\n\nThe Sony Pictures release, about the backstage drama as the NBC sketch comedy show is about to air for the first time in 1975, will likely need to make more of an impact with audiences to carry it through awards season.\n\n“Piece by Piece,” a Pharrell Williams documentary-biopic hybrid animated in Lego form, had also been hoping to click better with moviegoers.\n\nThe acclaimed Focus Features release, directed by veteran documentarian Morgan Neville (“20 Feet From Stardom,” “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”), opened with $3.8 million from 1,865 theaters.\n\nBut the debut for “Piece By Piece,” while low for a Lego animated movie, was very high for a documentary. “Piece By Piece,” which had the weekend’s best CinemaScore, an “A” from audiences, could play well for weeks to come.\n\nThe film, which was modestly budgeted at $16 million, is also likely to end up the year’s highest grossing doc — if “Piece by Piece” can be called that.\n\n“We Live in Time,” the weepy drama starring Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield, had one of the year’s best per-theater averages in its five-screen opening.\n\nThe A24 release, which will expand nationwide next weekend, debuted with $255,911 and a $51,000 per-screen average.\n\nOutside of the success of Warner Bros.’ “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” (which pulled in $7.1 million in its six weekends of release despite recently launching on video-on-demand), Hollywood’s fall has struggled to get going.\n\nLow-budget horror, like “Terrifier 3,” continues to be one good bet in theaters, but this autumn has been mostly characterized by bombs like “Joker: Folie à Deux” and “Megalopolis.”\n\nThis time last year, Taylor Swift was giving the box office a massive lift with “The Eras Tour.” This weekend compared with the same time last year was down 45% according to Comscore.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

Vance continue to thrust the federal disaster response squarely into the presidential race.Asked on ABC Sunday talk show \"This Week\" whether Trump has been accurate in describing the federal response as incompetent, Vance said \"it's to suggest that Americans are feeling left behind by their government, which they are.\"Biden took an aerial tour of the devastation in Tampa Bay and nearby St. Petersburg, and received a briefing of storm response efforts.While he described the impact as \"cataclysmic\" in some neighborhoods, Biden said Florida was fortunate it was not worse.Recent polling shows Harris has so far failed to stanch the flow of Latinos from the Democratic fold toward Trump, even as he pushes his sharply anti-immigration message.Data from the latest New York Times/Siena College poll show Harris underperforming other recent Democratic nominees among likely Latino voters, currently earning just 56 percent of the demographic compared to Trump's 37 percent, a margin of 19 points.Biden's 2020 advantage among Latinos was 26 points, while Hillary Clinton's was 39 points in 2016.And while Harris has large advantages with women, particularly women of color, she is struggling to gain traction with Black male voters, a growing number of whom are leaning toward the brash Republican.Polling shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck, including in the seven swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the election.An NBC News national poll released Sunday shows a 48-48 percent tie. \"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted the survey with a Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Speaking at a rally in Greenville later on Sunday, Harris accused Trump of \"not being transparent with the voters,\" pointing to his refusal to release his medical records, or sit down for an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes news program. \"It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away?\" she said. \"Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?\"A Harris heavyweight surrogate, Democratic ex-president Bill Clinton, was also on the trail Sunday in battleground Georgia, where he spoke at Mount Zion Baptist Church, a historically Black congregation.Both candidates hold campaign events in the biggest swing state prize of all, Pennsylvania, on Monday.","summary":"Kamala Harris and rival Donald Trump are campaigning in battleground states Sunday seeking 11th-hour advantages in a deadlocked White House race, as new polling shows the vice president underperforming among some traditional Democratic voter demographics.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/harris-trump-seek-advantage-knife-edge-election-battle-3746574","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4553886/former-us-president-bill-clinton-speaks-morning-service-mount-zion-baptist-church-albany.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 21:36:14","author":"Michael Mathes, With Brendan Smialowski In Greenville, North Carolina","authors":["Michael Mathes, With Brendan Smialowski In Greenville, North Carolina"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":259557000,"title":"Armed Man Arrested at Security Checkpoint near Donald Trump’s Rally in Southern California","text":"COACHELLA, Calif. — A Nevada man with a shotgun, a loaded handgun and ammunition in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, authorities said Sunday.

candidate Donald Trump wants to bring back U.S. manufacturing and lower costs, relying on tariffs to boost U.S. coffers and exert pressure on other countries -- but the reality is less straightforward.\n\nAhead of November's election, economists warn his policies could raise consumer prices and shake up global trade -- with unclear benefits to U.S. production.\n\nThe pitch is for tariffs to add billions in revenue and take aim at countries like China which have been \"ripping us off,\" while pushing businesses to bring production back on U.S. shores.\n\n\"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world,\" Trump said in his September debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nHe told a rally in Michigan last week: \"Tariffs, to me, are the most beautiful word.\"\n\nThe former president has vowed a 10 percent to 20 percent across-the-board tariff on imports and a 60 percent rate on Chinese goods -- more recently threatening a 200 percent levy on automobiles made in Mexico.\n\nIt is U.S. businesses -- not foreign governments, as Trump often asserts -- that pay import taxes on overseas purchases when there are tariffs on such goods, and they can pass on the higher costs, which could add to inflation.\n\nAlongside his tariff plans, Trump wants to extend expiring tax cuts and lower corporate income tax further.\n\nBut proposed tariffs could counteract the benefits from his tax policy \"while falling short of offsetting the tax revenue losses,\" said the Tax Foundation think tank.\n\nU.S. inflation could rise 1.3 percentage points above baseline next year if Trump imposed a 10 percent universal tariff and other governments retaliate, said the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).\n\nSharp hikes on Chinese goods would also fuel inflation, the institute added.\n\nOthers, like Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics, estimates a Trump presidency could raise inflation by 0.6 percentage points at its peak.\n\nPreviously, businesses bore the brunt as imported components got more expensive, said Kyle Handley, professor at UC San Diego.\n\nBut he noted: \"If they do an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent to 20 percent, there's no way we're not going to see that on store shelves.\"\n\nAnd it is unlikely that manufacturing can return to the United States in short order.\n\n\"We haven't made TVs in the U.S. in decades,\" Handley said, adding that U.S. factories are not producing at the scale needed to satisfy consumption either.\n\nTrump claims earlier tariff hikes on China and others brought no inflation.\n\nBut Handley estimates the supply chain frictions exporters faced were equivalent to a two to four percent tariff hit -- and companies tell AFP they have had to pass on some costs.\n\nA 2019 paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that by end-2018, import tariffs were costing U.S. consumers and importers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax costs.\n\nTrump's tariff plans could also slash bilateral U.S.-China trade by 70 percent, redirecting or eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of exchanges, said Oxford Economics.\n\nU.S. trade volumes could be cut by 10 percent, becoming more centered on North American and other free trade agreement partners, the advisory firm added.\n\nWhile the added tariffs would raise some $500 billion in revenue annually, rerouted trade from China could slash this figure closer to $200 billion per year eventually, Yaros said.\n\nOther proposals like revoking a status that shields China from various U.S. levies -- \"permanent normal trade relations\" -- could also raise inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025, PIIE added.\n\nAlthough Trump wants a \"reciprocal trade act\" where \"countries that make us pay a tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States,\" Yaros believes this is less likely as it requires bipartisan Congressional support.\n\nTrump regularly promises to eliminate inflation, too -- a critical voter concern -- saying he would slash energy bills in half within a year.\n\nAnalysts expect that this refers to more deregulation in the domestic oil and gas sector.\n\nBut Yaros expressed skepticism that this would \"unleash significantly greater production\" given that it depends on major energy producers, who in turn have shareholders to answer to.\n\nWhile Trump wants to lower food costs by allowing less foreign agricultural products into the country, economists have noted that import barriers could trigger retaliation.\n\nThis could harm U.S. farmers who export significantly.","summary":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to bring back U.S. manufacturing

'SNL' for the first time since the last female presidential nominee","text":"Ariana Grande took the New York 30 Rock stage at “Saturday Night Live” for the third time as host and found herself in familiar circumstances. \n\n“The last time I hosted was in 2016, and we were right on the verge of electing our first female president,” the 31-year-old singer and actor said in her monologue. “So, I guess, second time’s the charm?\" \n\nGrande, who first hosted in 2014, was doing it for the first time without also serving as musical guest — a role that fell to Stevie Nicks — and promised not to sing, before breaking into a song. \n\nThe theme continued as she vowed during the tune not to do her signature impressions of Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani, before throwing out a bit of each. She would do a much longer version of Celine Dion in a sketch later in the show.\n\nGrande hosted in promotion of her movie musical “Wicked,” the “Wizard of Oz” prequel set to be released next month. \n\nShe said playing the good witch Glinda as she does in the film is the dream of every theater kid like her, after “losing their virginity.” \n\nGrande's episode comes amid a ratings spike for the sketch institution, likely brought on by its 50th season, and election season. Last month's season premiere brought in the most viewers since 2020. \n\nJust as in the first two episodes of the new season, Maya Rudolph played Vice President Kamala Harris in the night's cold open, leading a group of former cast members returning as guest stars, including Andy Samberg as Harris' husband Doug Emhoff and Dana Carvey as President Joe Biden. \n\nThey teamed up for an election edition of “The Family Feud,\" taking on team Trump. \n\nKenan Thompson, the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history who began in 2003, reprised his long-running role as “Feud” host Steve Harvey and asked Rudolph-as-Harris about her recent media blitz. \n\n“It’s been a hell of a week,\" she said. \"I went on Howard Stern to reach the horny cab drivers, I went on ‘The View’ for the horny moms, and I also went on the podcast ‘Call Her Daddy’ because I have a message for young women: You need to go to the ballot box if you want the government out of your ballot box.”\n\nCurrent cast member James Austin Johnson returned as Donald Trump, saying his opponent is \"going to be horrible at this game. She’s a very low IQ person. The whole world is laughing at her because they don’t respect her.”\n\nThe 76-year-old Nicks was the “SNL” musical guest for the first time in more than 40 years. She opened with her brand new single, “The Lighthouse,” but the look of the performance was classic Stevie, with an abundance of rings and scarves and the singer draped in black. For her second song, she reached back with “Edge of Seventeen” from 1981. \n\nMichael Keaton is set to host next week with musical guest Billie Eilish.
