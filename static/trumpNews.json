Emotions don't carry you very far.\n\n'In any complicated, high-stakes negotiation, you can get unexpected twists and turns, and you have to keep your cool during those situations.'\n\nCarney said he had not spoken to the president since his blow up, noting it was up to Trump to reach out and mend the relationship.\n\nThe 60-second ad, part of a $53.5 million commercial by Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulls from a radio address made by Reagan as he explained why he was placing tariffs on Japanese electronics. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute has said the late president is being taken out of context. \n\nFord said he would pull the ad after the weekend in an effort to smooth over tensions.\n\nBut on Monday, Trump doubled down on his fury, revealing he had no plans to meet with Carney any time soon.\n\n'I don't want to meet with him,' he said.\n\n'No, I'm not going to be meeting with them for a while. I'm very happy with the deal we have right now with Canada. We're going to let it ride.'\n\nTrump reacted furiously to the ad in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, initially signaling that trade negotiations would be halted. \n\n'The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,' he wrote. \n\n'They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts. TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.'\n\nBy Saturday, Trump said he would raise tariffs by 10 percent after the ad was seen by millions of Americans on channels such as Fox News, Fox Sports, NBC, CBS, CNBC, ESPN, ABC and local affiliates. \n\n'Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,' Trump wrote Saturday afternoon on Truth Social. \n\n'Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.'\n\nTrump also reiterated his theory that the Ontario government, led by Ford, ran the ad to illegally sway the opinions of the Supreme Court, which will decide next month if the Trump administration has the legal authority to implement sweeping global tariffs without the input of Congress. \n\nIn the ad, Reagan explains how tariffs can appear to be beneficial to Americans at first - but looks can be deceiving. \n\n'When someone says, \"Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,\" it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs,' the 40th president of the US says.\n\n'And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.' \n\nReagan then explains: 'High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.'\n\nIn response to the ad, Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said: 'The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks.' \n\nThe institute adds that it is 'reviewing its legal options in this matter' before linking people to the full address Reagan gave. \n\nFord hoped to broadcast the ad on major television networks so that Americans could see negative effects tariffs would have against them. \n\nHe claimed that the ad is 'not nasty' and 'very factual,' calling Reagan 'the best president [America] has ever seen, in my opinion.'\n\nFord has now created a mess for Carney, who leads Canada's left-leaning Liberal Party, Ford's Conservatives' biggest competition.\n\nCanada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. \n\nMore than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the US and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion US) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. \n\nMany Canadian products have been hit with a 35 percent tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50 percent. \n\nEnergy products have a lower rate of 10 percent, while the vast majority of goods are covered by the US-Canada-Mexico Agreement, and are exempt from tariffs. \n\nTrump's decision to suspend negotiations and increase tariffs sparked criticism from his opponents, including California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\n'The man child in the Oval got his feelings hurt, so he is punishing the American people with higher costs,' Newsom wrote on X alongside a screenshot of Trump's Truth Social post.","summary":"Trump canceled ongoing trade negotiations with Carney last week and hit Canada with an additional 10 percent tariff after he was upset by an advertisement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15232675/canada-mark-carney-trump-tariffs-trade-advert.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/28/00/103361355-0-image-a-137_1761610279034.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/24/4979193711068595045/1024x576_MP4_4979193711068595045.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:59:14","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.275},{"id":373189040,"title":"Hamas to return body of hostage as families of missing call for break in Gaza truce","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nRed Cross workers in Gaza City on October 27, 2025.

What a day, what a life - I love you M.\n'An enormous thank you to everyone who made the day so special.'\nThe images showed them emerging from the ceremony as confetti was thrown by their friends and family.\n\nGame Of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright has confirmed he is married after exchanging vows over the weekend \n\nOver the weekend he shared snaps from his intimate London ceremony as he wed his partner who he simply referred to as 'M'\n\nThe actor, 26, played Bran Stark in the HBO television series, which earned him a Young Artist Award nomination as Best Young Supporting Actor in a TV Series\nThey then took a red London bus to their reception to enjoy the evening with dinner and dancing.\nHis on-screen sister, Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), gushed in the comments: 'Congratulations Isaaaaaac!!!!!!'\nWhile John Bradley, (Samwell Tarly) added: 'Oh MATE!! Congratulations! ❤️' \nBack in 2019 when the series ended Isaac revealed he did not expect his character Bran to ascend to the Iron Throne in the divisive season finale. \nThe British actor told 9Honey he was nonetheless pleased that a 'disabled character' was crowned king.\nHaving joined the cast of Game of Thrones when he was 12, Isaac didn't have the 'slightest inkling' that the youngest living Stark would become King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men.\n'Nobody thought it was going to be Bran - least of all me! So I didn't even have a slight inkling,' he said. \nIsaac also spoke of his pride at Bran representing the disabled community on screen.\n\nHe penned in the caption of his snaps: 'The best person I have ever met, the best day of my life, the best friends and family we could ever ask for. What a day, what a life - I love you M'\n\nHis on-screen sister, Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), gushed in the comments: 'Congratulations Isaaaaaac!!!!!!'\n\nBack in 2019 when the series ended Isaac revealed he did not expect his character Bran to ascend to the Iron Throne in the divisive season finale\n'I think it's brilliant to have a disabled character win the whole game. What are the odds of that? There are dragons and all these other things going on and Bran comes out on top, it was really special,' he said.\nHe was particularly happy that his character went from 'Bran the Broken' to 'The Lord of the Six Kingdoms'.\n'In the very first episode, you think he's toast, he's dead,' he explained, referring to when Bran was pushed out a window by Jaime Lannister. \n'He goes from being this vulnerable character to the most powerful there is,' he added.\nIsaac revealed at the time that he liked the controversial ending, but acknowledged that it would have been impossible for the writers to please everybody. \n'I think the thing to remember is Game of Thrones isn't a superhero movie, it's not all going to be tied up in a neat bow when you find out everything about all these people, that's not how it works,' he said. \nHe has also previously said he thought he received a 'joke script' as he said he understood why die-hard fans were angry with the ending. \n\n Game Of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright admits he thought the final script was a JOKE as he lends sympathy to 'broken-hearted' fans \nHe told Entertainment Weekly: 'I genuinely thought it was a joke script and that show runners [David Benioff and D.B. Weiss] sent to everyone a script with their own character ends up on the Iron Throne. \"Yeah, good one guys... Oh s**t, it's actually real?\"\nHe also lent his sympathies to unhappy fans but he countered it would be 'so difficult' to wrap up the show without 'p***ing some people off'.\nIn the dramatic final shock twist, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne Jon Snow (Kit Harington) was exiled for stabbing his lover Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke).\nJon was handed the punishment to live out the rest of his days with the Night's Watch, take no wife and father no children for the murder of the Mad Queen. \nWhile the pack survived, the Stark family went their separate ways in an emotional sequence that broke fans hearts.\nBran was named king of the six kingdoms, Sansa (Sophie Turner) became Queen in the North while Arya (Maisie Williams) headed out to explore unknown territory. \nThrowing his support behind the HBO bosses, Isaac pointed out the ending wasn't 'predictable' and that was what the producers were hoping for. \n\nBran was named king of the six kingdoms, Sansa (Sophie Turner) became Queen in the North while Arya (Maisie Williams) headed out to explore unknown territory\nLondonHBOSophie TurnerGame of Thrones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGame of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright is married!

California, the most populous Democratic state, retaliated by targeting five Republican-held districts. Other states, both Republican and Democratic, have followed or threatened similar moves. D\n\nDespite Republicans winning a narrow three-seat House majority in 2024, the party is poised to gain more seats through redistricting, even if California's effort succeeds.\n\nHere is how the conflict is unfolding across the country:\n\n Governor Greg Abbott signed a new Republican-backed map into law on August 29 aimed at flipping five Democratic-held seats. More than 50 Democratic lawmakers had fled the state weeks earlier, temporarily preventing a vote on the map. The missing lawmakers returned after California Democrats announced a retaliatory redistricting effort.\n\nRepublicans already control 25 of Texas' 38 seats under a Republican-drawn map from 2021. Civil rights groups have sued Texas over the new map, arguing it illegally dilutes the power of minority voters.\n\nRepublican Governor Mike Kehoe signed a new map into law on September 28 that dismantled a Democratic-held seat based in Kansas City, giving his party the advantage in seven of the state's eight congressional seats. Opponents are attempting to force a voter referendum on the map, while several organizations have filed lawsuits challenging its legality.\n\nA quirk in state law requires the Republican-dominated legislature to pass a new map for 2026, because the previous one, drawn in 2021, was approved with no Democratic votes. Republicans already control 10 of the state's 15 seats and are likely to target at least two incumbent Democrats.\n\nThe state legislature's Republican majority approved a new map in October designed to flip a Democratic seat, which would give Republicans control of 11 of the state's 14 U.S. House seats despite its status as a closely divided swing state. Under state law, Democratic Governor Josh Stein had no say in the process.\n\nRepublican Governor Mike Braun has called for a special session starting on November 3 to consider redistricting, following a pressure campaign from the White House. Republicans already control seven of the state's nine U.S. House seats.\n\nRepublican Governor Ron DeSantis has expressed support for a new map, which analysts believe could take aim at two or three Democratic incumbents. Republicans control 20 of the state's 28 seats, after DeSantis and the Republican-controlled legislature passed a map in 2021 that flipped four Democratic seats in 2022.\n\nThe effort would have to overcome a constitutional amendment, approved by voters in 2010, that bars the legislature from drawing districts purely for partisan gain. A majority of justices on the Florida Supreme Court, which upheld the 2021 map, were nominated by DeSantis.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have advocated for a new map that would take aim at the state's only Democratic House member, Sharice Davids. Republicans have large enough majorities in both legislative chambers to override a veto from Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. Republicans hold the state's other three congressional seats.\n\n Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers have advanced a new map designed to flip five Republican-held seats in direct response to Texas. The plan requires approval from the state's voters in a November special election, due to a state law that gives authority over redistricting to an independent commission. Democrats currently hold 43 of the state's 52 districts.\n\nVirginia Democrats launched a special legislative session on October 27 to consider a complicated three-step process to land a new congressional map for 2026. Redistricting is currently overseen by a nonpartisan commission, and only a constitutional amendment can give that authority back to lawmakers.\n\nUnder state law, an amendment must first be approved by two consecutive legislatures. With a legislative election next week, Democrats can pass the amendment now and then seek to do so again in January after the new legislature is sworn in. If that happens, voters would then have to approve the amendment before a new map could be installed.\n\nDemocrats hold six of the state's 11 seats and would likely try to flip as many as three Republican districts with a revised map.\n\nDemocrats have not ruled out redistricting. Any new map would take aim at the lone Republican among the state's eight House members. Democrats attempted to install an 8-0 map in 2022, but a state judge struck it down as unconstitutionally gerrymandered.\n\n A state judge in August ordered the Republican-led legislature to redraw the state's congressional map, finding that lawmakers improperly repealed a voter-approved ballot measure creating an independent redistricting commission. The current Republican-drawn map splits Salt Lake County, home to most of Utah's Democratic voters, among the state's four districts.\n\nIn response, Republican legislators approved a redrawn map that would maintain the party's edge in all four districts, though the district that includes Salt Lake City would be closely competitive. A judge will decide by November 10 whether to approve the legislators' map or an alternative proposed by voting rights groups that filed the lawsuit.\n\nDemocratic Governor JB Pritzker has not ruled out redistricting in response to Republicans. But Illinois already has a gerrymandered map in place, with Democrats controlling 14 of 17 seats, and flipping even one Republican seat could prove challenging.\n\nDemocratic Governor Kathy Hochul has vowed to respond to Texas, but legal constraints likely make that impossible until 2028. Voters would have to approve a constitutional amendment to permit mid-decade redistricting, and under state law such an amendment cannot be put on the ballot before 2027. Democrats hold 19 of the state's 26 seats, after a more aggressive gerrymander in 2022 was blocked by the courts.","summary":"Despite their House majority, Republicans are poised to gain more seats through redistricting","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-congressional-redistricting-texas-california-b2853347.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/23/20/06/FILE-PHOTO-The-legal-battles-over-redistricting-in-Texas-and-California-xk0hk7fr.jpeg?crop=3936,2624,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HltqslHV-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:47:20","author":"Joseph Ax","authors":["Joseph Ax"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":373188132,"title":"Anwar turns Malaysia into stage for dealmaking with Trump’s help","text":"From the moment U.S. President Donald Trump stepped off the plane in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, it was clear that he and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim shared a rapport.The two smiled and shook hands on the tarmac before the American president briefly boogied with local performers.

Border Control Commander Greg Bovino was photographed allegedly carrying a tear-gas canister toward protesters in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, prompting widespread criticism. \n\nA coalition of journalists, protesters and clergy filed a notice claiming that Bovino violated a temporary restraining order issued on October 9 by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis by deploying at least one canister of tear gas at the crowd.\n\nThe court order prohibits use of “less-lethal” or riot-control weapons (including tear gas) against people who do not pose an immediate threat, and requires at least two audible warnings before deploying such weapons, absent exigent circumstances.\n\nBovino defended his actions, and he is scheduled to appear before a federal court on Tuesday.\n\nThe court will examine whether Bovino had his body-worn camera activated and whether he gave at least two audible warnings before deploying the tear gas.\n\nSpeaking about the incident and the judge's possible action against ICE during a segment on CNN Monday afternoon, Litman said: \"In the past, just simply being found in contempt of a court order would be really a strong chastisement by a district court. Again, that seems to be a factor that is also out the window. There's a certain lack of, you know ... shamelessness to this all. But if it if it continues, I think you'll hear her ... hold Bovino expressly in contempt of court.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We'll see if they try to wriggle out of it. But in general, this is part of a whole secondary issue in these ICE cases. There's on the one hand, approaching people without any reason, just willy nilly, which the law forbids. But then second, doing it with unreasonable force. Bovino himself is accused of pointing a gun at a veteran, saying, 'bang, bang, you're dead, liberal' and that sort of thing.\"\n\nLitman added that the situation is \"particularly fraught now because Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys who represent continually in the uncomfortable position of either trying to defend or not even knowing what those folks are saying, how it's typically handled.Addressing the penalty options a federal judge has if it is found that agents like Bovino violated the temporary restraining order in Chicago, Litman said: \"They're broad, but also kind of amorphous. But if he were, I don't expect this to happen tomorrow and he has to sit for a deposition as well as a five-hour deposition [on] November 5th. But theoretically, he could be held in contempt, including criminal contempt. He could be personally fined and the like.

Gavin Newsom announced the financial lifeline Thursday, Oct. 23, not long after Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties said it was shuttering seven clinics and laying off 81 workers by Dec. 13.\n\nEarlier this month, Planned Parenthood said it was closing Melody Health because of the Trump administration’s defunding efforts. The layoffs include physicians, nurses and administrative staff. About 450 healthcare professionals and administrative staff will be left with Planned Parenthood after Melody Health winds down.\n\nThe defunding came after Congressional Republicans passed President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.” The law includes a provision that restricts federal funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliates or clinics for one year. That provision was paused under a court injunction in July, but was restored when the court order was stayed Sept. 11. Congress, as it stands, will renew the defunding provision annually.\n\nNichole Ramirez, chief communications and transformation officer with the local Planned Parenthood group, said that even if the nonprofit received a $20 million split of the $140 million offered by the state it would still need to make more belt-tightening moves because the Trump administration also blocked the state from receiving $300 million in federal Medicaid funds.\n\nMedicaid provides healthcare coverage for eligible low-income children and their families, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nThe local Planned Parenthood affiliate was receiving about $50 million out of its total annual operating budget of $100 million from the federal government, meaning that it would still need to make up a $30 million deficit from somewhere else, Ramirez said. “Right now we’re just living off our reserves,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe exact amount of money that Planned Parenthood is expected to receive locally is unknown, as Newsom didn’t say when and how much each of the affiliates would receive, Ramirez said.\n\n“We’re grateful for the funds, but we know that this is only meant to be a temporary solution,” she said. “In order to stay open, we will need to work with the California legislature when they return in January on a longer-term fix to make up what was lost when the Trump administration defunded Planned Parenthood.”\n\nThe cash infusion ensures that Planned Parenthood can still perform millions of annual gynecological exams, screenings for breast and cervical cancer, Pap smears to detect cell changes in a cervix, birth control, insert intrauterine devices, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, HIV testing, urinary tract infection testing and treatment and abortion care.\n\nIn 2026, Newsom and legislative leaders intend to identify additional resources so that Planned Parenthood health centers can continue to provide services to Californians.\n\nKrista Hollinger, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties, previously said terminating Melody Health would affect more than 13,000 patients enrolled at its seven clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. The clinics provide primary care services such as annual wellness checks, cold and flu treatment, vaccines, diabetes management, vaccinations and behavioral health services.\n\nAll nine of Planned Parenthood health centers in Orange and San Bernardino counties will remain open for reproductive care services.","summary":"$140 million for seven Planned Parenthood affiliates in California will keep 109 clinics open.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/27/planned-parenthood-of-oc-san-bernardino-getting-cash-infusion-from-state/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-PP-MELODY-CUTS-1014-one-01-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:32:35","author":"Pat Maio","authors":["Pat Maio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.573},{"id":373186058,"title":"Sikap bercampur PAS terhadap kehadiran Trump timbul persoalan, kata penganalisis","text":"Donald Trump disambut Anwar Ibrahim pada istiadat mengalu-alukan ketibaan presiden Amerika Syarikat di KLIA, Ahad lalu.\nPETALING JAYA: Kenyataan bercampur PAS mengenai kehadiran Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump ke Malaysia menimbulkan persoalan sama ada parti itu benar-benar memahami keseimbangan antara prinsip moral dan keperluan diplomasi moden.\nPemerhati hubungan antarabangsa dari Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), Nur Ashikin Yusof, berkata PAS dilihat keliru antara idealisme politik dan realiti diplomasi apabila mengiktiraf kepentingan hubungan ekonomi serta geostrategik, tetapi mengkritik sambutan rasmi terhadap Trump.\n\"Dalam dunia diplomasi, menghormati dan meraikan tetamu antarabangsa bukan tanda tunduk, tetapi lambang adab, kematangan dan kebijaksanaan sesebuah negara.\n\"Seperti negara lain, Malaysia berpegang kepada prinsip menghormati tetamu dan mematuhi protokol rasmi apabila menerima pemimpin luar,\" katanya kepada FMT.\nKelmarin, Setiausaha Agung PAS, Takiyuddin Hassan, berkata kehadiran Trump perlu dilihat dalam kerangka hubungan ekonomi, diplomatik dan geostrategik, namun tanpa mengetepikan pendirian Malaysia terhadap isu Palestin.\nNamun, pada masa sama PAS turut mempertikaikan sambutan besar-besaran terhadap Trump dan menganjurkan demonstrasi membantah kehadirannya.\nTakiyuddin merujuk sambutan meriah ketibaan Trump ke Malaysia, Ahad lalu, yang menarik perhatian apabila pemimpin kuasa besar itu secara spontan menari bersama kumpulan penari tradisional tempatan.\nTrump ke Malaysia bagi menghadiri Sidang Kemuncak Asean ke-47 atas jemputan Perdana Menteri Anwar Ibrahim selaku pengerusi Asean 2025.

Speaking at the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics alongside former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Raimondo said the US risks alienating key partners and weakening its global influence. \"On my list of top 20 things that I would be critical of this administration for is pissing off all of our allies,\" she said. \"America first is one thing. America alone is a disastrous policy. An America that's not a good friend or partner or ally to Europe, to Japan, is a weak America. I don't think we can be effective without strong relationships with Europe or much of Southeast Asia. And I wish that we would have much stronger commercial relationships with Europe. I think we're making a big mistake with India.\" Her remarks come as India–US trade tensions have grown in recent months, following Washington's decision to impose 50% tariffs on Indian goods, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil. Also Read: India-US Trade Deal In Final Stages; Report Says Tariffs Could Drop Over 30% Raimondo, who served as Commerce Secretary under former President Joe Biden, said the US had displayed \"hubris\" in its dealings with allies and warned that other nations would not wait for Washington to re-engage. \"What we're doing right now is giving the Heisman to the rest of the world,\" she said. \"And if we think they're going to sit around and wait for us to come back, I worry they won't. That's another thing China does well. China is right there every day in Europe, in Africa, in Latin America, in Southeast Asia. And it's such hubris by America to say we're the only ones.\" Raimondo also criticised the US industrial and trade policy, saying she had disagreed with both the Biden and Trump administrations over their emphasis on domestic manufacturing. \"I don't agree with the idea that we should make everything in America,\" she said. \"We don't have enough labour, it's not a good at which we have an advantage, and it's not critical to our national security.\" She recounted that Biden had pushed to \"make everything in America,\" but that she had cautioned him such a move would raise consumer prices. \"If we try to make everything in America and we don't have the capacity or the labour, inflation will go through the roof,\" she said. Raimondo added that both the Biden and Trump administrations had maintained tariffs for political reasons despite their economic costs. \"President Biden kept a number of the tariffs out of that instinct, ‘I want to be on the side of the American worker,'\" she said. \"If you're a politician, it's tough to take a tariff off once it's on — you're going to be the one that says, ‘I'm not sticking up for the American worker, go ahead, flood the market with cheap imports.' That's a tough political decision.\" Turning to China, Raimondo said the US needed a more \"nuanced\" and strategic approach to avoid escalation. \"What I see this administration doing is just making moves with China that are escalatory without even thinking about the next move that China might make,\" she said. \"We have almost $700 billion of trade with China, 99% of which is in commodity goods.

The grants were intended to help schools hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers, with a focus on rural and underserved areas of the country. But President Donald Trump’s administration opposed diversity considerations used to award the grants and told recipients they wouldn’t receive funding past December 2025.\n\nThe preliminary ruling by Kymberly K. Evanson, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, applies only to some grantees in the sixteen Democratic-led states that challenged the Education Department’s decision. In Madera County, California, for example, the ruling restores roughly $3.8 million. In Marin County, California, it restores $8 million. The ruling will remain in effect while the case proceeds.\n\nThe Education Department under Democratic President Joe Biden first awarded the grants. Biden’s administration prioritized giving the money to applicants who showed how they would increase the number of counselors from diverse backgrounds or from communities directly served by the school district.\n\nWhen Trump took office, his administration opposed aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students. In April, his administration said the grants were canceled because they conflicted with the department’s priority of “merit, fairness, and excellence in education” and weren’t in the federal government’s best interest.\n\nIn her ruling, Evanson called that decision arbitrary and capricious and said the states had made a case for real harm from the grant cuts.

Putin in his address to the Federal Assembly (Russia's bicameral parliament) stated that Moscow had developed a small-sized nuclear power unit that could be used in a cruise missile to extend its range practically indefinitely. According to Putin, this would be a low-flying missile with an unpredictable trajectory, TASS reported.\nPutin was cited as saying that the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile has no analogues in the world. He said Moscow had successfully tested the weapon and would work towards deploying it. Russian officials claim it remained airborne for about 15 hours and covered about 14,000 kilometres (8,700 miles).\nThis adds to the US President Donald Trump's \"frustrations\" over slow progress being made on a potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Recently, the US imposed new sanctions on Russian oil companies, citing ot as an \"appropriate and necessary\" step to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\"The president (Donald Trump) has always maintained that he would implement sanctions on Russia when he felt it was appropriate and necessary.

That comes out to around 2,000 a day.\n\nThe agency's release did not list the number of deportations but said \"the Trump administration is on pace to shatter historic records and deport nearly 600,000 illegal aliens by the end of President Donald Trump's first year since returning to office.\"\n\nThrough November 2024, there were 311,990 removals.\n\n\"When we send an alien back to their country of citizenship or a third country, it's called repatriation,\" DHS said on its website.\n\nThrough November 2024, there were about 677,800 repatriations after 1.4 million each in 2020 and 2021, then 1.1 million in 2023. Trump left office the first time in January 2021.\n\nThe departures include those sent back at the border or ports of entry. DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol are involved in the process.\n\nOf the 2 million who left the country since Trump took office, 1.6 million have voluntarily deported.\n\n\"In the face of a historic number of injunctions from activist judges and threats to law enforcement, DHS, ICE and CBP, have not just closed the border, but made historic strides to carry out President Trump's promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country,\" Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" she said. \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem have jump-started an agency that was hamstrung and barred from doing its job for the last four years.\n\nThe United States is offering undocumented immigrations $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport now.\n\nShe said they \"are hearing our message to leave now or face the consequence.\"\n\nMcLaughlin also noted, \"migrants are now turning back before they even reach our borders.

Defense and economic security are expected to be a key focus of their talks, before Trump flies on to South Korea, where he is likely to sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the APEC forum.\n\nFollow Trump's stay in Japan with Nikkei Asia.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nHere are the latest updates (Tokyo time):\n\nTuesday, October 28\n\n9:00 a.m. The president has a busy schedule ahead on the second day of his visit to Japan. According to the provided details, he will be welcomed with an honor guard ceremony before a morning summit with Takaichi. They will also have a working lunch. In the afternoon, the two of them are expected to take a flight on the Marine One helicopter to the U.S. military base in Yokosuka, landing on the aircraft carrier George Washington. Later, Trump is due to attend a dinner with Japanese business leaders.\n\n8:45 a.m. During Trump's meeting with the emperor last night, the two discussed the success of Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani, currently playing in the World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Trump, referring to Ohtani's teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto, also praised Japanese pitchers, according to a Nikkei report.\n\nTrump said he was \"hoping for a very good meeting\" with Takaichi, while the emperor expressed his hopes that the president's visit will \"further strengthen\" friendly ties between their countries.\n\n3:00 a.m. At a meeting earlier with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, new Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama exchanged views on Japan's energy imports from Russia, she says.\n\nIt was their first face-to-face talks. The Trump administration has called on countries to stop buying Russian oil and gas, a vital revenue source for Moscow.\n\n1:00 a.m. Trump will skip a meeting with the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea on this trip, Nikkei Asia has learned. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend instead.\n\nThe U.S. team has its eyes on paving the way for a possible meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n12:15 a.m. Trump's trip to Japan hasn't been without protest. Demonstrators took to the streets in Tokyo on Tuesday as the U.S. president's visit began.\n\nMonday, October 27\n\n8:10 p.m. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who is also visiting Japan, tells Nikkei in an exclusive interview that a $550 billion investment framework agreed between Japan and the U.S. will focus on \"power, pipelines ... things that are fundamental to national security and have virtually no risk.\"\n\n8:00 p.m. Earlier this evening, Takaichi posted a welcome message for Trump, saying she looks forward to a \"fruitful discussion\" on strengthening the alliance. She notes the buildings illuminated in his honor.\n\n7:30 p.m. Trump has left the Imperial Palace. He stayed for about 35 minutes and departed shortly after 7 p.m. Emperor Naruhito shook hands with the president once more and waved as his limo drove away.\n\n7:00 p.m. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Japanese counterpart, the newly appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, will meet on Wednesday morning, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Japan will be looking to emphasize its contribution to the bilateral defense alliance, which Trump once called \"unfair\" and \"one-sided.\"\n\nTakaichi last Friday said that her government will devote the equivalent of 2% of the nation's gross domestic product to defense in the current fiscal year through March, achieving the spending target two years ahead of schedule.\n\n6:40 p.m. Trump meets Emperor Naruhito. The president gets out of his limo and the emperor is there to greet him. The two men share a long handshake and exchange pleasantries, before posing for a brief photo opportunity and heading inside.\n\n6:30 p.m. Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree -- two of the city's best-known landmarks -- are lit up in the red, white and blue of the American flag.\n\n6:25 p.m. A tidbit from Trump's flight: The 79-year-old president told reporters aboard Air Force One that he recently underwent an MRI exam, Reuters reports. \"It was perfect,\" he said.\n\n6:05 p.m. Trump arrives at the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo, his long motorcade of black vehicles weaving over the paths of the grounds.\n\n5:50 p.m. After landing at a helipad, Trump moves to his presidential limousine, known as \"The Beast,\" which will take him to the Imperial Palace to meet the emperor.\n\nEmperor Naruhito has reigned since 2019, after his father, Akihito, stepped down due to his advancing age -- the first abdication in more than 200 years. The emperor does not wield political power but is defined as the symbol of the nation and unity of the Japanese people in the constitution.\n\n5:30 p.m. Outside the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, where Trump is due to meet Emperor Naruhito, a crowd of onlookers has gathered ahead of the president's arrival. Footage on public broadcaster NHK shows his Marines helicopter streaking across the city.\n\n\"Looking forward to seeing the Emperor!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social just before landing in Japan.\n\n5:11 p.m. Dressed in a navy suit and yellow tie, Trump emerges from his aircraft and makes his way down the stairs. He is greeted on the tarmac by Japanese and American officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass. The president then heads immediately to his waiting helicopter.\n\n5:02 p.m. Media footage shows Trump's blue-and-white plane, Air Force One, touching down at Tokyo's Haneda Airport as dusk rapidly descends on the Japanese capital.\n\n3:45 p.m. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has deployed up to around 18,000 personnel to ensure security during Trump's visit. Measures have been tightened near the U.S. Embassy, and units responsible for handling explosives and countering drones are poised to respond swiftly to any urgent incidents.\n\n3:30 p.m. The first Trump-Takaichi meeting is part of a U.S. effort to strengthen ties with allies and partners in the region, as Washington faces a protracted rivalry with Beijing despite the announcement of a framework for a trade deal on Sunday.\n\nGiven the importance of the U.S. to Japan as its security guarantor and second-largest trading partner, and considering Trump's top-down management style, many observers consider it essential for Takaichi to build a good rapport with the president.\n\nIn the meeting, defense is expected to top the agenda, amid heightened concerns over Russia's and China's territorial ambitions, coupled with unease over Trump's \"America First\" policy. Economic security is another important topic, as the U.S. struggles to address vulnerabilities such as its dependence on China for rare-earth minerals and on Taiwan for semiconductors.\n\n3:25 p.m. Aboard Air Force One, Trump tells reporters that he is eager to meet Takaichi. \"I'm looking forward to meeting with the new prime minister,\" he says, according to Reuters. \"I hear phenomenal things.\"\n\nHe also says that he would \"love\" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again, after three meetings during his first presidency. He suggests he would be willing to extend his upcoming stay on the Korean Peninsula to make that happen. \"It is our last stop so it's pretty easy to do. I would meet with him.\"\n\n3 p.m. Trump is still en route to Japan from Malaysia. He is expected to arrive in Tokyo after 5 p.m.\n\nTrump last visited Japan during his first presidency in June 2019, when he attended the Group of 20 summit in Osaka. He came to Japan three times during that term, when he developed a close relationship with late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThis time, Trump is expected to head straight to the Imperial Palace for a meeting with Emperor Naruhito. The president and first lady Melania had been state guests of the emperor in May 2019, shortly after his accession to the throne.\n\nAs he departed from Malaysia, Trump wrote on his Truth Social Network: \"Just leaving Malaysia, a great and very vibrant Country. Signed major Trade and Rare Earth Deals, and yesterday, most importantly, signed the Peace Treaty between Thailand and Cambodia. NO WAR! Millions of lives saved. Such an honor to have gotten this done.

The grants were intended to help schools hire more counselors, psychologists and social workers, with a focus on rural and underserved areas of the country. But President Donald Trump's administration opposed diversity considerations used to award the grants and told recipients they wouldn't receive funding past December 2025.\n\nThe preliminary ruling by Kymberly K. Evanson, a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle, applies only to some grantees in the sixteen Democratic-led states that challenged the Education Department's decision. In Madera County, California, for example, the ruling restores roughly $3.8 million. In Marin County, California, it restores $8 million. The ruling will remain in effect while the case proceeds.\n\nThe Education Department under Democratic President Joe Biden first awarded the grants. Biden's administration prioritized giving the money to applicants who showed how they would increase the number of counselors from diverse backgrounds or from communities directly served by the school district. \n\nWhen Trump took office, his administration opposed aspects of the grant programs that touched on race, saying they were harmful to students.

The show of deepening ties came as US President Donald Trump visits Asia.\nIn a separate meeting with her Russian counterpart, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui confirmed North Korea’s “unwavering understanding and support” for Putin’s war against Ukraine, North Korean state media said on Tuesday.\nNorth Korea in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to Russia to support its war effort, a growing alignment that has fueled leader Kim Jong Un’s increasingly assertive foreign policy as he seeks to break out of isolation and position his country as part of a united front against the US-led West. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president’s first term.\nPutin and Kim met in Beijing in September after attending a major military parade in the heart of the Chinese capital that marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nPutin asked North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui on Monday to convey his best wishes to Kim, noting that they had a very warm meeting, according to his televised remarks at the start of the talks.\nBefore attending the Kremlin meeting with Putin, Choe held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who again hailed North Korean troops for fighting alongside the Russian military in the Kursk region after a surprise Ukrainian incursion.\n“These heroic deeds will, of course, further strengthen the bonds of friendship and historical unity in our shared struggle for justice,” Lavrov said.\nChoe noted “considerable progress” in relations between the two countries and confirmed Pyongyang’s support for “all measures” taken by Russia to defend its security interests and “eliminate the root cause” of its conflict with Ukraine, according to Russian and North Korean media.\nNorth Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Russian officials, during their meeting with Choe, expressed Moscow’s support for all of Pyongyang’s efforts to “firmly defend its current status, security interests, and sovereign rights.” The two sides discussed expanding high-level exchanges and cooperation and coordinating their diplomacy on unspecified “major issues of mutual concern,” KCNA said.\nAccording to South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to Russia since last fall and also supplied large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and ballistic missiles to support Moscow’s military action in Ukraine. Kim has also agreed to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia’s Kursk region.\nKim has focused on expanding the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military since his diplomacy with Trump collapsed in 2019 due to disagreements over US.-led economic sanctions. Last month, Kim suggested he could return to talks if Washington drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.

Does it really?\n\nIt’s hilarious to see such reactions from Democrats like these, along with Joe Scarbrough, Stephanie Ruhle and other Very Serious People, to a project that enriches our national infrastructure and won’t cost taxpayers a dime. \n\nThose who a couple of years ago were toppling monuments to America’s founders and denouncing America itself as a slave state are now posing as defenders of our deep history and heritage. \n\nBecause nothing says “deep history and heritage” like a structure built in 1942 to hide a bomb shelter.\n\nTrump’s new White House annex will contain a lot more space, including a huge ballroom with a drone-proof metal roof and other security enhancements. \n\nUp to now, big state dinners have been held in tents on the White House lawn, with portable space heaters, awkward temporary restrooms — and zero overhead protection against security threats like drones, which are becoming a bigger and bigger danger. \n\nThe new building will make formal receptions and other big events safer and more comfortable.\n\nEven some on the left are jumping ship on this ridiculous outcry against an addition that many, including Biden and Obama staffers, have publicly advocated. \n\nThe Washington Post, no friend of Trump’s, editorialized in favor of the renovation — while complaining about the way he’s going about it. \n\n“In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible,” the paper tut-tutted.\n\nBut, it went on, “it is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties.”\n\nAnd Trump’s rapid construction program contrasts sharply with many other DC-area projects, mired in the usual slough of permitting, environmental reviews and “not in my back yard” complaints from the perpetually aggrieved.\n\n“Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere,” the WaPo concluded with grudging approval.\n\nHeck, even Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King is on board. \n\n“They are always wasting millions on tents and heaters and chairs and lights and everything else,” he reasoned on X. “Stop acting like you have some emotional attachment to the East Wing. You don’t.”\n\nBut most of the leftists have to pretend. \n\nIf Trump is for it, a large segment of this country just has to be against it, and in the most overwrought, over-moralizing way. \n\nThey can’t help themselves.\n\nThus when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted a Harvard study suggesting a link between consuming Tylenol in pregnancy and autism in children, pregnant Democratic women started posting TikTok videos of themselves gobbling the tablets: That’ll show Trump! \n\nSome reportedly wound up in the emergency room, but resisting Trump was more important.\n\nIt’s been a longstanding joke on the right that if Trump gave a speech praising “oxygen, beautiful oxygen,” people on the left would cover their heads with plastic bags. \n\nIt’s not far from the truth.\n\nAll this programmed hysteria does keep a certain segment of the crazy leftist base riled up in a state of excitement that Democratic leadership relies on for donations and votes.\n\nBut it seems they’re usually riled up about what Trump wants them to be — that is, things that make them look stupid, and get them chasing that laser dot around in circles.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"While Donald Trump tours Asia, dancing, making trade deals and apparently having a blast, he’s got his opponents back in the Swamp obsessing over . . . a home renovation project.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/opinion/trump-haters-white-house-ballroom-tantrums-get-even-more-ridiculous/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/20251023_zaf_i90_2094-e1761609887382.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:08:18","author":"Glenn H.

(RELATED: Trump Reportedly Authorizes CIA To Use Covert Action In Venezuela)\n\nThe Venezuelan vice president went on to compare the alleged “planned action” to the sinking of the USS Maine in 1898 and the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 — both widely believed to have been misrepresented — which led, respectively, to the U.S. declaring war on Spain and to the escalation of the Vietnam War.\n\n“Venezuela does not accept threats from any U.S. vassal government, We are not intimidated by military exercises of war cries,” Rodríguez’s statement added.\n\nThe Pentagon announced Friday that it had deployed the Gerald R.

And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs.\n\nHe said the priority at Cop30 was to shift direction: “It is absolutely indispensable to change course in order to make sure that the overshoot is as short as possible and as low in intensity as possible to avoid tipping points like the Amazon. We don’t want to see the Amazon as a savannah. But that is a real risk if we don’t change course and if we don’t make a dramatic decrease of emissions as soon as possible.”\n\nThe planet’s past 10 years have been the hottest in recorded history. Despite growing scientific alarm at the speed of global temperature increases caused by the burning of fossil fuels – oil, coal and gas – the secretary general said government commitments have come up short.\n\nFewer than a third of the world’s nations (62 out of 197) have sent in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement. The US under Donald Trump has abandoned the process. Europe has promised but so far failed to deliver. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has been accused of undercommitting.\n\nGuterres said the lack of NDC ambition means the Paris goal of 1.5C will be breached, at least temporarily: “From those [NDCs] received until now, there is an expectation of a reduction of emissions of 10%. We would need 60% [to stay within 1.5C]. So overshooting is now inevitable.”\n\nHe did not give up on the target though, and said it may still be possible to temporarily overshoot and then bring temperatures down in time to return to 1.5C by the end of the century, but this would require a change of direction at and beyond Cop30.\n\nHe called for governments to rebalance representation at Cops so that civil society groups, particularly from Indigenous communities, will have a greater presence and influence than people paid by corporations.\n\n“We all know what the lobbyists want,” he said. “It’s to increase their profits, with the price being paid by humankind.”\n\nHe said a transition away from fossil fuels was a matter of economic self-interest, because it was clear that the era of fossil fuels was coming to an end: “We are seeing a renewables revolution and the transition will inevitably accelerate and there will be no way in which humankind will be able to use all the oil and gas already discovered,” he said.\n\nAsked if he had raised this with the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government has just given the green light for oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon, he said: “Not yet. I’ll take advantage of the Cop [to do this].”\n\nOne of Brazil’s initiatives at Cop30 will be the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn for the protection of standing forests. A fifth of any money disbursed will go directly to Indigenous communities, whose territories contain most of the best-preserved biodiversity and most effective carbon sinks.\n\nOn several occasions, Guterres stressed the essential importance of Indigenous voices at Cop30. The UN said this was the first time the secretary general had given an exclusive interview to a journalist from an Indigenous community, Wajã Xipai, a Sumaúma reporter from the Xipai people who was joined by the Guardian.\n\n“It is fundamental to invest in those who are the best guardians of nature. And the best guardians of nature are precisely the Indigenous communities,” Guterres said.\n\nWorld leaders should also be schooled by Indigenous peoples in how to achieve a balance with nature, the secretary general said. “Political leaders are often more concerned with the day-to-day problems of society, especially at times when the economic situation is complex and aggravated by climate change, by disasters, by catastrophes. So sometimes there is no notion of the importance of a harmonious relationship with nature and therefore it is necessary to permanently maintain a pedagogy with the political leaders, and there is no one better than the Indigenous communities to do this pedagogy,” he said\n\nDespite growing pressure on the Cop system of global environmental governance, Guterres said it played a crucial role.\n\n“The alternative is a free-for-all,” he said. “And we know what free for all means. Free for all means that there will be a small privileged elite, people and companies that will be able to always protect themselves, even if disasters will spread. Floods will spread, communities will be destroyed, but there will always be a group of rich people and rich companies that will be able to protect themselves as the planet is being progressively destroyed.”\n\nNext year will be Guterres’s last as secretary general. Looking back on his nine years in the post, he said he wished he had focused on climate and nature earlier, though it was now a priority. He said: “I will never give up on my commitment to climate action, on my commitment to biodiversity, on my commitment to the protection of nature, on my commitment to help and support all the democratic movements that around the world are fighting and fighting hard to preserve the most precious possession that we have, which is our mother nature.”\n\nThis interview is also published in English, Portuguese and Spanish by Sumaúma.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/change-course-now-humanity-missed-000112671.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oBQnRb5x8MYJm__m9MOFVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xOTIwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/56ab6c00a8ed17cdf797816e41cff305","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:01:12","author":"Jonathan Watts And Wajã Xipai","authors":["Jonathan Watts And Wajã Xipai"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":373186800,"title":"Not even Trump knows what the hell he’s doing with his dumb ballroom","text":"The East Wing of the White House was reduced to a pile of rubble last week in a hasty, brutal demolition that shocked the country.

None of them are the same.\n\nHonestly, of course they aren’t. This is all being done on the fly, subject to Trump’s daily whims. The ballroom could hold 650 people, or maybe 1,350—it’s a mystery! Maybe it will cost $200 million, maybe $300 million. Wait, scratch that—it’s $350 million. Definitely $350 million.\n\nYou might find it odd that construction is already starting on a building that has multiple building plans—where one version of the ballroom holds nearly twice the other, with a price tag that increases by about $50 million every time you turn around. \n\nYou fool! You rube! You just don’t understand how construction works! Let White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt school you. \n\n“With any construction project, changes come. And we have informed all of you, we've been keeping you apprised of this project. We've shown you the renderings,” she said.\n\nWell, yes. It’s the fact that there are renderings plural that is the problem here. All we really know for sure is that it will be 90,000 square feet, or nearly double the size of the White House, which stands at 55,000 square feet—at least until Trump destroyed the East Wing. \n\nFormer first lady Jackie Kennedy’s garden is also gone, as are two magnolia trees that were planted in the 1940s to honor former Presidents Warren G. Harding and Franklin D. Roosevelt. And why not? Trump doesn’t want to honor any past presidents. He only wants to honor himself. \n\nEven the small details are inconsistent in Trump’s plans for the ballroom, including the number of decorative columns and staircases. There’s also the small problem of the renderings having physically impossible features, like a stairway to nowhere and overlapping windows. \n\nTo be frank, it looks a lot like someone just used AI to render a crappy facsimile of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMaybe these plans all look like haphazard, slightly different versions of golden crap because McCrery Architects, which is designing the ballroom, mostly builds churches—not ballrooms. However, James McCrery, the firm’s owner, is a hard-right religious zealot and has also designed buildings for Hillsdale College, the right’s beloved ultraconservative school.\n\nBut Trump knows that the companies showering him with money for this project don’t actually care about the ballroom's aesthetics or who builds it; it’s just another opportunity to curry favor with the president. \n\nAnd Trump certainly doesn’t care about quality. He revels in gilded everything, a king in the world’s tackiest castle. He’s created a perfect ecosystem of grift without oversight or public input.\n\nAnd what do we get?

Argentina","text":"From Argentina to Japan, MAGA is going global.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s slogan has long been “America First,” and his movement is all about making America great again — language the president’s foes misunderstand as meaning “isolationism.”\n\nIn fact, strengthening America requires strengthening our friends and allies as well — and Trump sets an example for those leaders in Latin America, Asia and Europe who want to make their nations great again, too.\n\nThere’s no paradox here.\n\nA robust international order is impossible if America has to sacrifice its own industrial capacity, and our people’s economic security, to global free trade.\n\nThat leads to a weaker and more dependent America, even as our allies, in the era before Trump, expected us to shoulder the lion’s share of the burden for their defense.\n\nThe “liberal international order” was a suicide pact, building up China while wearing down America, and the system perversely incentivized our friends to prioritize welfare spending over basic national-security needs.\n\nThe alternative to that failed order isn’t anarchy or Chinese hegemony: it’s cooperation among stronger nations that take their responsibilities—both to their own people and to the United States — more seriously.\n\nJapan is a critical case in point.\n\nIts new prime minister Sanae Takaichi represents a right turn for the dominant Liberal Democratic Party, which is Japan’s leading conservative party, despite what the name might suggest in the English-speaking world.\n\nMore than 80 years after the end of World War II, Japan remains constitutionally forbidden to rearm: It has defense forces, but not a true military. \n\nTakaichi belongs to a wing of the Japanese right that would change that — and thereby make Japan not a threat to anyone else but a better ally for America.\n\nThe superpower threat in the Pacific today comes from Beijing, and the more constrained Japan is, the less constrained that China is.\n\nRearmament is highly controversial within Japan, but just as Trump has taken controversial but necessary steps to address America’s weaknesses — from imposing tariffs to cracking down on illegal immigration — a leader like Takaichi can bring great changes to her country, too.\n\nShe’s already restricting immigration, before it becomes the kind of problem that it has long been in the West.\n\nTakaichi is a protégé of Shinzo Abe, who was Japan’s prime minister during Trump’s first term and had a uniquely strong bond with the president.\n\nAs the first woman to lead Japan, she’s also drawn comparisons to Britain’s Iron Lady of the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe tariffs that serve America’s industrial policy can be a strain upon trading partners like Japan, of course — although the land of the rising sun has long practiced its own forms of industrial and agricultural protection.\n\nJapanese rice production, for example, is heavily protected, which means Japan has enough domestic capacity to endure shortages in the event of war or other emergencies disrupting international trade.\n\nAlthough Japan isn’t self-sufficient, it’s a boon to American security that the country can provide for itself better than other friends in the region, such as Taiwan, which could be starved into submission by a Chinese blockade.\n\nTrump not only shows leaders like Takaichi that boldness can succeed in throwing out the playbook of establishment politics, his return to the White House prods allies like Japan to pick leaders who are simpatico with his right-leaning nationalist worldview — the kind of leaders America needs among its allies in the 21st century.\n\nRight-of-center, anti-establishment politics also plays well at home, both with voters and the stock market: Takaichi’s ascent sent the Nikkei stock index soaring to a new record.\n\nHalf a world away, the success of President Javier Milei’s right-leaning party in Argentina’s midterm elections on Sunday produced a similar result: Stock indexes boomed by as much as 23%.\n\nIt baffles Trump’s critics that America’s self-declared “Tariff Man” can have such good relations with Milei, a self-described “anarcho-capitalist.”\n\nBut Trump thinks in terms of interests, not ideology, and it’s in America’s interests that Milei succeed in making Argentina freer, more prosperous, and friendlier to us, in a region — our own hemisphere — where socialism, anti-“Yanqui” sentiment and Chinese influence continually threaten to align against us.\n\nThere’s no contradiction in nationalists from different nations working in parallel to make their own countries stronger individually and more secure collectively.\n\nLikewise, there’s nothing strange about populist reformers from different countries with different needs having a great deal of sympathy with one another — Trump is fighting an establishment bent upon globalization; Milei faces an establishment in Argentina that wants an all-powerful state sector.\n\nWhat brings different philosophies together to advance shared interests is simply the art of the deal.\n\nTrump’s the master of that, and other right-leaning leaders around the world are quickly learning from him.\n\nThey’re advancing a global realignment that will help make America great again, even as it makes their own nations greater as well.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and a contributing editor of The American Conservative.","summary":"Trump is teaming with allies like Japan's Sanae Takaichi to advance a global realignment that

over ‘lone wolf’ attacks","text":"Japan dramatically ramped up security as US President Donald Trump arrived in Tokyo on Monday, with 18,000 police officers on duty and a specialist emergency response team on constant alert for the American leader’s three-day visit.\nAn incident on Friday suggested that elevated levels of security for the occasion are warranted, with a police officer stationed outside the US embassy in central Tokyo attacked by a man with a knife.\nThe man, who has been arrested, was stopped after police believed he was acting suspiciously, with the officer sustaining minor injuries.\nAnalysts suggest the high-profile security cordon is appropriate given Trump has been the target of at least two recent assassination attempts back home, while Japan is still haunted by the death of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, killed by a “lone wolf” gunman in July 2022.\n“It is absolutely right that the authorities here are taking this very seriously,” said James Brown, a professor of international relations at the Tokyo campus of Temple University.\n“This would be the case in any circumstances, but this is the US president, who has already been targeted twice. And even though Japan is a very safe country, they have to take that into account.”\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has set up a dedicated security headquarters to manage the president’s visit until his departure on Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju.\n\nGiven that a gunman attempted to shoot Trump in July 2024, while he was campaigning for the presidential election, from the roof of a building overlooking a podium set up in the town of Butler, Pennsylvania, Japanese police are devoting a great deal of attention to buildings and elevated locations close to where the president will be.\nEquipment is also being deployed that will be able to neutralise drones that might be used in an attack.\nAccording to police, an armed rapid-response unit will be tasked with dealing with assailants who have guns, while authorities are also on alert at potential “soft targets” where large numbers of the public may be present, such as train stations.\nOf particular concern are “lone wolf” assailants who provide authorities with little warning of their intentions because they do not communicate with others.\n“I was in central Tokyo earlier today and there are a lot of police, but I wonder if they are being effective. A lot of them seemed to be loitering in bushes, but we know that the most effective way of stopping these sorts of attacks comes from intelligence,” Brown said.\n“The big concern has to be a ‘lone wolf’-style attack, because these people are not on the radar of the security services because they are radicalised on their own, they are not part of organised groups, and they are very hard to predict and therefore prevent.”\nAbe died at the hands of just such an assailant, Brown pointed out. By coincidence, Tetsuya Yamagami goes on trial on Tuesday, accused of shooting the former prime minister dead with a handmade firearm as he campaigned on a street corner in Nara in 2022.\n\nYamagami is expected to plead guilty to the charges, although his defence team could request leniency on the grounds that he had been the victim of “religious abuse”. The 45-year-old has said he acted out of frustration after his mother bankrupted the family by giving about 100 million yen (US$653,000) to the Unification Church.\nYamagami claimed that Japanese political parties supported the Unification Church because the organisation made generous donations to them in return for political influence.\nThen prime minister Fumio Kishida was also fortunate to escape unharmed when another lone assailant threw a pipe bomb at him as he campaigned in Wakayama prefecture in April 2023.\nIn response to those incidents, as well as increasing threats posted on social media against political leaders and celebrities, the police agency set up a specialist unit to identify and track potential solo attackers.\nIt is also seeking funding in next year’s budget for a pilot project that will employ artificial intelligence to identify anyone who appears likely to be planning to carry out an attack, based on their social media posts.\nBrown cautions, however, that no plan is completely foolproof and that an attack in which Trump is wounded or worse would be “disastrous” for bilateral relations.\n“I cannot begin to imagine how damaging it would be for Japan’s relationship with its most important security ally,” he said. “Some of the blame would of course fall on the president’s security service, but most would fall on the host nation. That would be disastrous.”","summary":"Japan dramatically ramped up security as US President Donald Trump arrived in Tokyo on Monday, with 18,000 police officers on duty and a specialist emergency response team on constant alert for the American leader’s three-day visit.\nAn incident on Friday suggested that elevated levels of security for the occasion are warranted, with a police officer stationed outside the US embassy in central Tokyo attacked by a man with a knife.\nThe man, who has been arrested, was stopped after police believed...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3330476/japan-high-alert-trumps-visit-amid-concern-over-lone-wolf-attacks","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/27/72213664-d71a-4adf-8cb8-11a2ceabb609_eb550cba.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 00:00:12","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":373186060,"title":"Anwar turns Malaysia into stage for dealmaking with Trump’s help","text":"Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US president Donald Trump have agreed to elevate their two countries’ relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. (EPA Images pic)\nKUALA LUMPUR: From the moment US president Donald Trump stepped off the plane in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, it was clear that he and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim shared a rapport.\nThe two smiled and shook hands on the tarmac before the American president briefly boogied with local performers. The crowd cheered as he waved American and Malaysian flags, before getting into a car together — breaking protocol — where Anwar lobbied for lasting peace in Gaza.\n“I am delighted truly, president, to hear from you personally how determined you are to ensure that peace is achieved in the most intractable areas — almost impossible, but you did it,” Anwar said, softening his tone on an issue he has been vocal on.\nFor his pains, Anwar will walk away with a trade deal that other nations have spent months negotiating for in Washington.\nMalaysia and the US upgraded ties to the highest rung possible, and the two sides pledged to deepen maritime security cooperation at a time when the US and China are competing for influence across the region.\nHis push to make Kuala Lumpur a venue for dialogue between competing powers lent an unusual weight to the Asean Summit that for decades was largely a ceremonial showcase of regional unity.\nTrump’s presence at the Asean gathering over the weekend also led to a flurry of agreements on tariffs and critical minerals and the signing of a peace accord between Cambodia and Thailand, which Trump set as a condition for attending the regional summit as he looks to bolster his case to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\n“I told the leader of Malaysia, who’s a very good man, I said, I think I owe you a trip,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One before arriving in Malaysia. He relished the pomp of his welcome ceremony, dancing to the beat of drums on the airport tarmac.\nLocal media also largely portrayed Anwar’s hosting of the event as a showcase of Malaysia’s diplomatic resurgence, calling it a moment of renewed regional leadership and proof of the nation’s growing stature as a bridge between East and West.\nOpposition leaders however were critical, with the secretary-general of the Islamic party, which holds the most seats in Parliament, saying the grand welcome for Trump was excessive and “akin to pouring salt on the still-bleeding wounds of Gazans”.\nBeyond Trump, the rare presence of leaders from around the world — including Brazil’s president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Canadian prime minister Mark Carney — raised Malaysia’s visibility and bolstered a reputation that has been slowly on the mend.\nTo be sure, not all invitations were successful. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin and India’s prime minister Narendra Modi didn’t show — likely to avoid awkwardness with Trump over the war in Ukraine.\nWhile critics accuse the 78-year-old of watering down anti-graft pledges and cutting deals with entrenched elites to secure his majority, Anwar has steadily tightened his grip on power, bringing a measure of political stability after decades of revolving-door governments and coalition infighting.\nFor years, Malaysia was seen as one of the more stable and less corrupt countries in Southeast Asia, until the eruption of the multibillion-dollar 1MDB corruption scandal. The fallout led to the defeat of the then prime minister, who was later jailed, and the fall of a coalition that had ruled since independence.\nA succession of short-lived administrations followed, raising doubts about the government’s policies and scaring off some investors. Then in 2022, Anwar, who first rose to prominence as a pro-market finance minister back in the 1990s before being jailed under what he derided as concocted charges, completed a dramatic comeback by becoming prime minister.\nAnwar, who is also finance minister, has both managed a difficult year as chair of Asean and helped Malaysia’s economy thrive despite Trump’s tariffs. Along the way, he earned the reputation of being a strong leader in Southeast Asia, Adib Zalkapli, founder of the geopolitical consultancy Viewfinder Global Affairs, said.\n“In international politics, it’s important to be seen as a neutral ground and an honest broker,” Adib said of Anwar.\nThe question is whether Malaysia can rise to the ranks of Singapore and Qatar, seen as trusted venues for statecraft.\nTensions still simmered in Kuala Lumpur. Carney offered a terse response to Trump’s promise to further hike tariffs on Canadian goods. In his opening remarks to the summit, Carney pointed to his goal of diversifying Canada’s trade away from the US, and citing his government’s quest for a free trade deal with the Asean bloc as a prime example.\nAnwar has also had to walk a fine line between speaking up for Palestine and not offending the US, Israel’s closest ally.\nThere have been frequent protests against the war in Gaza and he faced pressure from Malaysia’s Muslim-majority population to rescind his invitation to Trump, even as the US leader helped broker a ceasefire in the conflict. Protesters gathered at the historic Merdeka Square about 8km away from the Asean gathering on Sunday.\nThe issue failed to disrupt the meeting, and Anwar and Trump agreed to elevate their two countries’ relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Anwar did criticise the situation in Gaza — but only once Trump was on a plane to Japan.\nStill, even in his wilderness years, Anwar showed a knack for maintaining important connections, including former US vice-president Al Gore and former US deputy secretary of defence Paul Wolfowitz. And since coming to power almost three years ago, his frequent travels — from Washington to Rio de Janeiro and Beijing — have built connections with a diverse array of leaders.\nHe also appears to have deftly handled Trump, whose history of summitry includes undercutting the Group of Seven and criticising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n“Diplomats and trade negotiators often lament that dealing with the US is no longer grounded in clear, rules-based frameworks,” said Azizul Amiludin, a senior non-resident fellow at the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research.\n“Anwar demonstrated that in the absence of such rules, interpersonal skill and political intuition can be the most effective tools of diplomacy.”\nAnwar’s own journey — from political prisoner to prime minister — has probably added moral weight to his diplomacy, even as his government has been criticised for apparently seeking revenge on his old enemies.\nDuring his years behind bars on charges he said were politically motivated, he read the Bible “every other day” besides the Quran. One of the books he said sustained him was Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.\nAnwar, on Sunday, quipped during the signing of the Thailand-Cambodia peace accord that he and Trump “shared a lot in common”, including the fact that the Malaysian leader had been to prison, and the other “almost got there”.\n“You need somebody that can actually build relationships,” said Amirul Feisal Wan Zahir, the managing director of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd. “There aren’t that many in this world, so we’re very, very proud of him.”","summary":"For his pains, the PM walks away with a trade deal that other nations have spent months negotiating for in Washington.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/10/28/anwar-turns-malaysia-into-stage-for-dealmaking-with-trumps-help","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/39bd947f-2-donald-trump-anwar-ibrahim-asean-summit-epaimages-261025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:59:13","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.415},{"id":373180626,"title":"Kristen Bell’s ‘Cry for Help’: Unveiling the Serious Message Behind the Joke – Insights from KENNEDY","text":"Kristen Bell recently faced backlash for an Instagram post deemed ‘tone deaf’ by some, where she celebrated her marriage to Dax Shepard.\n\nIn the post, Bell wished her husband a happy 12th wedding anniversary, humorously recalling his comment: “I would never kill you. A lot of men have killed their wives at a certain point. Even though I’m heavily incentivized to kill you, I never would.”\n\nThe post sparked criticism, particularly given that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Many found her words inappropriate given the sensitive nature of the topic.\n\nWhile some understood the critique, it seemed like another instance of internet outrage, fueled by those looking for something to rally against.\n\nIt wasn’t long before various commentators, including younger social media users, began offering Bell unsolicited advice on her marriage.\n\nThese critics, often perceived as disconnected from the realities of a long-term relationship, seemed quick to judge without a nuanced understanding of the couple’s dynamic.\n\nNext, they started digging up every clip of this harmless pair until voila, they unearthed a fossil from 2012: Kristen and Dax were, once again, joking about violence.\n\nShe recounted a story about taking a ride in his classic car, saying, ‘He was so excited. We drove to brunch and the first thing I said, five minutes into the ride, I said, ‘This sounds like it’s going to break.’ Dax chimed in, ‘And I was very offended. And then I hit her several times.’\n\nKristen, being a professional, played along with the bit adding, ‘And then I got beat up. And guess what, I never opened my mouth again.’\n\nThat was 13 years ago, and I think it’s safe to report that Ms Bell has opened her mouth repeatedly since then.\n\nAfter all the internet blowhards had their say, it was the turn of jealous ‘friends’ to start piling on about how ‘Kristen goes through her days unscathed.’\n\n‘It seems like she treats all situations she’s involved in as if she’s in the right at all times,’ they bleated. ‘She always has an ‘I am better than you’ mentality that rubs some people the wrong way. It is not a surprise she hasn’t apologized, because she doesn’t ever think she is wrong.’\n\nThese so-called pals! Who knew the charmed life of a comedic actress, happily married with two daughters, could incite so much jealous rage?\n\nComedic being the operative word. News flash: Funny people make jokes, and much of the time they’re a coping mechanism for trauma and pain and, well, life.\n\nDax’s life has not been easy. He has been very vocal about his sobriety and like many addicts, the guy has a slippery wagon he’s fallen off in recent years. Does he gloss it over and pretend to live a perfect, filtered life?\n\nNo! He works the program and tells his 10 and 12-year-old daughters the painful reality of fighting to stay sober. He’s open about going to Alcoholics Anonymous and quite rightly has no shame in telling his kids, ‘I’m an alcoholic and if I don’t go there, then I’ll drink and then I’ll be a terrible dad.’\n\nHe’s backing up his wife through this whole silly and manufactured ‘crisis,’ because even though celebrities – like everyone else – share glimpses into their lives and milestones, the post was meant for him.\n\nIf he didn’t like it, the implication is he’d punch her right in the kisser because he’s clearly a domestic abuser, in the minds of these mouth-breathing trolls who no doubt view what was intended as a goofy ‘Yay! We made it to a dozen!’ post as Kristen’s cry for help.\n\nI was really hoping we had found the off-ramp for rampant cultural cancelations when people started realizing how stupid it was to cancel Sydney Sweeney and pull-down Abraham Lincoln statues.\n\nPerhaps Kristen Bell can’t save the union, but by making jokes and making her husband laugh she might be saving her own. Good for her for not caving and ‘apologizing’ – and as for her tiresome critics, the joke’s on them.\n\nPulp fiction\n\nStephen King fell for a whopper this week when he responded to a fake Donald Trump post saying, ‘WE WILL BE INVESTIGATING THE UN AMERICAN BLUE JAYS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO STEAL OUR BELOVED WORLD SERIES. THEY WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.’\n\nKing accused the president of failing to ‘rise above his petty political concerns.’ Um, no Stephen that would be you and your full-blown Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nTaking issue\n\nIsrael-bashing loon Rachel Zegler has been named one of Glamour magazine’s Women of the Year. Wait, Glamour is still a magazine? \n\nThey clearly didn’t watch Rachel’s terrible turn as Snow White. But then again, who did?\n\nSupplements for suckers\n\nNot one to let her sister have all the fun in the creepy coochie department, Kourtney Kardashian is competing with Kim’s furry pube-thongs by hawking a line of lollipops for your hoo-hah called Lemme Purr. \n\nThey’re probiotic suckers that ward off kitty infections. I’m not sure which orifice you feed them to. Guess we’ll suck it and see!\n\nNot Instagram official\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban have publicly announced their split, but fans are aflutter because they continue to follow each other on Instagram. \n\nMaybe he DMs her for tips on how to flat iron his bangs, but he only follows 115 people and she’s one of them. Who says romance is dead? \n\nJust in time for Halloween, this zombie romance may still have a pulse.\n\nReading the room\n\nSpeaking of Nicole’s horrible exes, Demi Moore claimed in a recent interview that Tom Cruise was uncomfortable when she showed up eight months pregnant to a table read for A Few Good Men. \n\nMaybe he was just pre-emptively jealous that the baby would be taller than him!\n\nWaxing lyrical\n\nJustin Trudeau and Katy Perry just made their first official public appearance together, but honestly, they give me the creeps… very waxy looking (and that’s just Justin!). \n\nIf I didn’t have my glasses on, I’d easily confuse him for an escapee from Madame Tussaud’s.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nDonald Trump may be denying plans to name his new ballroom after himself, but the report has nevertheless ruffled the feathers of the birdbrain Democrats. \n\nWouldn’t it be a class act to name it after the First Lady instead?\n\nKrafting his image\n\nGavin Newsom recently revealed on a podcast that he raised himself and ‘hustled’ while growing up, relying on Kraft macaroni and cheese dinners. \n\nSure, Gav.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump promised $20 billion in currency swaps and an additional $20 billion in private sector funding to aid the embattled Argentine economy, but he made the deal contingent on Milei’s party winning the midterm elections.\n\n“Congratulations to President Javier Milei on his Landslide Victory in Argentina. He is doing a wonderful job! Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,” Trump posted early Monday morning on Truth Social. \n\nMilei, who has long been friendly with the president, responded: “Thank you, President [Trump], for trusting the Argentine people. You are a great friend of the Argentine Republic. Our Nations should never have stopped being allies. Our peoples want to live in freedom. Count on me to fight for Western civilization, which has succeeded in lifting more than 90% of the world’s population out of poverty. MAGA.” \n\nJavier Milei is certainly Argentina’s man for the moment. He’s a true economist’s economist who calls Ludwig von Mises “the greatest economist in history” and routinely quotes Human Action, Friedrich Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, and Murray Rothbard’s Man, Economy, and State. He also understands that wholesale reforms such as the abolition of the country’s central bank will be an arduous process and that allying himself with Trump, and America generally, is his nation’s only hope, especially as many of Argentina’s South American neighbors are drifting further into China’s sphere of influence.\n\nTRUMP BRISTLES AT ARGENTINA BEEF CRITICISM AND SAYS RANCHERS WOULD BE ‘TERRIBLE’ WITHOUT TARIFFS\n\nTrump’s gamble on Milei is working out for all parties involved so far. Milei gets his mandate to continue his “chainsaw” reforms, Argentina receives its currency swaps, and the U.S. strengthens its alliance with what was and could again become one of the hemisphere’s most promising economies. America now has a South American counterweight to Chinese economic advances in countries like Brazil.\n\n“I’m with this man because his philosophy is correct,” Trump said about Milei during a meeting between the two world leaders at the White House earlier this month. Trump is right; if Argentina’s economy can be saved, only a man with Milei’s philosophy can do it, and America should ally itself with anyone who seeks to restore economic freedom to populations that desperately need it. \n\nBrady Leonard (@bradyleonard) is a musician, political strategist, and host of The No Gimmicks Podcast.","summary":"Pollsters expected a rejection of the anarcho-capitalist&#160;Argentinian&#160;President&#160;Javier Milei’s&#160;party, La Libertad Avanza, in Sunday’s midterm&#160;elections.

(EPA Images pic)\nBRASILIA: Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's lawyers on Monday filed an appeal against his 27-year prison sentence for a botched coup bid after his 2022 election loss.\nThe far-right firebrand's lawyers allege \"ambiguities, omissions, contradictions and obscurities\" in the Supreme Court decision finding him guilty of attempting to oust President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in a divisive trial that sparked the ire of US President Donald Trump.\nSupreme Court judges have no deadline to examine the appeal arguments.\nThe plot envisaged the assassination of Lula, his vice president Geraldo Alckmin, and Alexandre de Moraes - one of the five Supreme Court judges deciding Bolsonaro's fate.\nProsecutors said the plan failed only due to a lack of support from military top brass.\nBolsonaro has been under house arrest since August. Under Brazilian law, he will not be sent to prison until all legal avenues are exhausted.\nThiago Bottino, a law professor at the Getuliuo Vargas Foundation, told AFP that while it was unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse its rulings, it had made adjustments, such as to the length of the sentence.\nIf his appeal fails, Bolsonaro could request to serve his sentence under house arrest, claiming poor health.\nThe 70-year-old was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and was briefly admitted to hospital in September after suffering violent bouts of hiccups, vomiting and low blood pressure.\nHe has had multiple health issues and operations in recent years due to complications following a 2018 stabbing in his abdomen while campaigning for president.\nIn May, another former president, Fernando Collor de Mello, was given permission to serve his nearly nine-year sentence for corruption at home, on grounds of ill health.\nBolsonaro's allies in Congress had been pushing for an amnesty bill that could benefit the former president and hundreds of supporters who were convicted of storming government buildings a week after Lula took office in January 2023.\nHowever, the initiative fizzled out after massive protests.\nEven before his conviction, Bolsonaro had been disqualified from seeking public office until 2030 over his unproven fraud allegations against the country's voting system.\nWhile staunch supporters insist there is still a chance for him to be on the ballot in 2026 elections, various names are circulating as a possible replacement as conservative standard bearer.\nThese include Sao Paulo governor Tarcisio de Freitas and former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro.\nLula, who turned 80 on Monday, last week confirmed he would seek a fourth term in office in 2026.\nThe veteran leftist had been bleeding support at the start of the year, but has turned his fortunes around in recent months with his handling of a trade war with the United States.\nUS President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian officials over what he had termed a \"witch hunt\" against his ally Bolsonaro.\nLula's popularity increased as he positioned himself as the defender of Brazilian sovereignty against Trump.\nHe has since scored points for charming Trump and securing the first official face-to-face meeting between the two leaders to negotiate the tariffs in Malaysia over the weekend.","summary":"Lawyers cite 'ambiguities, omissions and contradictions' in the ruling convicting him of trying to oust President Luiz Inacio Lula da

spontaneity the moment calls for.\nOf course, this won’t go down well with the “Mrs Grundy crowd”.\nIn the literary world, “Mrs Grundy” references a character who requires behaviour to conform to

criticism, PAS had found fault with the serving of alcoholic drinks at a dinner reception funded by private donors aimed at preparing tourism agencies for Visit Malaysia Year 2026.\nMore recently, a dinner reception for alumni of a mission school in Ipoh, held on the school’s grounds and at which alcohol was served, also came in for PAS fire.\nGiven PAS’s strictures against the serving of alcohol

million in Bay Area in November","text":"Bay Area food banks and local governments are bracing for a potential surge in hunger if the partial federal government shutdown stretches into November and funding for a key safety net program runs dry.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — also known as food stamps or SNAP — helps about one in eight people in the U.S. pay for groceries, including 5.5 million in California. Anti-poverty advocates say it’s a vital part of the nation’s social safety net. Low-income individuals and families are eligible, and a family of three can receive up to $785 each month to pay for food, plants and seeds at grocery stores and farmers markets. California’s version of the food assistance program is CalFresh.\n\nThose benefits will disappear in November if the ongoing shutdown of the federal government drags through this week.\n\nLast week, White House officials said they would not tap contingency funds to keep food assistance flowing after October, because they are for disaster relief and not legally available to cover regular benefits. Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C. had lobbied the administration of President Donald Trump without success to keep the program running during the shutdown, which reached its 26th day on Monday. The Republican administration has consistently blamed the shutdown on Democrats, who are withholding their votes on a budget agreement to restore Republicans’ cuts to health care spending.\n\nThe California Department of Social Services is texting CalFresh recipients with a heads-up about the possible delay, said a spokesperson for Santa Clara County Executive James Williams. County staff are also informing recipients, he added.\n\nThe evaporation of food assistance would likely hit the region hard. More than half a million people in the core Bay Area receive CalFresh assistance. That includes 176,000 people in Alameda County — a whopping tenth of the population there — and 133,000 people in Santa Clara County.\n\nOfficials and food bank staff are expecting a surge in hunger, and they’re scrambling to prepare.\n\nIn the South Bay, Second Harvest of Silicon Valley distributes food and resources to low-income residents. The nonprofit also helps residents apply for CalFresh benefits. Even before the government shutdown, the food bank served double the number of people it did before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“We know from many years of serving our community that any time safety net services experience cuts, we see more people in our lines,” said spokesperson Diane Baker Hayward. “We, like all the other Bay Area food banks, are getting ready to see more people in our lines.”\n\nHow can others help?\n\n“The most important things we need right now are donations,” she said.\n\nState agencies already are stepping in. Gov. Gavin Newsom is expediting the delivery of $80 million in funds for food banks. A spokesperson for the governor blamed Trump and Republicans for “prolonging” the shutdown and “delaying critical SNAP benefits.”\n\nAbout $3.2 million will flow to Second Harvest, according to the spokesperson. Another $2.4 million will flow to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, plus $2.2 million to the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano.\n\nCounty officials are also stepping in to boost funding.\n\nIn Alameda County, where a quarter of the population doesn’t have enough to eat and doesn’t know where their next meal will come from, the Board of Supervisors is slated to finalize Tuesday pushing $10 million in funding for local food bank networks. The Alameda County Community Food Bank would receive the bulk, $8.3 million, to buy more food and shore up distribution lines, per the meeting’s agenda. The county would tap funds from Measure W, a 2020 sales tax increase voters approved for homelessness services, and funds would still be available after the shutdown ends.\n\nThe Alameda County social services agency is planning to open food distribution sites and deliver food to recipients in a partnership with the food bank “to help mitigate some of the issues around some of the government shutdown and the potential delays in SNAP,” County Supervisor Lena Tam told Bay Area News Group.\n\nTam noted that Newsom had offered to deploy National Guard troops to assist at food banks. But, like others in the region, Tam said the presence of the National Guard could make immigrants nervous enough to stay away from food banks.\n\n“Because of what happened last week with the ICE surge,” she said, “we don’t want to basically create that fear within the community. So the food bank will not be relying on the National Guard.”\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C. have continued to trade barbs and blame during the shutdown, which has also left about 250,000 federal employees in California furloughed or working without pay, according to the White House.\n\nThe administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiation. Democrats are imploring the Republican administration to continue funding SNAP.\n\nDuring the shutdown, the Republican president has used the funding lapse to punish Democrats, tried to lay off thousands of federal workers and seized on the vacuum left by Congress to reconfigure the federal budget for his priorities, The Associated Press reported. Already, Trump’s centerpiece “Big, Beautiful Bill” was expected to remove or reduce SNAP benefits for about 4 million Americans, according to a prominent left-leaning think tank.\n\nDuring a luncheon at the White House with GOP senators this week, Trump introduced his budget director Russ Vought as “Darth Vader” and bragged how he is “cutting Democrat priorities and they’re never going to get them back.”\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat representing part of San Jose, said the “Trump Administration’s move to possibly withhold benefits to 42 million Americans is a cruel and purely political move.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.","summary":"Food stamps in the Bay Area will run out in November if the government stays shut down.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/27/food-benefits-may-not-reach-half-a-million-in-bay-area-in-november/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US_Government_Shutdown_Food_Aid_What_to_Know_25167_9936bd-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:44:29","author":"Grant Stringer","authors":["Grant Stringer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":373181144,"title":"TikTok's Fate May Be Decided This Week After Years of Threats and Bans","text":"After years of political wrangling, lawsuits, looming bans and uncertainty for millions of people, TikTok's long-running dramatic saga might finally conclude this week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to \"consummate\" a long-negotiated agreement on Thursday, allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US under new ownership terms.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\n\n\"The details are ironed out,\" Bessent said, stating that his purpose in the negotiations was \"to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction\" and that it was \"successfully accomplished.\"\n\nIt's possible, of course, that Thursday could come and go without a TikTok deal finalization. Dates and deadlines have been flexible along the way. Trump set numerous deadlines for changes involving TikTok and has bumped those dates several times. TikTok went briefly offline in January hours ahead of a planned ban, but returned the next day.\n\nRead also: TikTok Introduces Parental Controls, Fact-Checking and AI Moderation Features\n\nTikTok's controversial history in the US\n\nTikTok's political rollercoaster began in 2020, when Washington first raised alarms about the app's Chinese ownership and potential data vulnerabilities. Congress passed a 2024 law forcing ByteDance, TikTok's Beijing-based parent, to divest its US operations or face a total ban. Since then, the video-sharing site has faced multiple executive orders, court challenges and failed acquisition attempts.\n\nThe time to make a deal has been running out. The US Supreme Court upheld the divestment order earlier this year, rejecting arguments that a ban would violate free speech. That ruling pushed both sides back to the negotiating table, but there have been numerous delays and shifts to the TikTok deal deadline over the last few months. \n\nTrump signed an executive order on Sept. 25, allowing the new ownership to be US-based and made up of a majority of American investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe all-important algorithm\n\nThe White House confirmed in September that TikTok's algorithm will be operated in the United States and overseen by American tech company Oracle. Private equity firm Silver Lake and Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, will also be among the investors. In September, Trump said that News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch will also be part of the ownership group, but CNN later reported that the Murdochs' media company, Fox Corp, would be the investor, not the two Murdochs individually.\n\nTikTok's algorithm is a major part of the deal. The algorithm is what recommends content to you while you're scrolling on TikTok, and it is controversial because of US concerns that ByteDance, TikTok's original Chinese owner, could be forced by the Chinese government to use those recommendations in pro-Chinese, anti-US ways.\n\nUnder the new TikTok deal, the algorithm will be retrained on US user data. \n\nWhat this means for TikTok users\n\nFor TikTok users, the alleged deal could preserve access to an app that has become a cultural mainstay in the US, eliminating the looming threat of a shutdown or spinoff app. \n\nAs part of the new arrangement, TikTok's US user data will remain stored domestically and managed by a dedicated oversight board, which may appease many Americans with concerns about data privacy. \n\nTrump and Xi will meet again in Korea on Thursday, which means a TikTok deal could be announced by the end of this week. However, implementing the deal and changing ownership will likely take months. \n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a personal friend of Trump, and some users fear his role with TikTok could mean the algorithm could push right-wing political content to users. A recent NPR story reported that analysts say that this could happen, but they will also need to refrain from alienating the existing audience.","summary":"President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to seal a TikTok deal on Thursday, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.","url":"https://www.cnet.com/news/social-media/tiktoks-fate-may-be-decided-this-week-after-years-of-threats-and-bans/","image":"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/fa3aa4acad674b798906660fc38bb25580f44055/hub/2025/10/27/ad67f658-797a-45a2-a145-3389c4591ed7/gettyimages-2237067611.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:44:19","author":"Macy Meyer","authors":["Macy Meyer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":373180346,"title":"Jon Stewart reveals his future at “The Daily Show”","text":"Good news for fans of Jon Stewart onThe Daily Show: the comedian revealed Sunday that he hopes to continue hosting the news satire program.\n\n \"We're working on staying.

The thought of Crapdammy running NYC makes me run to the john.\n\nWhich then brings me to sleazy Sliwa whose mouth is the only thing that works. He never had a real job. Managed what? Invented what? Created what? Sold what? Organized what? Advertised what? Ran what? Disseminated what? Built what? Manufactured what? Earned income from what?\n\nMarried more than once. Trouble paying child support. Home? He once ridiculed a millionaire mansion in Chappaqua. I can understand that because he’s lived in a one-room thing with 17 cats.\n\nWhat’s he done? Accomplished? Nothing. Nada. Zero. He’s just a talker. An open empty throat. His earnings came from WABC radio’s John and Margo Catsimatidis, who live in New York, work in New York, raised their family in New York, pay taxes in New York and whom Sleazy has since now insulted for suggesting that to save this election he take his red beret from his unproductive head and stick it up his pink behind.\n\nHe’s in his 70s and done what? Roscoe the bedbug dog’s done more. He patrolled the subway. Good idea then. Also good for photos and p.r. about sleazy Sliwa which is all this egocentric failure wants.\n\nUnderstand, he can’t do anything. Never even managed a gigantic one-bedroom house. Doesn’t have a summer home, weekend home or foreign home. Knows nothing besides kitty litter and how to wear that omni-stupid red beret for fear nobody will recognize him without it. Never ever invited to any A-1 gala. No president, chief of state, Boy Scout troop leader, Arab emir, garbage collector, nobody, no-how ever requested his opinion on problems municipal. And this is what’s running to lead the richest, greatest, toughest No. 1 city in the world?\n\nThis city houses Spike Lee, Robert De Niro, Taylor Swift, Sarah Jessica, Daniel Radcliffe, Denzel Washington, Hugh Jackman, Alec Baldwin, Justin Timberlake, Donald Trump, Adam Driver, Jerry Seinfeld, Jamie Dimon some partridge in a pear tree, etc., etc., and they’ll all hearken to an unemployed nothing wearing a red wool hat and holding an alley cat?!\n\nSo VIP important and valuable to the City of New York that I last saw him inhaling free candy from WABC’s goodie shelves. His open mouth only closed over peanuts, M&Ms and pretzels that he himself didn’t spend to buy. And this is what anyone can vote for in a city that has Rock Center, St. Patrick’s, the Statue of Liberty, Bronx Zoo, Central Park, Greenwich Village, Chinatown, Freedom Tower, MoMA, Broadway, best steaks, best cheesecake, best bagels, best franks, Fifth Avenue, Financial Center, Botanical Center, Park Avenue, the Met, Coney Island?\n\nRunning New York City is what this nonsolvent unemployed red beret BS-er with his cats is what he thinks he can do? Besides ripping that dirty old hat off? You looking to vote for him? And a blessing on your head, mazel tov, mazel tov. Listen, I hear this candidate was in Atlantic City recently — and he so far lost his car, his watch and his money. Also his ability to win the mayoralty.\n\nMeanwhile, as the world is going to hell — while POTUS is directing the world — someone in a Donald Trump blue suit, white shirt and red tie with a Donald mask is right now, just at this minute — directly across from Trump Tower — forget Russia, Ukraine, China, Taiwan, Iran, Venezuela, some unemployed other nobody cat lover in a one-room apartment voting for possibly Sliwa or Crapdami is actually standing right smack in the middle of Fifth Avenue directing traffic as cars are whizzing by.

Email adam.pogrund@dailymail.co.uk \nBy FREYA BARNES, NEWS REPORTER and ADAM POGRUND, TRAINEE REPORTER\n Published:23:35 GMT, 27 October 2025 |Updated:23:35 GMT, 27 October 2025 \n\nNew footage has emerged showing the protester who heckled King Charles over Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein's relationship being pulled back by a bystander.\nThe anti-monarchy protester - from the campaign group Republic - shouted questions about the Prince and convicted sex trafficker Epstein as the King visited Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire. \nThe heckler's identity remains unknown but a new angle of the outburst shows him being pulled back by a frustrated onlooker as he launched the tirade. \nThe furious demonstrator, a brown haired man who was wearing a green jacket and holding his phone to record the King, was jeered by crowds after he yelled at the monarch. \nAs the King walked past, the protester shouted: 'How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\n'Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?\n'Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?'\nThe King chose to ignore the heckler, showing no reaction while other people outside Lichfield Cathedral told the heckler to 'shut up' as the King made his way through the crowd, greeting fans and tuning out the chaos.\n\nNew footage has emerged showing the protester who heckled King Charles over Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein 's relationship\n\nThe furious brown haired man can be seen wearing a green jacket and holding his phone to record the King \n\nOther people outside Lichfield Cathedral told the heckler to 'shut up' as the King made his way through the crowd, greeting fans and tuning out the chaos\nIt comes as the King faces mounting pressure to kick his brother out of his Royal Lodge home where he has lived rent-free for over 20 years.\nAndrew has only paid 'peppercorn' rent for the last 20 years, and while he initially tried to dig his heels in by citing the terms of his 'cast iron' lease with the Crown Estate, it is understood he will finally move out.\nThe prince still has 50 years left on his pre-paid lease and it not known exactly how much money he could receive in compensation for the £7.5million he has spent on Royal Lodge renovations.\nOn Sunday night, it was claimed Andrew and Fergie have finally agreed to leave their sprawling mansion - but have demanded two homes in return.\nThe 65-year-old is said to have requested Harry and Meghan's former home, Frogmore Cottage, while Fergie is eyeing up nearby Adelaide Cottage ahead of William and Kate's departure next month.\nThe Prince's links to Epstein have dominated headlines recently with fresh focus on his sex accuser Virginia Giuffre's claims after her posthumous book was published.\nLast week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Andrew tried to involve the Metropolitan Police and one of Queen Elizabeth's most senior aides in a campaign to smear Virginia Giuffre, who had accused him of assaulting her as a teenager.\nA bombshell email obtained exposed how Andrew asked his taxpayer-funded police bodyguard to investigate the 'lying' young woman.\n\nThe King was heckled as he greeted people in the crowd who had lined up behind metal barriers outside Lichfield Cathedral\n\nIn line with the Royal family's usual response to unwanted questions or criticism - never complain, never explain - the King chose to ignore the heckler, showing no reaction (Pictured: The King inside Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire)\nShockingly, the prince passed on details of her date of birth and social security number, presumably given to him by Epstein.\nHe also claimed Virginia, who took her own life earlier this year, had criminal convictions, a claim which has not been backed up by any evidence or confirmed by police and has been strongly denied by her family.\nAn earlier email exposé proved that Andrew lied to Buckingham Palace and the British public when he claimed he had cut off all contact with his close friend in December 2010, following Epstein's release from prison on child-sex charges.\nTwelve weeks later, he emailed the paedophile financier to say they were 'in this together' and sickeningly expressed his wish to 'play some more soon'.\nHis ex wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also been living in Royal Lodge, came under fire in recent weeks as astonishing new emails claimed Epstein had secretly bankrolled her for 15 years.\nThe convicted paedophile complained to friends about the disgraced duchess's scrounging ways in messages that suggest his financial support went far beyond the £15,000 she admitted taking from him.\nIn the previously unseen emails, Epstein reveals Fergie was so desperate to cosy up to him that 'she was the first to celebrate' his release from jail 'with her two daughters in tow'. Princess Beatrice would have been 20 at the time and Eugenie 19, the same age as many of his victims.\nThe shocking claims are contained in a huge tranche of documents under review by the US Congress. They are set to be released once they have been redacted to protect the identity of hundreds of young girls Epstein raped and sexually abused.\nLast month, the MoS revealed how Fergie wrote to Epstein calling him a 'supreme friend', just weeks after giving an interview claiming she would 'never have anything to do with' the sex offender ever again – reviving the scandal that saw her and Andrew relinquish their titles on Friday.\n\nPrince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson (pictured in 2019) are facing increased scrutiny over their friendship with Jeffrey Epstein\n\nIt comes as the King faces mounting pressure to kick his brother out of his Royal Lodge home (pictured) where he has lived rent-free for over 20 years \nIn the London Evening Standard interview of March 7, 2011 Fergie issued a 'heartfelt apology' for accepting £15,000 from Epstein and called it 'a giant error of judgment'.\nThe comment angered the financier, who sent an email to his friend, French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, that day, complaining: 'The duchess that I have financially helped for 15 years said that she wants nothing to do with a paedophile and child sex abuser. It has caused quite a stir.'\nBrunel was later arrested on rape charges and killed himself in jail in 2022, three years after Epstein's own jail suicide.\nEpstein demanded Fergie write him a public letter of apology over the interview and threatened to sue her if she did not.\nIn Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir, she claimed Prince Andrew remarked that Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were 'just a little younger than you' on the first night they allegedly had sex.\nOn the day Ms Giuffre says she met the prince in March 2001, Maxwell woke her up at her London townhouse and told her she was going to have a 'special day' and 'just like Cinderella' she would meet a 'handsome prince'.\nWhen Andrew arrived, Maxwell told him to guess her age. The prince, then 41, 'guessed correctly' that she was 17, she recalled, and he added: 'My daughters are just a little younger than you.'\nMs Giuffre said she remembered running for her disposable camera to snap the now infamous picture of her with Andrew – saying that 'my mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture'. The prince has repeatedly denied her claims.\n\nPrince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein pictured together in Central Park in 2011 \n\nVirginia Giuffre photographed with Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001 \nLater that night, Ms Giuffre claimed she went to Tramp nightclub with Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where the prince 'sweated profusely' – despite him later insisting a medical condition made this impossible. Maxwell instructed her: 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.'\nMs Giuffre doubled down on her claim she and Andrew had a bath together.\nShe wrote: 'We didn't stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.'\nShe added: 'He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.'\nEpstein later gave her $15,000 'for servicing the man the tabloids called \"Randy Andy\",' she said.\nMs Giuffre repeated her fiercely denied claim that Andrew took part in an orgy with her and 'approximately eight other young girls' on Epstein's Caribbean island of Little St James, known as 'Paedo Island', in 2001.\nShe wrote: 'It was not just the two of us this time; it was an orgy. The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18, and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.'\n\nFergie pictured with Princess Eugenie (L) and Princess Beatrice (R), at a film premiere in 2009\n\nThe convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein reportedly claimed he bankrolled the former duchess for 15 years (Pictured in 2017 in prison mugshot)\nAndrew has always strenuously denied Ms Giuffre's claims.\nPrince Andrew insisted Ms Giuffre sign a gagging order – so he did not embarrass the late Queen during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022, the book claims.\nAfter Ms Giuffre launched a court action against the prince for alleged rape and emotional distress, she was paid a reported £10million in a settlement in which the prince did not admit any wrongdoing. He has consistently and vehemently denied all her claims.\nMs Giuffre said she agreed to stay silent for at least one year, as part of the settlement, saying it 'seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished'.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNew video emerges of King Charles heckler being pulled by bystander after he yelled at monarch about Prince Andrew \n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

(EPA Images pic)\nCARACAS: Venezuela claimed Monday to have dismantled a CIA-financed cell plotting a false-flag attack on a US warship deployed to the southern Caribbean, as Washington stepped up pressure on Caracas by flying bombers nearby.\nVenezuelan authorities said they uncovered an operation targeting the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer which docked Sunday in Trinidad – within firing distance of the Venezuelan mainland.\nThe Pentagon has so far deployed seven warships to the Caribbean and one to the Gulf of Mexico, ostensibly for anti-drug operations.\nPresident Donald Trump has also announced the imminent arrival of the USS Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, and its accompanying fleet.\nVenezuela and some observers believe Trump's administration is using the military deployments to build pressure on the government and depose Nicolas Maduro, whom Washington does not recognise as the legitimate president.\n\"At least four suspects were arrested,\" interior minister Diosdado Cabello said. Caracas claimed the dismantled cell was \"financed by the CIA\" and planned to attack the destroyer and frame Venezuela.\nNo further details of the alleged suspects were offered. Venezuela regularly claims to have arrested US-backed mercenaries working to destabilise Maduro's administration.\nAlongside his naval buildup, Trump recently confirmed authorising CIA operations in Venezuela and considering ground strikes.\nSince September, US forces have destroyed at least 10 boats they said carried narcotics, killing 43 people in international waters.\nExperts question the legality of the deadly attacks, and Washington has offered no proof other than aerial videos of the strikes to link the vessels to trafficking.\nThe USS Gravely's arrival Sunday sparked outrage in Caracas, which called it a \"provocation\" and claimed it was \"aimed at provoking a war in the Caribbean\".\nB-1 Bombers \nTensions rose further Monday as two US B-1B bombers flew over the Caribbean near Venezuela, the third such show of force in recent weeks.\nData from tracking website Flightradar24 showed the two bombers – which took off from a base in the northern US state of North Dakota – flying parallel to the Venezuelan coast before disappearing from view.\nEarlier missions included a B-1B sortie last week and a B-52 flight earlier this month, signalling Washington's readiness to escalate pressure on Maduro's government.\nWashington and Caracas have for years been at loggerheads, with the US rejecting Maduro's election victories in 2018 and 2024 as fraudulent.\nVenezuela's vice president Delcy Rodriguez urged suspending gas deals with Trinidad in retaliation to Washington's pressure, raising the cost of the crisis for the United States and its ally.\nTrinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar rejected what she called Venezuelan \"blackmail\", telling AFP her country remains committed to security and energy cooperation.\nWashington recently cleared Trinidad and Tobago to exploit the Dragon gas field in Venezuelan waters despite a US oil embargo, deepening friction between the neighbours.\nMaduro, who denies US allegations he leads a drug-trafficking network, accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\" for political purposes.","summary":"Authorities reported uncovering a plan against the USS Gravely, a US destroyer docked near Venezuelan shores in Trinidad.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/28/venezuela-claims-cia-false-flag-attack-foiled-as-us-deploys-bombers","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3e3194fd-uss-gravely-28102025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:32:26","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.046},{"id":373175954,"title":"The global reset of a new American leadership","text":"From Shamsul Saad\nMalaysia and our thought-makers have always been late to the party. We tend to follow Western trends to our detriment, always a decade or more too late. We lack the foresight beyond so-called conventional mainstream wisdom of the day.\nHere is the main problem. Our thought leaders and policies tend to be trapped by the narratives of the global mainstream media and opinion-makers, which for the most part have been driven by globalisation and a capital market-driven worldview since the Bill Clinton administration and the formation of the European Union.\nAt the same time, fired up by Vice-President Al Gore’s climate alarmism and Western Europe’s feverish adoption of such policies, welfarist-socialism and lax immigration, the Western world turned away from reasoned, manufacturing-driven capitalism to liberal socialism fuelled by capital market growth via offshoring to cheaper locations in the developing world.\nAnd with this so-called multilateralism emerged a new economic power, unleashed by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms for China and its entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.\nPeople forget that China was already an emerging economy prior to WTO; it just went into steroids after. Its GDP in 1978 was US$150 billion and ballooned to US$1.4 trillion by 2001. Now it is US$18.8 trillion.\nFrom a geopolitical standpoint, the world was already in a multi-polar state at the turn of the century with three powerful blocs: the US, China, and Russia. And yet today, decades later, people look at the current geopolitics and claim we are just now in a multipolar world.\nMy thesis is that this perspective and world view could never be more wrong.\nNeed to see the change for what it is\nToday, the US is unleashing a different kind of American unipolar leadership under President Donald Trump and his administration. And the foundation being laid down today by this administration, coupled with current geopolitical and economic realities of China, Western Europe, and the rest of the world, and the reality of long-term US domestic politics, will ensure this foundation will continue and be built upon over the next two decades, at the very least.\nWe, in Malaysia, need to comprehend and understand this reality instead of going along with the mainstream narrative of the last two decades. The old US establishment and neo-con world order of post-WWII is being dismantled, and Trump and his version of the Republican Party is dragging everyone kicking and screaming, whether you like it or not.\nTo understand why, one must truly understand that the global mainstream media has been a natural leftist narrative and in the US, pro-Democrat in leaning — it is anti-Republican, and especially anti-Trump, at its core.\nContrary to popular thought, I believe we are seeing a re-emergence of a unipolar world with US global leadership at its helm.\nWestern Europe has effectively lost its imperial power of the previous centuries, and its treasures accumulated through capitalism have been squandered on socialist and welfare-heavy policies over the past 40 years.\nIts economy, which was bigger in nominal terms than the US in the early 2000s, is no longer. It has been taxed to death in more ways than one. Today the US economy is bigger by about US$9 trillion to US$10 trillion more, for a superpower that was supposedly seen as in decline.\nThe other supposed polarity used to be Russia. It embarked upon a war with tiny Ukraine which should have ended in four weeks, but has now stretched almost four years. And the only help Ukraine has had is US defensive weaponry. The Russian economy is bleeding, and its war is funded primarily from the purchase of its oil by China and India.\nThe China story\nThe big kahuna that is strutting around, especially among the anti-American and pro-Eastern crowd, is China.\nChina’s GDP is the second largest on earth at US$18.8 trillion in 2024 (compared to the US at US$29.2 trillion). On the other hand, its GDP per capita is only about US$13,000, slightly above ours of about US$12,000. In comparison, GDP per capita in Singapore and the US are about US$90,000.\nThe fact is that China is not the superpower most commentators seemed to project. It has sustained an economic growth based on a productivity boost, like any developing nation shifting from an agrarian economy to an industrial one since the Deng reformation of 1978. It is not a miracle; it’s been done everywhere that transition occurs, just with almost a billion population to start with, hence the size of its massive economic growth.\nThe problem is that its GDP-driven KPI for every official, mayor, and regional leader of the one-party state is unfortunately also a reason for its eventual stagnation. Capital allocation is about production irrespective of consumption. You build and build and build at whatever cost, because it is all about GDP growth. You have gleaming buildings and infrastructure with no domestic consumption.\nChina is unfortunately stuck with these structural and systemic problems in not a good way. For instance, its decision to make their monopoly of rare earth minerals a power-play will have unintended negative consequences.\nNo seller has ever won fighting its consumers. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) already tried that and lost big time, and China is about to find out the same.\nThe American era\nSo here we are in the middle of a resurgent American economy and leadership. You may not like the swagger, but this is a new era of US global leadership through the prism of a cabinet full of practical business-people and led by one “blue collar” billionaire.\nWar is not their game, but they will use that military might if they have to. Take that “peace through strength” to heart, because these guys mean it.\nIn less than 10 months, this Trump administration has hit the ground running and firing on all cylinders on multiple fronts, domestic and international, at break-neck speed never seen before in any US administration, at least in my lifetime.\nOn the domestic front: former President Joe Biden’s open border immigration has been essentially shut down, tariff talks has yielded a treasure trove of revenue with nary an impact on inflation, on-shoring never thought possible is happening and commitments of investments in multiple trillions that will see their drawdowns and impact as early as within the next 12 months, and in spite of aggressive government cuts, GDP has grown beyond expectation at 3.9% (the biggest key to cut their debt levels) and the stock-market is at record highs.\nIn the geo-political arena, the global impact is even more pronounced. Multilateralism and globalism is definitely not on the cards for this administration. Their modus is bilateral economic and political partnerships and reciprocal trading. They are playing a highly skilled poker game on a global table of multiple players and they are winning.\nTrade and their leverage as the largest global consumer market is the negotiating hand they play for achieving end to wars, ceasefires and economic capitulation.\nBRICS is as good as dead with a hobbled Chinese non-consumption economy, a Russia dependent on external assistance and an India that has no capacity to unify its own national economic policy due its disparate regionalism and massive unwieldy bureaucracy.\nAll of these have handed Trump, and the US, a global condition whose leadership is ripe for the taking. They are seizing it to the hilt with a Middle East peace initiative unimagined a year ago backed by Arab and major Muslim nations. On the energy policy front, net zero carbon initiatives, agree or disagree, is dead in the water as the International Maritime Organization admitted its failure to adopt their proposed framework.\nRead the tea leaves, ladies and gentlemen, rather than being led and informed in your opinions by the left-leaning mainstream derision of the Trump presidency. The times they are a-changin’, and we, in Malaysia and our leadership, better know how to navigate this new world order as set by President Trump and his more than likely successor JD Vance.\n\nShamsul Saad is a former managing director of Perdana Petroleum Bhd and the co-host of ‘The Gutshot Podcast’.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"Malaysia is at the crossroads in navigating a Trump-led geopolitical change that is redefining the century.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/10/28/the-global-reset-of-a-new-american-leadership-2","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/e6bc12dc-1_asean_donald_trump_moganraj_fmt_26102025-copy-5.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:30:42","author":"Letter To The Editor","authors":["Letter To The Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.205}]}
