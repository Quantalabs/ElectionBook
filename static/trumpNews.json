Protests in BET Speech: “What Type of Government Is That?”","text":"Doechii took home the title of best female hip hop artist at the 2025 BET Awards, and she used her acceptance speech to shed light on the ongoing protests against unlawful immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\n The “Alter Ego” rapper noted that it was her first time attending the awards ceremony and showed love toward her fellow nominees before noting that “as much as I’m honored by this award, I do want to address what’s happening right now outside of the building.” \n\n “There are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,” she said. “Trump is using military forces to stop a protest, and I want y’all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us.”\n\n “What type of government is that?” Doechii questioned on stage at the 25th BET Awards. On Sunday, a BET spokesperson confirmed that the ceremony would go ahead as planned despite the protests.\n\n A wave of immigration raids in L.A. sparked last week, which led to clashes between protestors and law enforcement across the county. On Sunday, residents gathered around City Hall and the federal courthouse, bringing a freeway to a stop in protest of President Donald Trump’s move to deploy the state’s National Guard. California Gov. Gavin Newsom formally requested that the Trump Administration “rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles County and return them to my command.”\n\n “People are being swept up and torn from their families, and I feel it’s my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people: For Black people, for Latino people, for trans people, for the people in Gaza,” Doechii added. “We all deserve to live in hope and not in fear, and I hope we stand together, my brothers and my sisters, against hate and we protest against it. Thank you, BET.”\n\n Heading into Monday night, Kendrick Lamar topped the nomination list with 10 nods, with the “Denial Is A River” rapper, Future, GloRilla, Future and Drake following close behind with six noms each. The “Yeah Glo!” rapper, too, served as one of the night’s performers alongside Lil Wayne, Teyana Taylor, Playboi Carti and Leon Thomas. \n\n Kevin Hart hosted the 2025 BET Awards at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.","summary":"\"I want y'all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us,\" the \"Alter Ego\" rapper said Monday night.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/doechii-ruthless-attacks-los-angeles-ice-protests-bet-speech-1236260346/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2218844680-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 01:13:47","author":"McKinley Franklin","authors":["McKinley Franklin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.194},{"id":329758124,"title":"World News | US and China Are Holding Trade Talks in London After Trump's Phone Call with Xi","text":"London, Jun 10 (AP) High-level delegations from the United States and China met in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that has roiled the global economy. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at Lancaster House, an ornate 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.

Wang Wentao, China's commerce minister, also was part of Beijing's delegation. The talks, which may continue on Tuesday, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war.

The two countries announced on May 12 they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100 per cent-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession. The US and China are the world's biggest and second-biggest economies. Chinese trade data shows that exports to the United States fell 35 per cent in May from a year earlier. Since the Geneva talks, the US and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, visas for Chinese students at American universities and \"rare earth\" minerals that are vital to car makers and other industries. President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the following day that the trade talks would resume in London. Rare earths were expected to be a focus of the talks. The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a licence to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production. Beijing indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well as US firms. Kevin Hassett, a US economic adviser, told CNBC on Monday that he expected a short meeting with \"a big, strong handshake\" on rare earths. The UK government says it is providing the venue and logistics but is not involved in the talks, though British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves met with both Bessent and He on Sunday, and UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds was due to meet Wang. \"We are a nation that champions free trade and have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody's interests, so we welcome these talks,\" the British government said in a statement.

But one less expected Musk adversary is more powerful than them all: the Sun.\n\nSpaceX's vast network of Starlink internet service satellites are \"dropping like flies\", due to an extraterrestrial weather phenomenon caused by the Sun, said Futurism. And it's only set to get worse.\n'Particularly prone' to early burn-up\nThe thousands of Starlink satellites orbiting our planet have given space scientists a \"golden opportunity to study the effects\" of the Sun's activity on the lifespan of these \"minimalist, constellation-based spacecraft\", said Futurism. And it appears that Musk's \"space internet constellation\" is \"particularly prone to the effect of geomagnetic storms\", triggered by eruptions from the Sun, said The Independent. These \"ferocious solar storms\", Nasa scientists have found, are causing many of Musk's low-orbit satellites to fall to Earth \"faster than expected\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

However, so far, the \"only known instance\" of this happening was in August 2024, when a piece of a Starlink satellite was discovered on a farm in Canada.\n'Only so much can be done'\nThe solar storm problem threatens one of Musk's biggest power grabs to date. When his engineers \"bundled a batch of prototype satellites into a rocket's nose cone six years ago, there were fewer than 2,000 functional satellites in Earth's orbit\". Now more than 7,000 of his satellites now surround Earth, \"like a cloud of gnats\", said The Atlantic.\nThis is the most dominant any individual has been in the \"orbital realm\" since the late 1950s, when Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the Soviet engineer who developed Sputnik and its launch vehicle, was \"the only guy in town\" as far as satellites were concerned, space historian Jonathan McDowell told the magazine.\nBut the Sun is an adversary not even Musk can overcome. Solar storm forecasting \"has significantly improved over the past few years\", Piyush Mehta, a US professor of aerospace engineering, wrote on The Conversation in 2022 but \"there is only so much shielding that can be done in the face of a powerful geomagnetic storm\". The Sun is \"essential for life to go on,\" he said, but, like a child who often throws tantrums, \"its ever-changing disposition make things challenging\".\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nChas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nChas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

On Saturday, President Donald Trump bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom to deploy 300 National Guard troops to assist ICE, a move that Newsom staunchly opposed. Leaders across the Bay Area decried the use of the military in response to the protests.\n\nEarlier Monday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta confirmed plans to sue the federal government for deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles.\n\nThe protests also came on the heels of an uptick in immigration enforcement in some parts of the Bay Area. In San Jose on Friday, about 50 protestors marched in response to several immigration arrests in the city in the prior week.\n\nAttendees at Monday’s protest in San Jose held signs proclaiming “abolish ICE” and “immigrants make America great!” as they stood along Santa Clara Street, where they received honks of support. Some played songs such as “Fortunate Son” and tracks from “Hamilton,” while others waved American and California state flags.\n\n“We are experiencing an attack on our community,” San Jose City Councilmember Pamela Campos said in a speech. “We will counter Trump’s lies with the truth about our immigrant communities. And the fact is, immigrant families are the hardest working taxpayers in our country.”\n\nCampos implored the crowd to “lead with compassion.”\n\n“We know that those in power will use any pretext for a violent escalation,” Campos said.\n\nIn East Oakland, about two dozen people gathered at MacArthur Boulevard and High Street, waving signs declaring “stop the coup” and “dump Trump.” It marked the latest installment of a weekly gathering of neighbors at the intersection who have protested against the Trump administration.\n\n“I worry about authoritarianism,” said Lisa Claxton, 50, who has helped organize the weekly gathering. She voiced concerns that the president’s mobilization of military forces would lead to “trumping up violence,” all to eventually suppress dissent.\n\nMany speakers at the protest in San Jose lambasted the city’s new policies for dealing with unhoused individuals. Many pushed for the prioritization of housing and immigration support in the city’s new budget.\n\nThis is a developing story.

One official warned, however, that the order was just signed and it could take a day or two to get troops moving.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.Governor Gavin Newsom called the move reckless and disrespectful to our troops in a post on the social platform X. This isn't about public safety. It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego, Newsom said.The Pentagon also deployed about 700 Marines to Los Angeles on Monday to help National Guard members respond to protests over immigration raids, officials said, as California sued Trump over his use of the Guard troops and demonstrators took to the city's streets for a fourth day.The Marines are being deployed from their base at Twentynine Palms in the Southern California desert to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents, US Northern Command said in a statement.Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement on Monday afternoon he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a significant logistical and operational challenge for them.California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops by telling reporters that Trump had trampled the state's sovereignty. We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilising California National Guard troops, Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began on Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people that day across the city.The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown on Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.The law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars from neighbouring cities blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.The clashes unfolded over just a few square blocks in an immense city of some 4 million people, most of whom went about their normal business on peaceful streets.Early protests remained peaceful On Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a USD 50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.Early protests on Monday had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release.Protesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention centre where Huerta was being held, and at times sang in front of a line of police officers, who unsuccessfully asked people to move off the road and onto the sidewalk. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organisers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.Chanting against a line of National Guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, Free them all! and National Guard go away. Bonta accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger with his announcement of the deployment, saying he set off Sunday's clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. This was not inevitable, he said.Trump said on Monday that the city would have been completely obliterated if he had not deployed the Guard.Later, at a White House event, he added that state leaders were afraid to do anything. Other protests were taking shape on Monday afternoon across LA County, as confirmed reports of federal immigration agents in the cities of Whittier and Huntington Park south of Los Angeles spurred anger from activists. More protests were scheduled for cities across the country.Outside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.The family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him. Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household, Vasquez's brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.On Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects ranging from rocks to electric scooters at police and their vehicles.McDonnell said police officers were overwhelmed by the remaining protesters. who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. McDonnell said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.Governor says Guard not needed Newsom urged Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday, calling it a serious breach of state sovereignty. The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction. Trump wants chaos and he's instigated violence, he said. Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for. The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said California authorities had the situation under control.The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.In a directive on Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.

They attribute the turmoil in Los Angeles to President Donald Trump’s actions.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\n“This represents intentional cruelty. The message is, ‘You don’t belong here.’ However, we have a response: We’re staying put,” stated Illinois Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García. “This isn’t concerned with safety. It’s about control. Fear is their weapon, and their aim is silence.”\n\nSupporters of immigrant rights joined with labor unions and elected officials at Chicago’s Daley Plaza on Monday to raise a voice of resistance against recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainments in Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n“What is happening right now is about silencing voices,” SEIU President of Local 1 Genie Kastrup said. “It’s about dividing working people. It’s about dividing our communities against the haves and have nots, and it’s about abusing power.”\n\nICE has subpoenaed the city of Chicago to obtain personal information of applicants in the CityKey ID program, which is widely used by immigrants and includes their personal information.\n\n“We call on the city to refuse to turn over to the federal government any information from our city key municipal ID program, since DHS clearly wants to use this information for immigration enforcement,” Palenque LSNA Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera said.\n\nREAD MORE | Chicago leaders call for investigation after South Loop ICE operation, calling it an ‘entrapment’\n\nThis comes after ICE agents wearing masks detained a number of individuals who received messages to come in for a status update at an immigration office in Chicago’s South Loop last week.\n\n“What we saw last week and over the weekend wasn’t lawful enforcement. It was a belligerent power grab,” García said.\n\nIn Los Angeles over the weekend, demonstrations against ICE activities turned chaotic.\n\nThe Trump administration is mobilizing 700 U.S. Marines to support National Guard troops in Los Angeles. It is a rare use of presidential power that has not been seen in this country in decades.\n\nTrump on Monday said the decision is necessary to preserve law and order. California’s governor says federal assistance is not needed, accusing the president of trying to “manufacture a crisis.”\n\nThe mayor of Los Angeles said demonstrations have mostly been peaceful. However, recent video footage has shown objects being thrown at police and vehicles set on fire.\n\nActivists in Chicago are blaming the Trump administration for the chaos that has ensued in Los Angeles.\n\n“It’s plain and clear that Trump is escalating to advance his hateful agenda and resorting to tactics that place people from all communities, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, in danger,” said Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights Executive Director Lawrence Benito. “Their tactic to incite violence is clearly intentional, and it creates a moment that Trump will certainly exploit and act even more harm.”\n\nOther immigrant advocates say while they do not condone the violent response in Los Angeles, they do not believe it hurts their cause in advocating for immigrants being treated justly.\n\n“I think what hurts our cause is families being separated, children being torn apart from parents’ arms, and many times, single parents. And, you know, families are scrambling to figure out who’s going to take care of the children,” said Illinois Latino Agenda Co-Chair Marcela Rodriguez.\n\nThere are also concerns about the fallout from the recent ICE activity in Chicago.\n\nREAD MORE | Broadview protesters demand release of Chicago mother detained by ICE during routine check-in\n\nThere was no sign of ICE activity in Little Village on Monday, and people were out, going about their business, although perhaps it was not as busy as it might have been.\n\n“We believe that they’re being done in very misleading way, very inhumane way, separating families, and it really is unnecessary, and unfortunately, fears are very heightened. Anxiety is very high as well in our communities,” Rodriguez said.\n\nAdvocates say the situation has created fear, with many wondering what and when ICE’s next move in Chicago might be.\n\n“Given what they’ve done since day one, no, I don’t think this is the end. Since day one, they’ve created a lot of obstructions at every step of the process for folks trying to normalize their status,” said Beyond Legal Aid Sr. Staff Attorney A.J. Johnson Reyes.\n\nThese recent ICE actions come as Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is in Washington, D.C. prepping for his appearance on Thursday before a House committee investigating sanctuary states. He is one of three governors called to testify.\n\nRELATED | What to know about Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to LA protests","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; Earlier Monday, advocates for immigration rights gathered downtown to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chicago ICE Raids Spark Protests: Advocates Rally at Daley Plaza, Criticize Trump for Los Angeles Unrest first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chicago-ice-raids-spark-protests-advocates-rally-at-daley-plaza-criticize-trump-for-los-angeles-unrest/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Chicago-ICE-raids-protests-today-Advocates-hold-Daley-Plaza-protest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 00:32:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.007},{"id":329759580,"title":"GOP lawmaker reveals how travel ban helps protect country from threats","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics June 09, 2025 05:48 \n\n GOP lawmaker reveals how travel ban helps protect country from threats \n Rep.

The initiative includes opening $1,000 investment accounts for every American baby born between 2025 and 2029, reports the Guardian. The MAGA supremo describes this move as “a pro-family” effort, which is part of a sweeping bill that has passed the House but still faces hurdles in the Senate. The accounts are dubbed as “Trump accounts,” and would be tax-deferred and track stock market performance. “For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said during a White House roundtable with major business leaders. Parents or guardians will manage these \"Trump accounts,\" which allow up to $5,000 in additional annual contributions from private sources. Trump pitched the initiative as a way for families to benefit directly from the strength of the American economy. “It’s a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation,” he said. The plan has received strong backing from several prominent CEOs, including Michael Dell, Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi, Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Robinhood's Vladimir Tenev. Trump applauded their commitment, saying they were “really the greatest business minds we have today” and that they were “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account.” House Speaker Mike Johnson also praised the scheme. “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one,” he said. “Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.” The accounts are part of what Trump calls his “one big, beautiful bill.” The bill is a sweeping budget package that, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), could add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also warned that the proposed changes, which include cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, could leave nearly 11 million more Americans without healthcare by 2034. Despite the criticism, Trump remains optimistic. “Beneficiaries would really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future,” he said. Johnson warned that failing to pass the bill would lead to “the largest tax increase in American history.” Johnson urged lawmakers to back what he called “pro-growth legislation” to benefit all Americans.","summary":"Donald Trump has introduced a federal initiative to bolster financial security for future generations, proposing $1,000 investment accounts for American babies born between 2025 and 2029.

The legislation faces a tougher path in the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns over its broader fiscal implications. While Trump insists the bill is “fully funded through targeted reforms,” including welfare changes and a remittance tax, the Congressional Budget Office last week reported it would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also projected that 10.9 million more Americans would be without healthcare by 2034 due to cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The accounts resemble 529 college savings plans but with lower contribution limits, prompting some financial advisors to question their investment value. Similar programs have existed elsewhere: the UK operated a Child Trust Fund from 2002 to 2011, while Singapore continues to run a Baby Bonus Scheme with matched savings incentives.

Last week, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital that public school districts must \"certify in writing\" by June 9 that they will not abide by the California Interscholastic Federation’s gender identity rules. \"Knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Dhillon wrote in the letter. RILEY GAINES TALKS PUBLIC'S REACTION TO SIMONE BILES' PERSONAL ATTACK: 'ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR HER' The California Interscholastic Federation governs public and private high school sports in the state and has a bylaw that requires its members to recognize gender identity in sports. All students should be able to participate in school sports \"in a manner that is consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on a student’s records,\" the bylaw states. Dhillon, a former California-based conservative attorney, said the certifications she is seeking from the public school districts will \"ensure compliance\" with Title IX and help them to \"avoid legal liability.\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement the lawsuit was filed \"in anticipation of imminent legal retaliation against California’s school systems\" failing to adhere to Dhillon’s demand, according to the Los Angeles Times. \"The President and his Administration are demanding that California school districts break the law and violate the Constitution — or face legal retaliation. They’re demanding that our schools discriminate against the students in their care and deny their constitutionally protected rights,\" Bonta wrote. \"As we’ve proven time and again in court, just because the President disagrees with a law, that doesn’t make it any less of one.\" The Justice Department had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. The DOJ previously filed a lawsuit against Maine after the state repeatedly thumbed its nose at President Donald Trump’s executive order to keep males out of girls’ and women’s sports. The Justice Department accused Maine of \"openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The latest chapter in California between the state and the Trump administration came days after transgender athlete AB Hernandez won state championships in the girls’ division.

Helmeted troops in camouflage gear, carrying guns, were stationed at a detention centre downtown, where pepper spray and tear gas were fired into a crowd.\n\nThe order came from Trump, without state approval, in response to several days of protests over federal immigration raids.\n\nWhy did the protests start?\n\nThe weekend’s unrest started on Saturday AEST after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted enforcement operations in the city, arresting at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations.\n\nAngelica Salas, executive director of the immigrants’ rights organisation CHIRLA, said lawyers had not had access to those detained, which she called “very worrying”.\n\nTrump has pledged to deport record numbers of people in the country illegally and lock down the US-Mexico border, with the White House setting a goal for ICE to arrest at least 3,000 migrants per day.\n\nBut the sweeping immigration crackdown has also caught up people legally residing in the country, including some with permanent residence, and has led to legal challenges.\n\nWhat was the initial response?\n\nAround 300 troops arrived in LA amid ongoing protests, with some later facing off with demonstrators in front of a detention centre, as the situation escalated. Source: AAP / Eric Thayer/AP\n\nAs federal agents set up a staging area near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators tried to block border patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. \n\nWhen did Donald Trump step in?\n\nOn Saturday evening AEST, Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 national guardsmen “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester”, a statement from the White House said.\n\n“The Trump administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behaviour and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs. These criminals will be arrested and swiftly brought to justice,” the statement said.\n\nWhat is the national guard?\n\nThe US national guard — a state-based reserve military — is frequently used in natural disasters, and occasionally in instances of civil unrest, but almost always with the consent of local authorities.\n\nTrump’s deployment came despite the objections of California governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nA woman waves a Mexican flag amid tear gas from law enforcement during a protest in the Paramount section of Los Angeles. Source: AAP / Eric Thayer/AP\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nTrump’s decision has prompted swift backlash and division along party lines.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of “moving to take over the California National Guard” not due to a shortage of law enforcement but “because they want a spectacle”.\n\n“Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully,” he posted on X.\n\n“Important to remember that Trump isn’t trying to heal or keep the peace. He is looking to inflame and divide,” Democratic senator Chris Murphy said in one of the most direct rebukes.\n\nA joint statement from 22 Democratic governors also condemned Trump’s decision, calling it an “alarming abuse of power”.\n\n“Governors are the commanders in chief of their national guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state’s governor is ineffective and dangerous,” the statement said.\n\nBut Republicans lined up behind Trump to dismiss the pushback.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nTrump, asked about the use of troops, hinted at a more widespread deployment in other parts of the country.\n\nResponding to a question about invoking the Insurrection Act — which would allow the military to be used as a domestic police force — Trump said: “We’re looking at troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country.” \n\nIn a signal of the administration’s aggressive approach, defence secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty marines “if violence continues” in the region.\n\nNewsom has formally requested the administration rescind its national guard order. \n\nIn response, a White House spokesperson told Reuters: “President Trump rightfully stepped in to restore law and order because of Gavin Newsom’s feckless leadership and his refusal to stop the violent attacks on American law enforcement.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNational guard troops are patrolling parts of Los Angeles after United States&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What&#8217;s going on in LA and why has the National Guard been deployed? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/whats-going-on-in-la-and-why-has-the-national-guard-been-deployed/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/7f/03/45115956477abb5e8c331980c7f3/20250608185735557397-original.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 00:17:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":329756710,"title":"Trump Says Iran Is Involved In Gaza Hostage Negotiations","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-iran-is-involved-in-gaza-hostage-negotiations-8629468\" on this server.\nReference #18.91a12417.1749517335.1b71bb26\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.91a12417.1749517335.1b71bb26","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday Iran is involved in negotiations aimed at arranging a ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-iran-is-involved-in-gaza-hostage-negotiations-8629468","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 00:13:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":329757462,"title":"'Stick to football bro': Newsom buries top Republicans after they criticize CA crime rate","text":"As protests over President Donald Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles are increasing in number and intensity, so are Republican attacks on California.

In recent days, administration officials have focused their efforts on major Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\n\nTensions between protesters and law enforcement escalated on Friday, as some demonstrators threw objects and police responded with pepper balls and flash-bang devices.\n\nIn response, Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members on Saturday. The protests intensified further on Sunday, with growing crowds and heightened confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.\n\n\"President Trump's order calling federalised National Guard troops into Los Angeles - over the objections of the Governor and local law enforcement - is unnecessary and counterproductive,\" said Bonta in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"The President is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends.

It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego,” Newsom said.\n\nThe Pentagon also deployed about 700 Marines to Los Angeles on Monday to help National Guard members respond to protests over immigration raids, officials said, as California sued Trump over his use of the Guard troops and demonstrators took to the city’s streets for a fourth day.\n\nThe Marines are being deployed from their base at Twentynine Palms in the Southern California desert to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents, U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement Monday afternoon he was confident in the police department’s ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines’ arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a “significant logistical and operational challenge” for them.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops by telling reporters that Trump had “trampled” the state’s sovereignty.\n\n“We don’t take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops,” Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump’s use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.\n\nThe arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people that day across the city.\n\nThe smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.\n\nThe law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars from neighboring cities blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.\n\nThe clashes unfolded over just a few square blocks in an immense city of some 4 million people, most of whom went about their normal business on peaceful streets.\n\nEarly protests remained peaceful\n\nOn Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta’s arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration’s crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state’s janitors, security officers and other workers.\n\nEarly protests Monday had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta’s release.\n\nProtesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held, and at times sang in front of a line of police officers, who unsuccessfully asked people to move off the road and onto the sidewalk. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to deescalate moments of tension.\n\nChanting against a line of National Guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, “Free them all!” and “National Guard go away.”\n\nBonta accused Trump of fanning protesters’ anger with his announcement of the deployment, saying he set off Sunday’s clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. “This was not inevitable,” he said.\n\nTrump said Monday that the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.\n\nLater, at a White House event, he added that state leaders “were afraid to do anything.”\n\nOther protests were taking shape Monday afternoon across LA County, as confirmed reports of federal immigration agents in the cities of Whittier and Huntington Park south of Los Angeles spurred anger from activists. More protests were scheduled for cities across the country.\n\nOutside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.\n\nThe family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.\n\n“Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,” Vasquez’s brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects ranging from rocks to electric scooters at police and their vehicles.\n\nMcDonnell said police officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. McDonnell said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.\n\nSeveral dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.\n\nGovernor says Guard not needed\n\nNewsom urged Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”\n\nThe governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump’s plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.\n\n“Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” he said. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said California authorities had the situation under control.\n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor’s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”\n\nSullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Gavin Newsom believes Donald Trump’s choice to deploy U.S. Marines into Los Angeles as the protests against ICE continue is the “deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President.”\n\nTrump initially announced Monday that 700 marines were being deployed into Los Angeles to support the National Guard as the city’s protest against the most recent ICE raids against undocumented individuals spilled into day four. Newsom was quick to fire back his thoughts on the escalation.\n\n“U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes,” Newsom wrote. “They shouldn’t be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President. This is un-American.”\n\nThe protests against the Trump administration’s federal arrests of undocumented individuals began Friday and continued through the weekend – sparking in intensity after the president sent additional National Guard troops into the city.\n\nThe governor added in a separate tweet Monday that Trump had ordered an another 2,000 troops into L.A. – despite the majority of the first batch largely doing nothing.\n\n“I was just informed Trump is deploying another 2,000 Guard troops to L.A.,” Newsom tweeted. “The first 2,000? Given no food or water. Only approx. 300 are deployed — the rest are sitting, unused, in federal buildings without orders. This isn’t about public safety. It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego. This is Reckless. Pointless. And Disrespectful to our troops.”\n\nOn Sunday night, the governor issued a letter asking the president to pull the initial deployment of the National Guard out of L.A.\n\n“I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles County and return them to my command,” he wrote Sunday. “We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved. This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed. Rescind the Order. Return order to California.”\n\nTrump’s decision to deploy marked the first time a president sent the National Guard to a state without a request from that state’s governor since the 1960s. Protestors and officers clashed off and on all weekend, with most of the intensity coming Sunday.\n\nNewsom announced plans Monday to sue Trump over the deployment of the National Guard.","summary":"The president authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard troops into L.A. on Monday\n\n\nThe post Gavin Newsom Says Trump Sending Marines to LA Is the &#8216;Deranged Fantasy of a Dictatorial President&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/gavin-newsom-donald-trump-marines-la-dictatorial-president/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gavin-Newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 00:00:19","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.673},{"id":329756712,"title":"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell takes stand in Denver defamation trial, continues attacks on plaintiff","text":"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell took the stand Monday in the ongoing defamation trial against him, where he remained committed to his crusade against voting machines and his widely debunked conspiracy that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nLindell also continued his attacks against Eric Coomer, the former Dominion Voting Systems executive, even as he sought to distance himself from claims that he specifically coordinated attacks against Coomer at a 2021 convention Lindell organized about the conspiracy theory.\n\nLindell attacked Coomer as merely seeking money and grinding a political ax.\n\n“(I) cost Dr. Coomer what?” Lindell said in response to a question from one of Coomer’s attorneys. “He’s out there suing people for money.”\n\nCoomer filed suit against Lindell in April 2022. He accused Lindell of defaming him in a series of statements and media appearances, causing emotional and physical distress and costing him his career in election security.\n\nLindell has accused Coomer of treason and said he belongs in jail for being “part of the biggest crime this world has ever seen.” Lindell doubled down on his attacks against Coomer from the witness stand — but argued many of the more salacious statements were because Coomer sued him and Lindell was angry about the “lawfare.”\n\nHowever, Coomer notes in his lawsuit that Lindell tied him to wider conspiracies about Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems and called him “treasonous” as early as May 2021.\n\nAn attorney for Lindell, upon cross-examination, asked if Lindell was perhaps being hyperbolic with some of his rhetoric. Lindell responded that, “In my mind, it’s pretty big. Now, if that’s hyperbole, that’s subjective, I suppose.”\n\nCoomer accuses Lindell of parroting remarks that started with Colorado-based podcaster Joe Oltmann and broadcasting them to a wider audience. Oltmann accused “Eric, the Dominion guy” of coordinating with forces opposed to President Donald Trump to deny his reelection in 2020.\n\nOltmann repeated the statements during a panel at Lindell’s “Cyber Syposium” that was held in South Dakota in August 2021. On the stand Monday, Lindell sought to distance himself from Oltmann’s statements then. Lindell said he had lost his voice, and left the organizing of the Oltmann’s panel to other people.\n\n“Who put them up there, to this day, I could not tell you,” Lindell said.\n\n“So that’s another thing you’re not taking responsibility for,” Coomer’s attorney, Charles J. Cain, said. “You’re not taking responsibility for what you’ve done to Dr. Coomer, and you’re not taking responsibility for who got up on your stage.”\n\nCoomer’s lawsuit is being heard by a jury in U.S. District Court in Denver.

With a market capitalization of $528 billion, Netflix (NFLX -1.36%) is already halfway to a $1 trillion valuation. And with shares up 39% so far in 2025, the company looks poised to continue its monster run.\n\nLet's explore what has made Netflix such an appealing investment during an otherwise challenging year for investors. I'll also dig into some trends fueling the company's long-term growth prospects to make the case for why Netflix could become a trillion-dollar business over the next five years.\n\nNetflix stock is on a monster run\n\nIt's not a secret that President Donald Trump's tariff policies have dampened enthusiasm in the stock market this year. Perhaps the biggest reason for that is the uncertainty that comes with tariffs.\n\nWhile investors can understand at a high level how tariffs impact prices for imported and exported goods, tariff policies are more fluid. For instance, specific items or geographic regions may be excluded from certain policies. These finer details make it much more challenging to get a true sense of what is going on, and what types of businesses are most vulnerable right now.\n\nFortunately for Netflix, the company doesn't really need to worry much about tariffs. Netflix is a streaming business -- making revenue from subscriptions to its digital content catalog of movies and television, as well as from advertisers on the platform.\n\nSince Netflix's core business doesn't rely on manufacturing physical products or the dynamics of imports and exports, the company is essentially insulated from the threats tariffs pose to other companies, such as retailers.\n\nNetflix could be headed to the exclusive trillion-dollar club\n\nEarlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix had built a five-year forecast in which it outlined its vision to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation by 2030. Per its internal goals, Netflix's management hopes to double revenue to $80 billion, and triple operating income to roughly $33 billion over the next five years.\n\nDoubling sales and tripling operating income in just five years looks ambitious. However, I see a number of levers that Netflix can pull in order to get there.\n\nFirst, Netflix is well aware that the streaming landscape is becoming increasingly more intense. Despite its first-mover advantage, Netflix now faces competition from Walt Disney, Paramount Global, Warner Bros. Discovery, and even big tech platforms such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple.\n\nTo compete at a high level with these platforms, Netflix has invested heavily in developing its own original content, as well as expanding into live broadcasting -- particularly in sports. Notably, the company has struck partnerships with the National Football League (NFL) and entertainment company TKO Group Holdings.\n\nIn addition, Netflix has changed its pricing strategy in recent years in an effort to stay more competitive; it now offers a low-priced tier that features advertisements. While still nascent, Netflix's ad tier is scaling nicely. And I think as the company continues to offer more live content, larger advertising deals could be struck down the road.\n\nBoth subscription revenue and advertising sales are high-margin for Netflix. So if the company can continue unlocking customer acquisition and strong retention rates, I think it has a good path to continued revenue acceleration and widening operating profit margins for years to come.\n\nDoes the math behind the trillion-dollar goal check out?\n\nFor argument's sake, let's assume that Netflix reaches $80 billion in revenue and $33 million in operating profit by 2030. To reach $1 trillion in market cap, the company would need to trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 12.5, or roughly 30 times its operating income.\n\nNFLX PS Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAs the graph above illustrates, both of the implied multiples needed to reach a $1 trillion valuation are in line with Netflix's current trends. The big question is: Can these levels be sustained?\n\nUnless Netflix starts to show meaningful signs of deceleration or begins to lose market share to the competition, I don't see its valuation multiples contracting in a meaningful way.\n\nRegardless of whether Netflix reaches its goal by 2030, I see it becoming a trillion-dollar stock eventually. I think that for investors, the prudent thing to do is to monitor how the company's investments in original content and advertising keep moving the needle. This should become increasingly apparent, based on its subscriber growth and profit-margin profile over time.\n\nI think Netflix can indeed sustain a premium valuation in the long run. The caveat is that a lot needs to go right for the company over the next five years.","summary":"Netflix stock has been on a roll in 2025, as the company's streaming business is insulated from tariffs.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/09/prediction-this-tariff-resistant-growth-stock-coul/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F820980%2Fgettyimages-1038491694.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 00:00:00","author":"Adam Spatacco","authors":["Adam Spatacco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":329752310,"title":"Mexican President Sheinbaum to Attend G7 Summit in Canada","text":"CopyFacebookXTruthGettrLinkedInTelegramEmailSave\n\nBy Matthew Horwood6/9/2025Updated: 6/9/2025\n\nSheinbaum made the announcement during a press conference on June 9, adding that Mexico’s foreign affairs minister is working on setting up bilateral meetings and that it is “likely” a meeting will also take place with U.S. President Donald Trump.","summary":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she will be attending the upcoming G7 Leaders Summit in Canada held in Kananaskis, Alberta, from June 15 to 17.

Mark Green of Tennessee, announced on Monday that he will retire from Congress once the House votes again on the sprawling tax and budget policy bill backed by President Donald Trump. In a statement, Green said he was offered a private sector opportunity that was \"too exciting to pass up\" and so he informed House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday of his retirement plans. The move comes more than a year after Green announced he would not run again in 2024, but changed his mind when fellow Republicans implored him to stick around.

Green voted for Trump's sweeping legislation when it passed the House last month. The bill is now in the Senate's hands, and would need to return to the House for agreement on any changes. Trump wants the bill on his desk for his signature by July 4. Also Read | Los Angeles Immigration Protest: Agitators Clash With National Guard Troops During Demonstrations Against Immigration Raids in US City. Green's delayed departure could help with the GOP's narrow margins in the House. Republican leaders need every vote they can get on their big tax bill, which they managed to pass last month by a single vote and will have to pass again once changes are made in the Senate. They now have a 220-212 majority. \"It was the honour of a lifetime to represent the people of Tennessee in Congress,\" Green said. \"They asked me to deliver on the conservative values and principles we all hold dear, and I did my level best to do so.” Green's seat will be decided in a special election. The timing will depend on when he leaves office. Ahead of his 2024 reelection, Green had announced that February 2024 he would not run again. The decision was revealed a day after the impeachment of then-President Joe Biden's Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. But many fellow Republicans had called on him to reconsider, and he jumped back into the running just two weeks later. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and then defeated Democrat Megan Barry — the former Nashville mayor who resigned in 2018 in scandal — by more than 21 percentage points in November 2024. Green, 60, has served since 2019 in the 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn in 2022 to include a significant portion of Nashville. The city was carved up three ways in the 2022 redistricting so Republicans could flip a Democratic district in Congress that had covered Music City, which they successfully did. Green previously served as an Army surgeon and in the state Senate and is from Montgomery County. Green flirted running for governor in 2017, but suspended his campaign after he was nominated by former President Donald Trump to become the Army secretary. He later withdrew his nomination due to criticism over his remarks about Muslims and LGBTQ+ Americans.

The entire District of Columbia is normally a no-fly zone for drones.\n\nArmy officials have estimated around 200,000 attendees for the evening military parade, and McCool said he was prepared for \"hundreds of thousands\" of people.\n\n“We have a ton of magnetometers,” he said. “If a million people show up, then we're going to have some lines.”\n\nA total of 175 magnetometers would be used at security checkpoints controlling access to the daytime birthday festival and the nighttime parade. Metropolitan Police Department chief Pamela Smith predicted “major impacts to traffic” and advised attendees to arrive early and consider forgoing cars for the Metro.\n\n“This is a significant event with a large footprint,” she said. “We're relying on the public to be an extra set of ears and eyes for us.”\n\nThe military parade has been designated a National Special Security Event — similar to a presidential inauguration or state funeral. That status is reserved for events that draw large crowds and potential mass protests. It calls for an enhanced degree of high-level coordination among D.C. officials, the FBI, Capitol Police and Washington’s National Guard contingent — with the Secret Service taking the lead.\n\nThe Army birthday celebration had already been planned for months. But earlier this spring, Trump announced his intention to transform the event — which coincides with his 79th birthday — into a massive military parade complete with 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tanks and Paladin self-propelled howitzers rolling through the city streets.\n\nMultiple counter-protests of varying sizes are planned for Saturday, with the largest being a mass march to the White House dubbed the No Kings rally. Officials say they are also on alert for signs that the immigration-related clashes between law enforcement and protesters currently roiling Los Angeles would spread.\n\n“We're paying attention, obviously, to what is happening there.

The Marines are being deployed from their base at Twentynine Palms in the Southern California desert to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents, US Northern Command said in a statement.

The Marines and National Guard troops are not expected to do law enforcement duties, which are prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act to allow them to do law enforcement. It is not clear if he intends to. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement on Monday afternoon he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a \"significant logistical and operational challenge\" for them.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the planned lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops by telling reporters that Trump had \"trampled\" the state's sovereignty. \"We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilising California National Guard troops\" Bonta said. He planned to seek a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment. The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began on Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people that day across the city. The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown on Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars from neighbouring cities blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests. The clashes unfolded over just a few square blocks in an immense city of some 4 million people, most of whom went about their normal business on peaceful streets. Early protests remained peaceful On Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a USD 50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers. Early protests on Monday had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release. Protesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention centre where Huerta was being held, and at times sang in front of a line of police officers, who unsuccessfully asked people to move off the road and onto the sidewalk. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organisers at times to deescalate moments of tension. Chanting against a line of National Guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, \"Free them all!\" and \"National Guard go away.\" Bonta accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger with his announcement of the deployment, saying he set off Sunday's clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. \"This was not inevitable,\" he said. Trump said on Monday that the city would have been \"completely obliterated\" if he had not deployed the Guard. Later, at a White House event, he added that state leaders \"were afraid to do anything.\" US officials said about 1,000 National Guard members were in the city under federal orders by midday on Monday. The full 2,000 members authorised by the president were expected to be on the ground by the end of the day. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the details of military operations. Other protests were taking shape on Monday afternoon across LA County, as confirmed reports of federal immigration agents in the cities of Whittier and Huntington Park south of Los Angeles spurred anger from activists. More protests were scheduled for cities across the country. Outside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released. The family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him. \"Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\" Vasquez's brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities. On Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects ranging from rocks to electric scooters at police and their vehicles. McDonnell said police officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. McDonnell said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days. Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained on Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers. Governor says Guard not needed Newsom urged Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday, calling it a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction. \"Trump wants chaos and he's instigated violence,\" he said. \"Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for.\" The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts. Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles. The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Centre for Justice. In a directive on Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is \"a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

The child's guardians will control the account. Guardians could deposit up to $5,000 a year into the account, which the child could access once they're 18.In a statement to BI, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that passing the president's spending bill, called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" and the associated Trump Accounts \"will put the lives of young Americans on the right financial path!\"BI reached out to the companies of the CEOs who attended the roundtable.In their remarks at the event and statements provided to BI, the CEOs emphasized that the investment accounts would set the next generation up for success by giving them a financial head-start.\"Our economy's future vitality is dependent on young people understanding the power of investing for the long term,\" Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said during the roundtable.\"The American stock market is among the greatest wealth creation engines of our time,\" Tenev, the Robinhood CEO, said in a statement. \"Speaking personally, as an immigrant to this country, I've seen firsthand the vast opportunities afforded by our financial system.\"A representative for ServiceNow said in a statement: \"This is more than policy — it's about unlocking a future where more Americans can own, build, and thrive.\"Monday afternoon's investments are another example of the Trump administration's close ties to the private sector.The administration has also secured hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono work from major law firms for causes the administration supports.","summary":"\"Trump accounts\" would be government-funded savings for newborns.

Sadly, all signs suggest it is failing in this regard. \n\nThe good news: President Donald Trump has made combatting antisemitism a priority and has begun cleaning house at the museum.\n\nLast month, he removed several Biden appointees, including Ron Klain, Doug Emhoff, Tom Perez, Susan Rice, Jon Finer and Anthony Bernal, none of whom were suited for the council.\n\nRice had politicized Biden’s National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism by excluding anti-Zionism and including Islamophobia.\n\nFiner called members of the Israeli government “abhorrent,” slamming it at a meeting with Arab American leaders in Dearborn, Mich., last year.\n\nEmhoff, appointed just three days before Trump took office, resisted his removal, claiming it “dishonors the memory of 6 million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.”\n\nThat’s nonsense: Replacing these partisan figures has nothing to do with the 6 million murdered Jews, the Holocaust survivors or their descendants.\n\nOn the other hand, the new council members appointed by President Trump will bring expertise from their careers as well as their skills and their important values.\n\nAgain, the US Holocaust Museum was created to preserve the memory of the Shoah and protect future generations from violent antisemitism.\n\nTo accomplish this at a time when Jews face their biggest threats in decades requires greater oversight by the council and a broader, bolder outlook that addresses today’s emerging problems.\n\nIt’s time to rethink the facility’s role and what it is supposed to do to combat antisemitism.\n\nIt’s time make the US Holocaust Museum great again.\n\nMartin Oliner, a lawyer and the son of Holocaust survivors, was mayor of Lawrence village from 2010 to 2016.","summary":"The murders of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim and the attack on Jewish seniors, including in Boulder, Colo., are evidence that US Holocaust Museum needs to rethink its mission.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/09/opinion/amid-the-horrific-rise-in-jew-hatred-the-us-holocaust-museum-must-rethink-its-mission/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/2211000921-e1749512272733.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-09 23:38:28","author":"Martin Oliner","authors":["Martin Oliner"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.034},{"id":329748556,"title":"Trump Says ‘Israel Has Enough Problems Without Kidnapping Greta Thunberg,’ Suggests Activist Seek Anger Management","text":"Donald Trump said Monday that “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg,” responding to allegations from the 22-year-old activist that Israeli forces had done just that over the weekend. \n\nIn a press conference following President Trump’s phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he was asked if Thunberg’s detainment came up.

Vincenta Aguilar said she was anxious on Monday as she and her husband, both Guatemalan citizens, were subjected to three different interviews by US officials after arriving at Miami International Airport and showing tourist visas the couple received last week. \"They asked us where we work, how many children we have, if we have had any problems with the law, how we are going to afford the cost of this travel, how many days we will stay here,\" said Aguilar, who along with her husband was visiting their son for the first time since he left Guatemala 22 years ago.

She said they were released about an hour after their flight landed, greeting their waiting family members in Florida with tears of relief. Guatemala is not among the countries included in the new ban or flagged for extra travel restrictions. Trump's new ban shouldn't revoke previously issued visas The new proclamation that Trump signed last week applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the US and don't hold a valid visa. The new ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all US diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travellers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the US even after the ban takes effect. Narayana Lamy, a Haitian citizen who works for his home country's government, said he was told to wait after showing his passport and tourist visa on Monday at the Miami airport while a US official confirmed by phone that he was allowed into the country to visit family members. Luis Hernandez, a Cuban citizen and green card holder who has lived in the US for three years, said he had no problems returning on Monday to Miami after a weekend visiting family in Cuba. \"They did not ask me anything,\" Hernandez said. \"I only showed my residency card.\" Ban appears to avoid chaos that followed Trump's first-term attempt During Trump's first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy. Many immigration experts say the new ban is more carefully crafted and appears designed to beat court challenges that hampered the first by focusing on the visa application process. Trump said this time that some countries had \"deficient\" screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. He relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the US after their visas expired. Trump also tied the new ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. US officials say the man charged in the attack overstayed a tourist visa. He is from Egypt, which isn't on Trump's restricted list. Critics say travel ban sows division The ban was quickly denounced by groups that provide aid and resettlement help to refugees. \"This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,\" said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a nonprofit international relief organisation. Haiti's transitional presidential council said in a statement that the ban \"is likely to indiscriminately affect all Haitians\" and that it hopes to persuade the US to drop Haiti from the list of banned countries. In Venezuela, some visa holders changed US travel plans last week to get ahead of Trump's restrictions. For those without visas, the new restrictions may not matter much. Since Venezuela and the US severed diplomatic relations in 2019, Venezuelans have had to travel to neighbouring South American countries to obtain US visas. José Luis Vegas, a tech worker in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, said his uncle gave up on renewing an expired US visa because it was already difficult before the restrictions. \"Paying for hotels and tickets was very expensive, and appointments took up to a year,\" Vegas said.

Meanwhile, demonstrators continued to fill the city’s streets for a fourth consecutive day.\n\nThe Marines are being dispatched from their base at Twentynine Palms in the Southern California desert to safeguard federal property and personnel, including immigration agents, stated U.S. Northern Command. \n\nThe Marines and National Guard troops are not anticipated to perform law enforcement tasks, which are prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act. President Trump has not enacted the Insurrection Act to allow them to carry out law enforcement duties, and it is unclear whether he plans to do so.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement Monday afternoon he was confident in the police department’s ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines’ arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a “significant logistical and operational challenge” for them.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the planned lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops by telling reporters that Trump had “trampled” the state’s sovereignty.\n\n“We don’t take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops” Bonta said. He planned to seek a court order declaring Trump’s use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.\n\nThe arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people that day across the city. \n\nThe smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. \n\nThe law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars from neighboring cities blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.\n\nThe clashes unfolded over just a few square blocks in an immense city of some 4 million people, most of whom went about their normal business on peaceful streets.\n\nEarly protests remained peaceful\n\nOn Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta’s arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration’s crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state’s janitors, security officers and other workers.\n\nEarly protests Monday had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta’s release. \n\nProtesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held, and at times sang in front of a line of police officers, who unsuccessfully asked people to move off the road and onto the sidewalk. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to deescalate moments of tension.\n\nChanting against a line of National Guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, “Free them all!” and “National Guard go away.”\n\nBonta accused Trump of fanning protesters’ anger with his announcement of the deployment, saying he set off Sunday’s clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. “This was not inevitable,” he said.\n\nTrump said Monday that the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.\n\nLater, at a White House event, he added that state leaders “were afraid to do anything.”\n\nU.S. officials said about 1,000 National Guard members were in the city under federal orders by midday Monday. The full 2,000 members authorized by the president were expected to be on the ground by the end of the day. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the details of military operations.\n\nOther protests were taking shape Monday afternoon across LA County, as confirmed reports of federal immigration agents in the cities of Whittier and Huntington Park south of Los Angeles spurred anger from activists. More protests were scheduled for cities across the country.\n\nOutside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.\n\nThe family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.\n\n“Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,” Vasquez’s brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects ranging from rocks to electric scooters at police and their vehicles. \n\nMcDonnell said police officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. McDonnell said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.\n\nSeveral dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.\n\nGovernor says Guard not needed\n\nNewsom urged Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”\n\nThe governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump’s plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.\n\n“Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” he said. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles.\n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor’s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” \n\nSullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Baldor in Washington and Jake Offenhartz in New York contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Pentagon sent approximately 700 Marines to Los&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: 700 Marines Sent by Pentagon to Los Angeles Amid Immigration Protests first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/700-marines-sent-by-pentagon-to-los-angeles-amid-immigration-protests/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Pentagon-deploys-700-Marines-to-Los-Angeles-to-respond-to.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-09 23:34:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":329746384,"title":"US deploys Marines to Los Angeles as Trump backs arrest of California governor","text":"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The U.S. military will temporarily deploy about 700 Marines to Los Angeles until more National Guard troops can arrive, marking another escalation in President Donald Trump's response to street protests over his aggressive immigration policies.\n\nThe U.S. Northern Command said a battalion would be sent to help protect federal property and personnel until more National Guard troops could reach the scene.

My son is now 4 years old, and I’ve watched his development stall alongside Measure C delays.\n\nThe cruelest irony: the resources it promised should have been available to him from his first week of life. Despite the measure collecting about $650 million earmarked for families like ours, not a single dollar has reached anyone. The Alameda Taxpayers Association blocked the funds with a baseless lawsuit threat.\n\nI recently made the difficult decision to leave my job to care for my son at home because I couldn’t find adequate child care.

Millions of roofs are being degraded by sunlight while overheating buildings; they could produce electricity for everyone.\n\nUtility companies would no doubt rather control — and profit from — industrial solar generation, but that is not best for Californians. We must not let them degrade California’s ecosystem with big solar plants; instead, we should enable Californians to reduce impacts on their homes and businesses while generating needed power.\n\nThe state should require utilities to focus on storage and better management of it, to avoid disastrous toxic fires, and on solar over aqueducts. There will be problems to solve. The PUC must push the utilities to create solutions.\n\nThe utilities are here to meet the needs of Californians at a reasonable profit. The PUC’s job is to ensure that utilities maximize value for citizens by moving all those rooftops from solar degradation to solar generation.\n\nForest Weld\n\nSprinter’s celebration\nbroke with CIF values\n\nRe: “CIF overreacts to athlete’s celebration” (Page A6, June 6).\n\nIn the response to the letter writer’s comments about the CIF disqualifying a high school track runner over her winning celebratory act (she took a fire extinguisher to her shoes), he asks, “What is wrong with that?”\n\nFor some people, sportsmanship encompasses a range of qualities, including fairness, respect, humility and graciousness, both in victory and defeat. When we lose sight of this, we have lost sight of what is good in sports and in ourselves.\n\nMichael Poe\nSan Leandro\n\nArea leaders should\nsupport CIF rules\n\nRe: “Local leaders support runner” (Page C1, June 6).\n\nClara Adams, who was disqualified after winning the CIF Championship 400 meter, is a victim indeed, though not of CIF officials, but rather of her attention-seeking father.\n\nFor decades, laudable CIF rules against inappropriate grandstanding have been enforced. Those rules expect dignified behavior, surely one of the highest lessons to be taught by interscholastic competition. Further, CIF Championship meets are tightly scheduled. Podium athletes are rewarded almost immediately, but with no extra time for distracting celebrations from those seeking more than their share of glory.\n\nFor anyone watching, Clara’s impressive victory spoke for itself. Sadly, Clara’s father wanted more. His daughter, not he, has paid a heavy price.\n\nClara’s local supporters should find fault where it lies, not with CIF officials simply doing their job.\n\nRamsay Thomas\n\nDonald Trump’s\nhate is his lifeblood\n\nRe: “Trump hatred is not good for the country” (Page A6, June 4).\n\nI don’t normally reply to a letter to the editor, but Doug Abbott’s letter forced me to reply.\n\nMr. Abbott, with all due respect, you should flip the script of your letter. It is not citizens’ hatred of Donald Trump that is not good, it is Trump’s hatred of our constitutional republic that is truly bad for our country.\n\nHere is a short list: Trump hates our Constitution, hates our laws, hates judges, hates the FBI, hates poor people, hates people of color, hates our allies, hates (and assaults) women, hates Democrats, hates Republicans that defy him, hates Mike Pence, hates Palestinians, and, finally, Trump also hates you Mr. Abbott, because you are a Californian. And there are a huge number of people who were Trump’s friends who are now under the bus where he threw them.\n\nSan Lorenzo\n\nTrump too comfortable\nwith those who hate us\n\nRe: “Trump hatred is not good for the country” (Page A6, June 4).\n\nIt’s ironic that someone would claim Democrats hate the president.\n\nSadly, most insecure people are bullies. They’re incapable of doing anything but belittle others and seek revenge. If revenge alone isn’t an act of hate, what is?\n\nOur president, in charge of these United States, made of millions of refugees, feels the need to mete out revenge on anyone who says or does anything against him. He’s vindictive and embarrassing.\n\nIt would be wonderful to have an adult running the country rather than a person only interested in working for his brand. Isn’t a president supposed to stand up for “we the people” and not make deals for himself? Dealing with countries promoting evil in the U.S. is unacceptable. Remember, 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe president and family are overly comfortable but naïve with the House of Saud. They’re not friends of ours.\n\nBetsy Sargent","summary":"Also: Solar production &#124; CIF values &#124; Support rules &#124; Trump's hate &#124; Too comfortable.

It has been ratified by 49 nations plus the European Union, according to the UN, and comes into force 120 days after its 60th ratification.\n\nThe United States signed the treaty in 2023 under Joe Biden's administration but is not expected to ratify it while Donald Trump is president.\n\nHere are the key points of the treaty text:\n\n- International waters -\n\nThe treaty covers international waters, which fall outside the jurisdiction of any single state, and account for more than 60 percent of the world's oceans.\n\nSpecifically, it applies to waters beyond countries' exclusive economic zones, which extend up to 200 nautical miles from the coast.\n\nIt also covers what is known as \"the Area\", shorthand for seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The Area comprises just over half of the planet's seabed.\n\nOnce enacted, a decision-making body -- a Conference of the Parties (COP) -- would have to work with regional and global organizations that already oversee different aspects of the oceans.\n\nThese include regional fisheries bodies and the International Seabed Authority, the arena where nations are hotly contesting a proposed set of rules to govern deep-sea mining.\n\nTrump's decision to sidestep the authority -- to which the United States is not a member -- and issue deep-sea mining permits in international waters has raised tricky questions of jurisdiction.\n\n- Marine protected areas -\n\nCurrently, almost all protected marine areas (MPAs) are within national territorial waters.\n\nThe treaty, however, allows for these reserves to be created in the open ocean.\n\nMost decisions would be taken by a consensus of the COP, but an MPA can be voted into existence with a three-quarters majority, to prevent deadlock caused by a single country.\n\nOne crucial shortcoming: the text does not say how these conservation measures will be monitored and enforced over remote swathes of the ocean -- a task that will fall to the COP.\n\nSome experts say satellites could be used to spot infractions.\n\nIndividual countries are already responsible for certain activities on the high seas that they have jurisdiction over, such as those of ships flying their flags.\n\n- Sharing the bounty? -\n\nOn the high seas, countries and entities under their jurisdiction will be allowed to collect animal, plant, or microbial matter whose genetic material might prove useful, even commercially.\n\nScientists, for example, have discovered molecules with the potential to treat cancer or other diseases in microbes scooped up in sediment, or produced by sponges or marine mollusks.\n\nBenefits-sharing of those resources has been a key point of contention between wealthy and poorer nations.\n\nThe treaty establishes frameworks for the transfer of marine research technologies to developing countries and a strengthening of their research capacities, as well as open access to data.\n\nBut it is left to the COP to decide exactly how any monetary benefits will eventually be shared, with options including a system based on specific commercialized products, or more generalized payment systems.\n\n- Environmental impact studies -\n\nThe treaty requires signatories to assess the environmental impacts of planned activities under their control on the high seas before they are authorized in instances when such activities may have more than a minor or transitory effect.\n\nIt also calls for countries to assess the potential impact on international waters of activities within national jurisdictions that may cause \"substantial pollution\" or harm the high sea marine environment.\n\nUltimately, states are responsible for giving the green light to any potentially harmful activity -- a role NGOs hoped would go to the COP, to make controversial approvals more difficult.\n\nThe treaty also requires states to publish updates on an activity's environmental impacts. Approvals can be called into question if unanticipated impacts arise.\n\nThough they are not specifically listed in the treaty, activities that could come under regulation include transport and fishing, as well as more controversial subjects such as deep-sea mining or even geo-engineering initiatives to mitigate global warming.\n\nabd/np/sms/aha/dhw","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/high-seas-treaty-145705578.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/a60c810a4035167f50d6c3b68b4baa23","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-09 23:28:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.281},{"id":329755638,"title":"Mark Green to retire from House early after second reconciliation vote","text":"“Though I planned to retire at the end of the previous Congress, I stayed to ensure that President Trump’s border security measures and priorities make it through Congress,” Green said. “By overseeing the border security portion of the reconciliation package, I have done that.
