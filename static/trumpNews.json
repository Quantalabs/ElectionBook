She added that, given his refusal to accept a negotiated solution, the United States government has fulfilled its promise to enforce the law.\n\nMachado said the time has come for popular sovereignty and national sovereignty to rule in our country.

capture by US forces in Caracas.\n\nMaduro was seen surrounded by FBI agents as he descended the boarding stairs of a US government plane at a New York state National Guard facility, and was slowly escorted along the tarmac.\n\nThe leftist leader was expected to be flown by helicopter to New York City, where he faces drug trafficking charges.\n\nUS forces snatched Maduro and his wife out of the

(EPA Images pic)\nSEOUL: North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles off its east coast on Sunday, Seoul's military said, its first launch of the year just hours before South Korea's leader heads to China for a summit.\nSunday's launch follows a US military operation against Pyongyang's socialist ally Venezuela that snatched President Nicolas Maduro out of his country – for decades a nightmare scenario for North Korea's leadership, which has long accused Washington of seeking to remove it from power.\nSeoul's defence ministry said it had detected \"several projectiles, presumed to be ballistic missiles\" fired from near the North Korean capital Pyongyang around 7.50am (2250 GMT Saturday).\n\"The military is maintaining a full readiness posture, having strengthened surveillance and vigilance against possible additional launches,\" Seoul said.\nJapan's defence ministry also said it detected a possible ballistic missile, which it said landed in an unspecified location around 8.08am (2308 GMT Saturday).\nIt is Pyongyang's first ballistic missile launch since November, when it staged a test after US President Donald Trump approved South Korea's plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.\nOne analyst said Trump's Saturday military operation against Venezuela likely played a role in the decision to carry out the launch.\nPyongyang has for decades argued it needs its nuclear and missile programme as a deterrent against alleged regime change efforts by Washington. The United States has offered Pyongyang repeated assurances it has no such plans.\n\"They likely fear that if the United States so chooses, it could launch a precision strike at any moment, threatening the regime's survival,\" Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said.\n\"The underlying message is likely that attacking North Korea would not be as easy as a strike on Venezuela,\" he added.\nLee bound for China\nThe test also came just hours before South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departs for Beijing for talks with counterpart Xi Jinping, whose government is a key economic backer of North Korea.\nLee hopes to possibly harness China's clout over North Korea to support his bid to improve ties with Pyongyang.\nPyongyang has significantly stepped up missile testing in recent years.\nAnalysts say this drive is aimed at improving precision strike capabilities, challenging the US as well as South Korea and testing weapons before potentially exporting them to Russia.\nPyongyang is also set to hold a landmark congress of its ruling party in the coming weeks – its first in five years.\nEconomic policy, as well as defence and military planning, is likely to be high on the agenda.\nAhead of that conclave, leader Kim Jong Un ordered the \"expansion\" and modernisation of the country's missile production and the construction of more factories to meet growing demand.\nOn Sunday, state media reported that Kim had paid a visit to a facility involved in making tactical guided weapons.\nHe ordered them to expand current production capacity by 250%, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.","summary":"Seoul’s defence ministry reported several projectiles, likely ballistic missiles, and increased readiness for more launches.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2026/01/04/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-first-test-of-2026","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/666487ac-north-korea-missile-04012026.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:42:05","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.042},{"id":391076050,"title":"Cost Of Decreasing Number Of International Students In The US","text":"TARA SONENSHINE\n\nAmerican college campuses from Tucson to Tallahassee are buzzing with the familiar routine of students getting settled in classes and dorms.\n\n One new trend, though, is emerging.\n\nAn estimated 30% to 40% fewer international students are expected on American college campuses in the fall of 2025, compared with trends in the 2024-2025 academic year, according to according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators – a nonprofit that focuses on international education – and JB International, a for-profit educational technology firm.\n\n In total, an estimated 150,000 fewer international students were expected to arrive this fall, due to new visa restrictions and visa appointments being canceled at U.S. embassies and consulates in many countries, such as India, China, Nigeria and Japan. NAFSA and JB International are expected to release updated data on international student enrollment in November 2025.\n\n There were over 1.1 million international students – more than half of whom were from China or India – on American college campuses in the 2023-2024 academic year, according to the Institute for International Education, which monitors foreign student programs and shares the most comprehensive available recent data.\n\nThis sharp drop in international students could cost the U.S. economy US$7 billion in the 2025-26 school year, according to estimates from NAFSA.\n\nFor every three international students in the U.S., one new American job is created or supported by the average $35,000 these students spend in their local communities on housing, food and transportation, and other costs.\n\nAs a senior fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy in the Obama administration, I oversaw many of the student exchange programs involving multiple countries around the globe. I foresee a major economic crisis over international students that could last for years.\n\nA Growing Trend, Quickly Reversed\n\nInternational students began coming to the U.S. in the early 20th century, when philanthropists like the Carnegie, Rockefeller and Mott families sought out scholars from the U.S. to go overseas. These philanthropists helped create international fellowships and grants that later on would often be funded by the U.S. government – like the Fulbright program, which gives money to American students to spend time and research abroad.\n\nBy 1919, nonprofits like the Institute for International Education were serving as mediators between foreign students and American universities.\n\nInternational student enrollment in the U.S. has steadily risen since the end of World War II, coinciding with an emerging world that became easier and cheaper to travel across. While 26,000 foreign students came to the U.S. in the 1949–1950 school year, that number had ballooned to 286,343 three decades later.\n\nIn the 1990s, there were more than 400,000 international students attending school in the U.S. each year. That number continued to climb and surpassed 500,000 in the early 2000s.\n\nInternational student enrollment in the U.S. first topped more than 1 million in the 2015-2016 school year.\n\nWhile international students made up just 1% of the 2.4 million university and college students in the U.S. in 1949-50, they were about 6% of the total 18.9 million students in the U.S. in 2023-24, according to the Migration Institute, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nThis percentage is relatively small, however, compared with the international student representation in other countries. International students represented 38% of overall Canadian university enrollment, made up 31% of all university students in Australia and 27% of all students in the United Kingdom during the 2024-2025 school year.\n\nTrump’s Warnings To International Students\n\nWithin the first 90 days of his return to office, President Donald Trump invoked the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives the secretary of state the authority to expel foreign students whose behavior could pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n The administration has since revoked the visas of 6,000 foreign students, the State Department reported in August 2025.\n\nThere have also been several high-profile arrests of international students, including Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested Ozturk in March 2025 shortly after the administration revoked her visa. Her arrest came one year after she co-wrote an opinion piece calling for Tufts to recognize a genocide in the Gaza Strip and to divest from all companies with ties to Israel.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defended Ozturk’s arrest, saying in March that the government will not give visas to people who come to the U.S. intending to do “things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus.”\n\nA federal judge ruled in May that there was no evidence showing Ozturk posed a credible threat to the U.S. She was then released from an immigration detention facility.\n\nBut her arrest coincided with the arrest of other international students in high-profile cases, like Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student and U.S. permanent resident who was arrested after he participated in Palestinian rights protests on campus. These arrests all sent a message to foreign students: It is not as safe as it once was to come to the U.S.\n\nThe administration has announced other changes that will make it more difficult for foreign students to spend time in the U.S. – like a 2025 travel ban that prohibits or restricts the entry of people from 19 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe administration also announced in August that it plans to cap the length of time foreign students can stay in the U.S. to four years. Currently, foreign students have a 60-day grace period to stay in the U.S. following graduation, before they must secure a work visa or another kind of authorization to legally stay in the country.\n\n A Simple Math Equation\n\nNew York University, Northeastern University in Boston and Columbia University hosted the largest number of international students in 2023-2024. But international students are not concentrated in just major, liberal cities.\n\nArizona State University hosted the fourth-highest number of international students that school year, and Purdue University in Indiana and the University of North Texas also are among the 10 schools that host the total most international students.\n\nAll of these schools – and others, like Kansas City colleges and universities, which are now welcoming far fewer international students than they planned to in the spring because some of the students could not get visas – will feel the financial effects of turning international students away from the U.S.\n\nDoing the math, I believe that a solid argument can be made for increasing the numbers of foreign students coming to the U.S., not cutting back.\n\n Tara Sonenshine is Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice in Public Diplomacy, Tufts University.\n\nSource: THE CONVERSATION (https://theconversation.com), September 12, 2025.","summary":"TARA SONENSHINE American college campuses from Tucson to Tallahassee are buzzing with the familiar routine of students getting settled in classes and dorms. &#160;One new trend, though, is emerging.

He added that American oil companies would be sent to Venezuela to fix the infrastructure 'and start making money for the country'.\n\nIn an extraordinary early-hours assault, US special forces dropped from helicopters directly into President Nicolas Maduro's compound - Fort Tiuna - in the centre of Caracas as fighter jets launched air strikes across the capital.\n\nAfter overcoming dozens of armed guards during a ferocious gun battle, the elite Delta Force reached Maduro as he fled from his bedroom with his wife Cilia Flores. 'He made it to the door [of the panic room], he was unable to close it,' said Mr Trump.\n\nWatching the drama unfold from his Florida home, Mr Trump likened it to 'a television show' and suggested the military operation was the greatest since the Second World War.\n\nIt was not clear how the US proposed running Venezuela or whether it would involve an occupying military force, although Mr Trump said he was not afraid of putting 'boots on the ground'.\n\nDescribed as a 'narco-terrorist' by the US, Maduro and his wife will face trial in New York charged with drugs and weapons offences. \n\nThe 63-year-old dictator, whose regime was blamed for thousands of extrajudicial executions, was being held last night at a detention centre in Brooklyn. Earlier he was pictured on board the USS Iwo Jima wearing a blindfold and ear defenders.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said Venezuela was experiencing a 'new dawn' adding: 'The tyrant is gone. He will now - finally - face justice for his crimes.'\n\nAlso yesterday it emerged that:\n\nA CIA spy in Caracas tracked Maduro's movements to facilitate the raid - and got so close to the dictator that he even knew what type of food he gave his pets;\n\n US special forces spent weeks rehearsing Maduro's capture in a specially made replica of his presidential compound;\n\nMaduro spoke to Trump last week but refused his request to quit peacefully;\n\nTrump declined to seek authority from the US Congress as he feared the operation would be leaked;\n\nHe issued warnings to Cuba and Colombia after the raid, saying the latter's president should 'watch his ass' as his country was smuggling cocaine to the US.\n\nBritain and France welcomed Maduro's capture, with Keir Starmer calling him an illegitimate leader and saying, 'we shed no tears about the end of his regime'.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said the Venezuelan people are 'rid of Nicolas Maduro's dictatorship and can only rejoice. By seizing power and trampling on fundamental freedoms, [he] gravely undermined the dignity of his own people.'\n\nBut Russia called Maduro's arrest an 'act of armed aggression' - and China accused the US of violating international law and threatening 'peace and security' in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nAddressing a news conference, a triumphant Donald Trump said 'armed forces conducted an extraordinary military operation in the capital of Venezuela, [with] overwhelming American military power. Air, land and sea was used to launch a spectacular assault, and it was an assault like people have not seen since World War Two.'\n\nMore than 150 bombers, fighters and reconnaissance aircraft were used in the raid, during which Caracas was plunged into darkness. American forces dismantled and disabled air defences 'to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters' used to extract Nicolas Maduro.\n\nMeanwhile the air strikes on Caracas in the early hours of yesterday morning, including at military bases, lit up the night sky.\n\nThe US helicopters came under fire as they approached the Venezuelan leader's compound around 2am local time - 6am UK time. One was hit but continued flying.\n\nMr Trump said the Venezuelan leader's vice-president Delcy Rodriguez, was now in power, but that she had promised to do 'anything' the US wants. However she contradicted that assertion by rejecting US intervention and demanding Maduro's return.\n\nEarlier, Venezuela's state-run television was broadcasting rallies and protests across several cities, including Caracas. Maduro's supporters vowed to defend their country from what they described as an illegal attack and the kidnapping of their leader.\n\nAt his news conference, Mr Trump said the 'people standing behind me' - who included Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth - would help run the country.\n\nAnd he issued a warning that 'all political and military figures [in Venezuela] should bear in mind that what happened to Maduro could happen to them'.\n\nA second wave of attacks on the nation could take place if needed, he added. Asked if the US military will maintain a presence in Venezuela, he added: 'Well, no, we're going to have presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil.'\n\nMr Rubio said Maduro was seen as an 'illegitimate president' by multiple administrations. He's a fugitive of American justice with a $50 million reward,' before joking: 'I guess we saved $50 million'.\n\nHe added: 'Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this, he was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers and chose instead to act like a wild man.' \n\nMaduro set the tone for his socialist presidency when he said in 2013 that anyone who voted against him would fall victim to an ancient curse. It was dismissed as crazy rhetoric at the time but the former bus driver's regime was later accused of using 'death squads' to instil terror in his opponents.\n\nHyperinflation and chronic shortages saw the country's economy collapse under his rule. Amid rigged elections and harsh crackdowns on protests., millions of Venezuelans fled abroad.\n\nSoon he was ranked as one of the world's worst dictators, though not everyone considered him a pariah. He counted former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as a friend.\n\nMaduro saw himself as the 'son' of Hugo Chavez, his predecessor, who became a flamboyant emblem of anti-Americanism.","summary":"US special forces dropped from helicopters directly into President Nicolas Maduro's compound - Fort Tiuna - in the centre of Caracas as fighter jets launched air strikes across the capital.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15431903/Venezuela-Donald-Trump-dictator-Nicolas-Maduro-captured-raid.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/04/01/105211039-0-image-m-10_1767489599200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:40:27","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor,Ian Gallagher","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor","Ian Gallagher"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":391075716,"title":"Venezuela diaspora celebrates Maduro's deposition, wonders what's next","text":"Venezuelan migrants ‍around the world erupted in celebration on Saturday (January 3, 2026) following the U.S.-led deposition of President Nicolas Maduro, whose government oversaw one of the world’s ​largest migration exoduses in recent history.\n\nU.S. capture of Venezuela LIVE updates\n\nChants celebrating Mr. Maduro’s capture were heard on the streets of ‌capital cities in Latin America and in Spain, where Venezuelans gathered to share their joy — and ​wonder what the future could hold.\n\n“We are free.

International Organization for Migration.\n\nNeighboring Colombia has received the largest share of the diaspora, with around 2.8 ⁠million Venezuelans, followed by 1.7 million in Peru, according to the R4V platform, a group of regional NGOs assisting migrants and refugees from Venezuela set up by the U.N. migration agency.\n\nIn Peru’s capital Lima, dozens of Venezuelans gathered, many wrapped in their country’s flag, to mark Maduro’s deposition.\n\nVenezuelan migrant Milagros ​Ortega, whose parents are still in Venezuela, said ⁠she hoped to go back.\n\n“Knowing that my dad was alive to see the fall of Nicolas Maduro is very emotional. I would like to see his face,” she said.\n\nPeruvian President Jose Jeri said on X that his government would facilitate the immediate return of Venezuelans, regardless of their immigration status. “For those of us living in exile, ‌it is an immense joy,” said Cynthia Diaz at a small march convened in Ecuador’s capital Quito. “Venezuelans, sooner ‌rather than later, will return to Venezuela — to a free Venezuela, to a Venezuela that is a land of greatness,” Ms. Diaz said. For years, the U.S. was a haven for Venezuelans, but ‍many were branded criminals and forced to seek refuge elsewhere during President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nIn Spain, thousands of people gathered at central Madrid’s Puerta del Sol and applauded as they watched Mr. Trump give a live press conference.\n\nGroups of Venezuelans were also ‍expected to gather to celebrate in Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires.\n\nSpeculation about future\n\nAfter the initial joy, doubts about Venezuela’s future also set in, as Venezuelans abroad wondered what the future would hold for their country and its citizens.\n\nAndres Losada, who has lived in Spain for three years and is among the 400,000 Venezuelans residing in the country, according to official data, said he is struggling between worry and joy about the situation in Venezuela.\n\n“Although what people are going through in Caracas is tough, I believe that beyond that there is a light that will lead us to freedom,” he added. “We are still not at the point where we can say Venezuela is completely free,” said Maria Fernanda Monsilva, a Venezuelan who gathered at a ⁠march in Quito, saying she hoped Edmundo Gonzalez, the Venezuelan opposition’s main candidate in the 2024 presidential election, could take power.\n\n“Many of us who are abroad want to return,” Ms. Monsilva said, “This is ​the first step in a series.”\n\nSpeaking to a local TV station in Spain, Agustin Rodriguez, the Vice President of a ⁠Venezuelan cultural association, expressed concern about the strikes but said they “may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, where there can be a future.”\n\nMr. Trump on Saturday (January 3) promised to put Venezuela under American control for now, including by deploying U.S. forces if necessary, until “we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.”","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/venezuela-diaspora-celebrates-maduros-deposition-wonders-whats-next/article70469963.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hy5eml/article70469971.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2026-01-04T011647Z_2103586156_RC20UIAA73RQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-LATAM-REACTIONS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04

(Thanks) to Donald Trump for helping Venezuela,\" he said in Bogota, having left his home country 10 years ago.\nYeiner Benitez, a security guard in the Colombian capital, teared up as he recalled the hardship and fear that drove him to leave Venezuela in 2022.\nDuring his absence, his uncle died from what Benitez said was a common illness due to a lack of medication – a regular occurrence in the economically ravaged country.\n\"Venezuela has gone through a very difficult process; these have been very hard years - years of hunger, misery, torture, friends lost, and friends who disappeared,\" Benitez told AFP.\n\"So, forgive the emotion, but what's happening today is extraordinary; it's divine justice.\"\nNot everyone was happy with what they see as Washington's foreign intervention.\nIn Mexico City and Buenos Aires, groups gathered at the US embassies there to make their protest known.\n\"Venezuelan brothers, resist... don't hand over your land, your oil, your gold\" to the United States, protest leader Mario Benitez told the crowd in Mexico, waving banners with slogans such as \"No to war.\"\nIn Argentina's capital, people chanted, \"Out, yankees, out!\"","summary":"Thousands massed in the capitals of Chile, Mexico and Argentina and in Miami, dancing and hugging and waving Venezuelan flags.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2026/01/04/at-last-venezuelans-abroad-celebrate-maduro-ouster","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ba7e098c-venezuela-celebrate-04012026.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:24:18","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.193},{"id":391075966,"title":"Venezuela attack: Trump destroys world order","text":"Yesterday was seismically significant as President Donald Trump ordered United States Special Forces nighttime operation to seize Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife. They have been flown to the US to be tried, according to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, in US courts. Charges had previously been filed against Mr Maduro in the US in 2020. The bombing of Iran last year, the airstrike on Nigeria last Christmas, the abduction of Mr Maduro, and the torrent of threats Mr Trump issued against US traditional allies and foes alike are all indications of the upending of the rules-based global order in favour of a power-based world order. Long after the Peace of Westphalia in the 17th century had established the concept of sovereignty, among other variables, as the foundation of global peace and stability, the world order was nevertheless repeatedly broken at least four times in the past two centuries. Each time the order was broken, war followed. Mr Trump is about rounding up his first year in office; by the time he is through, it is uncertain what would be left of the global order, or how long it would take for the consequences of his disruptions and dictatorship to manifest.\n\nMr Trump may be picking on small and less powerful nations incapable of retaliating against the US, but by balkanising the world into two camps, pro-US and anti-US, and by first alienating his allies before taking on his enemies, the American president may be setting the stage for his country’s isolation and vulnerability. The US may have the most powerful military in the world at the moment, but until it is truly tested by near equals, no one can say whether the US military is as invincible as Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted. Until Russia took on Ukraine in 2022, few expected that even with external help Kiev could last for as much as it has done, one month shy of four years. Russia has so far failed to expand its sphere of influence, and if peace is finally brokered, it will have gained only a little territory at the cost of over 300,000 men. China is not content to maintain its huge and expanding zone of economic influence. If it makes a bid for Taiwan, there are no indications it would not be a very costly misadventure.\n\nRead Also: Troops recover large cache of ammunition in Maiduguri\n\nThe Saturday morning attack on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, lasted barely 30 minutes before the country’s leadership was decapitated. No one is sure whether the US would make no other move, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio promised, or whether the ease with which the abduction took place would tempt Mr Trump into something more far-reaching and catastrophic. However, the attack followed months of sabre rattling as the American president baited President Maduro, and weeks of gunboat diplomacy that effectively shut-in an already distressed Venezuela in a crippling economic blockade. Back in 2020, in the Southern District of New York, Mr Maduro had been indicted in a US federal court on charges that included narco-terrorism and possession of weapons against the US. Additional charges might now be included in a fresh indictment. Like Panama’s Manuel Noriega who was also seized exactly 35 years ago during the presidency of George H. Bush, it is clear that no one can save Mr Maduro: he will face the charges, and he will get a guilty verdict, for the US had expended so much resources in abducting him.\n\nBut the unlawful arrest and trial of Mr Maduro is the smallest of the world’s headaches. Since the advent of President Trump, and for the past one year, the United Nations (UN) has been shunted aside, forced to reenact the dying throes of the League of Nations, its voice reduced to little more than whispers. And when it manages to speak loudly, it sermonises. It will get worse in the months and years ahead. The US under Mr Trump has forsaken soft power in favour of brute force. Unopposed, its enemies and friends alike cowering before it, the sole surviving superpower will flaunt its wealth and throw its power in everyone’s face. It may in the short term limit himself to taking on less powerful and non-nuclear countries, but ultimately it will look for formidable opponents. President Trump has no sense of history, nor even studied history, and has paid little attention to the principles that undergird the rules-based order he is dismantling. So his instincts, short attention span, and what a psychologist called his malignant narcissism, will conjure the deadly spasms the world must experience in the years ahead. \n\nBut overall, Mr Trump is a historical accident. Men like him have ruled empires, destroyed empires, and reshaped the world in ways neither they nor their successors, nor the rest of the region which they dominated, anticipated. For instance, the Assyrian Empire which peaked between 10th to 7th centuries BCE under rulers like Assurmasirpal II, Tiglath-Pilesar III, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal may have collapsed as a direct consequence of a 60-year megadrought experienced in the 6th century BCE, but it took only three months for Babylon to overrun it and sack Nineveh, the capital, because the empire had become weakened by a combination of many factors. Take a roll call of powerful empires and kingdoms, and observe the eerie parallel with Mr Trump’s shallow understanding of power, regional and global dynamics, and the internal factors that conduce to or corrode state power. It will be evident that the empires of the Romans, Mongols, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Persians, and the Greeks tell cautionary tales. But it takes a leader schooled in the art and dynamics of power to safeguard an empire. Mr Trump is not adept or schooled. It is a matter of time before the world and circumstances take on the might of the US.\n\nMost condemnations of the abduction of Mr Maduro will be tame, for the prevailing unipolar world cannot withstand Mr Trump’s destructive projection of power. Nigeria was fortunate to get away with a face-saving joint attack on terrorists targets in the Tangaza forests of Sokoto State last Christmas. Had the US decided to go it alone, Nigeria would have been powerless to raise a finger. Even the Nigerian promoters of religious hegemony and ethnic exceptionalism as well as sponsors of terrorism had suddenly become deathly quiet. Had Nigeria united behind its leaders and managed its differences well, no outsider could attack. Had Venezuela united behind its controversial and flawed leader, the US would have thought twice before embarking on the crude and insane colonial exploitation it has embarked upon.\n\nIn the end, the ultimate consequence of the demolition of a rules-based global order is the rekindling of global arms race. Small and medium level countries will from now onwards strive to develop weapons capable of projecting power on such a scale that even the big powers would think twice about meddling in their affairs. North Korea did it, and has been left alone. Iran needed brilliant and circumspect leaders to do it, but it made a lot of noise, threatened genocide against Israel, and showed itself to be a regional nuisance. It will need time and perhaps change in leadership and ideology to be able to achieve military self-sufficiency and political latitude. Other ambitious countries will quietly take the lessons of history made possible in real time by the US to rearm. In the end, like every era when the world order was undermined, war will be inevitable.","url":"https://thenationonlineng.net/venezuela-attack-trump-destroys-world-order/","image":"https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04020417/•-Trump-and-•-Maduro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:24:14","author":"Palladium","authors":["Palladium"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.106},{"id":391075602,"title":"Trump says Venezuelan opposition leader who beat him to Nobel prize 'does not have support' to be president","text":"Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of working with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado after capturing the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe US President has claimed Machado, who beat him to the Nobel Peace Prize last year, 'doesn't have the support' within her country to successfully lead it. \n\nVente Venezuela Party leader Machado is widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, but Trump told reporters he has not been in contact with her. \n\n'She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country,' he said.\n\nIt comes despite Machado voicing support for US actions to fight alleged drug trafficking from Venezuela - and after she dedicated her Noble Prize win to Trump and the people in her country. \n\nMachado, who is hugely popular among Venezuelan voters, also referred to Trump's capture of Maduro as 'the hour of freedom' for her people in an X post shared shortly after the shock abduction. \n\nHer supporters, including Venezuelan businessman and former board member of the state oil company PDVSA, Pedro Burelli, have hit back at Trump's comments. \n\nMachado, 'is the most respected politician in the country,' Burelli wrote on X. 'Venezuela is broke and needy, but it is not about to surrender to absurd whims.'\n\nThe day after capturing Maduro, Trump said the dictator's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez would be the new Venezuelan leader. \n\nHe said she had been 'sworn in' as president and was 'willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again'. \n\nBut Rodriguez refused to comply, saying Maduro remained the country's only president. Trump responded by saying the US would now run Venezuela. \n\nThe saga began when US troops captured Maduro and his wife from Caracas in the early hours of Saturday Friday before transporting them to New York on drug trafficking charges. \n\nA white FBI Boeing 757 landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in upstate New York after 4:30pm Saturday afternoon. Cops subsequently boarded the plane.\n\nAround 30 minutes later, several figures including Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores flanked by a group of officials could be seen slowly disembarking the aircraft. \n\nIt is believed the couple were first taken to Puerto Rico, where another video showed them being escorted onto a different US military plane earlier in the day. \n\nShot from several hundred yards away, the footage shared by Puerto Rican broadcaster NotiCentro follows a huddle of people boarding a plane on the runway at Ramey Base, a former US Air Force strip at Rafael Hernandez International Airport.\n\nThe mayor of Aguadilla, Julio Roldan, also wrote on social media that the Venezuelan dictator had been 'transferred' through the city, which is located on the north-western coast of Puerto Rico, around 600 miles north of Caracas. \n\n'Aguadilla was the first American jurisdiction where they transferred the detainee Nicolás Maduro,' Roldan said Saturday. \n\n'An additional sample of geopolitical value Aguadilla has for our common defense.'\n\nAfter his capture by the US Army's elite Delta Force unit, Maduro and his wife were flown by helicopter to the USS Iwo Jima warship. \n\nThey are expected to be held in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, which is famous for its squalid conditions and has also housed Luigi Mangione and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. \n\nTrump said the United States would govern Venezuela indefinitely in the meantime. \n\n'We're going to run the country until as such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,' he told reporters in the wake of the shock capture. \n\nTrump offered little further detail on the logistics of running Venezuela, which has a population of 30 million, but suggested the country's vast oil reserves would be used to fund its revival. \n\nMaduro's arrest came after US forces struck Caracas amid accusations from Trump that Venezuela has been flooding the US with drugs and gang members. \n\nTrump alleged that Maduro is the leader of the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) drug trafficking operation.\n\nTrump said Saturday that he had not briefed Congress of his plans to snatch Maduro, claiming that had he done so, the news would have 'leaked' and potentially helped the Venezuelan leader to evade capture.","summary":"Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of working with

two countries, in separate statements by their foreign ministers made the announcements.\n\nWith these, the number of African countries reciprocating the US travel ban has climbed to four.\n\nOn June 6, 2025, Chad suspended the issuance of visas to American citizens as a reciprocal move to earlier US visa restrictions affecting Chadians.\n\nChadian President Mahamat Deby in a statement via social media said the suspension was effected in “accordance with the principles of reciprocity.”\n\nDeby emphasised that the action was about national pride and dignity.\n\nAlso, on December 25, 2025, Niger halted the issuance of visas to US citizens and barred nationals from entering the country.\n\nAn official statement from Niger said it had “completely and indefinitely suspended the issuance of all visas to citizens of the United States of America and has prohibited the entry of US nationals into the territory of Niger.”\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Burkina Faso’s Foreign Minister, Karamoko Traore, said, “In response to the recent measures taken by the United States restricting entry for Burkinabe citizens, the Government of Burkina Faso is applying equivalent visa measures on United States nationals.”\n\nMali’s official statement affirmed that the measure matched the US decision.\n\nIt stated, “In accordance with the principle of reciprocity and with immediate effect, the Government of the Republic of Mali will apply the same conditions and requirements to American nationals as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States of America.”\n\nMali, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger are the four landlocked countries colonised by France.\n\nIn the Proclamation 10998 of June 4, 2025, effective from June 9, 2025, entry had been suspended for immigrants and non-immigrants from 12 countries, which are Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.\n\n On December 16, 2025, Trump expanded the full travel ban and restrictions to 19 countries.\n\nAlso, travel documents from the Palestinian Authority were affected by the restrictions.\n\nThe nationals of the affected countries were suspended from entering the US, unless they were already in the US with a valid visa or qualified for exemptions such as diplomats, students, athletes, and lawful permanent residents.\n\nTrump’s decision was part of the ongoing efforts to tighten the US entry standards for travel and immigration. \n\nHowever, in the Proclamation of December 16, 2025, effective from January 1, 2026, eight more countries were added to include Burkina Faso, Laos, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Syria.\n\nAlso, 20 countries, including Nigeria, were placed under a partial ban that restricted the entry of immigrants and non-immigrants from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe countries affected were Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nNigeria not Sahelian nations – Experts\n\nSome diplomatic experts described the decision of the African countries as their sovereign rights.\n\n A former Nigerian Consul to Cameroon, Ambassador Rasheed Akinkuolie, said, “Mali and Burkina Faso have the sovereign rights to take reciprocal action against the United States of America, by banning American citizens from entering their countries.\n\n“Moreover, the relationship between the USA and the two countries is not cordial. I doubt if US citizens would risk travelling to hostile and unsafe countries that are facing a major insurgency.”\n\nHe noted that the US was helping Nigeria in fighting terrorism, which would make it difficult for the country to strain its relationship with the Trump administration.\n\n“Nigeria cannot ban US citizens from entering the country because the stakes are higher for Nigeria; it wants investors from all over the world. Moreover, the US is supporting Nigeria in fighting the Boko Haram insurgency, which is escalating, and there is a need to call for help,” Akinkuolie added.\n\nSpeaking on the same development, the Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, Prof Eghosa Osaghae, said Mali and Burkina Faso only responded to the situations as best for them.\n\nHe said, “The good thing, though, is that the international system has its own rules, its own laws, its own conventions, its own protocols, and how countries respond bilaterally and multilaterally are determined by what the core interests of those countries are. Those countries have acted within their rights to do so.”\n\nOsaghae stated that Nigeria’s issues could not be compared to those of its African counterparts.\n\nHe said, “Nigeria is not Niger, it’s not Burkina Faso, it’s not Mali, and Nigeria’s relations with the US in this particular instance are not the same as those of those countries.\n\n“So, it’s not a question of whether what they are doing is commendable or not, it must be that they are responding the way that they can fit, how they see their interests as their countries are affected. And for Nigeria, we are also a national interest-driven country, and we have made our options very clear.”\n\nThe NIIA boss added, “We have pursued friendliness and partnership with all countries in the world, and Nigeria is not an adversarial country. Nigeria has never pursued adversarial relations with any country. We’ve always sought a peaceful resolution to whatever problems.\n\n“That’s because the moral foundation of our foreign policy and national interest says reciprocity, yes, but reciprocity should be used to have win-win outcomes.”","summary":"Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger have banned US citizens from entry, reciprocating the US visa ban implemented by the Trump administration.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/us-visa-four-african-countries-ban-american-citizens/","url":"https://punchng.com/us-visa-four-african-countries-ban-american-citizens/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/24183746/US-visa.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:23:42","author":"Biodun Busari,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Biodun Busari","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.251},{"id":391076060,"title":"Was the U.S. capture of Venezuela's president legal?","text":"Washington - The U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a military operation early on Saturday morning, culminating a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that drew condemnation from some international leaders.Maduro arrived in New York on Saturday to face criminal charges.Below is a look at the legality of the U.S. action.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/01/04/world/politics/us-venezuela-maduro-legal-focus/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/01/04/515084.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:19:30","author":"Andrew Goudsward,Tom Hals","authors":["Andrew Goudsward","Tom Hals"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.586},{"id":391048098,"title":"Retired soldier dedicated to a life of service","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor-General, Sir Patrick Allen (left), greets Retired Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) Sergeant, Peter Williams, during the annual Remembrance Day ceremony at National Heroes Park in Kingston.\n\n(Photo: MARK BELL)\n\n\n Latest News, News \n\nDana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n January 3, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Retired soldier dedicated to a life of service \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — At 92 years old, veteran Sergeant Peter Xavier Williams, also called “Poppy Man” remains firmly grounded in service, discipline and faith.\n\nBorn in 1933, in Long Road, St Mary, Williams’ life story spans wartime Jamaica, the formation of the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF), and decades of national service that has continued well beyond his years in uniform.\n\nHe recalls a childhood shaped by hardship during World War II and after losing his father at the age of seven, he grew up amid food shortages, blackouts and fear of aerial attacks.\n\n“That time at war time, you couldn’t get butter. After 10 o’clock, no lights anywhere,” he stated.\n\nAt 13, Williams came under the care of national hero, the Right Excellent Sir Alexander Bustamante, who supported him until he reached adulthood. The veteran still holds letters and photographs from that period, including images he took at Sir Alexander’s funeral.\n\nWilliams’ fascination with military life began through public parades and recruitment displays held on Queen Victoria’s birthday. Watching boy scouts, cadets and soldiers march in uniform, also left a lasting impression.\n\n“I see this group of boys dressed up in pretty uniform…[and] so, I started to walk like them, march like them,” he recalled.\n\nAt 18, in 1952, he enlisted in the Jamaica Local Force, which was then under British command. His early military training, he said, was uncompromising.\n\n“Training was between life and death…You have to be obedient,” he said.\n\nHis service spanned the transition from federation to independence, and he witnessed the formation of the JDF.\n\n“Jamaica had to form their own defence force. Hence, the Jamaica Defence Force was formed,” he explained.\n\nOver a distinguished 28-year military career, six years beyond the normal retirement period, Williams served in several key roles.\n\nHe was a trained medical orderly, a drummer and bugler, a postmaster responsible for sensitive military correspondence across the British Caribbean, and a supervisor of military telephone exchanges.\n\nHe also trained the first group of women soldiers in communications when they entered the JDF in 1965.\n\nA self-taught photographer, Williams later became chief photographer for the JDF and the West Indies Regiment, documenting military life and national history.\n\n“All my photographic work can be found at the National Library at the bottom of East Street,” he said.\n\nDuring the state of emergency, Williams was assigned as postmaster at the detention centre in Up Park Camp, where he managed correspondence for detained political figures.\n\n“Not prison…we call it detention…I was the postmaster looking after the mails,” he said.\n\nAfter leaving the JDF in 1976, Williams transitioned seamlessly into civilian life, joining the Telephone Company of Jamaica as island-wide security manager.\n\nHis work earned him national recognition, including certificates of exemplary conduct and the Governor-General’s award. He also received the Independence Medal in 1962 and the Badge of Honour for Meritorious Service in 2008.\n\nHis life story was later featured in a three-page spread titled “Peter Xavier Williams: The Extraordinary” in the JDF’s 60th anniversary publication.\n\nNow regarded as the JDF’s oldest living soldier, Williams describes himself as an “ambassador” to the force.\n\n“I appoint myself ambassador to the Jamaica Defence Force. I am a leader, leading by example,” he said proudly.\n\nHe currently serves as chairman of the Jamaica Legion’s Northeast District, covering Portland, St Mary and St Ann, and remains actively involved.\n\n“I still attend meetings…I have the minutes right now to show my total participation,” he said.\n\nWilliams is believed to be the only soldier permitted to still wear his original uniform, issued on October 6, 1952.\n\n“I am proud of the uniform that I wear from there on, up to now,” he said.\n\nA central figure in national Remembrance Day observances, Williams has delivered the exhortation at ceremonies across the island, including in Parliament.\n\n“They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old…and all of them shout, ‘we will remember them,” he recited.\n\nReflecting on the values that shaped his life, Williams pointed to discipline and obedience as essential.\n\n“The most invisible uniform that anyone can ever wear is obedience. When you can discipline yourself, then you are right,” the veteran stated.\n\nFaith, he added, has been central to his longevity. He recalled a defining moment while on duty as a bugler near Palisadoes during a violent storm.\n\n“I said ‘this is the end of the world, and Jesus, I’m going to give my life to you,” he recalled.\n\nDespite his age, Williams remains mobile and independent.\n\n“I don’t need a walking stick…I just carry my umbrella just in case,” he said.\n\nFor Peter Xavier Williams, service did not end with retirement. It became a lifelong calling, anchored in faith, sustained by discipline and dedicated to country.\n\n“Yesterday is dead, tomorrow does not exist. Today is here, use it,” he stated.\n\nAt 92, Williams stands not only as Jamaica’s oldest soldier, but as a living testament to service, sacrifice and national pride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: JDF memorial service \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Starmer says UK will ‘shed no tears’ over US seizing Maduro \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday the United Kingdom (UK) will discuss the \"evolving situation\" in Ve... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Macron says Venezuela’s Gonzalez Urrutia should lead post-Maduro transition \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n PARIS, France (AFP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said that 2024 presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia should lead a peacef... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hurricane recovery a catalyst to address long-standing development constraints \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — Prime Minister, Dr Andrew Holness, says Jamaica’s recovery from Hurricane Melissa must be used as a catalyst to address long-s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Venezuelan capital quiet, streets empty after US strike \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n CARACAS, Venezuela (AFP) — A lingering smell of explosives hung over Venezuela's capital Caracas Saturday as shocked residents took stock after an ear... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gauff saves US at United Cup, Wawrinka starts farewell season with win \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n PERTH, Australia (AFP) —Coco Gauff rode to the rescue with a 6-1, 6-1 hammering of Solana Sierra to nudge the United States (US) towards a 2-1 defeat ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Joy and despair as Venezuelans react to Maduro’s capture \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n CARACAS, Venezuela (AFP) — Venezuelans across the globe are reacting following the United States (US) military operation that led to the capture of Pr... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump says US ‘will run’ Venezuela until ‘safe’ transition; opens doors to American oil firms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 3, 2026 \n\n\n PALM BEACH, United States (AFP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States (US) will \"run\" Venezuela until a political transition can oc... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The United States has offered Pyongyang repeated assurances it has no such plans.\n\n“They likely fear that if the United States so chooses, it could launch a precision strike at any moment, threatening the regime’s survival,” Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said.\n\n“The underlying message is likely that attacking North Korea would not be as easy as a strike on Venezuela,” he added.\n\n- Lee bound for China -\n\nThe test also came just hours before South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departs for Beijing for talks with counterpart Xi Jinping, whose government is a key economic backer of North Korea.\n\nLee hopes to possibly harness China’s clout over North Korea to support his bid to improve ties with Pyongyang.\n\nPyongyang has significantly stepped up missile testing in recent years.\n\nAnalysts say this drive is aimed at improving precision strike capabilities, challenging the United States as well as South Korea and testing weapons before potentially exporting them to Russia.\n\nPyongyang is also set to hold a landmark congress of its ruling party in the coming weeks -- its first in five years.\n\nEconomic policy, as well as defence and military planning, are likely to be high on the agenda.\n\nAhead of that conclave, leader Kim Jong Un ordered the “expansion” and modernisation of the country’s missile production and the construction of more factories to meet growing demand.\n\nOn Sunday, state media reported that Kim had paid a visit to a facility involved in making tactical guided weapons.\n\nHe ordered them to expand current production capacity by 250 percent, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.\n\nburs-kjk-oho/tc","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-first-test-of-2026-365121458","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/f0/80/5db358f94af9eda395bb250384de/medias","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:16:36","author":"North Korea","authors":["North Korea"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.024},{"id":391073964,"title":"Donald Trump's bet on regime change in Venezuela is a sharp departure from MAGA agenda","text":"AgenciesUS President Donald Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to ‍attack Venezuela, arrest its president and temporarily run the country marks a striking departure for a politician who long criticized others for overreaching on foreign affairs and vowed to avoid foreign entanglements. His vision for US involvement in Venezuela, sketched out in a midday news ⁠conference, left open the possibility of more military action, ongoing involvement in that nation's politics and oil industry and \"boots on the ground.\" The term suggests military deployment of the sort that presidents often avoid for fear of provoking domestic political backlash. \"We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,\" Trump said. He gave little sense of how far he was willing to go to gain control of Venezuela, where Maduro's top aides appeared to be still in power. 'THE WARS WE ‌NEVER GET INTO'As recently as his ‌inauguration for a second term last January, Trump told supporters: \"We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, by the wars we never get into.\"Live Events Since then, Trump has bombed targets in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Yemen and ‌Somalia, blown up dozens of alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean and made veiled threats to invade Greenland and Panama. The overnight attack on Venezuela was his most aggressive foreign military action yet, striking the capital Caracas and other parts of the country and capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wifeto face drug-trafficking charges in New York. These developments ran counter to some Republican hopes that the president would focus more on voters' domestic concerns - affordability, health care and the economy. Trump told the news conference that intervening in Venezuela was in line with his \"America First\" policy. \"We want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourself with stability. We want to surround ourself with energy,\" he said, referring to Venezuela's oil reserves. But the emerging political stakes were captured by a social media post from U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who has broken with Trump because of what she said has been his departure from the America First rhetoric of limiting foreign adventures. She is resigning from Congress next week. \"This is what many in ‌MAGA thought they voted to ‍end. Boy were we wrong.\" RISK OF QUAGMIRETrump's ongoing attention to foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticize Trump ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of ‍Congress is likely to turn on just a few races across the United States. Republicans narrowly control both right now, giving ‌the president a largely free hand to enact his agenda. \"Let me be clear, Maduro is an illegitimate dictator, but launching military action without congressional authorization, without a federal plan for what comes next, is reckless,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a call with reporters. Trump has worked to end several foreign conflicts, including in Ukraine and Gaza, while lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize. But U.S. military actions tend to draw more public attention and historically have carried more political risk for presidents and their parties. Polls have shown that, before the attack, the prospect of U.S. military action in Venezuela was unpopular, with roughly one out of five Americans supporting force to depose Maduro, according to a November Reuters/Ipsos survey. REPUBLICAN DEBATE OVER FOREIGN POLICYTrump's top diplomat and national security adviser Marco Rubio called several members of Congress early on Saturday in an effort to blunt opposition to military action. Mike Lee, a prominent libertarian-leaning senator, initially questioned the administration taking military action without a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force, butwrote on X he concluded that the operation likely fell within the ‍president's authority after speaking to Rubio. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a frequent Trump critic, wrote in a post on X that Trump's warning of further strikes on Venezuela \"Doesn't seem the least bit consistent\" with Rubio's characterization to Lee. \"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in ‍violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm ⁠law,\" Massie wrote in a separate post. U.S. 'WILL GET TANGLED UP'For ⁠a president who has consistently contrasted himself with the Republican \"neoconservatives\" of the late 20th century, Trump's foreign policy has developed striking similarities with that of his predecessors. In 1983, under former President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. invaded Grenada, claiming that the government at that time was illegitimate, a claim Trump has also made with respect to Maduro. In 1989, former President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to depose dictator Manuel Noriega who, like Maduro, was wanted on U.S. drug-trafficking charges. In that case, the U.S. installed Noriega's replacement. Elliott Abrams, who served as Venezuela envoy in Trump's first term, said he did not believe the president was running a political risk at home in ousting Maduro and that he \"has a lot of latitude as long as American troops are not dying.\" But he acknowledged: \"I don't know what running Venezuela means.\" \"He's done the right thing in removing Maduro,\" said Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. \"The question is whether he will do the right thing in supporting democracy in Venezuela.\" Brett Bruen, a former foreign policy adviser in Barack Obama's administration, said the U.S. could now be sucked into overseeing a complex transition process. \"I don't see any short version of this story,\" said Bruen, now head of the Global Situation Room, an international affairs consultancy. \"The U.S. will get tangled up in Venezuela but will also have new problems to contend with related to its neighbors.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDonald TrumpVenezuelaUS VenezuelaVenezuela modurotrumpUS MAGA agenda\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onDonald TrumpVenezuelaUS VenezuelaVenezuela modurotrumpUS MAGA agenda \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"President Trump's decision to attack Venezuela, arrest its president, and temporarily run the country marks a significant shift from his past rhetoric on foreign entanglements.

He also had accused the Trump administration of seeking to depose him and seize control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.\n\nDemocratic Party lawmakers in the US had been demanding answers from the Trump administration about its aims in Venezuela, accusing the Republican president of seeking to unlawfully carry out acts of war without congressional oversight.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war.\n\nBut that authority has been weakened over the last several decades, with the US carrying out military strikes around the world during its so-called “war on terror” based on loosely-interpreted congressional authorisations.\n\nOn Saturday, Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said that, despite the Trump administration’s claims, “there was no imminent threat to the United States” from Venezuela, “certainly not one that justified military action without congressional authorization”.\n\n“These actions violate both US and international law and, by Trump’s own admission, this is not a limited operation,” Meeks said in a statement shared on social media.\n\nThis was echoed by the University of Pennsylvania’s Finkelstein, who said there was no “immediate threat” to the US that would justify the executive branch carrying out attacks without notifying Congress.\n\n“It was an act of war against Venezuela, and we did not have the kind of self-defence justification that would normally justify bypassing Congress,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Even if you believe the US is at grave danger because of drug trafficking, there isn’t the kind of imminence there that would justify the president moving unilaterally and not turning to Congress and trying to get them on board.”\n\nFinkelstein also rejected Trump’s plans for the US to “run” Venezuela as “incredibly illegal”.\n\n“States have sovereignty rights, and you cannot just invade them and take them over,” she said.\n\n“Even if Maduro were to fall of his own accord and we had not brought that about, we don’t have the right to go in and start running their government,” Finkelstein said.\n\n“Democracy is premised on the idea that the people are sovereign and the people choose their own leaders, and that’s something we should be promoting in Latin and South America, not trying to undermine.”","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/act-of-war-expert-rejects-trump-rationale-for-venezuela-attack/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/epa_695993b79702-1767478199-u53MNF.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:06:09","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":0.015},{"id":391075004,"title":"What are the implications of US ‘capture’ of Nicolas Maduro?  - St. Kitts Gazette – Daily News from St Kitts","text":"US special forces seized Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, in an attack that has taken the country and the world by surprise.\n\nMaduro has long denied accusations by US President Donald Trump of heading a narcotics cartel.\n\nSo, what are the implications of Washington’s actions?\n\nPresenter: James Bays\n\nPhil Gunson – senior analyst for the Andes Project at the International Crisis Group\n\nRichard Weitz – US security analyst and senior fellow at the NATO Defense College\n\nTemir Porras – foreign policy adviser to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and former chief of staff to Maduro","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/what-are-the-implications-of-us-capture-of-nicolas-maduro/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/image-1767479585-hyXOBN.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:06:07","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":391074020,"title":"'Officially stripped': Trump's 'peace prize' called into question after Venezuela attack","text":"Donald Trump in December was given a medal as he was awarded the FIFA Peace Prize, which some have dubbed a \"participation trophy\" for the president who has long coveted the Nobel Peace Prize, but even the backup award he received is being called into question after the U.S. captured Venezuela's leader.\n\nTrump early on Saturday morning announced a successful plot for the U.S. to capture the foreign leader and his wife.

I can't wait to be back in my country!'Venezuelans in Chile have been spooked by the campaign promises of far-right president-elect Jose Antonio Kast to deport nearly 340,000 undocumented migrants he blames for a perceived rise in crime.In Miami thousands more gathered, singing and kissing the Venezuelan flag.'Thank you, Trump!' one shouted about the US president.'Today, January 3rd, the dreams of Venezuelans abroad came true,' Ana Gonzalez, one of the revelers, told AFP.Another, Anabela Ramos, said she had been waiting '27 years for this moment and now it's finally happened, it's finally happened!'In Spain, home to about 400,000 Venezuelans, thousands came together in Madrid to celebrate.'He is gone, he is gone!' they shouted, many with Venezuelan flags draped over their shoulders.'I came to celebrate: at last we're emerging from this dictatorship,' said Pedro Marcano, 47, who has his heart set on going home after 11 years abroad.But first, 'we'll need things to be a bit clearer,' he said.The country's future is uncertain, with Trump saying Saturday the United States will 'run' Venezuela until a power transfer can happen.Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has said she is ready to work with Washington, according to Trump, who said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado 'doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country' to be president.Rodriguez later insisted in a public address that Maduro was Venezuela's 'only president' and the government was 'ready to defend' the country.At the Madrid rally, a message from Machado was played over a loudspeaker, and the crowd fell silent.'Venezuela will be free!' she said, and Marcano wiped a tear.In Buenos Aires, thousands similarly gathered in a joyous atmosphere.'No one wishes for an invasion and a bombing... but it was needed,' said 39-year-old Carlos Sierra, who left Venezuela in 2017.'It gives you back the hope of returning to your country.''Divine justice'In the capital of Colombia, which hosts nearly three million Venezuelans -- more than any other country -- hairdresser Kevin Zambrano grinned as he told AFP he was 'Happy, happy, happy' to see the back of Maduro.'The first step is done, and everything else is a gain. (Thanks) to Donald Trump for helping Venezuela,' he said in Bogota, having left his home country 10 years ago.Yeiner Benitez, a security guard in the Colombian capital, teared up as he recalled the hardship and fear that drove him to leave Venezuela in 2022.During his absence, his uncle died from what Benitez said was a common illness due to a lack of medication -- a regular occurrence in the economically ravaged country.'Venezuela has gone through a very difficult process; these have been very hard years -- years of hunger, misery, torture, friends lost, friends who disappeared,' Benitez said.'So, forgive the emotion, but what's happening today is extraordinary; it's divine justice.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/01/04/world/venezuelans-abroad-celebrate-maduro-ouster/2252305","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/04/886566.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:02:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.149},{"id":391072974,"title":"Saturday's Final Word","text":"What a beautiful tab, comin' into my room ...\n\nAnd PSA for everyone saying this was \"illegal\":Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism. You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.— JD Vance (@JDVance) January 3, 2026\n\nEd: We established that precedent in Panama 37 years ago. And speaking of that precedent ...\n\nJonathan Turley: Trump does not need congressional approval for this type of operation. Presidents, including Democratic presidents, have launched lethal attacks regularly against individuals. President Barack Obama killed an American citizen under this “kill list” policy. If Obama can vaporize an American citizen without even a criminal charge, Trump can capture a foreign citizen with a pending criminal indictment without prior congressional approval.\n\nOrdinarily, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other international agreements require the United States to notify the embassy of a foreign national arrested and held in the United States. Notice seems a tad superfluous in this case.\n\nIn his appeal, Noriega argued that his arrest violated international law under the head-of-state immunity doctrine. The district court rejected Noriega’s head-of-state immunity claim because the United States government never recognized Noriega as Panama’s legitimate ruler — an argument that will be made in the Maduro prosecution.\n\nThe United States for the Eleventh Circuit also rejected the immunity claim.\n\nEd: As I mentioned earlier, the precedent Obama established in Libya is actually stronger than the one he set with Anwar al-Awlaki (and son). Obama used US military forces for a sustained assault on Moammar Qaddafi's regime in 2011 with the express purpose of deposing him, along with the EU. Obama never bothered to report this operation to Congress at all, not even after it ended. Democrats defended that under the Samanatha Power-created doctrine of \"responsibility to protect,\" a bitterly ironic term considering the catastrophic outcome in Libya. \n\nMaduro: \"Come for me, I am waiting for you... coward!\"Trump: pic.twitter.com/kPOvhQVqC1— Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) January 3, 2026\n\nEd: I swear, this is almost a replay of Panama and Noriega. Remember when \"the Pineapple\" banged his machete on a podium and dared the US to come after him? That worked out just as well.\n\nJohn Hinderaker at Power Line: As AG Bondi says, Maduro was indicted several years ago in the Southern District of New York. I don’t know what rules govern venue in a case of this kind, nor do I know whether it is feasible to bring a new set of charges in a different jurisdiction.\n\nBut I would warn the administration that there is little chance of convicting Maduro in the Southern District of New York, i.e., New York City. Democratic Party jurors would vote to acquit Communism, mass murder, drug trafficking and starving children 100% of the time, simply to spite Donald Trump. Maybe DOJ could get a conviction in Miami, but in New York or, say, Washington D.C.? Highly unlikely, with the Democratic Party on the other side.\n\nEd: I am more optimistic than John on this score. It might have been easier to prosecute this in Florida, but the DoJ has a strong case in any venue. Maduro isn't a Democrat politician, after all. Still, I'd be more comfortable if the trial took place in Tallahassee than in lower Manhattan. \n\nRough translation of Maria Corina's message:Venezuelans, The HOUR OF LIBERTY has arrived!As of today, Nicolás Maduro faces international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations.

Unleashing…— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) January 3, 2026\n\nEd: #4 is my favorite. \n\nLuther Ray Abel, NRO: There will be more thoughtful columns on the site today concerning the prosecution of our raid on Venezuela and the capture of Nicolás Maduro. Nonetheless, I feel the need to note that when the U.S. and her military get to feeling frisky, there isn’t much anyone, anywhere, can do about it, and the bad actors of the world should thank their lucky stars we have as many political, structural, and ethical checks on foreign intervention as we do.\n\nI grew up in the wane of the Global War on Terrorism when, after the invasion of Iraq and the ensuing embarrassments, we no longer felt that we were a moral actor. The ensuing rise of Obama and his apology tours — combined with a miasma of general cynicism regarding interventionism of any stripe — that so delighted our enemies in Russia, China, and collectivists everywhere, claimed that the U.S. had not waged a righteous war since we toppled Hitler. It was always Zinnian crap, but it was the prevailing narrative.\n\nHow good it is to sit here today and see reports of our victory for the Venezuelan people. \n\nEd: This could still go sideways too. However, it's worth noting that Panama has remained friendly to the US after we took Noriega into custody in 1989, and that we managed to avoid repetitive juntas there. Let's see how this goes before fully assessing the value of the operation, but it's certainly a move that opens up options for liberty and an end to the narco-trafficking taking place with the illegitimate Maduro regime. \n\nAdd that it is being reported this was supposed to happen four days ago but delayed because of weather and that no leaks happened in that span of time is really quite remarkable. https://t.co/VkVKRmvbW1— ZitoSalena (@ZitoSalena) January 3, 2026\n\nEd: Funny how professionalism and focus on core missions tend to tighten up how militaries operate. \n\nMaduro: the only illegal alien Dems *don’t* want to bring to the US.— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY) January 3, 2026\n\nEd: Get ready for lots of performative outrage, but ... yeah. \n\nMediaite: “The Mexican president, the Colombian president…I think all of those leaders have to be looking over their shoulder as far as what that means, and where this goes, and tying to the drug cartels. That’s the ultimate threat here, the drug cartels, and the use of different cartels to funnel drugs into the U.S., thereby making a case against these leaders,” Baier said before telling the story of his proposed interview with Maduro.\n\n“I will tell you something here that I was not going to say — We were contacted through intermediaries to have potentially an interview with Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. We were in the process of having back-channel communications. They wanted me to come to Caracas. It was not feasible; they couldn’t make a decision. He was worried about security. I was talking to the US about the possibilities, then this came to pass.”\n\nBaier added, “Obviously Nicolás Maduro saw that this was coming. You saw the video of him in the car doing an interview with the Spanish channel saying, ‘I’ll give the U.S. whatever they want. He knew this was transpiring. My wife was not into me going to to Caracas either, but I was ready to go.”\n\nEd: I bet that Bret Baier wishes he'd been in the country when this happened ... and that Mrs. Baier is delighted he wasn't. \n\nPresident Trump has done something very important. He has reestablished U.S. military might, morale and credibility - at home and abroad. https://t.co/snW0Z3VykL— Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) January 3, 2026\n\nNBC News: \"We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" to new leadership, Trump said during a press conference in Florida.\n\nThe U.S. president added that he didn't want a new leader to take over in the wake of Maduro's capture that would result in \"the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.\"\n\n\"So, we are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.

president","text":"Supporters of Venezuelan President, Nicolás Maduro, have embarked on protests in the country’s capital, Caracas, following the capture of the president and his wife.\n\nThe Venezuelans were demanding that President Donald Trump release Maduro.\n\nSome were chanting “we want Maduro” as they are led in a march by the Mayor of Caracas, Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, according to the BBC.\n\nWearing a military uniform, the mayor said she and others had taken to the streets to protest against what she described as Maduro’s “kidnapping.”\n\nThis is as Russia, the African Union, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, some Latin American leaders, and Nigerian activists have condemned the US action.\n\nGuterres warned that the US move represents “a dangerous precedent” and risks undermining international law.\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday in New York by the UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed” by the escalating standoff between Washington and Caracas in recent months, which culminated in the early-hours military operation announced by the US.\n\nThe AU, in a communiqué issued on Saturday, reaffirmed its commitment to international law, highlighting the importance of respecting national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the right of peoples to self-determination.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of the government expressed hope that the capture of Maduro and his wife would lead to a change of government.\n\nShortly after Maduro was captured, the streets of Venezuela appeared calm as the sun rose.\n\nSoldiers patrolled some parts, while small pro-Maduro crowds began gathering in Caracas.\n\nSome Venezuelans, however, expressed relief.\n\n“I’m happy, I doubted for a moment that it was happening because it’s like a movie,” said merchant Carolina Pimentel, 37, in the city of Maracay, while speaking with Reuters.\n\n“It’s all calm now, but I feel like at any moment everyone will be out celebrating.”\n\nVenezuelans in Caracas said they had been expecting a US military strike for some time.\n\nMany of the close to eight million Venezuelans who have left the country since Maduro came to power celebrated openly in the streets of the cities where they have settled.\n\nThe opposition leader of Venezuela and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Corina Machado, welcomed the US intervention, saying the country’s “hour of freedom” had arrived.\n\nShe said on social media that President Maduro was removed from power after refusing a negotiated exit, and that the opposition’s candidate for the 2024 elections, Edmundo Gonzalez, should now “assume” the presidency.\n\nMachado added that the opposition would restore order in the country and free political prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, some fierce critics of Maduro are uncomfortable with US intervention, fearing it could lead to further destabilisation, and have not supported Machado’s close alliance with the Trump administration.\n\nBut some critics see this as a final resort to get rid of what they believe was an authoritarian and oppressive regime.\n\nTrump has described the successful military operation in Venezuela as a display of overwhelming military power and a spectacular assault.\n\n“This was one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American might and competence in American history,” Trump said at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he was flanked by senior officials, including the Secretary of Defence, Pete Hegseth, and the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump added that no American military personnel were killed and no US military equipment was destroyed, while the objective — capturing Nicolás Maduro and his wife — was achieved.\n\nHe said American officials would take control of Venezuela.\n\n“We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\n\n“We can’t take a chance that someone else takes over Venezuela who doesn’t have the interests of Venezuelans in mind,” Trump added.\n\nTrump claimed the US “partnership” with Venezuela would make the people of the country “rich, independent and safe,” adding that Venezuelans living in the US would be “extremely happy.\n\n“They’re not going to suffer any more,” he told the news conference.\n\nTrump called Maduro an “illegitimate dictator” responsible for bringing “colossal amounts of deadly illicit drugs” into the US, accusing him of overseeing the Cartel de los Soles cartel.\n\nMaduro has previously vehemently denied being a cartel leader.\n\nHe claimed the oil business in Venezuela had been a “bust” and said large US companies would go into the country to fix the infrastructure and “start making money for the country.”\n\nHe added that the US was “ready” to stage a second and “much larger” attack on the country if needed.\n\nTrump said they were initially prepared to carry out a “second wave” and had assumed it would be necessary, but given the success of the previous night’s attack, it probably would not be.\n\n“No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday. All Venezuelan military capabilities were rendered powerless in the attack,” he said.\n\nTrump added that the lights of Caracas were turned off during the operation “due to a certain expertise” that America has.\n\nIn the words of one of the American architects of the Iraq War, Secretary of State Colin Powell, “If you break it, you own it.”\n\nThe US president said Maduro and his wife were captured from a fortress-like house and were being taken to New York, adding that there were “a few injuries but no deaths on our side.”\n\nMaduro is expected to be arraigned in a New York Federal Court in the Southern District of New York next week, possibly as early as Monday.\n\nMaduro has been indicted in New York on drug and weapons charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, adding that he would “face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nWhile Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, as well as Russia, has called on the United States to issue “proof of life” of Maduro, President Trump has shared a photo which he said showed Maduro onboard the USS Iwo Jima — the proof-of-life photograph shows him blindfolded and wearing ear defenders.\n\nRusia, Latin American leaders condemn Trump\n\nRussia, Latin American leaders, and several countries have condemned the United States military action in Venezuela, describing it as unjustified and a violation of international law.\n\nRussia, in a statement, said there was no tenable justification for the attack, accusing Washington of allowing ideological hostility to override diplomacy.\n\nVenezuela remains Russia’s most important ally in South America, although the Kremlin has stopped short of offering direct military assistance to Caracas in the event of a conflict with the US.\n\nSimilarly, Colombian President, Gustavo Petro, said Colombia rejected what he described as aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Washington of carrying out a criminal attack, describing the action as state terrorism against Venezuela and the wider region.\n\nAlso, Chilean President Gabriel Boric expressed concern and condemnation, calling for a peaceful solution to Venezuela’s crisis.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also condemned the military intervention, citing the UN Charter’s prohibition against the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the US bombings and the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro crossed an unacceptable line.\n\nAccording to him, attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law opens the door to violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest replaces multilateralism and global cooperation.\n\nThe US operation, which reportedly involved the capture of President Maduro and his wife, has also drawn criticism from Nigeria.\n\nSimilarly, Nigerian former senator, Shehu Sani, condemned the action, comparing it to previous US-led regime changes in Iraq and Libya.\n\nHe accused the US President of acting without congressional approval and in disregard of international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty.\n\nIn the same vein, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, also criticised the move, describing it as an illegal regime change agenda and condemning what he called the kidnapping of Venezuela’s elected leader and his wife.","summary":"A US military operation sees Trump captures Maduro and his wife, leading to protests, celebrations, and strong condemnation from Russia and Latin America.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/mixed-reactions-as-trump-captures-venezuelan-president/","url":"https://punchng.com/mixed-reactions-as-trump-captures-venezuelan-president/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16071643/AFP__20251215__2252097190__v2__MidRes__PresidentTrumpPresentsTheMexicanBorderDefense-1024x630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 01:00:47","author":"Anna Moneymaker,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Anna Moneymaker","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.037},{"id":391072744,"title":"World leaders react to Donald Trump's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro","text":"Several world leaders have reacted to the news that President Nicolas Maduro has been captured by American troops.

The Venezuelan President and his wife have now arrived in the US where they have been charged with several offences, including Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy. At least 40 people have been killed in the US attack on Venezuela, with the death toll made up of both civilians and military officials, a senior Venezuelan official has said.

He said that American forces, working with law enforcement agencies, captured Maduro and his wife in a night-time operation.While addressing a press conference in Florida, Trump said, “No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday or frankly, in just a short period of time.

He also said the companies would not go back until sanctions against the country are removed.\n\nVenezuela would also have to reform its laws to allow for larger investment by foreign oil companies.\n\nVenezuela nationalised the industry in the 1970s, and in the 2000s ordered a forced migration to joint ventures controlled by its state oil company, PDVSA.\n\nMost companies negotiated exits and migrated, including Chevron, while a handful of others did not reach deals and filed for arbitration.\n\nThere is a lot that could go wrong\n\n“If Trump et al can produce a peaceful transition with little resistance, then in five to seven years there is a significant oil-production ramp up as infrastructure is repaired and investments get sorted out,” Dr Thomas O’Donnell, an energy and geopolitical strategist, told Reuters, adding that heavy crude produced in the country works well with US Gulf Coast refineries and can also be blended with lighter oil produced from fracking. \n\nBut that would depend on everything going right, and there is a lot that could go wrong.\n\n“A botched political transition that has a feeling of US dominance can lead to years of resistance,” Dr O’Donnell said, noting armed groups of citizens and guerrilla groups that operate in the country.\n\nChevron would be positioned to benefit the most from any potential oil opening in Venezuela, said Dr Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute in Houston. Other US oil companies would be paying close attention to political stability and would wait to see how the operational environment and contract framework unfolded, he added.\n\nVenezuela - a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - produced as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7 per cent of global oil output.\n\nProduction fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd in 2025, or just 1 per cent of global production.\n\nChevron is the only US oil major operating in Venezuela\n\nChevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela. Conoco has been seeking billions for the takeover of three oil projects nearly two decades ago, while Exxon was also involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country nearly two decades ago. \n\n“The company that probably will be very interested in going back is Conoco, because they are owed more than US$10 billion (S$12.86 billion), and it’s unlikely that they will get paid without going back into the country,” Dr Monaldi said.

It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,” a company spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters. \n\nChevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the US Gulf Coast, has had to carefully manoeuvre with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country over the past year.\n\nChief executive Mike Wirth said in December that he had spoken with the Trump administration about what he said was the importance of maintaining an American presence in the country through multiple political cycles.\n\nThe oil firm has been in Venezuela for over 100 years and said on Jan 3 that it is focused on the safety and well-being of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets.\n\n“We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nExxon did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nOPEC and allies will meet on Jan 4 and are expected to maintain current oil output policy.

Bush with Iraq. Obama with Libya. In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela,” Mr Hirs said. \n\nOil tankers chartered by Chevron had been among the few to set sail from Venezuela over the past month, following Trump’s December announcement of a “blockade” of sanctioned tankers entering and leaving the country.\n\nThe country had exported around 921,000 bpd in November, with much of that going to China.\n\nThat is perhaps where one quick win could emerge, if Mr Trump is able to restart the flow of Venezuelan crude into the US Gulf, potentially boosting refiners like Valero in the process.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that just the opposite is happening.

At 10.46pm EST on Friday, Trump gave the final go ahead for what would be known as Operation Absolute Resolve, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine told reporters.\nTrump, surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, watched a live stream of the events.\nHow the hours-long operation unfolded is based on interviews with four sources familiar with the matter and details Trump himself has ‍revealed.\n“I’ve done some pretty good ones, but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Trump said on Fox News just hours after the mission was completed.\nThe Pentagon has overseen a massive military build-up of forces in the Caribbean, sending ‍an aircraft carrier, 11 warships and more than a dozen F-35 aircraft. In total, more than 15,000 troops have poured into the region for what US officials have long described as anti-drug operations.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, Trump senior aide Stephen Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe formed a core team working ‌on the issue for months with regular - sometimes daily - meetings and phone calls. They often also met with the president.\nLate on Friday night and into early Saturday, Trump and his advisers huddled as a number of US aircraft took off and carried ‍out strikes against targets inside and close to Caracas, including air defence systems, according to a US military official.\nCaine said the operation involved more than 150 aircraft launched from 20 bases around the Western Hemisphere, including F-35 and F-22 jets, and B-1 bombers.\n“We had a fighter jet for every possible situation,” Trump told Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends.\nSources have told Reuters the Pentagon had also quietly moved into the region, refuelling air tankers, drones and aircraft specialising in electronic jamming.\nUS officials said the air strikes hit military targets. Images taken at the La Carlota airbase in Caracas showed charred ‌military vehicles ⁠from a Venezuelan anti-aircraft unit.\n\nWith the strikes taking place, US special forces made their way into Caracas heavily armed, including with a blowtorch in case they had to cut through steel doors at Maduro’s location.\nAround 1am EST on Saturday, Caine said, the troops arrived at Maduro’s compound in downtown Caracas while being fired upon. One of the helicopters was hit, but still able to fly.\nSocial media videos posted by residents showed a convoy of helicopters flying over the city at low altitude.\nOnce they reached Maduro’s safe house the troops, along with FBI agents, made their way into the residence, which Trump described as a “very highly guarded ... fortress”.\n“They just broke in, and they broke into places that ‌were not really able to be broke into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,” Trump said. “They got taken out in a matter of seconds.”\nOnce the troops were inside the safe house, Caine said, Maduro and his wife surrendered.

I have previously warned these terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.”\n\nThe Federal Government, while confirming the strikes, said it gave the US support and that the strikes were carried out on targeted areas being used by the terrorists.\n\nHowever, there were controversies over the success of the operations, as some people believed that the missiles hit the wrong targets in Sokoto and Kwara states, where no casualty was recorded.\n\nAt Jabo, Tambuwal Local Government Area of Sokoto State, a missile reportedly hit a farmland, while some buildings were affected in Offa, Kwara State.\n\nAlthough there were no deaths, several residents sustained injuries, while properties worth millions of naira were destroyed in Offa, Kwara State after being hit by missiles.\n\nA top security source told Saturday PUNCH that the strike was successful, disclosing that over 16 missiles were fired at the enclaves.\n\nAsked why there was no photo or video evidence, the intelligence officer said the peculiarity of the location slowed down the gathering of evidence of the operations.\n\n“The operation was successful, and the terrorists have been decimated. From our findings, over 16 missiles were fired at the terrorists’ hideouts and they were caught unawares. But because their camps are in deep forests, pictures or videos couldn’t be taken from the air, and troops are also cautioned against going to the location for now. They may be laying ambushes after being dislocated,” he said.\n\nAnother security operative in Tangaza, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the strike dealt a significant blow to Lakurawa operations.\n\n“We have not been authorised to disclose details, but the strike was successful. Several camps were destroyed. The attack came unexpectedly and did not give them enough time to escape or secure their bases,” he said.\n\nSimilarly, locals in Tangaza Local Government said the operations were successful, noting that there had been no traces of the terrorists since the strikes.\n\nAccording to the residents, the terrorist hideouts in Kawuri-Kandam, Malgam and Kahuri were hit by the missiles, adding that the operations have significantly weakened the group’s presence.\n\nA resident of Tangaza town, Abubakar Shehu, said peace had returned to the community since the operations.\n\nRecounting the strikes, Shehu said, “The ground shook, then fire followed. The strike sent fear into their camps. \n\n“People from Gongono told us they saw remnants of the terrorists fleeing their base in Kawuri-Kandam and Malgam, where they had dug wells and established permanent hideouts.\n\n“My brother personally saw about 15 motorcycles carrying multiple passengers heading eastward.”\n\nHe added that the community had endured years of terror before the strikes.\n\n“We have been terrorised by Lakurawa for a long time. That is why many of us are relieved by this development,” he said.\n\nAccording to Shehu, residents could not immediately approach the affected locations due to fear of armed remnants, but relatives confirmed seeing large numbers of fighters escaping.\n\nAnother resident, Mallam Umar Aliyu, said he heard multiple explosions.\n\n“We heard loud sounds three times. The impact shook our houses. Later, we saw fire in the distance, and it was then we realised it was the Lakurawa camp in Kahuri being hit by missiles. There were panics everywhere.\n\n“Today, there is no sign of life in Kahuri, Kandam or Malgam. They have all fled,” he said.\n\n For many residents, the strike represents a turning point after prolonged hardship.\n\nA traditional herbal medicine seller, Nafiu Umar, said Lakurawa terrorists had destroyed his means of survival.\n\n“They killed my monkey and hyena, which I used to entertain people and attract customers. They almost killed me too.\n\n“They warned me to stop my traditional practice, saying it was against their version of Islam. That was my only source of livelihood,” he lamented.\n\nUmar said he now survives by quietly visiting known customers and avoids public spaces out of fear.\n\nSimilarly, Bello Abdullah, a former provisions trader, said his entire village was sacked by the terrorists.\n\n“My community was completely sacked. Nobody lived there for months until the army increased patrols.\n\n“I refused to return because my lifestyle and dressing did not align with their rules. I was scared when I heard the blast, but thankfully civilians were not affected,” he said.\n\nAbdullahi called for continued support for the Nigerian military, saying their presence had restored a measure of calm.","summary":"Residents report US airstrikes in Sokoto successfully destroyed Lakurawa terrorist camps, with survivors fleeing and no signs of life left in the area.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/no-sign-of-life-in-lakurawa-camps-after-us-strikes-sokoto-residents/","url":"https://punchng.com/no-sign-of-life-in-lakurawa-camps-after-us-strikes-sokoto-residents/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/26140037/AFP__20251226__892P763__v1__Mockup__FilesNigeriaUsUnrestConflict-1200x630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:52:30","author":"Light Oriye Tamunotonye,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Light Oriye Tamunotonye","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":391075332,"title":"At last': Venezuelans abroad celebrate Maduro ouster","text":"Some of the nearly eight million Venezuelans who fled economic collapse and repression under Nicolas Maduro gathered in their thousands in cities worldwide Saturday to celebrate the strongman’s ouster by US forces.\n\nThousands massed in the capitals of Chile, Mexico, Argentina and in Miami, dancing and hugging and waving Venezuelan flags.\n\n“At last we’ll be able to go back home,” street vendor Yurimar Rojas told AFP, straining to make himself heard over an ebullient crowd gathered in Santiago, many decked out in the Venezuelan national colors of yellow, blue and red.\n\nMaduro, whose claims to reelection in 2018 and 2024 were widely dismissed as fraudulent, was snatched by US forces in an early-morning military strike and flown to New York to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.\n\n“This is tremendous for us,” celebrated Yasmery Gallardo, 61, who said she planned to return home soon from Chile, where she has lived for eight years.\n\n“I’m already planning my trip...

His rule abruptly ended on Saturday when President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had captured him and flown him out ​of the country. Trump said later the U.S. would run Venezuela with a group, adding this would be \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"A 63-year-old socialist and the ‌handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro was long accused by critics both at home and abroad of being a dictator who jailed ⁠or persecuted political opponents and repeatedly staged sham elections. .Maduro, a salsa aficionado ‌with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians \"fascist demons\" and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of \"yes peace, not war\" remixed into an electronica song. He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Thousands of people who protested against the government's declaration of victory were jailed. .Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham. His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the awarding of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.After Trump announced last ​October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted \"those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil.\" Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption.In August, Washington doubled its reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups. Trump said on Saturday that Maduro and his wife would now face American justice.Trump ratcheted up the pressure in recent months with a huge build-up of the U.S. military in the southern ‌Caribbean, more than two dozen strikes ‌on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and a ramping up of sanctions. .Maduro Denied Accusations of Rights Abuses a UN Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a ⁠decade in targeting political opponents.Maduro long denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil.He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an \"economic war\" designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro.Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a ⁠period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Those protests left 125 people dead. Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration ⁠to his second term in 2019. After the 2024 election, the U.N. found that Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests, with over two dozen ‌dead and 2,400 arrests. .Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants.Almost 82% of ‌Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs, a U.N. special rapporteur said in 2024 after visiting the country. .Bus Driver's Rise to PowerMaduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison ‍and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor.After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America.Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast. . But the criticism made little dent in his meteoric rise: he became president of the National Assembly and later foreign minister. In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs.Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. But there was a gaping chasm between his own appeal and the legendary charisma of his predecessor.His rule was quickly plagued by bread lines and product shortages that smacked of Soviet-era collapse, largely due to his unwillingness to unwind lavish Chavez-era subsidies that were unsustainable after the oil boom came to an end.As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the ​run-up to a nationwide election for mayors.In 2018, militants attempted to ‌assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events.Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse.Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country</p","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/world/nicolas-maduros-tight-grip-on-venezuela-shaken-loose-by-trump-blitz-3850904","image":"https://media.assettype.com/deccanherald/2026-01-04/asb70h30/2026-01-03T231549Z153626405RC2YTIAACR7JRTRMADP5USA-VENEZUELA-EXPLOSIONS-1.JPG?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:52:06","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":391072256,"title":"Venezuela travel warning: Australians warned help is ‘severely limited’ after US captures President Nicolas Maduro","text":"Australia has called for a transition in power that “reflects the will of the Venezuelan people” after the US captured the South American country’s president and threatened to place it under its immediate control.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the federal government was monitoring developments in Venezuela after President Donald Trump played up the “large scale” strike in Caracas saying US forces had spirited Nicolas Maduro and his wife out of the country.\n\nAt least seven blasts were heard in Caracas on Saturday night Australian time as low-flying US aircraft swept over the capital.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Arrow\n\nVenezuelan authorities have said some had been killed, but the scale of casualties remains unclear.\n\nVenezuelan president Nicolas Maduro arrived in New York after 5pm, local time, to face drug charges alongside his wife Cilia Flores.\n\nSmartraveller, the Australian government’s advice website, warned travellers to avoid the nation — and issued urgent advice to anyone currently in the South American country.\n\n“A state of emergency is currently in place due to military strikes at multiple locations in Venezuela, including military facilities in Caracas and the states of Miranda, Aragua, and La Guaira,” Smartraveller warned.\n\n“The security situation is unpredictable and may worsen.

As Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined critical strategic shifts regarding the Venezuela operation, the commander-in-chief was observed with his eyes closed for extended periods.This latest lapse occurred in the Cabinet Room, where senior officials had gathered to discuss regional security. Witnesses noted that Trump couldn't keep his eyes open and would frequently close them, and many were convinced that he fell asleep during those times as General Caine provided updates on troop movements and logistics.A Pattern of Public DrowsinessOn Saturday, 3 January, Trump and his team held a briefing at Mar-a-Lago just hours after the US strikes on Venezuela that led to Maduro's capture. The President's apparent slumber occurred while General Caine discussed the complexities of the Caracas intervention.Despite the gravity of the national security implications, Trump remained in his standing position, closing his eyes from time to time, noticeably fighting to stay awake during the briefing. Observers in the room described an atmosphere of quiet tension as the POTUS' aides attempted to maintain the flow of the presentation while he looked like he was about to fall asleep, Daily Beast reported.Trump struggling to keep himself awake is not an isolated event; he has been seen in the same state at multiple Cabinet Meetings. At one point, he nodded off for nearly 20 minutes during a meeting with international trade advisors. During that session, staff reportedly lowered their voices to avoid waking him, while others exchanged concerned glances.In another incident, he was seen falling asleep during a discussion about a substantial aid package for US farmers. However, despite seemingly dozing off, Trump suddenly jolted awake and commented to correct the figure that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins mentioned.Rollins talked about the $11 billion (£8.7 billion) budget, and Trump said, 'It's $12 billion (£9 billion).' The former explained that they would keep the $1 billion (£563 million) budget as a contingency fund, and the President replied, 'Ahhh, very tricky.'It turned out that Trump was still listening and was alert despite falling asleep during meetings. However, the sight of the 79-year-old businessman-turned-politician struggling with drowsiness has led many to question his stamina and energy.'It's Very Relaxing to Me'The recurring episodes of Trump dozing off even earned him the moniker 'Dozy Don.' Trump, for his part, denied falling asleep during those meetings. According to him, he just closed his eyes because 'It's very relaxing to me.' He also acknowledged that there were photos of him 'blinking,' seemingly denying that he nodded off.Trump talked about his health in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, and he insisted that his health was 'perfect.' He, however, wanted to cut down the number of meetings involving him this year.Trump clarified that his decision to attend fewer meetings had nothing to do with his health. Instead, he wanted to be selective, so he could use his time 'more efficiently.' The POTUS aimed to be present on high-stakes negotiations and critical policy decisions, and distance himself from events that do not require his direct presence.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dozy-don-trump-battles-drowsiness-general-caine-details-venezuela-operation-1767954","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779679/trump-claims-national-guard-intervention-reduced-crimes-chicago-portland.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ef604868fd9e4214d8973fb0a6ca0ddd","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:50:18","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":391073960,"title":"The Venezuelan oil industry Trump is planning to revive","text":"NYT News Service\n\nVenezuela's oil industry would \"make a lot of money\" with the United States behind it, President Donald Trump said Saturday in a news conference to confirm the capture of the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, who is facing federal drugs and weapons charges. \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said. He said the Venezuelan oil industry had been \"a total bust,\" for a long time, adding, \"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping.\"ALSO READ: Drugs or more? Why Trump toppled Venezuela’s MaduroTrump appears to be counting heavily on U.S. intervention in the oil industry to help transform Venezuela, a proposition that could prove to be complicated and expensive.Live Events How much oil does Venezuela produce? Venezuela claims to have more than 300 billion barrels in the ground, the largest reserves of oil of any country. But it struggles to produce about 1 million barrels a day, or around 1% of global production. In addition, much of Venezuela's oil is extra heavy, making it polluting and expensive to process. What is the state of the oil industry in Venezuela? The industry has seen some recovery in recent years, but output is well below the more than 2 million barrels a day that Venezuela was producing in the early 2010s. The national oil company, known as PDVSA, lacks the capital and expertise to increase production. The country's oil fields are run down and suffer from \"years of insufficient drilling, dilapidated infrastructure, frequent power cuts and equipment theft,\" according to a recent study by Energy Aspects, a research firm. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, which is now exported primarily to China. Are any Western oil companies involved there? Chevron is the main Western oil company still operating in the country and produces about a quarter of Venezuela's oil. Early in this century, when other companies were forced out, Chevron stayed, figuring that conditions might eventually improve. Roughly half of Chevron's production is exported to the United States. On Saturday, Chevron said it was trying to ensure the safety of its employees and its operations in the country after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arrested and removed in the U.S. military action. The oil giant, based in Houston, has conducted operations in Venezuela since 1923 and has maintained five onshore and offshore production projects there. \"With more than a century in Venezuela, we support a peaceful, lawful transition that promotes stability and economic recovery,\" said Kevin Slagle, a Chevron spokesperson. \"We're prepared to work constructively with the U.S. government during this period, leveraging our experience and presence to strengthen U.S. energy security.\" Later Saturday, Chevron said it had given an incorrect statement and issued a new one that removed mention of the U.S. government, saying: \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\" What would U.S. control of the country's oil production mean? In theory, if U.S. oil companies were given greater access in Venezuela, they could help gradually turn the industry around. \"But it's not going to be a straightforward proposition,\" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects. Analysts say increasing Venezuelan production will not be cheap. Energy Aspects estimated that adding another half a million barrels a day of production would cost $10 billion and take about two years. Major increases might require \"tens of billions of dollars over multiple years,\" the firm said. The overthrow of the Venezuelan government may offer opportunities for American oil companies, but they could also find themselves dragged into a messy situation, industry analysts say. Pressure from Trump could \"force them to play a quasi-governmental role on the capacity building and development front,\" Helima Croft, head of commodities at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, wrote Saturday in an investment note. She added that reducing military influence over the oil industry and the broader economy \"could prove challenging.\" How will this affect oil prices? Trump's intervention in Venezuela is bound to send jitters through the oil markets, but analysts say that a major price jump is unlikely. Venezuela is a relatively small producer and many analysts calculate that the oil market is currently oversupplied. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded at $60.80 a barrel on Friday, near its lows for the year. After Washington conducted its operation to remove Maduro, Third Bridge, a research firm, said in a note that it \"did not see these events immediately impacting the price of crude oil or the cost of gasoline drivers see at the pump.\" This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onVenezuela oil industryVenezuelaVenezuela NewsTrump Maduro captureVenezuela latest newsChevron VenezuelaVenezuela oil productionVenezuela oil reservesU.S. intervention Venezuela\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onVenezuela oil industryVenezuelaVenezuela NewsTrump Maduro captureVenezuela latest newsChevron VenezuelaVenezuela oil productionVenezuela oil reservesU.S. intervention Venezuela \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"President Donald Trump said Venezuela’s oil industry could become profitable again with backing from the United States, after U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro, who faces drug and weapons charges.

He also had accused the Trump administration of seeking to depose him and seize control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.\n\nDemocratic Party lawmakers in the US had been demanding answers from the Trump administration about its aims in Venezuela, accusing the Republican president of seeking to unlawfully carry out acts of war without congressional oversight.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, only Congress has the power to declare war.\n\nBut that authority has been weakened over the last several decades, with the US carrying out military strikes around the world during its so-called “war on terror” based on loosely-interpreted congressional authorisations.\n\nOn Saturday, Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said that, despite the Trump administration’s claims, “there was no imminent threat to the United States” from Venezuela, “certainly not one that justified military action without congressional authorization”.\n\n“These actions violate both US and international law and, by Trump’s own admission, this is not a limited operation,” Meeks said in a statement shared on social media.\n\nThis was echoed by the University of Pennsylvania’s Finkelstein, who said there was no “immediate threat” to the US that would justify the executive branch carrying out attacks without notifying Congress.\n\n“It was an act of war against Venezuela, and we did not have the kind of self-defence justification that would normally justify bypassing Congress,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Even if you believe the US is at grave danger because of drug trafficking, there isn’t the kind of imminence there that would justify the president moving unilaterally and not turning to Congress and trying to get them on board.”\n\nFinkelstein also rejected Trump’s plans for the US to “run” Venezuela as “incredibly illegal”.\n\n“States have sovereignty rights, and you cannot just invade them and take them over,” she said.\n\n“Even if Maduro were to fall of his own accord and we had not brought that about, we don’t have the right to go in and start running their government,” Finkelstein said.\n\n“Democracy is premised on the idea that the people are sovereign and the people choose their own leaders, and that’s something we should be promoting in Latin and South America, not trying to undermine.”","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/act-of-war-expert-rejects-trump-rationale-for-venezuela-attack/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2026/01/epa_695993b79702-1767478199-sirs2s.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:47:11","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":0.015},{"id":391071598,"title":"What are the implications of US ‘capture’ of Nicolas Maduro?  - Bahamas Spectator – Bahamas &amp; Caribbean","text":"US special forces seized Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, in an attack that has taken the country and the world by surprise.\n\nMaduro has long denied accusations by US President Donald Trump of heading a narcotics cartel.\n\nSo, what are the implications of Washington’s actions?\n\nPresenter: James Bays\n\nPhil Gunson – senior analyst for the Andes Project at the International Crisis Group\n\nRichard Weitz – US security analyst and senior fellow at the NATO Defense College\n\nTemir Porras – foreign policy adviser to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and former chief of staff to Maduro","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/what-are-the-implications-of-us-capture-of-nicolas-maduro/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2026/01/image-1767479585-ByAU9q.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:47:09","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":391073320,"title":"Maduro llega a Estados Unidos para enfrentar cargos federales por narcotráfico y armas  - Puerto Rico","text":"El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, llegó este sábado a Estados Unidos para enfrentar cargos federales por narcotráfico y armas, luego de ser capturado en una operación militar estadounidense.\n\nDe acuerdo con un funcionario federal, el avión que transportaba a Maduro y a su esposa, Cilia Flores, aterrizó en la base aérea Stewart Air National Guard Base, en el estado de Nueva York.

He said Cuba was in complete collapse, and noted that Maduro’s guards and the entire intelligence agency were largely composed of Cubans. In a press conference, Rubio said, “Cuba is a disaster. It’s run by incompetent, senile men and, in some cases, not seen now, but incompetent nonetheless. It has no economy. It’s in total collapse. All of the guards that helped protect Maduro, this is well known, their whole spy agency, all of whom were full of Cubans.”“This poor island took over Venezuela in some cases. One of the biggest problems that Venezuelans have is that they have to declare independence from Cuba. They tried to basically colonise it from a security standpoint. If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” he said. While President Donald Trump said that Cuba is “a failing nation” and criticised its system for causing long-term suffering, adding that the US aims to help both the Cuban people and those who were forced to leave the country. “Cuba is an interesting case. Cuba is not doing very well right now. Its system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years. I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about because Cuba is a failing nation right now. Very badly failing nation. We want to help the people in Cuba, but we also want to help the people who were forced out of Cuba and are living in this country,” Trump said. Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement, leading to heightened tensions and uncertainty.According to an unsealed indictment shared by Attorney General Pamela Bondi on X, Maduro and Flores face multiple counts of statutory allegations related to “drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies”. The capture of Maduro comes amid rising tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the minority leader, also called for a briefing, demanding that the Trump administration immediately present to Congress “compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force”.\n\nThe House and the Senate are set to return to Washington this coming week after a long holiday break.\n\nBut Mr Schumer said on Jan 3 afternoon that the administration had not responded to any request from congressional leaders for an immediate briefing.\n\n“They have not given us any details and have not gotten back to us,” Mr Schumer said during a conference call with reporters. “They kept everyone in the total dark.”\n\nMost congressional Republicans rallied around the president’s action, in keeping with the extraordinary deference they have shown to Mr Trump even as he has trampled over congressional prerogatives and contradicted his promises to extricate the United States from foreign conflicts.\n\nSenator John Thune, R-S.D., the majority leader, said Mr Maduro’s capture was “an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States”. He called the operation a “decisive action” by Mr Trump.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson called the operation “decisive and justified”, and said in a statement that the Trump administration was “working to schedule briefings for members as Congress returns to Washington”.\n\nBut even some Republicans gently pressed for more answers from the Trump administration.\n\n“I look forward to hearing more about the Administration’s plans for a positive transition in the days ahead,” Senator Todd Young, R-Ind., said online, while also praising the military personnel who carried out the capture of Mr Maduro.\n\nAnd others said the operation ran counter to Mr Trump’s “America First” promises.\n\n“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing Republican from Georgia who is set to vacate her position as lawmakers return to Washington, wrote in a lengthy social media post. “Boy were we wrong.”\n\nMany Democrats called Mr Maduro’s apprehension good news but said the way in which it was done raised serious questions.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who represents a district in which Venezuelan immigrants cheered the news, said that Mr Maduro’s capture was “welcome”. But she added: “I’ll demand answers as to why Congress and the American people were bypassed in this effort. The absence of congressional involvement prior to this action risks the continuation of the illegitimate Venezuelan regime.”\n\nAnd the top Democrats on the national security, intelligence and armed services committees all condemned the action even as they denounced Mr Maduro.\n\n“Last night, President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification, and without any explanation to the American people,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Whatever comes next, President Trump will own the consequences.”\n\nAt least one Republican expressed concern early on Jan 3 about the operation, but later said he was satisfied with the explanation that Mr Rubio had given him in a phone call. In an initial post on the morning of Jan 3, Mr Mike Lee said he wanted to know “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action” in the absence of congressional authorisation for military force.\n\nBut in a second post hours later, Mr Lee wrote that Mr Rubio had told him that Mr Maduro had been “arrested by US personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States”. He added: “This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack.”\n\nMr Lee also said that Mr Rubio “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”. \n\nThat post came hours before Mr Trump told reporters that the United States would effectively be running Venezuela and that a US military presence would remain there “as it pertains to oil”.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWhile there are no visible signs of a U.S. presence on the ground in Caracas, Trump was demonstrating chutzpah that's become the trademark of his foreign policy approach. It's one marked by a grand confidence that his will on the international stage is an immovable force.\n\n\"This was one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history,\" Trump declared at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe president strode into office with a promise to turn the page on America's decades of foreign entanglements. But on Saturday, he committed the U.S. to help Venezuela usher in a period of \"peace\" and \"justice\" after decades of rule by strongmen.\n\nThe president's pledge to a Venezuela project comes as he finds himself struggling to bring about a permanent peace between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and find an endgame to Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nBut the path ahead is treacherous. The White House will need to grapple with any power vacuum caused by Maduro's ouster and inevitable complications of trying to maintain stability in a country that's already endured years of hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages and brain drain despite its vast oil wealth.\n\nIt also remains to be seen what lessons U.S. adversaries may take from Trump's decision to demonstrate American might in its sphere of influence in the aftermath of Trump's play in Caracas. China's Xi Jinping has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan and Russia's Vladimir Putin has designs on neighbor Ukraine and diminishing NATO's eastern flank.\n\nYet Trump was unflinching in his confidence that the bad actors of the old government will be pushed aside as he helps make Venezuela \"great again.\" He also sought to reassure American taxpayers that they won't be on the hook for his plan to help out Caracas.\n\n\"The money coming out of the ground is very substantial,\" Trump said. \"We're going to get reimbursed for everything that we spend.\"\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from flexing U.S. military might even as he has vowed to keep America out of war. He's now twice used U.S. forces to carry out risky operations against American adversaries. In June, he directed U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nSaturday's action stirred fresh anxiety in capitals around the world that have sought to adjust to a new normal in Trump 2.0, where the idea of the U.S. trying to find global consensus on issues of war and peace is now passe.\n\nWhat's next for Venezuela?\n\nEuropean allies had expressed concern as Trump built up a massive presence of troops in the Caribbean in recent months and carried out dozens of lethal strikes on suspected drug smugglers — many that the administration claimed were effectively an arm of the Maduro government.\n\nNow the Trump administration's dead-of-night extradition of Maduro and his wife and its plans to \"run\" the country, even temporarily, are raising stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nMaduro was hardly viewed as a choir boy by the international community. His 2018 and 2024 elections were seen as riddled with irregularities and viewed as illegitimate.\n\nBut many U.S. allies greeted news of Maduro's capture with a measure of trepidation.\n\nEuropean Commission President António Costa said he had \"great concern\" about the situation in Venezuela following the U.S. operation.\n\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said \"the military operation that led to the capture of Maduro infringes the principle of the non-use of force that underpins international law.\"\n\nThe criticism from some Democrats over Trump's military action to oust Maduro was immediate.\n\n\"This war is illegal, it's embarrassing that we went from the world cop to the world bully in less than one year.\" Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona wrote on X. \"There is no reason for us to be at war with Venezuela.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned what it called a U.S. \"act of armed aggression\" against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday. The ouster of Maduro, who was backed by the Russians, comes as Trump is urging Putin to end his war on Ukraine.\n\n\"Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,\" the statement said.\n\nSimilarly, China's foreign ministry in a statement condemned the U.S. operation, saying it violates international law and Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nCapture follows months of pressure\n\nThe operation was the culmination of a push inside the administration led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other like-minded foes of Maduro who have been urging Trump to take action against the Venezuelan leader for years.\n\nIn south Florida — the epicenter of the Venezuelan diaspora opposition to Maduro that has influenced Rubio's thinking — Saturday's operation was cheered as an era-changing moment for democracy.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, said he had spoken to Rubio and thanked Trump for having \"changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country & the world are safer for it,\" he wrote on X, comparing Maduro's extradition to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nRubio took the moment to send a warning to Cuba, another U.S. adversary in the Caribbean and ally of the Maduro government. \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned — at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.\n\nTrump: Venezuela has no chance without his intervention\n\nMaduro had sought a pathway to exit from power while saving face.\n\nVenezuelan government officials had floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office, The Associated Press reported in October.\n\nThe proposal called for Maduro to step down in three years and hand over to his vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, who would complete Maduro's six-year term that ends in January 2031. Rodriguez would not run for reelection under the plan.\n\nBut the White House had rejected the proposal because the administration questioned the legitimacy of Maduro's rule and accused him of overseeing a narco-terrorist state.\n\nMaduro earlier this week said Venezuela was open to negotiating an agreement with the United States to combat drug trafficking and work with Washington on promoting U.S. further investment in the Venezuelan oil industry. Trump said Maduro was recently offered chances to surrender but declined.\n\nRubio held a long phone conversation on Saturday with Rodriguez, Trump said. In an address to the nation, she demanded the U.S. free Maduro but left open the possibility of dialogue with Trump.\n\n\"If we just left, it has zero chance of ever coming back. We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally,\" Trump said. \"We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in, invest billions and billions of dollars. ... And the biggest beneficiary are going to be the people of Venezuela.\"\n\nVenezuela's opposition says the rightful president is the exiled politician Edmundo González, an ally of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\nTrump said he wasn't ready to commit to a certain leader but pledged his administration has to remain \"very involved\" in Venezuela.\n\n\"We can't take a chance of letting somebody else run it — just take over where (Maduro) left,\" Trump said.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/04/after-ousting-maduro-in-venezuela-trump-commits-himself-to-another-foreign-policy-project","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:45:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.222}]}
