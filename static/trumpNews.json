The pair compelled Annie to visit their ranch in New Mexico. Maxwell gave her a naked massage and then, the morning after, Epstein climbed into bed with her.\n\nAnnie testified about these events during the criminal case against Maxwell in 2021, recounting how Epstein and Maxwell had seemed interested in helping her with her education, how she “wanted so badly” to escape when Maxwell was abusing her, and how she pretended she needed to go to the bathroom to get away from Epstein the next day.\n\nThere is no evidence that the FBI ever followed up on Maria Farmer’s report. Epstein did not face any form of justice until the mid-2000s, and continued to abuse underage girls throughout that period.\n\nHe committed suicide in prison, in 2019, after being rearrested. Maxwell is now serving a 20-year sentence in jail after being convicted on sex trafficking charges. She was moved to a low security prison, with greater privileges, earlier this year, for unknown reasons, after giving interviews to the US Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche.\n\n“This is the moment for which I’ve waited three decades, for over half my life,” Ms Farmer said in a statement as the new tranche of documents was released.\n\n“When I was ignored and hung up on by the FBI in 1996, my world turned upside down, and I felt frozen in time. I faced death threats, ridicule and mockery by some of the most powerful people on Earth.”\n\nShe called the handling of her complaint a “grotesque law enforcement failure”.\n\nAnd in subsequent comments to The New York Times, she said “I can’t believe it”.\n\n“They can’t call me a liar anymore,” said Ms Farmer.\n\n“They should be ashamed ... they harmed all of these little girls. That part devastates me.”\n\nSpeaking to Australia’s 60 Minutes in 2020, Maria recounted how “daunted” she felt when FBI staff were “dismissive” towards her complaint against Epstein in the 90s.\n\nMs Farmer said her decision to seek help from the law was followed by a campaign of threats and intimidation from Maxwell.\n\n“Originally, it started with things like, ‘I’m going to burn your art,’” she said.\n\n“Then, ‘I’m going to burn your career.’ And then, ‘I’m going to burn you and the house you live in. And then it was, ‘Oh, be careful crossing a street, you know, you can get shot in the back of the head.’\n\n“They were threats against my life. And I told the FBI this.”\n\n“Do you reflect on how different life would be for so many women today, if the FBI had investigated your complaints in 1996?” asked journalist Tara Brown, at the time.\n\n“Yeah. They – yeah. I think about it all the time. I do,” Ms Farmer said.\n\n“It hurts a lot. And I never had children because of it. Because I didn’t feel like they could be safe.”\n\nMs Farmer, an artist, met Epstein and Maxwell in 1995. The billionaire financier hired her to procure art for his massive townhouse in New York.\n\nShe told 60 Minutes she had witnessed Maxwell drawing young girls into Epstein’s orbit.\n\n“Several times I was in the car with her, and she would ask the driver to stop the car. And she’d dash across to the school or the park or wherever she was going, and she would write down her phone number for a child, a young girl,” she said.\n\n“And then I’d see that child at the house. And she’d say, ‘She’s auditioning.’”\n\nThe story Maxwell gave Ms Farmer was that the girls were models. At the time, Epstein claimed to help manage Victoria’s Secret, and Maxwell was supposedly his talent scout.\n\n“I thought it was really strange because I did see a couple of girls in braces. And I’ve never seen a model in braces,” said Ms Farmer.\n\nAny illusion Epstein had created fell away one night, when Ms Farmer alleges both he and Maxwell sexually abused her.\n\n“Ghislaine came in to get me one evening. Basically, Ghislaine escorts me to Jeffrey’s room,” she recounted.\n\nEpstein told her to sit down next to him. Maxwell joined them. Then, Ms Farmer alleges, they assaulted her.\n\n“The whole time I’m thinking, ‘My sister has been around these people. My sister is 16. She’s been around them alone,’” she said.\n\nMs Farmer’s fears were justified. Annie had indeed been another victim.\n\nEpstein’s proximity to powerful people, including current US President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, is at the centre – but is by no means the limit – of the current push to publicly release all documents concerning his crimes.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently under fire for failing to comply with a newly passed law, in the US, that required it to release the so-called “Epstein files” on Friday.\n\nInstead it released some new documents, many of which were highly redacted.\n\nAmong the unredacted material were pictures of Mr Clinton, including some that showed him in a pool or hot tub with women whose faces were blacked out.\n\nMr Clinton’s media team responded with a statement accusing the White House of “hiding” files related to Mr Trump.\n\n“This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever,” the spokesperson claimed.\n\n“So they can release as many grainy, 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.\n\n“There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We are in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.\n\n“Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”","summary":"Amid the outrage over the Trump administration’s half-baked release of the Epstein files, one genuinely cathartic document stands out.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/victims-of-jeffrey-epstein-maria-and-annie-farmer-vindicated-decades-after-they-reported-paedophile-to-the-fbi/news-story/b922156682a79c0f94259eb63bbaea97?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c3e4538efc2d8b60e24b0612ea0eb7f5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 01:09:58","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":388214622,"title":"NGO risau syarat pendaftaran baharu Israel gugat bantuan kemanusiaan di Gaza","text":"PARIS: Pendaftaran lebih 12 pertubuhan bukan kerajaan (NGO) ditolak susulan peraturan baharu Israel, yang dilihat berpotensi menjejaskan kerja bantuan di Gaza dan Tebing Barat secara serius, menurut amaran petugas kemanusiaan.\n\nMenurut Israel, NGO terbabit diberi tempoh sehingga 31 Disember untuk mendaftar, bukan kerana mahu menghalang pengagihan bantuan, sebaliknya bagi mengelakkan 'perlakuan bermusuhan atau penyokong keganasan' dalam kalangan NGO beroperasi di wilayah Palestin.\n\nKontroversi itu timbul ketika Gaza, yang masih kekurangan bekalan air bersih dan elektrik, terus bergelut dengan krisis kemanusiaan walaupun selepas gencatan senjata diumumkan Oktober lalu.\n\nKementerian Hal Ehwal Diaspora dan Memerangi Antisemitisme Israel berkata, sehingga November 2025, kira-kira 100 NGO memohon pendaftaran dan hanya 14 permohonan ditolak, selebihnya diluluskan atau masih dalam proses semakan.\n\nMenurut kementerian itu, permohonan ditolak membabitkan pertubuhan yang terbabit dalam keganasan, antisemitisme dan tindakan menggugat kepentingan Israel selain penafian Holocaust serta penafian jenayah 7 Oktober 2023.\n\nAntara NGO yang disekat di bawah peraturan baharu itu ialah 'Save the Children', antara pertubuhan paling lama dan paling dikenali di Gaza yang membantu 120,000 kanak-kanak, serta Jawatankuasa Khidmat Rakan Amerika (AFSC).\n\nPertubuhan terbabit diberi tempoh 60 hari untuk membawa keluar semua kakitangan antarabangsa mereka dari Semenanjung Gaza, Tebing Barat yang diduduki dan Israel, selain tidak lagi dibenarkan menghantar bekalan kemanusiaan merentasi sempadan ke Gaza.\n\nBerikutan itu, forum menghimpunkan agensi Pertubuhan Bangsa Bangsa Bersatu (PBB) dan NGO beroperasi di kawasan itu menggesa Israel menarik balik semua halangan termasuk proses pendaftaran baharu yang berisiko menjejaskan bantuan kemanusiaan.\n\nBeberapa NGO menyatakan mereka mematuhi kebanyakan keperluan Israel bagi melengkapkan dokumen permohonan.\n\nNamun, ada yang enggan melangkaui apa yang mereka sifatkan sebagai 'garisan merah', iaitu memberikan maklumat mengenai kakitangan warga Palestin mereka.\n\nPresiden NGO Perancis, Medecins du Monde, Jean-Francois Corty, berkata jika NGO dianggap berbahaya hanya kerana menyampaikan testimoni penduduk, melaksanakan kerja operasi dan menyatakan apa yang sedang berlaku, lalu dikenakan larangan beroperasi, maka ia menjadi masalah besar.\n\nBeberapa aktivis kemanusiaan turut mendakwa, ada sesetengah NGO yang namanya belum pernah mereka dengar sebelum ini tetapi mendapat akreditasi.\n\nMalah, ada antaranya yang tidak pernah beroperasi di Gaza tetapi dilaporkan termasuk dalam pelan pembangunan semula Gaza yang diusulkan oleh Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump. -

The sea service also has failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nHistorically, the term battleship has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore. This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons.\n\nAfter World War II, the battleship’s role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe also has complained to Secretary of the Navy John Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump “has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.","summary":"The ship, according to Trump, will be longer and larger than World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and armed with hypersonic missiles and more.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/military/2025/12/22/trump-battleship-navy-design/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump-Putin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 00:52:54","author":"Associated Press,Jae C.

While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the existence of the silo sites, it had not disclosed how many missiles were loaded, according to Reuters..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}China’s nuclear warhead stockpile stood in the low 600s in 2024, the report said, but Beijing remains on track to exceed 1,000 warheads by 2030.The findings align with assessments by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which has said China is expanding its weapons stockpile at a pace unmatched by any other nuclear power.The Pentagon declined to comment on the draft report, noting it could still change before submission to US lawmakers.BEIJING REJECTS BUILDUP CLAIMSChina dismissed the report’s conclusions, with its embassy in Washington saying Beijing maintains a defensive nuclear posture and keeps its forces at the minimum level required for national security.China has also accused the United States of attempting to smear and defame China and deliberately mislead the international community, and has reiterated its stated no-first-use nuclear policy and moratorium on nuclear testing.The report’s release comes weeks after US President Donald Trump said he may pursue denuclearisation talks with China and Russia, a prospect the Pentagon assessment suggests Beijing is unlikely to entertain.Beyond nuclear forces, the report offers a stark warning on China’s conventional military ambitions, concluding that Beijing believes it could “fight and win” a war over Taiwan by the end of 2027.China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, has never renounced the use of force. The report said Beijing is refining options to seize the island by brute force, including strikes up to 2,000 nautical miles from China that could challenge US military presence across the Asia-Pacific.ARMS CONTROL FEARS GROWThe findings arrive less than two months before the expiration of the 2010 New START treaty, the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control agreement. With no successor in place and China outside the framework, experts warn of a looming three-way nuclear arms race.“More nuclear weapons and an absence of diplomacy will not make anyone safer,” said Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association. “Not China, not Russia, and not the United States.”The Pentagon report also pointed at sweeping anti-corruption purges under Chinese President Xi Jinping, particularly within the People’s Liberation Army and state-owned defence firms.While the crackdown may affect short-term readiness, the report said it could ultimately lead to long-term improvements across China’s military. At least 26 senior executives in arms companies have been investigated or removed in the past 18 months, it said, as scrutiny widened to China’s nuclear and shipbuilding sectors.- EndsWith inputs from ReutersPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Dec 23, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/china-ballistic-missiles-nuclear-buildup-pentagon-glbs-2840192-2025-12-23","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/china-232850410-16x9_0.png?VersionId=ztKdhVmiR9ln3PsL17ea65TrAkVtTe14?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 00:29:37","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":388213652,"title":"DOJ Includes Clip Of Disputed Epstein Jail Cell Footage In Files — But Quickly Kills Link","text":"Several prominent social-media influencers on Monday circulated a video — claiming it came from the Department of Justice — that shows Jeffrey Epstein attempting to take his own life inside a jail cell.\n\nThe short clip circulated widely on X after users claimed it originated from a Department of Justice file release and carried a timestamp matching the day Epstein died in federal custody in 2019, though the DOJ-hosted link began returning an “access denied” error shortly after it spread.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the DOJ has started releasing Epstein-related records but will continue producing additional materials on a rolling basis as internal reviews proceed and victim protections are applied.\n\n“We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce, making sure that every victim, their name, their identity, their story to the extent it needs to be protected, is completely protected,” Blanche said on “FOX and Friends.” (RELATED: Trump Administration Misses Deadline To Release All Epstein Files)\n\nPublic scrutiny over the Epstein files intensified after the DOJ and the FBI concluded in July that Epstein died by suicide in custody and did not keep a client list, effectively ending the review after Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said such records were being examined.

The world leader even went as far as to defend Bill Clinton and other political enemies featured in the release. Famous faces, such as Michael Jackson, Mr Clinton, Sir Mick Jagger and politician Lord Mandelson, have also appeared in the thousands of photographs published online in the last few days . But Mr Trump, himself named in the files, insisted the majority of those celebrities met Epstein innocently over the years. Yet, the billionaire financier was a convicted child sex offender who abused girls as young as 14 years old. Speaking today in the wake of the release, Mr Trump, 79, said: \"I know there are a lot of people that are angry about all the pictures of other people. I think it's terrible... This whole thing with Epstein is a way to try to deflect from the tremendous success of the Republican Party. I thought that was finished, a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\" Speaking about the Democrat former president, Mr Trump added: \"I like Bill Clinton, I've always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I've been nice to him, he's been nice to me, we've always gotten along with him, I respect him. Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it, but you probably have pictures of people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago.\" According to the Daily Mail , the world leader then blamed mostly Congressional Democrats for pushing for the latest drop. Mr Trump, though, admitted Epstein had connections everywhere back in the 1990s and 2000s. The data dump came after US deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the need to protect the victims of sex offender Epstein meant hundreds of thousands more documents would be released over the coming weeks. The US Department of Justice were legally obligated to make all files related to the investigation into Epstein public by midnight on Friday following the passing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The paedophile financier was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, New York, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Both guards who were assigned to check on Epstein fell asleep while on shift and falsified their records. The apparent workplace blunder was exacerbated by the revelation that cameras in the holding area malfunctioned or were broken.","summary":"Donald Trump has described the latest Jeffrey Epstein files drop &quot;a terrible thing&quot; in a remarkable rant today, but he defended Bill Clinton and other political enemies","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-defends-big-boy-36444306","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36444324.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Trump-25351634877185.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 00:08:51","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":388199746,"title":"'Very angry': Donald Trump warns Epstein file release could unfairly damage reputations","text":"US President Donald Trump Monday has said the release of investigative files linked to Jeffrey Epstein could unfairly damage the reputations of people who had only incidental contact with the disgraced financier.

'60 Minutes' correspondent is alleging political interference in her story on CECOT","text":"CBS News is in the midst of a major controversy, as \"60 Minutes\" reporter Sharyn Alfonsi has sharply criticized editor-in-chief Bari Weiss' decision to delay her segment from airing about the notorious El Salvador prison CECOT. Alfonsi, a longtime correspondent for the newsmagazine, finds herself as part of the story after she sent a note to colleagues fuming over the decision by Weiss to hold the story, \"Inside CECOT,\" claiming it was done for political rather than editorial reasons. The Trump administration didn't grand CBS an interview for the segment. The fight has leaked into the public, causing a media frenzy and creating yet another headache at the Tiffany Network. Who is Sharyn Alfonsi? Alfonsi is a \"60 Minutes\" investigative correspondent. According to her online biography, she first appeared on the program in 2015, and has won several awards, including two Emmys for her reporting about survivors of the Parkland school shooting in 2018. '60 MINUTES' REPORTER LASHES OUT AT BARI WEISS AFTER SEGMENT ON EL SALVADOR PRISON YANKED AT LAST MINUTE She joined CBS again after a stint at ABC News. She worked previously as a CBS correspondent in New York and other CBS-owned local outlets before going to ABC. She's done a range of profiles for \"60 Minutes\" and investigative segments, including into the death of Jeffrey Epstein, and has reported from war zones, including coverage of the Biden administration's chaotic 2021 Afghanistan troop withdrawal. Her most recent story delved into the dangers of AI bots that chat with minors. What is her CECOT story about? Alfonsi's segment \"Inside CECOT\" was going to feature her interviewing some released deportees from the notorious prison, \"who describe the brutal and torturous conditions\" there. TRUMP OPEN TO SENDING VIOLENT AMERICAN CRIMINALS TO EL SALVADOR PRISONS \"Earlier this year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists. This move sparked an ongoing legal battle, and nine months later the U.S. government still has not released the names of all those deported and placed in CECOT, one of El Salvador’s harshest prisons,\" the press release for the segment read. Has Alfonsi had any controversial reporting before this? Alfonsi came under fire in 2021 for a \"60 Minutes\" segment where she challenged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and painted a narrative that he had given supermarket chain Publix preferential treatment on distributing COVID vaccines because its PAC had donated $100,000 to his campaign. However, the story came under significant criticism, including from Democrats like Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz. Publix had more than 800 locations in the state, making it an ideal location for distributing the vaccines to a state with a high senior population. Also, Publix fired back against the notion that it essentially bribed DeSantis, calling the suggestion \"false and offensive.\" CBS, BARI WEISS FACING MOUNTING BACKLASH FROM LIBERAL CRITICS OVER YANKING '60 MINUTES' SEGMENT CBS stood by the story at the time, even though the \"pay-for-play\" narrative was debunked. In addition, DeSantis accused CBS of cheaply editing a back-and-forth that aired between him and Alfonsi that omitted context about the story. What did she write about her story and Bari Weiss? In a memo that quickly leaked to the media Sunday night, Alfonsi told her colleagues that Weiss had spiked the story and not given her an opportunity to discuss it further. \"Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.\" She added that \"60 Minutes\" made requests for comment to the White House, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department. Their silence was their statement, she wrote, and allowing that to delay the story was effectively giving them veto power. \"If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,\" she wrote. Abandoning the sources who spoke with them at personal risk, Alfonsi said, would be wrong. KRISTI NOEM BLASTS 'FAKE NEWS' COVERAGE OF DEPORTED SALVADORAN NATIONAL, SAYS SCOTUS SENT 'CLEAR MESSAGE' \"We have been promoting this story on social media for days,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘gold standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet.\" In her memo, she also invoked the infamous Jeffrey Wigand saga, when \"60 Minutes\" was pressured by corporate executives not to air an interview with the tobacco industry whistleblower for fear of litigation. The scandal was a black eye for the network and was the subject of the 1999 movie \"The Insider.\" What did Bari Weiss say about the story? Weiss has defended the decision to hold the segment, saying it was not ready for air and didn't advance the story in a meaningful fashion. \"My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be,\" she said in a statement on Sunday. \"Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.\" On Monday, she told staffers on a morning editorial call, \"The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. Anything else is absolutely unacceptable.\" \"I held a ‘60 Minutes’ story because it was not ready. While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball — the [New York] Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is ‘60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera. Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That’s my north star and I hope it’s yours, too.\" ANTI-ISRAEL CRITICS FUME AS TONY DOKOUPIL TAPPED TO ANCHOR 'CBS EVENING NEWS' According to reports, Weiss viewed the story on Thursday and ultimately decided it wasn't ready to go to air, citing that there wasn't an on-the-record Trump administration response. Executive producer Tanya Simon, according to the Washington Post, said during a private meeting that she stood by the story but wasn't able to assuage Weiss. \"In the end, our editor in chief had a different vision for how the piece should be, and it came late in the process, and we were not in a position to address the notes,\" said EP Tanya Simon, according to a partial transcript of the meeting obtained by the Post. \"We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes, and I ultimately had to comply.\" Weiss is already a lightning rod given her opinion background and pushback against \"woke\" ideology, and some of her moves and rhetoric during her brief tenure atop CBS News have irked media liberals. What other controversies has \"60 Minutes\" been embroiled in lately? The show is still smarting from President Donald Trump's lawsuit against the network over how it edited an interview with 2024 opponent Kamala Harris. Trump accused the network of election interference for how it aired portions of Harris' answer about Israel on two separate nights leading up to the election. Trump sued parent company Paramount and CBS for an eye-popping $20 billion. In the background, Paramount was seeking Trump adminisration approval for its merger with Skydance Media. Ultimately, Trump received a $16 million settlement that covered legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable cause. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The saga left \"60 Minutes\" staffers fuming that their corporate parent had paid, as late-night host Stephen Colbert put it, a \"big fat bribe\" to get the merger through, despite the network's lawyers saying the suit was meritless.

The measure cleared both the House and Senate with support from all but one Republican and Trump signed it into law; his administration had previously said it did not plan to release any more Epstein materials after a thorough review.\n\n“A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they’re in a picture with him because he was at a party, and you ruined a reputation of somebody,” Trump said during an event in the library at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach club that he claims to have ejected Epstein from in the early 2000s.\n\n“A lot of people are very angry that this continues. A lot of Republicans,” he said, claiming the issue was meant to “deflect against a tremendous success.”\n\nTrump has long sought to downplay his own connection to Epstein – noting, as he did Monday, the two had a falling out years ago – and he has previously warned that releasing files might be unfairly damaging to those referenced in them. He notably said at Mar-a-Lago he even “hated” to see so many photos of former President Bill Clinton contained in the latest batch of documents released by the Justice Department. Clinton has never been charged with any crimes or accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein; one of the most publicized images in the DOJ release last week was a picture of Clinton in a hot tub with his arms folded behind his head. Beside him is a person whose faced is redacted.\n\n“I think Bill Clinton’s a big boy. He can handle it,” Trump said.\n\nA representative of Clinton, meanwhile, shared a statement Monday before Trump’s remarks calling on the Justice Department to “immediately release any remaining materials referring to, mentioning, or containing a photograph of Bill Clinton.”\n\n“Refusal to do so will confirm the widespread suspicion the Department of Justice’s actions to date are not about transparency, but about insinuation – using selective releases to imply wrongdoing about individuals who have already been repeatedly cleared by the very same Department of Justice, over many years, under Presidents and Attorneys General of both parties,” said the spokesperson, Angel Ureña, in a statement posted on X.\n\nThe Justice Department is facing criticism from survivors of Epstein’s sexual abuse and lawmakers on Capitol Hill over how it has released materials from its investigation of the convicted sex offender. Though the law required the department to make public “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials,” officials did not do so on the Friday deadline, instead releasing a first tranche of files. Lawmakers of both parties said that was unacceptable, with some indicating they would explore legal action. Survivors asserted that the disclosures were incomplete and improperly redacted.\n\nThe department has said lawyers will work in the coming weeks to make redactions to protect victims and alleviate other possible concerns.\n\nAs for the photos of himself contained in the Epstein files, Trump shrugged off what he said was a social connection from another era.\n\n“They give you their photos of me, too,” he said. “Everybody was friendly with this guy, either friendly or not friendly, but he was around. He was all over Palm Beach.”\n\nKevin Liptak, CNN","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/trump-bemoans-destroyed-reputations-from-epstein-files-in-first-public-comments-since-doj-release/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/NNNFPK7JU5DHVMWCYSTR2G4ZEY.jpg?auth=caec10e72fd999984b616759af7d023c0626a8bbce12e0545756ab1e8d5d9faa","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 00:00:43","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.577},{"id":388200402,"title":"Letters: Schools must teach about evil of antisemitism","text":"Evil of antisemitism\nmust be taught\n\nRe: “Antisemitic display brings calls for more understanding” (Page A1, Dec. 12).\n\nThe recent events at Branham High School are remarkable.

Neither Gazans nor the Palestinian Authority possess the financial, logistical or institutional capacity to manage massive debris and waste removal on their own.

Oscar Perez, the Providence police chief. Neves Valente acted alone, Perez added.\n\nTwo students were killed, and nine were wounded in the shooting on December 13 in a Brown University lecture hall. The 47-year-old MIT professor, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, was shot in his home two days later.\n\nBrown University President Christina Paxson said Neves Valente was enrolled at Brown from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2001 after being admitted to the graduate school in September 2000 to study physics. \"He has no current affiliation with the university,\" she said.\n\nValente and Loureiro attended the same academic program at a university in Portugal between 1995 and 2000, Foley said. Loureiro graduated from the physics program at Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal's leading engineering school, in 2000. That same year, Neves Valente was dismissed from a position at the University of Lisbon, according to a termination notice issued by the university's then president in February 2000.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Brown on an F-1 visa and later obtained legal permanent resident status in September 2017, Foley said.

We desperately needed ships as some of them have become old, tired, and obsolete. As Commander in Chief, I have approved a plan for the Navy to begin the construction of the brand new, largest we have ever built battle ships. They will be 100 times the force, the power. These have been under design consideration for a long time, and started with me in my first term. These are the best in the world, the fastest, the biggest.'\n\nHe said that the battleships weighing between 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes will be the 'most lethal' warships and will carry nuclear arms and guns along with missiles.\n\n'We haven't built a battleship since 1994. We used to build ships during World War II, but now we don't build ships anymore. These cutting-edge vessels will be some of the most lethal surface warfare ships. Each one will be the largest battleship in the history of the world. We are talking about ten, but we are going to start with two, and ultimately we think it will be between 20 to 25 of these. These battleships have many missiles but also guns, and in many ways, guns can do the trick at a tiny fraction of the cost,' Trump said.\n\nHe added, 'Once completed, these new 30-40,000-tonne plus vessels will be the flagships of the American Naval Fleet. We have great navy yards, and we are negotiating with some companies which run those yards. The most sophisticated lasers on Earth will be on the battleships. They will also carry the nuclear arms and cruise missiles under development... They'll be AI-controlled... The US Navy will lead the design of the ships along with me.'\n\nThe announcement comes after the United States seized two tankers off the coast of Venezuela this month, and on Sunday (local time), they began pursuing what it described as a 'dark fleet' vessel in international waters near Venezuela after the ship refused to stop and continued sailing, CNN reported. The vessel, identified as Bella 1, was sailing toward Venezuela to load oil when US Coast Guard personnel attempted to board it.

According to the New York Post, the video clip was quietly posted to the Justice Department’s website without an explanation as part of a set of documents and images released as the Epstein investigative files.The chilling 12-second video shows a white-haired man wearing an orange jumpsuit kneeling at the base of a bunk bed and appearing to struggle violently. A timestamp on the footage reads 4:29 am on August 10, 2019, roughly two hours before Jeffrey Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre.The video bore the label J Epstein in one corner and was added to the DOJ's online document dump that began last Friday.CLIP SUSPECTED TO BE FAKEHowever, the New York Post reported that the video was a fake clip that circulated on 4chan. A Florida conspiracy theorist allegedly alerted investigators to the altered footage, after which the Justice Department abruptly removed it.The department has also not clarified on the matter.This comes a day after the Justice Department briefly removed and then restored a photograph featuring President Donald Trump from the Jeffrey Epstein files. The removal was due to concerns about victim privacy, not the president himself, according to officials.US authorities have repeatedly said that Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. However, his death has fuelled years of scepticism and conspiracy theories, amplified by surveillance failures and lapses in jail oversight.Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, had rejected the suicide finding, alleging that the financier was murdered. The DOJ has not addressed those claims in connection with the newly released video.DOJ DISCLOSURES ON EPSTEIN FILESThe Epstein Files have included a trove of documents, photographs, and video material connected to the convicted sex offender, some of it deeply disturbing. Previous releases have featured images of Epstein with underage girls and footage from inside properties investigators described as central to his abuse network.Several of the records feature Epstein alongside his longtime associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.

The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nHistorically, the term battleship has referred to a very specific type of ship - a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore. This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons.\n\nAfter World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy's fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy's newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy's destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o'clock) in the morning\" about \"rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.\"\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n\"I looked at it, I said, 'That's a terrible-looking ship, let's make it beautiful,'\" Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n\"The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I'm a very aesthetic person,\" Trump said.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/trump-holds-event-rubio-hegseth-during-vacation-tensions-venezuela-mount/18307285/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18307714_Trump-Battleship-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:53:49","author":"Aamer Madhani, Regina Garcia Cano And Emma Burrows","authors":["Aamer Madhani, Regina Garcia Cano And Emma Burrows"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.206},{"id":388208102,"title":"Ottawa announces new Canadian ambassador to U.S.","text":"OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Mark Carney has appointed a global investment banker and pension fund manager to be Canada’s next ambassador in Washington.\n\nCarney’s office said Mark Wiseman, who begins the role Feb. 15, will lead negotiations with the United States on a review of the continental free trade deal.\n\nWiseman is a longtime friend of Carney who was among the first to contribute to his Liberal leadership bid, donating the maximum $1,750, as well as $1,750 to the Liberal party during the spring election campaign.\n\nHe will replace Kirsten Hillman, who announced this month she would end her posting, saying a new team would be able to focus on a review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement next year.\n\nWiseman is a member of the Prime Minister’s Council on Canada-U.S. Relations, a body created by former prime minister Justin Trudeau just as Donald Trump was about to be sworn in as U.S. president for the second time.\n\nTrudeau did not include Wiseman on the council, but Carney added him just days after being sworn in as prime minister in March.\n\nWiseman, 55, was born in Niagara Falls, Ont., but grew up mostly in Burlington, the son of a plumber and pipe fitter and a physiotherapist.\n\nHe holds a joint master of business administration and law degree from the University of Toronto and clerked for Beverley McLachlin when she was a judge on the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nWiseman worked as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer for multinational law firm Sullivan Cromwell, first in New York City and later in Paris. He also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan.\n\nIn 2016 he became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.\n\nWiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though Wiseman’s time at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague.\n\nHe has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp., and has been a vocal proponent of sustainable investments and the economic benefits of moving to a zero-carbon economy.\n\nWiseman will enter his new role with the least amount of political or diplomatic experience of any U.S. ambassador in recent memory. His predecessors included former premiers Gary Doer and Frank McKenna, federal cabinet minister Michael Wilson, political advisers and campaign managers such as David MacNaughton, and career diplomats including Hillman and Michael Kergin.\n\nSome, including Hillman and Wilson, had experience negotiating major free trade deals: Hillman was Canada’s lead negotiator for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, while Wilson helped negotiate both the original Canada-U.S. free trade deal as well as the first iteration of the North American free trade pact.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois and Conservatives had already levelled criticism over Wiseman’s role in co-founding the Century Initiative, which aims to increase Canada’s population to 100 million by 2100.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has called that a “radical” idea, while the Bloc says he will be damaging for Quebec, following a social media post from Wiseman two years ago saying Canada must aim for a 100-million strong population “even if it makes Quebec howl.”\n\nThat post has since been deleted.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 22, 2025.\n\nBy Dylan Robertson\n\nWith files from Mia Rabson","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/ottawa-announces-new-canadian-ambassador-to-us/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/U2UEBKNUBBGNNHJKNFOBRT7GDA.jpg?auth=714e664ef3891132bb9f4b77285ca720885cde2557729572a9ea696cd8b9a780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:50:17","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.125},{"id":388215384,"title":"Don Jr. Comes Right Out And Says 'This Isn't The Republican Party Anymore'","text":"Donald Trump Jr. is crediting his father, President Donald Trump, with a complete rebrand of the Republican Party. \n\nAppearing at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference on Sunday, Don Jr. blasted GOP critics of his father ― who he deemed “Republicans In Name Only,” or RINOs ― while suggesting the party rename itself after one of the president’s signature phrases. \n\n“Midterms are coming around the corner, and make no mistake, the Democrat Party wants to do whatever they possibly can to shut this movement down,” he said. “Not just the Democrats.

Donald Trump made the announcement at a press conference held in West Palm Beach, Florida on Monday, December 22. The US leader made the major statement alongside the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He presented a board with a battleship on that read 'Trump Class' and claimed: \"There's never been anything like these ships. These have been under design consideration for a long time. \"They'll be the fastest, the biggest by far and 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built. The largest battleship in the history of the world.\" Trump continued to say that the vessels would be made of steel and weigh between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes. They will be armed with the \"most sophisticated lasers in the world\" as well as \"guns and missiles\". The US President explained the fleet will grow to around 25 ships however the new 'Trump Class' will start off as two vessels. The news comes as the president said that the US is \"desperately in need of ships\" as the ones they have are \"old and tired\". The Navy's John Phelan added: \"The future Trump-class battleship, the U.S.S. Defiant, will be the largest, deadliest, and most versatile, and best-looking warship anywhere on the world's oceans.

He said the ship “came from the wrong location, it came out of Venezuela,” though the vessel — called Bella 1 — was in fact sailing toward Venezuela when the US Coast Guard attempted to interdict it. The US has intercepted two other tankers off the coast of Venezuela this month. Those interdictions have come amid a massive US naval buildup in the Caribbean Sea as Trump applies pressure on Maduro, including attempts to cut off his oil revenues. Trump on Monday declined to answer a question about his endgame in Venezuela, even as he again raised the threat of land strikes and said it’d be “smart” for Maduro to step down. “There’s no answer. He can do whatever he wants. We have a massive armada — the biggest we’ve ever had, and the biggest we’ve ever had in South America,” Trump said. “He can do whatever he wants. It’s all right, whatever he wants to do. If he wants to do something, if he plays tough, it’d be the last time he’s ever able to play tough.” Pressed on whether he’s trying to force Maduro from power, Trump added, “Well, I think it probably would. I can’t tell that,” adding: “That’s up to him what he wants to do. I think it’d be smart for him to do that.” Trump – who last week ordered a “complete” blockade of sanctioned tankers going in and out of Venezuela – noted the US will keep oil seized during the interdiction of oil tankers in the Caribbean, leaving the door open to adding it to the US’ Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “We’re going to keep it,” Trump said. “Maybe we’ll use it in the Strategic Reserves – we’re keeping it. We’re keeping the ships also,” he added. Trump also said he had spoken to American oil companies who have had their assets seized about what a post-Maduro Venezuela would look like. American officials view the Bella 1 as part of the shadow fleet that transports oil from sanctioned nations, and a warrant had been issued for its seizure. Trump noted Monday that the vessel was sanctioned as he discussed the attempts to stop it. On Saturday, the US Coast Guard intercepted the Centuries tanker in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. A White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said it was carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil, though the ship itself did not appear on a list of sanctioned vessels. The US seized a large oil tanker called the Skipper, which had been under sanctions for its ties to Iran, on December 10.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/22/politics/oil-tanker-pursuit-trump-maduro","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-22220460-0-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:47:16","author":"Donald Judd,Kevin Liptak","authors":["Donald Judd","Kevin Liptak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":388209102,"title":"PM Mark Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as Canada’s ambassador to the US","text":"Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as Canada’s next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners.\nWiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the United States regarding the review of their free trade agreement.\n“Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses and institutions.”\nWiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month as the two neighbours plan to review their free trade agreement.\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026.

Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed in the attacks. Asked if the goal was to force Maduro from power, Trump told reporters: \"Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out.\" \"If he wants to do something, if he plays tough, it'll be the last time he's ever able to play tough,\" he said. \"He's no friend to the United States. He's very bad. Very bad guy. He's gotta watch his ass because he makes cocaine and they send it into the U.S.\" In addition to the strikes, Trump has previously announced a \"blockade\" of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela. The U.S. Coast Guard started pursuing an oil tanker in international waters near Venezuela on Sunday, in what would be the second such operation this weekend and the third in less than two weeks if successful. \"Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it,\" Trump said when asked what would happen with the seized oil, adding it might also be used to replenish the United States' strategic reserves.

I’ve always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I've been nice to him. He’s been nice to me. We’ve always gotten along. I respect him. I hate to see photos come out of him, but this is what the Democrats, mostly Democrats, and a couple of bad Republicans are asking for,” Trump said Monday. “There’s even photos of me, too.”\n\nTrump has continued to downplay his connections to Epstein despite a years-long relationship that fell apart in the 2000s. The president has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and one’s inclusion in the documents does not imply otherwise.\n\nA spokesperson for Clinton accused the administration of using “selective releases to imply wrongdoing” and called on the Justice Department to “immediately release any remaining materials” from the Epstein files \"referring to, mentioning or containing a photograph of” the former president.\n\n“Someone or something is protected,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña said Monday. “We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.”\n\nHours after the initial release of documents, the Justice Department removed more than 20 files — including an image that showed a photograph of Trump with bikini-clad women was sitting in an open drawer.\n\nThose images were later restored, but their removal only fueled outrage and demand for the full release of the files, with threats of legal action from members of Congress.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department was scrambling to make necessary redactions to protect survivors.\n\n“You’re talking about a million or so pages of documents — virtually all of them contain victim information,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday.\n\nHe said officials were not removing any mentions of Trump in the documents, more of which are expected to be rolled out over the coming weeks.\n\n“We are not redacting information around President Trump,” Blanche said.\n\nAfter the Justice Department restored the image of Trump taken from Epstein’s credenza, the agency said in a statement that “there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.”\n\nMissing from the documents are bank records that could shed light on the allegedly vast financial engine supporting Epstein and his crimes, as well as internal memos and other documents from prosecutors who investigated him and others.\n\nThe law requires the release of potentially thousands of documents that are typically shielded from public view, including grand jury testimony, settlements, investigative notes and internal records related to Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIt also requires the release of documents related to Epstein’s jailhouse death in 2019, which was ruled a suicide. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nMore than a dozen survivors of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse have criticized the administration’s partial release of the files, which were “riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.”\n\n“At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm,” they wrote Monday.\n\n“While clearer communication would not change the fact that a law was broken, its absence suggests an ongoing intent to keep survivors and the public in the dark as much as possible and as long as possible,” they wrote.\n\nMembers of Congress have suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi could be held in contempt for failing to release documents on deadline.\n\nReps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, the Democratic and Republican lawmakers behind legislation compelling the release, “are talking about and drafting that right now,” Khanna told CBS Face the Nation Sunday.\n\n“The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,” Massie added.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will also introduce a resolution next month to “initiate legal actions” against the Trump administration for “illegally refusing to release the full complete files” and “heavily redacting” others, his office said.","summary":"Trump dismisses his years-long ties to Epstein as he says pressure to release files ‘deflects’ from his success","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-epstein-files-doj-release-b2889267.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/22/23/35/Trump-gcu29bu2.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5zMIDPD8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:40:27","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.55},{"id":388210304,"title":"President Trump touts new ‘Trump class’ battleships","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nVod Vertical December 22, 2025 00:21 \n\n President Trump touts new ‘Trump class’ battleships \n Speaking from Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump announces a military upgrade featuring new ‘Trump class’ battleships.\n Tags VOD-VERTICAL","summary":"Speaking from Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump announces a military upgrade featuring new ‘Trump class’ battleships.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6386844150112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e889d9bc-0b7b-41ae-861f-7436094ddbd0/630ae64b-6b16-46af-bcd0-e90e08c3e812/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:37:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.281},{"id":388199978,"title":"Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners.\n\nWiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement.\n\n“Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.”\n\nWiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026.

Since then, Americans have largely turned on the former Florida attorney general, and they now hold a 41-point net negative view of Bondi. \n\nThe latest polling, based off answers from 2,315 respondents, captured public sentiment in the week ending on Friday, December 19, when Bondi’s Justice Department faced a statutory deadline to release the Epstein files. \n\nWhile the DOJ has started releasing some files, the disclosure has been marked with delay and controversy. Scores of files now available to the public have been heavily redacted, angering Epstein survivors. The department also deleted then restored a file from its public portal containing photos of Donald Trump, raising suspicions of political interference, which the DOJ denied. \n\nA bipartisan coalition of lawmakers have threatened to bring contempt charges against Bondi, arguing the DOJ has failed to release hundreds of thousands of pages of Epstein material it is required to under a law Trump signed in November. \n\nBondi, as the nation’s top legal official, has often been the face of the administration’s Epstein policy. \n\nIt was the attorney general who handed out binders of Epstein material to conservative influencers at the White House in February, and it was her DOJ that in July threw cold water on the prospect of further investigations into Epstein links, a posture critics have alleged may be to shield Trump from any further scrutiny over his past friendship with the late convicted sex offender. \n\nThe perception that the Trump administration was seeking to tip the scales on the Epstein process was only furthered when the Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department, quietly moved Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell to a lower-security facility over the summer after she sat for an interview with a top DOJ official who was once Trump’s personal lawyer. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the DOJ for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has denied the president had any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes, and the DOJ has insisted it is not trying to protect any political figures in the Epstein file process but has withheld certain materials to maintain victims’ privacy. \n\nBondi has attracted controversy elsewhere too.\n\nIn September, the president posted a highly unusual message on social media calling for the attorney general, an independent law enforcement official, to prosecute a series of Trump’s political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Leticia James. Cases against both figures soon followed, though they’ve both since faced legal hurdles.\n\nThat same month, Bondi attracted criticism from civil rights experts after she called for a wide-ranging hate speech prosecution against those who celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, even though almost all speech outside of active violent threats is constitutionally protected. \n\nOutside speech issues, the Trump administration has raised legal alarms for the tactics of its deportation crackdown. Masked Border Patrol and ICE agents have been accused of racial profiling for carrying out what appear to be random mass stops at locations including Home Depot stores, which these agencies deny. \n\nThe Trump administration also fought for months to defend the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man with U.S. citizen children who officials admitted had wrongly been sent out of the country despite a court decision blocking such a move.","summary":"The pressure on Bondi continues to grow amid widespread dissatisfaction over how the Justice Department has delayed the full release of the Epstein files","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pam-bondi-approval-rating-epstein-files-b2889243.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/20/15/19/GettyImages-2222091006.jpg?crop=6291,4194,x0,y1&trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5zMIDPD8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:26:55","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.537},{"id":388215368,"title":"Nicki Minaj's Body Language After 'Assassin' Gaffe Next To Erika Kirk Said A Lot, Experts Say","text":"Rapper Nicki Minaj made quite the unfortunate gaffe during her surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest convention over the weekend.

The coupling of these gestures signals defeat in that moment,” she said. Donaldson also pointed out that Minaj leaned in toward Erika Kirk shortly after, which signaled “a wanting of a deeper connection to Erika.” \n\nShe added that Minaj appeared to wipe her eye at one point, as if she were wiping away a tear, signaling she was “coping with an intense emotion and wanted to steady herself.”\n\nDenise M. Dudley, a psychologist and author of “Making Relationships Last,” believes that Minaj putting her hand over mouth coupled with “her prolonged eye closure” said a lot. \n\n“She’s replaying the tape in her head, so to speak, and regretting the word choice,” she told HuffPost. “However, I do believe that her regret is not because of calling JD Vance an assassin. It’s because of the insensitivity of using that word in front of Kirk.”\n\n“Minaj is definitely known for speaking her mind in ways that are sometimes outrageous,” she continued. “She’s totally used to saying things that are provocative. So I’m thinking that this long pause is indicative of her surprising even herself. In other words, even Minaj is taken aback by her own comment.” \n\nDudley thinks that Minaj’s body language showed “sincere regret,” but she believes the rapper was perhaps mostly concerned about how the gaffe would look for her image. \n\n“I believe she’s more concerned about herself than worrying about wounding Kirk.

Kirk remains positive and even says some nice things, but Minaj is still looking like she’s recovering — not as if she’s showing empathy for Kirk,” she added. \n\nPatti Wood, a body language and nonverbal communication expert and author of “SNAP: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language, and Charisma,” told HuffPost she noted a sharp contrast between the way Minaj delivered her lines about Trump compared to how she talked about Vance. \n\n“I say this because she said it in a slow purposeful manner which would typically indicate nonverbally that she had thought about that message before this interview and felt strongly about it as she delivered it,” she said. \n\nWood said that Minaj was noticeably silent and had “frozen body language” while she appeared to be deciding what to do next after using the word “assassin.” \n\n“Then she goes through a series of comfort cues putting her hand up to her lips and covering her lips,” she said, adding that “yet her overall posture is upright” and “fairly still.” \n\nWood said she thought it was interesting that Minaj, who is famous and is typically confident and assertive in her nonverbal delivery, remained silent as Erika Kirk tried to “make everything OK.” \n\nTraci Brown, an author and body language expert and behavior analyst, also believed that Minaj covering her mouth and closing eyes showed a “genuine recognition of her mistake, wanting her words back.”\n\nAdditionally, Brown thinks Minaj’s blinking pattern in that moment said it all: “[Minaj] has real stress as evidenced by rapid eye blinks,” she said.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nicki-minaj-erika-kirk-assassin-gaffe-body-language-experts_n_69498688e4b013356531a278?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69498d7b190000750b7f4d4d.jpeg?cache=2KSykAFuTF&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:22:06","author":"Kimberley Richards","authors":["Kimberley Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":388215436,"title":"Nicki Minaj's Body Language After 'Assassin' Gaffe Next To Erika Kirk Said A Lot, Experts Say","text":"Rapper Nicki Minaj made quite the unfortunate gaffe during her surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest convention over the weekend.
