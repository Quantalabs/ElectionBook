Shortly before polling stations were scheduled to close, the National Electoral Council announced that polling places would have the option of staying open for another hour if the station committee of party representatives agreed to do so. Regardless, polling places had to stay open until the last person in line could vote. In addition to a new president, voters were casting ballots for a new Congress, as well as hundreds of local positions. Main candidates Among the five presidential candidates on the ballot, polls indicated three had a chance to win and were finishing in close competition. They are: 1. Rixi Moncada who served as finance and later as defense secretary in the current administration of President Xiomara Castro and is running for the social democrat LIBRE or Liberty and Re-foundation party. 2. Salvador Nasralla, who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the conservative Liberal Party. 3. Former Tegucigalpa Mayor Nasry “Tito” Asfura, who carries the mantle of the also conservative National Party. Moncada promises to “democratize” an economy still defined by extreme wealth and poverty. Nasralla casts himself as the outsider who can clean up the country’s endemic corruption. And Asfura is trying to restore the National Party as a pro-business force tarnished by previous bouts of presidential corruption. Campaign issues Honduras’ security situation has improved in recent years as homicides across the region continue to fall, but it still has Central America’s highest homicide rate. Hondurans say security and jobs remain their top priorities, despite an economy that has strengthened during Castro’s administration. The presidential contest had mostly focused on candidates trading accusations of plans to manipulate the vote until this past week when Trump endorsed Asfura while attacking his opponents, the latest signal of the United States’ renewed interest in Latin America. U.S. president's intervention Then Trump shocked Hondurans by announcing Friday that he would pardon ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández , who was serving a 45-year sentence in a U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers moving cocaine to the United States. It was unclear what impact Trump would have on the election, but it was the latest show of the U.S. government’s willingness to directly involve itself in the region and came at a time of already heightened tensions because of the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and Trump’s threats against Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro. When asked why he pardoned Hernández, Trump argued that he was answering the calls of Hondurans who believed the case was politically motivated. “The people of Honduras really thought he was set up, and it was a terrible thing,” Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One later Sunday. “They basically said (Hernández) was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\" But in Honduras, many were left unnerved by the sudden U.S. attention, and hoping at a minimum for a peaceful election. Divergent views Cristian Zelaya, a 42-year-old systems engineer, said that his priority in the voting booth was “to try to rescue the country from a future like Venezuela.” He said that he wanted to get the “Communists” out, in reference to the governing social democrat LIBRE party, which he said made big promises, but didn't deliver. He praised Trump’s decision to pardon Hernández, who he considered a good president, but said it had no impact on his decision. In another part of the capital, Carlos Alberto Figueroa, a 71-year-old retiree, said that he wanted Moncada to continue President Castro’s work, which he said had already resulted in “development, a better economy and security.” But he too discounted Trump’s impact, saying the Honduran people would decide. Nancy Serrano, 20, was voting for the first time and top of mind for her was “enough with corruption.” Serrano is studying to be a teacher and she worries that the high prevalence of corruption limits opportunities for the youth and eats away at the economy.

The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 49.4.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the official non-manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5 from 50.1, below the 50.0 consensus forecast, and dropping into contraction for the first time since the economy reopened in 2023l it was driven by weakness in the real estate and residential services sectors. \n\nThe readings offer a preliminary glimpse of how the world’s second-biggest economy fared in November, after months of global trade turbulence and an unprecedented decline in investment. They suggest that GDP extended its decline and is now well below the 4.8% level Beijing pretends China is growing at. So far this quarter, industrial production had its smallest gain since the start of the year...\n\n... while exports unexpectedly contracted, as global demand failed to offset the slump in shipments to the US. \n\nAccording to Bloomberg Economics, the November PMI pointed to continuing broad economic weakness and hinted at a further down-drift in consumption. Services dropped sharply into contraction, a stark contrast to the flat reading in 2024 after the long October holiday. Manufacturing and construction also remained in contraction, despite a modest seasonal rebound.\n\nThe good news is that tensions with the US eased modestly after a temporary truce last month following a meeting in South Korea between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Even so, key details of the deal, including questions over Chinese shipments of rare earths, are still being negotiated, underscoring the fragility of the agreement. In fact, as reported here previously, there is still no actual rare earths agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, a diplomatic spat with Japan in recent weeks has added to trade uncertainty, as China contemplates economic countermeasures.\n\nBeyond geopolitical risks, weak domestic demand is still casting a pall over the outlook for Chinese factories. Growth in retail sales slowed for the fifth straight month in October, the longest such streak since the country shuttered shops because of the Covid pandemic more than four years ago.\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, the recent downswing in the economy doesn’t mean that additional stimulus measures are on the table. Chinese policymakers are in no rush to act now that their annual growth target of around 5% for this year looks to be within reach. Meanwhile, China's credit growth - previously the envy of the western world - has slowed to a trickle as the demand simply isn't there, as Beijing is scared to making China's massive debt bubble even bigger. \n\nChina already injected additional stimulus worth 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) since late September, including unused bond quota for provinces to expand investment and repay arrears owed to companies, as well as new funding for policy banks to spur investment. That, however, has not been enough, as we reported recently in \"China Prepares New Property Stimulus Package As Housing Crisis Enters Year Six.\"\n\nLooking at the next five years, Beijing has made clear it plans to keep tech and manufacturing as the top priorities even as it pledged to “significantly” boost the share of consumption in its economy. Net exports contributed nearly a third of China’s growth this year.\n\nChina’s economic growth decelerated last quarter to the slowest pace in a year. Analysts see a further slowdown, forecasting the weakest this quarter since the final three months of 2022, when the nation was nearing the end of its Covid Zero lockdowns.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/china-factory-activity-contracts-longest-stretch-record-economy-sinks","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/china%20mfg%20pmi.jpg?itok=C7evRRe1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 01:25:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":383743714,"title":"Trump defends Hegseth, says he didn't order second strike on drug-smuggling vessel—'I believe him 100%'","text":"President Donald Trump said today that he is certain Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not authorise a second strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean after the initial attack failed to kill everyone aboard.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, “He said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%.”'Pete said he did not order death of those two men'The Pentagon is under increasing scrutiny following a Washington Post report alleging that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth instructed forces to carry out a deadly strike on boats and explicitly required that everyone on board be killed. According to the report, this order resulted in a suspected second strike on Sept. 2 targeting the damaged hull of a boat to kill two individuals who had survived the initial attack.“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said, according to Bloomberg. When questioned about whether a follow-up strike would be lawful, he responded, “No, I wouldn’t have wanted that, not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”Experts say the naval operations have been conducted under questionable legal authority, and they have increasingly unsettled US allies. The administration contends the vessels qualify as valid targets because they are allegedly transporting drugs.Trump said he had no worries about legal objections “because you can see the boats. You can see the drugs in the boats, and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans. So I think they do an amazing job.”The Republican-controlled armed services committees in both the Senate and House have announced they intend to carry out “vigorous oversight” of the alleged double-tap strike, which has sparked worries that the US might have breached the laws governing armed conflict, a report by CNN noted.The report of a second strike intended to kill injured survivors prompted uncommon criticism from Republicans. Ohio Representative Mike Turner told CBS on Sunday that, if verified, the action would be an “illegal act\", and Nebraska’s Don Bacon told ABC it would be a “clear violation of the law of war\".Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said the committee will look into the strikes following the report.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/trump-defends-hegseth-says-he-didnt-order-second-strike-on-drug-smuggling-vessel-i-believe-him-100-11764549105919.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/01/1600x900/logo/FBN-SPO-DETROIT-LIONS-V-WASHINGTON-COMMANDERS-39_1764550558259_1764550563975.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 01:24:14","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":383742822,"title":"Trump Says He’ll Release ‘Perfect’ MRI Results from October Exam","text":"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Sunday that he would release the results of his MRI test that he received in October. “If you want to have it released, I’ll release it,” the president said during an exchange with reporters as he traveled back to Washington from Florida.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One while returning to Washington, Trump confirmed, “I know who I am going to pick, yeah. We’ll be announcing it.”The announcement is expected soon, and the decision comes after months of public criticism of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly faulted for not lowering rates fast enough.The likely frontrunner is White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, people familiar with the process told Bloomberg. Trump views Hassett as closely aligned with his push for more aggressive monetary easing, though the choice could face questions about independence at the central bank.Earlier on Sunday, Hassett appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation. While he did not confirm whether he is leading the race, he acknowledged the positive reaction from financial markets to speculation about his potential nomination. Calling the discussion a “rumor,” Hassett said the public response suggests investors expect Trump to choose someone supportive of lower borrowing costs.“We had a great Treasury auction, interest rates went down and I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who’s going to help them have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rate,” he said on CBS. “That’s what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me.”Live EventsPeople aware of internal conversations say Trump trusts Hassett and sees him as supportive of deeper rate cuts. Hassett has indicated he would accept the role if asked. Analysts, however, have noted that he may face challenges uniting the Federal Open Market Committee and could be more exposed to presidential pressure. His remarks on market reaction appeared aimed at easing those concerns.The prospect of Hassett’s nomination briefly pushed the 10-year Treasury yield below 4% last week.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is overseeing the selection process, said Trump may announce his nominee before the Christmas holiday. Other finalists under consideration include Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. Trump has also mentioned Bessent as an option, though Bessent has rejected the idea.Whoever is selected will require Senate confirmation and, if chosen from outside the central bank, would serve a 14-year term starting in February.

But why is his first target the drug cartels of Venezuela?\n\nSimply put, Venezuela is an easier target than Mexico — America’s closest trading partner and neighbor — or China — a nuclear armed adversary who might not take a liking to the US Navy sinking merchant ships carrying precursor agents.\n\nIn support of this effort, Washington has deployed a large number of warships and servicemembers into the Caribbean — the most at any time in the past three decades. This includes naval forces (a carrier strike group, destroyers, and amphibious ships), manned and unmanned air power (both afloat and ashore), special operators and 4,000 Marines on ships.\n\nThese forces have been used as a demonstration of power, but also to affect 20- plus attacks on small boats allegedly ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.\n\nThese kinetic attacks are a stark departure from nearly 40 years of law enforcement-based drug operations, where Navy, Coast Guard and other federal assets stopped ships, searched them and arrested those ferrying narcotics.\n\nThis current effort has been heavily criticized for its lack of probable cause and potential for error, and is focused too much on the cocaine after it’s been broken down into small shipments.Now we have the rumors of “ground operations.”\n\nLogically, the primary target for this effort would be striking the drugs at cartel concentration points — factories and warehouses; these targets should be well understood by US forces by now.\n\nAn accompanying target set would be the relevant parts of the Venezuelan armed forces — military airfields, fighter aircraft and air defense systems — that might oppose US strikes on narcotic targets: Venezuela has limited number of these weapons, and they are thought to be poorly maintained systems, but operational safety would dictate that they be removed. \n\nAgain, these targets should be well scoped by US forces by now; striking them will have the added benefit of convincing the Venezuelan military that this is not a fight they want to play in.\n\nActual ground operations with US soldiers in Venezuela are not a logical option: Venezuela is twice the size of California, with a population of 35 million. Yet ruling out large numbers of boots on the ground would not eliminate the possibility of special operations, by unique highly trained forces.\n\nThe short-term goal should be convincing Maduro to leave, or convincing those around him to remove him themselves.\n\nThe longer-term goal is to create the conditions where those in power, the military and police forces, allow those legally elected to power to take the presidency — Edmundo Gonzalez or Maria Corina Machado, who Gonzalez stood in for when she was barred from running.\n\nDonald Trump did not run for president as an agent of regime change anywhere, but he seems to have decided to pursue this agenda in the most unusual of places — South America, for the most unexpected of reasons — cocaine distribution.\n\nBut if he keeps up the pressure campaign he has started, regime change is likely what we will be seeing in Venezuela later this month.\n\nRear Adm.

He was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that is common in older adults, in July. There have been instances of bruises being visible on the president’s hands, which have in turn sparked concern and questions over his health.\n\nTrump confirmed that he had received an MRI at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in October as part of what the White House described as a routine physical. However, Trump told reporters he had “no idea what they analyzed.”\n\nAt 78 years old, Trump was the oldest man to assume the office of president, followed by Joe Biden. He turned 79 in June, and speculation about his health continues, particularly as this issue led to Biden’s exit from the race for president in 2024.\n\nThe President is unwell.

The demands followed a late-night post from Trump criticizing immigration policy and using inflammatory language against Walz and Somali American Democratic Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar. \n\nOther democratic figures including CNN commentator Adam Kinzinger, political influencer Harry Sisson, and the Democratic Governors Association have also joined the chorus calling for disclosure. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previously stated Trump remains in “exceptional physical health” based on the imaging results. In August, Vice President JD Vance spoke about Trump’s health, telling USA Today, “I feel very confident the president of the United States is in good shape, is going to serve out the remainder of his term and do great things for the American people.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks with reporters while in flight on Air Force One from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., to Joint Base Andrews, Sunday, Nov. 30, 2025.

This guy is, apparently, in a room ranting about everything else. This is not normal behavior. It is not healthy. And presidents throughout time have released a couple things. They’ve released their tax returns, not Donald Trump, and they’ve released their medical records, not Donald Trump….The president’s fading physically, I think the mental capacity, again, ranting, you know, crazily at midnight on Thanksgiving about everything else.

I’ve the honour and privilege of being a student of the distinguished Prof. Amupitan for four years (2000-2004), at the Faculty of Law, University of Jos (Unijos). I would have read your write up “The white paper” Backpage of Daily Trust twice, BUT YOU’RE A MUSLIM. That is all I need to qualify your very myopic nonsense. What right did Mohammed Abubakar have to become Inspector General of Police having been indicted by Justice Niki Tobi white paper on the 2001 Sept crisis in Jos, while he served as Commissioner of Police then. Maybe because Amupitan is not Scion of the caliphate. Mtcheeeeeed PATHETIC HYPOCRISY. 0803 613 0733\n\nDear Professor Suleiman.\n\nTinubu, out of government, urged foreign intervention on account of mass killing of Christians. He also asked Jonathan to resign for failure to secure Nigerian lives. I doubt very much if Amupitan will be sacked as you requested in your column today. We have a great disaster on our hands; which Trump’s intervention can only worsen.\n\nIncidentally, kindly extend my condolences to the Daily Trust group on the loss of Dan Agbese. I have been reading columnists since 14 in Nigeria, US and Canada.\n\nNobody writes like Dan. Almighty God will give him perpetual peace.\n\nAs for you, I will never stop reading your article on Monday.\n\nHave a great week ahead. Dele Sobowale, Vanguard Media Limited, Apapa\n\nMall. Suleiman A. Suleiman, I read your article from Daily Trust of 24/11/25. Any Christan and Muslim that practices their religion loyally and faithfully, and lives well has the hope of going to Heaven. Existence of Christianity in the world predates Islam by 622 years. The coming of Islam in Nigeria predates Christianity, when Islam started in the world in 622 AD, it spreaded like wildfire.\n\nThe creation of states and local government was and is a good idea. However, sundry insecurity issues had negated and reversed progress. People are leaving the rural areas for cities for security reasons and because of poverty brought about by bad leadership and governance. Danmaigona, C. 0810 580 4321\n\nRe: Tinubu must sack Amupitan for “genocide” hatchet job against Nigeria.\n\nI have just read your article with the title above. I wish to thank you once again for your concern for humanity. 0818 183 3227\n\nIn Your Piece on Prof. Joash Amupitan’s Appointment as INEC Chairman, You suggested that he should be sacked by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the dossier he wrote on the alleged genocide on Christians in Nigeria. Alternatively, you opined that he should apologise.\n\nIt was the apology (soft landing) that I thought would not work. Do you expect him to say “I am sorry what I wrote was not true, I Only wrote that because that was what my client wanted?” Or do you want him to say “I am sorry if what I wrote had offended you, but I still stand by it?”\n\nHow would any Fulani candidate standing for an election against another non-Fulani candidate feel with Professor Joash Amupitan as umpire? The man’s position is untenable. Resignation is the right and honourable step to take. But don’t hold your breath. 0803 311 8404\n\nThis is the “A” part of their demand. Once Tinubu accedes to it, then the “B” part will be to replace him with Gumi! Abi? James Soujah Abu\n\nA bitter truth that only those who doesn’t use religious sentiments will understand. Thank you for the write up. Mahdi Ibrahim\n\nDo you see Tinubu as a person you can push around? Amupitan remains with Tinubu till 2031. Kingsley Omokoje\n\nHe who go to equity must go with clean hand. Amb ST Dokore\n\nOnly those who believe in the unity and independence of Nigeria as a sovereign nation should be given the position of authority. Alhassan Naseer\n\nIf not that I have cautioned myself over the use of foul language l, I would have said “thunder fire you”!! Anyway, for your information, Prof Joash Amupitan will serve 10 years as INEC Chairman. Nothing will happen, this country belongs to all of us!! Ability Chukwuemeka Mbah\n\nRe: “TINUBU MUST SACK AMUPITAN FOR “GENOCIDE” HATCHET JOB AGAINST NIGERIA, in Daily Trust Monday Column of 24 November 2025, was a patriotic national call. In countries where highly placed public officials bother about honour and integrity, Professor Joash Ojo Amupitan should have resigned as INEC Chairman voluntarily, before waiting to be sacked.\n\nAs you rightly observed, Amupitan being the author of a chapter entitled “Legal Brief: Genocide in Nigeria” (2020) really betrayed his country in a very reckless manner. It takes a somewhat divisive and unpatriotic Nigerian, in this case, a Law ‘Professor’ for that matter, to co-author such a damning report against his country.\n\nAcademic brains like respected media practitioners hardly produce one sided report where those accused are denied fair hearing for the purpose of balancing. As you correctly observed, even the term “genocide” was given a narrow definition by Amiputan and his gang to justify the sinister motive of “Christians Genocide” in Nigeria. Officials of the United States government including President Donald Trump himself may have used the said report as a smokescreen to cover their much deeper motives. Yet, the “hatchet job” offered by Amupitan and Co. handed them the gaslight.\n\nBut as you asked president Tinubu to sack the new INEC boss, you seem to be silent on the crucial role of the National Assembly on the issue. The NASS need to investigate this apparent “treasonable” offence by Amupitan and formally request his sack given the huge national embarrassment and security scare it has brought to bear on the country particularly with the unilateral threat of military action by the US president.\n\nA worrying angle is that Amupitan’s so called “legal brief” was clearly motivated by personal or group induced divisive religious agenda. This is evident from the way Boko Haram insurgency, the farmer-herder conflict, the indigene-settler clashes and banditry were falsely lumped together and described as “fingers of the same hand” or the “Islamization agenda” by the “Muslim North”.\n\nImagine a whole learned Law professor tracing Sharia law in Nigeria to only the renewed move to updated the codes in the early 2000 or Sheikh Usman Danfodio’s Islamic Revivalist Movement of 1804, as is if they marked the very beginning of Islam in Nigeria or West Africa in general.\n\nMe think, many divisive elites in the North Central region are yet to be purged of the “Gideon Orkar” coup mentality which sought to ‘excise’ the Muslim majority Northern Nigeria from the rest of the country. Needless to catalogue “Muslim Genocide” in Nigeria to counteract the current false narrative.\n\nMy humble opinion is that as Nigerians, we should own the necessary political and moral courage to secure all citizens and residents, irrespective of race, region and religion. Our leaders must not wait for any foreign power threat based on false narrative and hidden Agenda to take the right decisions.\n\nWhen did Nigeria, the famed “Giant of Africa” and “Africa and Black Man’s Beacon of Hope” descend so low as to be bullied around by an extra continental entity before responding to our critical leadership and citizenship responsibilities? We must collectively wake up now to be our nation’s best keepers. Garba Isa\n\nSalam. It’s been a while since you wrote an article like this. May God continue to bless you.

Witkoff is scheduled to visit Moscow for talks next week.Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky named Umerov as the new head of Ukraine’s delegation to peace talks with the United States, other partners, and Russia, according to local media.“Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky said.Sunday’s meeting marks the latest development in two weeks of intense diplomatic engagement, triggered by the leak of a 28-point US peace plan that alarmed Ukraine and European allies for appearing to favor Russia, which launched its invasion nearly four years ago.The previous round of talks between US and Ukrainian officials was held November 23 in Geneva, Switzerland.US President Donald Trump has said his peace plan has been “fine-tuned” with input from both sides, and that he is sending envoys to the leaders of Russia and Ukraine to finalize an agreement. He said he looks forward to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky “only when the deal to end this war is final or in its final stages.”Trump initially set a Thanksgiving deadline for Ukraine to accept the agreement but later indicated he would allow more time if progress continues.Meanwhile, fighting persists.

A new chief negotiator, national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, led the discussions for Kyiv after the resignation on Friday of previous team leader Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, amid a corruption scandal at home.\"Ukraine's got some difficult little problems,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, referring to the corruption scandal, which he said was \"not helpful.\" He repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war and said there was a good chance a deal could be reached.Umerov thanked the United States and its officials for their support. \"U.S. is hearing us, U.S. is supporting us, U.S. is walking besides us,\" he said in English as the negotiations began.After the meeting, he declared it productive. \"We discussed all the important matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people and U.S. was super supportive,\" Umerov said.The Sunday talks took place near Miami at a private club, Shell Bay, developed by Witkoff's real estate business.Zelenskiy had said he expected the results from previous meetings in Geneva would be \"hammered out\" on Sunday. In Geneva, Ukraine presented a counter-offer to proposals laid out by U.S. Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll to leaders in Kyiv some two weeks ago.Ukraine's leadership, facing a domestic political crisis fueled by a probe into major graft in the energy sector, is seeking to push back on Moscow-friendly terms as Russian forces grind forward along the front lines of the war.Last week, Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians, who are weathering widespread blackouts from Russian air strikes on the energy system, that his country was at its most difficult moment yet but pledged not to make a bad deal.\"As a weatherman would say, there's the inherent difficulty in forecasting because the atmosphere is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to large outcomes,\" Kyiv's first deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, also part of the delegation, wrote on X from Miami on Sunday.

She is on her last legs... and Starmer will not be far behind","text":"Of course I didn't lie,' claimed Rachel Reeves on Sky News yesterday morning, though the Chancellor had to be pushed three times to say it.\n\nBut how can we be sure that itself is not a lie? After all, in the long, chaotic, confusing run-up to her second Budget last Wednesday, we were swamped with a veritable plethora of porky pies from her and the Treasury.\n\nWe know now, thanks to details revealed on Friday by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Government's official number-crunchers on tax and spend, that there was a yawning gulf between what Reeves knew to be true in private and what she was telling the rest of us in public.\n\nAt the weekend we learned that Keir Starmer also knew what his Chancellor knew – yet did nothing to stop her misleading the country with untruths, omissions and distortions about the state of the public finances.\n\nIf Reeves has lied to us – and that looks increasingly likely – then there can be no doubt the Prime Minister was complicit in the deception. Which explains why Starmer is today rallying to her defence. He knows his fate is tied to hers.\n\nDuring the summer doldrums it began to eke out from official circles that events said to be beyond the Government's control meant the nation's finances were still in a bad way. The ground was being prepared for another big increase in taxes – something the Chancellor had vowed not to repeat after her first tax-raising Budget in October last year.\n\nNone of this, we were assured, was the Government's fault. Brexit had apparently hit the economy worse than expected. The war in Ukraine and Donald Trump's tariffs were a drag on the global economy. In particular, the OBR had downgraded its estimate of British productivity growth, which meant expected tax revenues had taken a huge hit. A new fiscal black hole had emerged – perhaps as big as £30billion – requiring another hefty rise in taxes to fill it, just as Reeves had raised taxes to fill the previous year's black hole she claimed to have inherited from the Tories.\n\nWe now know none of this was true. On September 17 – over two months before the Budget – the OBR told her that its 'productivity downgrade' (which did indeed take its toll on tax revenues) had been largely offset by more buoyant revenues from rising wages and inflation. The black hole was only £2.5billion, which didn't require huge tax rises to fill it. Despite this relatively good news, the Treasury drumbeat of gloom grew ever louder. On September 26, Reeves said the productivity downgrade was 'challenging' and 'I'm not going to duck that challenge' – a clear hint of tax rises to come. There was no mention of other revenues offsetting the downgrade.\n\nThe more the news got better in private, the grimmer Reeves' warnings in public. There was a bizarre disconnect between what the Chancellor knew to be true and what she was telling us. It amounted to downright dishonesty to justify jacking up taxes.\n\nOn October 20, the OBR reported to the Treasury that the fiscal position had further improved. The loss of revenue from lower productivity had been more than wiped out by other tax revenues being higher than expected. She was now 'on course' to meet her fiscal targets. Indeed, she even had a small surplus of £2.1billion. It made no difference to the Treasury's public gloom.\n\nOn October 27 the Treasury leaked to the Financial Times, Reeves' favourite vehicle for off-the-record briefings, that the productivity downgrade meant a '£20billion hit to public finances'. It is a measure of the dishonesty now gripping the pre-Budget process that the briefing made no mention of it all being offset by other tax revenues.\n\nFour days later (October 31), in its final fiscal forecast before it factored in whatever the Government had in store come the Budget (the 'pre-measures forecast'), the OBR told the Treasury that there was now a £4.2billion surplus.\n\nFar from sharing or even hinting at this good news, Reeves doubled down with her dishonest doom and gloom.\n\nOn November 4, she commandeered the breakfast airwaves in a bizarre 'Cheerios' press conference from Downing Street to signal that all manner of bad stuff – Brexit, global events, that hit to productivity – meant she'd have to break Labour's manifesto commitment and raise income tax.\n\nShe didn't say so in so many words. But that was the intended implication of her remarks, it was how it was reported and the Treasury was happy with such reports. 'I want people to understand… the circumstances we face,' she whined. 'I am being honest with people.' In fact, she was being the opposite of honest. She was lying.\n\nStill the lies continued. On November 10 she continued to roll the pitch for income tax increases to fill a black hole in the nation's finances she knew didn't exist. 'It would be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments [not to raise the main taxes]', she told BBC radio 'but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.' Another lie.\n\nThen, lo and behold, on November 13, the Financial Times (of course) reported that there was now no need to raise income tax because the OBR's latest forecasts were much improved. But even this dramatic course correction was a lie. The Government had known since mid-September there was no yawning black hole. It had known since the end of October there was actually a small £4billion surplus.\n\nI warned on these pages at the time that the sudden 'rosier-than-expected' forecasts explanation was untrue. Starmer told Reeves to back off increasing income tax rates at the last minute because No 10's efforts to rubbish Health Secretary Wes Streeting, seen as a leadership contender, were so cack-handed it actually set off something of a counter-coup against Starmer. He was now too weak to force through an income tax rate rise. It was pure power politics – and nothing to do with a new, non-existent OBR forecast.\n\nAt the weekend, No 10 rushed to Reeves' defence. It conceded there had been a £4billion surplus rather than a black hole – but the OBR hadn't factored in the cost of the winter fuel U-turn (£1.25billion), the aborted £5billion of welfare cuts and the £3billion cost of lifting the two-child benefit cap.\n\nThese measures would together have plunged the Chancellor back into fiscal deficit.\n\nBut that is precisely the point. Taxes are going up not because of Brexit, Ukraine, Trump, poor productivity or the tooth fairy running away with the magic money tree at the end of the Downing Street gardens. They are increasing because of conscious Labour policy choices to abandon welfare reform, eschew any cuts in public spending and tax working people more to raise welfare benefits – the express demands of Labour backbenchers on a Prime Minister and Chancellor too weak to resist them.\n\nThe Tories are calling on the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate Reeves' behaviour in the run-up to the Budget. Market manipulation is a serious offence, especially if it involves moving markets on the basis of false information – and Reeves moved markets with a litany of lies, untruths and half-truths. But I suspect the regulators won't want to tangle with a Chancellor.\n\nRegardless, Reeves looks on her last legs. Forensic questions about her deceptions are batted away with a long, self-serving exegesis about child poverty, as she morphs from Iron Chancellor to Mother Teresa of the Treasury. Nobody is buying it and it won't save her skin. The OBR, which ironically she professed to worship, has blown the lid off her serial gaslighting of the British people. She can't survive the brutal exposé.\n\nAnd when she goes, Starmer will not be far behind.","summary":"'Of course I didn't lie,' claimed Rachel Reeves on Sky News yesterday morning, though the Chancellor had to be pushed three times to say it.

Devoted son Carmine, who said he would donate his kidney to his mom, stayed with her.\n\nThe telephone lady said Victoria knew word was getting out. A few false callers. Supposedly saying they were her doctors, lawyers, family. At the desk, a nurse quietly said, “She needs to inform her regular doctor that she’s here.” I was told that through tears Victoria said things like: “My son . . . How did I get so blessed with a son like this?”\n\nThanksgiving. People had gone away. Nobody was anywhere. Few reachable through their regular numbers. Nobody in their regular places. I had to leave for dinner. I couldn’t be late. I had no number, nowhere, to call. Nurses wouldn’t say anything. Doctors were on golf courses. I rang the caller’s number back only to learn Victoria had returned to her house.\n\nAn ageless wonder\n\nI receive a crate of emails daily. Some start “Dear Stupid.” One from a political pro.

Maduro’s government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty.\n\nAfter the Post’s report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.” \n\n“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nTrump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth.\n\n“Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”\n\nThat was followed Saturday with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issuing a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.” \n\n“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.\n\n“We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.”\n\nKaine and Turner appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Bacon was on ABC’s “This Week.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-cartels-congress-review_n_692ce548e4b0dee467c8de73?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/692ce54a19000010f36a0893.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:49:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":383743442,"title":"How 'Free North Korea Radio' smuggles truth across the border, and why it may go silent","text":"For two hours every day, Lee Si-young and her colleagues broadcast uncensored foreign news into closed-off North Korea, with a cruel and unthinkable awareness: If their listeners are caught tuning in to her station, they are sent to prison. Free North Korea Radio has been broadcasting from the South Korean capital, Seoul, for two decades. During that time, it has tried to push real-time news into the communist country ruled by Kim Jong Un, and before him Kim Jong Il, in an effort to crack, even slightly, the walls that hide the outside world from its 26 million residents. But Lee says she now feels a real crisis. Funding cuts and policy shifts by the governments of the United States and South Korea have led to the shutdown of broadcasts that until now were backed by government money. “Our frustration is huge, and we are afraid they have abandoned the people of North Korea,” says Lee, a defector from the North who runs the station. In North Korea, all radio and television sets are locked to state channels, the regime’s channels. But defectors who managed to escape say they used to modify their receivers or rely on smuggled devices to listen in secret at night to foreign broadcasts, exposing themselves to information the regime does not want them to hear. Those reports include outside coverage of the Kim dynasty that has ruled the dictatorship since its founding, glimpses of a richer and freer Western lifestyle, and success stories of defectors who fled North Korea and built better lives abroad. The recent moves by Washington and Seoul now threaten that important project. The website 38 North, a respected outlet covering developments inside North Korea, estimated last month that such radio broadcasts have shrunk by 85% because of the cuts. Two major stations that operated for years with US government support, Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, were forced to halt their Korean-language broadcasts after Donald Trump signed an executive order in March effectively dismantling the agency that supervised them and funded networks like theirs. Trump argued the networks leaned unfairly liberal and that investing in them was a waste of money. South Korea’s liberal government, led by President Lee Jae-myung, also stopped its own radio broadcasts in an attempt to reduce hostile actions toward the regime in Pyongyang. As part of a broader move, Seoul has also begun preventing anti-Kim activists from setting up loudspeakers near the border to blast K-pop and world news into the North. It ordered them to stop floating balloons carrying leaflets and USB devices across the border, which were meant to reach North Koreans and expose them to what is happening beyond their country. Free North Korea Radio is now one of the last small civilian or religious groups still broadcasting into North Korea. Lee says Voice of America and Radio Free Asia were far larger than her station, which has only five employees, all defectors from North Korea. “It hurts, and we don’t know what we should do,” she says. “Should we tell North Koreans that the suspended broadcasts were stopped only temporarily and will surely return, or update them that we are one of the few stations still surviving?” Not to topple the regime, just to show there is a better world outside Despite the difficulties of sending news from abroad into North Korea, Lee Yoang-hyeon, a defector who became a lawyer in South Korea, launched a website and phone app this month aimed at offering North Koreans alternative ways to access outside information. Lee says the site and app, called Korea Internet Studio, will first target the thousands of North Koreans living abroad, outside North Korea, including foreign workers, students, diplomats and their families. Many of them have mobile phones with access to the global internet, a privilege that citizens inside isolated North Korea do not have. He says his organization aims to produce practical content that North Koreans abroad can use, such as explaining what gifts foreign workers can buy for loved ones back home or what cryptocurrency is. “We do not expect the public using our content to start an uprising and overthrow the North Korean regime,” he stresses. Instead, the goal is that North Koreans “learn there is a good world where they can enjoy certain freedoms and rights.” Lee believes North Korea will eventually ease its tight internet restrictions cautiously, for example by allowing Chinese, Russian or Vietnamese companies to open offices there. Many experts are skeptical. Since 2020, North Korea has introduced especially harsh laws to intensify its battle against foreign cultural influence, particularly South Korean culture. The “reactionary ideology and culture rejection law” sets penalties of up to 10 years in prison with hard labor for anyone who consumes foreign films or music, possesses them or distributes them. It also mandates up to five years in prison for consuming unauthorized radio and television broadcasts. To keep going, even if there is only one listener Before he defected from North Korea in 2003, Pak Yosep said he was stunned to hear on South Korean radio that protests were being held against the government in Seoul, something unimaginable in the North. Pak says that while serving as a soldier in a North Korean frontline unit, he enjoyed listening to music broadcast from South Korean loudspeakers placed across the border. Kim Ki-sung, one of Free North Korea Radio’s employees, also says the South Korean radio broadcasts he listened to for a decade before fleeing North Korea in 1999 influenced him and convinced him to defect. He says he learned from them that South Korea was wealthy enough to extend loans to the Soviet Union and that it had so many cars it suffered traffic jams. “I don’t know how strong addictive drugs are, but I think these broadcasts were addictive in the same way,” Kim says. “A lot of people ask us if we are sure North Koreans really listen to our programs, but I believe we have to keep doing this even if only one person hears us.”","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1tsld911wl","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/10/28/rJRHvEOLF/rJRHvEOLF_0_272_3000_1688_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:47:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":383739892,"title":"What is driving US President’s Trump’s actions against Venezuela?  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St Lucia News","text":"Venezuela has accused Washington of a “colonial threat” against its sovereignty after US President Donald Trump said he was shutting down the country’s airspace.\n\nThe Latin American nation is on high alert after United States attacks on boats nearby and a major military deployment in the Caribbean that includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump says he is fighting drug trafficking.\n\nBut is that the real reason?\n\nPresenter: Bernard Smith\n\nMark Pfeifle – US Republican strategist and a former White House deputy national security adviser\n\nPaul Dobson – Independent journalist and political analyst in Venezuela\n\nChristopher Sabatini – Senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/what-is-driving-us-presidents-trumps-actions-against-venezuela/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/image-1764526828-rtcX7R.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:42:07","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.092},{"id":383739890,"title":"Armed men kidnap 13 women in Nigeria’s latest abduction  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St Lucia News","text":"Armed attackers abducted 13 women and an infant during an overnight raid in northeastern Nigeria, marking the latest in a series of mass kidnappings in the West African nation.\n\nA bride and 10 of her bridesmaids were among those abducted on the night of Saturday to Sunday from the village of Chacho in Sokoto State, a resident told the AFP news agency.\n\n“Bandits stormed our village last night and kidnapped 14 persons, including a bride and 10 bridesmaids, from a house in Zango neighbourhood,” said Aliyu Abdullahi, a resident of Chacho village.\n\nA baby, the baby’s mother and another woman were also taken, Abdullahi added.\n\nAccording to Abdullahi, Chacho had already been targeted in October by bandits who kidnapped 13 people.\n\n“We had to pay ransom to secure their freedom.

The extreme nature of these surgeries has drawn sharp criticism from cosmetic surgeons, who compare the resulting look to villains from horror and fantasy films.The phenomenon highlights a stark intersection of wealth, politics, and the relentless desire for physical transformation within the president's inner circle.The Maleficent AestheticThe precise aesthetic sought by the Mar-a-Lago crowd is dubbed 'Mar-a-Lago face' and characterised by an intensely smooth, taut, and volumised appearance achieved through aggressive cosmetic procedures. Prominent female figures in Donald Trump's orbit, such as Kimberly Guilfoyle, Kristi Noem, Lara Trump, and Karoline Leavitt, are frequently cited as exemplifying the look due to their high, overfilled cheeks, artificially plump lips, and noticeable lack of fine lines.Dr Anita Kulkarni, a Washington-based plastic surgeon, said a surge of patients making 'unreasonable requests' to have the Mar-a-Lago face happened after Trump's second term. The results sometimes border on the unnatural, leading to comparisons with fantastical antagonists. The look has been compared to the Disney villain Maleficent, whose highly defined cheekbones and exaggerated facial structure are now being unintentionally mirrored in the clientele's post-operative appearance.'To my eye, if I put any more in there, you're going to cross over from looking like the best version of yourself to looking like Maleficent,' Kulkarni told RadarOnline.Furthermore, some results have been likened to Billy the Puppet, the iconic ventriloquist dummy that the Jigsaw killer used from the terrifying Saw horror franchise, because of their fixed and mask-like facial expressions.Patients Demand the Overdone LookExperts have also noticed a startling cultural shift among elite social circles, where the cardinal rule of cosmetic surgery—subtlety—is deliberately rejected in favour of a conspicuous, overdone aesthetic. According to Dr Troy Pittman, clients are now 'OK with looking enhanced', a significant departure from the previously covert nature of cosmetic procedures.Dr Kelly Bolden, Medical Director of Cultura Dermatology & Plastic Surgery, confirmed a generational shift, stating that younger patients in their 20s and 30s are openly requesting an 'artificial look'. Many of these younger clients reportedly are inspired by high-profile Trump political figures such as Karoline Leavitt and Anna Kelly. The requested style, often branded a mask-face aesthetic', is typically achieved through repeated, heavy doses of dermal filler and Botox.The Surgeons' StruggleThe demand for the Mar-a-Lago face is so high that plastic surgeons in and around West Palm Beach are becoming completely 'overwhelmed' with bookings. The doctors are struggling to keep up with the rush for procedures designed to achieve a dramatically youthful appearance, despite the experts finding their requests unnatural.'People want this pumped-up, hyper-polished face because they think it signals loyalty to the new power structure. But it's a very unnatural aesthetic, and some people simply are not good candidates,' a DC surgeon told RadaOnline.Surgeons Warn About Perception BlindnessSurgeons are currently warning patients that the relentless pursuit of more extreme cosmetic enhancement can lead to perception blindness, a psychological condition where individuals lose the ability to accurately recognise how much their facial appearance has changed.The phenomenon at Mar-a-Lago serves as a potent cultural marker, reflecting how political aspirations and social positioning can drive extreme and sometimes questionable cosmetic decisions. The Maleficent and Billy the Puppet looks, whether intentional or not, has become the unexpected face of the political cosmetic craze.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trumps-second-term-triggers-cosmetic-craze-critics-say-resembles-maleficent-saw-dummy-1759217","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1772476/kimberly-guilfoyle.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=99722e2a6a28a37e12b8a483354f1d24","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:41:23","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.137},{"id":383739700,"title":"What is driving US President’s Trump’s actions against Venezuela?  - St. Vincent Tribune – Daily St Vincent","text":"Venezuela has accused Washington of a “colonial threat” against its sovereignty after US President Donald Trump said he was shutting down the country’s airspace.\n\nThe Latin American nation is on high alert after United States attacks on boats nearby and a major military deployment in the Caribbean that includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump says he is fighting drug trafficking.\n\nBut is that the real reason?\n\nPresenter: Bernard Smith\n\nMark Pfeifle – US Republican strategist and a former White House deputy national security adviser\n\nPaul Dobson – Independent journalist and political analyst in Venezuela\n\nChristopher Sabatini – Senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/what-is-driving-us-presidents-trumps-actions-against-venezuela/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/image-1764526828-KQ2Hju.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:40:04","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":0.092},{"id":383739702,"title":"Armed men kidnap 13 women in Nigeria’s latest abduction  - St. Vincent Tribune – Daily St Vincent And The","text":"Armed attackers abducted 13 women and an infant during an overnight raid in northeastern Nigeria, marking the latest in a series of mass kidnappings in the West African nation.\n\nA bride and 10 of her bridesmaids were among those abducted on the night of Saturday to Sunday from the village of Chacho in Sokoto State, a resident told the AFP news agency.\n\n“Bandits stormed our village last night and kidnapped 14 persons, including a bride and 10 bridesmaids, from a house in Zango neighbourhood,” said Aliyu Abdullahi, a resident of Chacho village.\n\nA baby, the baby’s mother and another woman were also taken, Abdullahi added.\n\nAccording to Abdullahi, Chacho had already been targeted in October by bandits who kidnapped 13 people.\n\n“We had to pay ransom to secure their freedom.

Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has claimed that the motive behind President Donald Trump’s recent designation of Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” and his allegations of Christian genocide is the US president’s interest in Nigeria’s oil wealth.\n\nAccording to Bakare, who spoke during a State of the Nation Address at the Citadel Global Community Church on Sunday, the Trump administration considers Nigeria’s oil wealth, other mineral resources and critical sectors such as real estate as central to its agenda.\n\nHe added that Trump was also keen on Nigeria’s role in the value chain of emerging technologies, which he described as major pillars of the American leader’s foreign and economic policy.\n\nThe address marked Bakare’s first public reaction since Trump’s October 31 redesignation of Nigeria as a CPC and his subsequent “guns-a-blazing, fast, vicious and sweet attack on terrorists in Nigeria” comments, which triggered swift responses from the President Bola Tinubu administration.\n\nBakare recalled that shortly after Trump won the 2024 US election, he received a vision in which the American leader arrived in Sabo, Yaba, Lagos, aboard Air Force One, “dressed in Arabian thobe and ghutra” and declaring, “We are here now.”\n\nHe said the revelation signalled a “particular interest” Trump would take in Nigeria linked to Middle East politics, oil and gas, real estate, and the country’s expanding technology sector.\n\nBakare said, “It was clear to us that President Donald Trump was going to have a particular interest in Nigeria.\n\n“Nigeria’s oil wealth and other mineral resources will be critical to the Trump presidency, as will our role in the value chain of emerging technologies.”\n\nHe added that the symbolic attire in the vision pointed to “religious implications” that could spark tensions if not properly managed.\n\n“Trump’s Muslim attire was a clear indication that his interest in Nigeria could have serious religious implications, such that could cause religiously motivated social unrest,” he said.\n\nBakare labelled Trump’s leadership style transactional and urged the Federal Government to respond with a structured economic plan.\n\n“President Donald Trump has proven to be a transactional leader whose threats are usually invitations to the negotiating table,” he said.\n\n“The Nigerian government should present the United States with a mutually beneficial business proposal, one that will facilitate US business interests while guaranteeing Nigeria’s security, educational development, industrialisation and access to cutting-edge technologies.”\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to negotiate a strategic business deal with Washington rather than wait to be pressured, stressing that Nigeria must not miss the window of opportunity.\n\nWhile he did not disclose details of his proposed plan, he insisted that Nigeria’s long-term development depended on striking agreements anchored on national interest.\n\nPresident Tinubu, last week, appointed National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, to head Nigeria’s delegation on the US-Nigeria joint working group to deepen collaboration between the two countries on security.\n\nThe former Vice-Presidential candidate also warned that the country’s worsening insecurity had exposed deep structural wounds long ignored by successive governments.\n\nHe said the Middle Belt, North-West and South-East had become flashpoints of unresolved grievances, banditry, terror networks and communal mistrust.\n\n“To deny that Christians have been targeted in many Middle Belt communities is to turn the truth on its head,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, the continued killings across Benue, Plateau, Southern Kaduna and other Middle Belt states were a “shame on the Nigerian state.”\n\nHe criticised the National Assembly for remaining silent on the insecurity crisis until the US Congress debated the issue, accusing lawmakers of prioritising 2027 politicking and defections over national security.\n\nIn the same vein, he faulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for being reactive and failing to galvanise diplomatic goodwill to support Nigeria’s war against terror. \n\nHe said, “It is a shame on the Nigerian government that these communities would resort to calling on the American government to help because their own government has failed them woefully.\n\n“It is a shame on our National Assembly that it took the United States Congress — not the representatives elected by Nigerians — to convene a hearing on the lived experiences of citizens suffering under insecurity, while those in Abuja were busy with politicking, posturing for political relevance, defecting from one political party to another in their desperate manoeuvres to secure their seats ahead of the 2027 elections.\n\n“It is indeed a shame that Nigeria’s foreign affairs architecture failed all the while to mobilise Nigeria’s dwindling diplomatic goodwill to secure international support for the war on terror, only to respond with excuses when that goodwill reached its lowest ebb.”\n\nBakare added that tensions in the South-East, exacerbated by the detention and trial of separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu, showed that Nigeria had not healed from the 1967-1970 Civil War.\n\nBakare said President Bola Tinubu stood at a decisive junction where he must choose between political calculations ahead of 2027 and the tougher path of structural reforms.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the President’s efforts to recruit more security personnel and declare limited security emergencies, he insisted that only bold action could stabilise the country.\n\nHis proposed measures included a national apology, a Victims and Survivors Register, increased boots on the ground using veterans and paramilitary forces, technology-enabled surveillance, “tech-to-industry diplomacy” to attract American military AI systems and the establishment of state, zonal and community policing systems under federal coordination.\n\n“This would entail the President owning the failure of government over the decades to protect the victims and survivors of banditry, terrorism and other forms of insecurity.\n\n“It would entail opening a Victims and Survivors Register. Then, at the end of three months, in a solemn address to the nation, the President would tender an apology on behalf of the Nigerian state to victimised communities across the nation, calling each community by name, and, possibly, some of the families most gruesomely hit in the attacks.\n\n“Such an acknowledgement would expectably be followed by compensation in the mid-term phase,” Bakare said.\n\nHe also urged Tinubu to set up a Presidential Commission for National Reconciliation, Reintegration and Restructuring, insisting that Nigeria’s real challenge was what he called “the Nigeria Question” — identity, dignity, equity, coexistence and governance.\n\nAccording to him, solving these issues was the foundation for ending decades of instability.\n\n“No nation can be built on denial,” Bakare said. “If we are to sit at the table of brotherhood, we must acknowledge the truth and confront it.”\n\nHe warned that Nigeria must move beyond piecemeal responses and embrace long-delayed structural reforms, arguing that the best of the North and South must unite to negotiate a new national settlement.\n\nAs part of long-term solutions, Bakare called for the empowerment of zonal, state and local policing systems to ensure faster response times, local accountability and community trust.\n\nHe also called for the recalibration of the national security architecture through a “technical non-political Directorate of National Intelligence,” which would free the National Security Adviser to focus on his role as the President’s political appointee.\n\nHe emphasised the need for “the establishment of a Zonal Security Council in each of the six geopolitical zones, chaired by governors from the respective zone on a rotating basis, incorporating state and local policing systems into the framework of each Zonal Council.”\n\nHe said, “The representation of the Zonal Security Councils in the National Security Council through their serving chairpersons at each point in time.\n\n“The transformation of the federal police force into a national investigative body focused on intelligence gathering, complex investigations and inter-jurisdictional crimes, serving as Nigeria’s premier investigative body.”\n\nIn addition, he called for the replacement of the one-year National Youth Service Corps with a two-year scheme, “the first year of which would be deployed towards military training and deployment.”\n\nBakare further advocated a dual foreign policy architecture – the Trans-Saharan and Trans-Atlantic – with the former engaging the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula for the “progressive acculturation of northern Nigeria and the stabilisation of the Sahel,” and the latter driving cooperation with the West.","summary":"Pastor Tunde Bakare alleges Donald Trump&#8217;s interest in Nigeria&#8217;s oil is the real motive behind recent US foreign policy moves and calls for a strategic res\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/trump-targeting-nigerias-oil-says-bakare/","url":"https://punchng.com/trump-targeting-nigerias-oil-says-bakare/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/04011740/Tunde-Bakare.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:35:56","author":"Punch Newspapers,Wale Akinselure","authors":["Punch Newspapers","Wale Akinselure"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.079},{"id":383741658,"title":"What is driving US President’s Trump’s actions against Venezuela?  - Antigua Tribune – Daily Antigua &amp;","text":"Venezuela has accused Washington of a “colonial threat” against its sovereignty after US President Donald Trump said he was shutting down the country’s airspace.\n\nThe Latin American nation is on high alert after United States attacks on boats nearby and a major military deployment in the Caribbean that includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump says he is fighting drug trafficking.\n\nBut is that the real reason?\n\nPresenter: Bernard Smith\n\nMark Pfeifle – US Republican strategist and a former White House deputy national security adviser\n\nPaul Dobson – Independent journalist and political analyst in Venezuela\n\nChristopher Sabatini – Senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/what-is-driving-us-presidents-trumps-actions-against-venezuela/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/image-1764526828-cZw1AA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:32:42","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":0.092},{"id":383741656,"title":"Armed men kidnap 13 women in Nigeria’s latest abduction  - Antigua Tribune – Daily Antigua &amp;

Now, we are faced with the same situation,” he said.\n\nA Nigerian intelligence report seen by the AFP confirmed the attack.\n\n“Sokoto witnessed a notable uptick in bandit-initiated abductions in November, culminating in the highest number of such attacks in the past year,” the report found.\n\nIt suggested that deals struck by neighbouring states in the hopes of getting the bandits to agree to stop their activities may be partly responsible for the uptick.\n\nLast week, attackers took 25 students in Kebbi State and more than 300 in Niger State. Those abducted from Kebbi were rescued and united with their parents, while there is an ongoing search for the others.\n\nMass kidnappings for ransom have become common in northern Nigeria, where armed gangs target schools and rural communities, often overwhelming local security forces.\n\nThe unrest has heaped pressure on the Nigerian government, with President Bola Tinubu declaring a nationwide emergency on Wednesday.\n\nMoreover, United States President Donald Trump recently threatened to carry out attacks in Nigeria in response to purported anti-Christian violence.\n\nWhile human rights groups have urged the Nigerian government to do more to address unrest in the country, experts say that claims of a “Christian genocide” are false and simplistic.","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/armed-men-kidnap-13-women-in-nigerias-latest-abduction/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25321718390326-1763481044-Pw8T7m.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:32:40","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":383738546,"title":"'I started with nothing!': Second home owners on banks of stunning Lake Windemere rip into Labour's 'unfair' mansion tax raid for being 'wrong on every level'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Dec 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen my dad died from a brain tumour, I watched powerless as my grieving mum walked into the arms of a manipulative monster who snapped her neck, leaving her paralysed\n\n'It wasn't true': Rachel Reeves is forced to watch footage of herself vowing she 'won't be back for more' after last tax bomb Budget\n\nEd Sheeran exposes cracks in his marriage with heartbreaking new album tracks\n\n'It's been extremely messy.

Email: john.james@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JOHN JAMES, SENIOR REPORTER and KEVIN DONALD, JOURNALIST \n Published:00:30 GMT, 1 December 2025 |Updated:00:31 GMT, 1 December 2025 \n\nMillionaire second home owners on the banks of Lake Windermere have reacted furiously to Labour's mansion tax raid.\nBusinessman David Sutton, 64, has three homes which stand together overlooking one of Britain's most stunning vistas - one that he lives in and two he rents out to tourists. \nUnder Rachel Reeves' so-called mansion tax, two of his properties would be eligible for the extra levy, leaving him and his wife at least £5,000 per year worse off.\nHe currently has all three properties on the market and plans a move back to his native Sheffield when the houses, two which are valued at £2.35m and the third at £1.4m, sell.\nIn her Budget on Wednesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was introducing a 'high value council tax surcharge' in England for homes worth £2million or more.\nThere will be four price bands with the surcharge starting at £2,500 a year for properties worth more than £2million.\nIt will rise to £7,500 for properties worth more than £5million. The charge will sit on top of usual council tax and will be applied to property owners directly, rather than tenants.\nMr Sutton told the Daily Mail: 'I've worked very hard over my life and have earned every penny I have. \n\nBusinessman David Sutton, 64, has three homes in Windemere and told the Mail he's selling them all \n\nResearch from the Mail has found a string of multi-million pound prestige Windemere properties placed on the market, such as this £8.5million lakeside six bed\n\nWestmorland and Furness Council previously doubled council tax for second home owners in south Lakeland in April\n'I'm from a mining family and when I was 16 I had nothing, I was living in a friend's house on a mattress under the eves.\n'But I built up an accountancy business which I was able to sell and we bought these properties, which were in a dreadful state and we've spent £2m on refurbishments over the last eight years.\n\n Mansion tax on properties over £2m, up to £7,500 a year, will COST Treasury before it comes in \n'All that only to have Rachel Reeves come along and impose this completely unfair tax, which is fundamentally wrong at any level.\n'Property should be sacrosanct, not something that can be taken away in taxation. I have played by the rules all my life and I expect the Government to play by the rules.\n'But they haven't, they're saying 'we're going to come along and didn't our hands into your reserves because we've decided you can afford it.'\nMr Sutton has escaped the local authority's 'second home tax,' because his other two properties are regarded as businesses.\nHowever other homeowners on the lake face a double whammy if they don't live full time in their Lake District properties and don't use it as a holiday let. \nThe changes brought in by Ms Reeves mean that from 2028 they will be paying mansion tax and double council tax under second home rules imposed in April by Westmorland and Furness Council.\nAhead of the 'mansion tax' being imposed next April, officials will conduct a 'targeted valuation exercise' to discover which homes are worth £2million and over.\nRevaluations will then be conducted every five years, as Ms Reeves looks to rake in more than £400million a year from the levy on family homes.\nBut this has led to questions about how the Valuation Office, which maintains lists of council tax bands for 26.8 million properties, will undertake the work.\nCouncil tax bands in England are still based on property values in 1991, more than 30 years ago, because there has not been a major revaluation since council tax was first introduced.\nThe Valuation Office currently assesses properties, to ensure they're in the correct council tax band, when asked to do so during an appeal or band review.\n\nMr Sutton plans to leave the area for good following the mansion tax and his council doubling second home tax (Pictured: One of his multi-million pound properties)\nIt also automatically assess some properties, for example when a property has been made smaller or when a property is newly built', according to its website.\nAssessments are made on a number of factors, such as the property's size, layout, character and location.\nIf the Valuation Office is unable to get enough information to band a property, they will arrange to visit the home.\nAn assessor will either gain all the information they need from the outside, including external pictures, or they may ask to go inside the property during a visit of up to 30 minutes.\nInspections can only happen with a homeowner's consent.\nWestmorland and Furness Council previously doubled council tax for second home owners in south Lakeland in April, a move welcomed by many locals.\nThe council was quick to allocate £300,000 to introducing 24 20mph zones to makes roads safer and encourage people to walk and cycle, reducing pollution in the national park.\nHowever it committed to spend just £1m per year towards affordable housing schemes, split between £150,000 on planning and £850,000 on the delivery of new homes.\nMr Sutton, a supporter of Reform, said: 'More and more people are going onto benefits, that's what rattles me, they are taking the money from the proactive people and giving it to those on benefits.\n'As I watched the budget I didn't know whether to laugh or cry because this government is doing exactly what I said it would when they came to power - it's taking the country back to the 1970s.\n'No socialist government has ever worked anywhere in the world and this one is proving an abject failure.\n'In a sense, though, it's good because the country needs a reset and thanks to the actions of Starmer's Labour we are probably going to get one.'\n\nThanks to a brutal combination of second home taxes and mansion taxes - Windemere is losing its appeal\nFurther along the lakeside Phil Routledge, 75, is waiting to find out whether or not his magnificent lakeside home will mean his coffers are raided.\nMr Routledge, who made his money selling forklift trucks in his native Merseyside, said: 'There's a good chance that our property will be valued at £2m so we will probably have to pay this new tax.\n'When they announced it in the budget I immediately started to wonder how they would go about classifying which property is worth £2m, it seems a massive task which would mean people visiting each individual home to value it.\n'We've spent a lot of time and money doing up our home to a good standard but there are properties of a similar size nearby which would be valued at less. You'd have to go inside to make an accurate assessment.\n'We're in the fortunate position of being able to afford the £2,500 a year, but there will be people, especially in London, who are in £2m homes who don't have that pare money to hand over to the government.\n'We bought this place as a holiday home initially, it was a second home but we decided to move up here and enjoy this beautiful scenery that we're lucky enough to look out onto.'\nA third homeowner, who declined to be named, is expecting to have to pay the mansion tax on top of the second home charge.\nHe said: 'I now have to pay double the council tax because we use our property in the Lakes as a second home for weekends when we come up from Manchester.\n'I expect this house and our main residence will be subject to the mansion tax - so with second home tax and two lots of mansion tax to pay I expect to be around £12,000 a year worse off.\n'It's absolutely scandalous that Labour has come after people like me who have worked hard and done well, it's a penalty for having the nerve to become wealthy.'\nIt was a different story in the less well-heeled parts of Windermere as locals said that affordable housing should be the local authority's number one priority, with some forced to stay in rooms in B and Bs just so they can continue to work in the town.\n\nThere has been anger in the town that rows of millionaires' mansions sit empty half the year\n\nQuiet streets of quaint homes are taken over by holiday rentals recognisable by the coded key boxes\nAnd there was anger that while rows of millionaires' mansions appear along prime lakeside locations, staff in shops and cafes are struggling to pay stiff monthly rents for single room bedsits.\nQuiet streets of quaint homes are taken over by holiday rentals with names like Tizzie Whizie Cottage and Herdy Hollow - recognisable by the coded key boxes installed beside brightly painted front doors.\nCafe manager Katie Williams, born and bred in Windermere, has no issue with the council pursuing anti pollution policies.\nBut Katie, 24, said: 'The number one priority has to be building affordable housing for local people because for people like me and my generation any thought of owning a home in the place where we were brought up is just impossible.\n'It should be the most important thing and it doesn't feel as though it is, we have been forgotten about.\n'A three bedroom house would cost about £1,500 in rent and most small flats are £900-a-month, which is way out of reach for people in hospitality jobs.\n'I pay £600 for a flat in Kendal, which is well outside Windermere. It's a small one bedroom flat and the council tax is £200 a month.\n'It makes it a real struggle for me. The council has doubled council tax for second home owners and it's right that the people with most money should pay more.\n'But they're not doing enough for local people, those who were born here like me.\n'My dad and I had to move out of our rented home because the landlord wanted to sell it and I spent some time in a B and B where the owners had rooms for rent to locals.\n'It was strange living in a hotel but it meant I had more money and didn't need to spend money commuting into Windermere to do my job.'\nCarol Sharp is headmistress of Hawkshead Esthwaite Primary School in Hawkshead, 10 miles from Windermere.\nIn recent years she has seen her pupil role fall to just 30 and Mrs Sharp has had to split her role to be head of another small primary school in the north of Cumbria to make both schools viable.\nShe said: 'More than half the residential houses in Hawkshead are Airbnbs or second homes and it's obvious that is going to effect a school like ours badly.\n'The average house price in our village is £850,000 and that is beyond the majority of local people so they have to move away.\n'It means the village is dead, especially out of season, when all those expensive homes are sitting empty. For us that means we have 30 pupils when we should be running at around twice that number.\n'I have taken on a role as executive head of Penruddock School, for no extra money, just to keep both schools sustainable.\n'Until the issue of affordable housing is tackled properly it is only going to get worse and we'll see schools like Hawkshead closing.\n'We're seeing places where local people used to live, buildings on large farms for instance, turned over to be used as tourist rentals. The places where local people can afford to live are dwindling all the time.'\nPaul Carrier, 88, a retired marketing executive in the chemical industry, has watched in dismay as some of Windermere's most beautiful views have become dotted with the mansions of the wealthy.\n\nPaige Mather, 29, works at a Windermere letting agency and has seen second homes going on the market\n\nThe council has poured extra income from second home raids into hated traffic schemes \nHe said: 'It makes me so angry to see these places being built in prime locations that were once the most beautiful views along the length of the lake.\n'It seems that those with the most money are able to build whatever they want wherever they want while local people are forced to move out of the places where they were brought up.\n'We have very wealthy business people and top footballers rumoured to have enormous and incredibly expensive homes here which sit empty for the majority of the year.\n'I was born in Liverpool and worked in Buckinghamshire, but I retired here in the late nineties. I'm afraid I've seen mostly changes here that I don't like. The roads are crowded and I hate the roar of motorbikes.'\n\nLabour is 'fleecing homeowners' \n\nReaction from across the property industry to Labour's budget has been mixed to say the least. \nA spokesman for Purple Bricks told the Mail: 'Yet again the government is picking the pockets of the property owners of this country. This extra tax on people who I've worked hard to live in a nice home comes on top of the punitive stamp duties that already distort the housing market.\n'The Chancellor's actions in the Budget risk causing the whole market to stagnate. If this tax puts people off upsizing, the ramifications could spread all the way down to first-time buyers.\n'Not every £2million property is a mansion and not every owner is super-rich. That's the average price for a small terraced house in some London streets.\n'Our Mansion Package is not just to help those hit by the new tax but also a protest at yet another kick in the teeth for Britain's fleeced homeowners.'\nThe agents say they have released a new Mansion Package to sell homes hit by the new levy for £2,499.50 on completion – that's half the price of their usual top-level service for more expensive properties.\nTraditional estate agents commonly charge between 1% and 2%, which could mean fees of between £20,000 and £40,000. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaige Mather, 29, works at a Windermere letting agency and has seen second homes going on the market.\nShe said: 'A lot of people have been putting their second homes here on the market because the council tax rise is just too much for them.\n'But many aren't selling. People are aware of the tax so are resisting buying a second home even if they can afford it and the houses are just too expensive for ordinary local people.\n'For someone like me who earns minimum wage it is impossible to live in Windermere, as much as my partner and I would love to.\n'Instead we live in Kendal, which is outside the national park but is still really expensive. It costs £8.50 to get the train into Windermere, which is a lot just to get to work every days considering it's a short journey.'\nWindermere butcher Jonathan Turner said holiday rental should be paying the same elevated business rates as the high street shop he manages.\nJonathan, 36, said: 'They should be paying the same as us for commercial waste collection but they don't. You see them coming out and placing piles of rubbish into public bins on streets. It isn't fair on local people or businesses.'\nSecond home owners say that the tax hike could have an adverse effect on the Lake District economy because they have less to spend.\nRob Nicholls, who has a second home in Ambleside, said: 'We haven't got limitless funds, so we've changed our habits. Now we bring all our food and drink with us and cook in the cottage instead of going out.\n'We used to eat out regularly – now we don't go out for £70 or £100 meals. We might nip out for breakfast occasionally but that's it. Our budget hasn't changed but how we live when we come here has. We just pack the car with everything and bring it with us.'\nA spokesman for Westmorland and Furness Council explained its second homes tax hike to the Mail ahead of the controversial budget. \nA spokesperson said: 'High levels of second home ownership can have negative consequences for local communities and major implications for community sustainability – when there are not enough people in a community to keep services and community support networks going.\n'It also reduces available housing stock, for sale and rent, and drives up house prices for local people.\n'In 2023, there were a total of 5,440 second homes in Westmorland and Furness, representing 4.7 per cent of the total number of homes. \n'However, there are many parts of our area where second homes make up a much larger proportion of the housing stock - for example,14 per cent in Windermere, 25 per cent in Patterdale and more than 20 per cent in the Lake District as a whole.\n'This level of second homes and holiday lets is hollowing out communities. It is imperative that we take the action necessary to stop the situation getting even more severe, and to avoid other communities being lost to holiday homes.\n'With a significant proportion of the population absent for large parts of the year, especially in winter, it can also make it more expensive and difficult for councils and businesses to provide the local services residents expect.\n'In recognition of the issues, in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, councils were granted the discretion to charge additional council tax of up to 100 per cent on furnished homes not used as a sole or main residence.'\nLabourRachel Reeves\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'I started with nothing!': Second home owners on banks of stunning Lake Windemere rip into Labour's 'unfair' mansion tax raid for being 'wrong on every level'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The answer is yes,\" Trump said when asked if he had spoken with Maduro. He was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One.The New York Times first reported Trump had spoken with Maduro earlier this month and discussed a possible meeting between them in the United States.\"I wouldn't say it went well or badly, it was a phone call,\" Trump said regarding the conversation..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}The revelation of the phone call comes as Trump continues to use bellicose rhetoric regarding Venezuela, while also entertaining the possibility of diplomacy.On Saturday, Trump said the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety,\" but gave no further details, stirring anxiety and confusion in Caracas as his administration ramps up pressure on Maduro's government.When asked whether his airspace comments meant strikes against Venezuela were imminent, Trump said: \"Don't read anything into it.\"The Trump administration has been weighing Venezuela-related options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro's role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. The socialist Venezuelan president has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade.Reuters has reported the options under US consideration include an attempt to overthrow Maduro, and that the US military is poised for a new phase of operations after a massive military buildup in the Caribbean and nearly three months of strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela's coast.Human rights groups have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.Trump said he would look into whether the US military had carried out a second strike in the Caribbean that killed survivors during a September operation, adding he would not have wanted such a strike.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the strikes are lawful but are intended to be \"lethal.\"Trump told military service members last week the US would \"very soon\" begin land operations to stop suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers.Maduro and senior members of his administration have not commented on the call. Asked about it on Sunday, Jorge Rodriguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said the call was not the topic of his press conference, where he announced a lawmaker investigation into US boat strikes in the Caribbean.- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Dec 1, 2025Tune InTrending Reel","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/trump-confirms-call-with-maduro-us-plans-military-action-venezuela-glbs-2828532-2025-12-01","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/trump-america-venezuela-293527457-16x9.jpg?VersionId=cSgKYwBCJvcXYg0EV14cdoq0.dEiCDgi?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:31:29","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":383736918,"title":"Thailand open to more Indian imports, seeks removal of tariff barriers, FM Sihasak tells Firstpost","text":"Thailand is ready to import more from India and wants both sides to address obstacles such as removing tariffs and non-tariff barriers to ensure smooth trade, said Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\nIn an interview with Firstpost Managing Editor Palki Sharma, Sihasak said the strong rise in bilateral trade reflects India’s expanding economy and the growing purchasing power of Indian consumers.\n“Trade follows the market,” he said, adding that tariff and non-tariff barriers must be examined to ensure a smoother exchange of goods. He said that if any hurdles were restricting free trade, both countries should work to address them.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD He said similar concerns have emerged within ASEAN, where discussions on managing trade deficits and advancing regional free-trade talks began earlier this year. Those negotiations were initially expected to conclude by October but have been delayed.\nMore from World Death toll rises to 91 in Vietnam’s devastating floods and landslides Indian exporters redirect shipments to Asia and Europe as steep US tariffs hit key sectors: Report When asked whether the process risked collapsing, he said the global multilateral trading system including the WTO was weakening, which made stronger regional cooperation even more important.\nThe Foreign Minister said Asean continues to move toward deeper economic integration, including the goal of creating a single market and production base and is promoting trade under the RCEP. He said the bloc hopes India will eventually join such arrangements, stressing that all countries benefit from increased trade. When asked whom that message was directed at, he declined to specify.\nBalancing big powers\nSihasak also discussed Thailand’s ties with China following the Thai king’s rare visit to Beijing, the only country he has travelled to apart from Bhutan since becoming monarch in 2016. He said the trip marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, though the countries share historical links going back centuries.\nQuick Reads View All US envoy Witkoff heads to Moscow as Washington pushes for breakthrough in Russia–Ukraine talks 'Wouldn’t say it went well...': Trump confirms call with Maduro amid escalating US–Venezuela tensions On Chinese President Xi Jinping’s comment that China and Thailand are “one family,” Sihasak said such phrasing has long been used to describe the relationship. He highlighted the deep cultural and ancestral connections, noting that many Thais have Chinese roots and that Thai Chinese, Thai Indians and other communities coexist harmoniously.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Asked whether Washington, Thailand’s oldest treaty ally — was concerned about Thailand’s growing engagement with China, Sihasak said Bangkok aims for balanced ties with all major partners. He stressed that closer relations with Beijing do not come at the expense of its long-standing ties with the United States.\nOn whether the US’s transactional approach under Donald Trump had been difficult, he said those tendencies were visible early in Trump’s presidency. Thailand responds to such policies pragmatically but firmly, focusing on mutual benefit rather than pressure. He added that even smaller countries play a meaningful role in a region whose geopolitical importance is rising.\nOn defence procurement, he was asked whether Thailand’s recent acquisition of Chinese weapons suggested China was gaining ground over Western suppliers. He said Thailand’s decisions were not politically motivated, and that it would continue to choose systems that are the most effective and most economical, regardless of their origin.\nA strategic, growing India–Thailand partnership\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD On India–Thailand relations, Sihasak described the partnership as strategic, going beyond bilateral ties. He praised India’s economic success and technological leadership, noting Thailand’s efforts to transition to a digital, green and innovation-driven economy. He highlighted the importance of tourism, with over two million Indians visiting Thailand annually and Thai pilgrims traveling to India’s Buddhist sites and expressed hope for increased flows in both directions.\nSihasak also said that Thailand was now in the recovery phase after unprecedented floods claimed over 140 lives. He attributed the disaster to climate change, rejecting any notion that it is a “hoax” and stressing that scientific evidence is clear. He called for greater political will and climate finance, especially for countries with limited capacity, and criticised major powers for not showing the necessary commitment.\nSihasak emphasised the need to connect South and Southeast Asia through frameworks like BIMSTEC and the Mekong–Ganga Cooperation, with India and Thailand playing a pivotal role. Maritime security was a key theme, with Sihasak highlighting the importance of keeping sea lanes connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans free, open and secure. He pointed to joint naval exercises like SITMEX as evidence of India’s active engagement in the region.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The minister identified cybercrime, particularly scam canters along Thailand’s borders with Myanmar and Cambodia, as a pressing shared challenge. He announced that Thailand will host a ministerial-level international conference on December 17 to address online scams, calling for global cooperation to combat this transnational threat. India and Thailand already have a joint security task force for information sharing and coordinated crackdowns.\nOn defence corporation, Sihasak confirmed Thailand’s interest in both acquiring Indian weapons and, more importantly, in joint production and development. He stressed that the goal is to build Thailand’s own capacity to produce certain weapons and munitions.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/thailand-open-to-more-indian-imports-seeks-removal-of-tariff-barriers-fm-sihasak-tells-firstpost-13955389.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/11/Representational-Image-2025-11-30T235239.331-2025-11-96913dbcc0c97757600b5346a7d8cef5.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:30:33","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.112},{"id":383740408,"title":"Why the RBI MPC is likely to maintain status quo for a third consecutive time","text":"Why the RBI MPC is likely to maintain status quo for a third consecutive time Explained \n 9 min ago\n\n This is an AI assisted summary.\n\n The RBI's MPC is set to maintain the repo rate at its upcoming meeting, with the GDP growing at 8.2% in Q2 FY2026 and CPI inflation at a record low of 0.25% in October.

On his cryptocurrency-based prediction market, customers wager real money on real-world events — everything from elections to sports, entertainment and even conflict. Polymarket has beaten the experts at predicting some outcomes. \"It's the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now, until someone else creates some sort of a super crystal ball,\" Coplan said. What is Polymarket?Coplan, a native New Yorker, dropped out of New York University in his freshman year. When COVID hit, found himself looking for simple answers to complex questions — the kinds that can, in some cases, be answered by prediction markets. He remembers asking himself questions like: \"When is this going to end? When's the vaccine going to be ready? When is shelter in place going to be over?\"\"He was 22 when he launched Polymarket as a place for people to bet on current events. \"And as a result, when a ton of people are betting, you get the betting odds, which basically tell you how likely each outcome is,\" Coplan said.When 60 Minutes met Coplan, he showed correspondent Anderson Cooper Polymarket's main page featuring 15 categories to choose from, including politics, culture, sports and finance. Within each, there are questions - around 10,000 - about upcoming events for people to bet on. \"If something is being discussed in the news, if something is of importance, whether it's geopolitically, you know, macroeconomically, culturally, we want to have a Polymarket for it,\" Coplan said.To wager, customers click on one of the questions. Users can take a \"yes\" or \"no\" position on each one.\"You make money if you're right. You lose money if you're wrong,\" Coplan said. \"And as a result, it creates this information that's really useful for people.\"Percentages next to questions show the odds, determined by all the other bets that have already been made. As more people wager and news breaks, the odds change. One of the most popular questions came nearly a year before the 2024 presidential election: Who will be the presidential election winner? President Trump started pulling away in early October. In the final month of the campaign, while most pollsters were saying the race was too close to call, Polymarket correctly predicted the outcome of the race. \"The percentage of people who are gonna vote for a candidate is not the same as who's likely to win,\" Coplan said. \"You would look at Polymarket and it would say '70%-30% for Trump.' And people are like, 'No way it's gonna be 70%-30%.'\"Coplan says that unlike polls, which ask who you're most likely to vote for, Polymarket answers a different question: Who is going to win.\"But it's the question people actually want to know,\" Coplan said. In all, around $3.6 billion was wagered on that one question Money has also been wagered on politics around the world on Polymarket: like the Irish election results, and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's ability to hold on to power. \"If you are into geopolitics, this creates an incentive for you to dig into what's going on in Venezuela and try and get an edge,\" Coplan said. Sports are also hugely popular. You can buy and sell shares and cash out any time before an event resolves.\"Unlike a betting site where you make a bet and it's against the house, here you own a share,\" Coplan said. \"You could almost say it's similar to a stock, but it's not a stock.\"Investigations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FBICoplan made a risky bet of his own when he built Polymarket in 2020. He did it fast – in just three months – and he didn't seek regulatory approval as required by law. His main competitor, Kalshi, did. The next year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees derivatives and futures trading, launched an investigation. Polymarket cooperated and ultimately paid a $1.4 million penalty for operating without registering with the CFTC. Coplan also agreed that the company would not have customers in the U.S. How a French \"whale\" made over $80 million on Polymarket betting on Trump's 2024 election winPolymarket geo-blocked trading in the U.S. and moved certain operations outside the country, Coplan said. \"It wasn't, 'Hey, you're banned from trading in the U.S.' It's like, 'Until you're licensed,'\" Coplan said. After the settlement, Polymarket wasn't supposed to let U.S. users trade on its platform. But plenty continued to do so, even though officially it violated the site's terms of service. All they needed was a VPN connection to mask their computer's location. In 2024, in the final weeks of the Biden administration, Coplan got a rude awakening at home from the FBI.\"There was a lot of, like, yelling and banging on the door,\" Coplan said. He wasn't arrested, but agents seized his phones and computers. \"New phone, who dis?\" Coplan posted on social media afterwards. Future of prediction marketsBut with a new administration in the White House came a new appreciation for prediction markets. The government dropped its investigations in July. Coplan bought a fully licensed, legally compliant trading platform, paving the way for U.S. customers to openly bet on Polymarket. In August 2025, Coplan named the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., to Polymarket's advisory board. Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital fund invested around $10 million in the company. Coplan said putting President Trump's son on his advisory board had nothing to do with protecting his company. Send a secure tip to 60 Minutes: Here's how to confidentially share information with our journalists\"This [administration] is very pro-innovation, and pro-crypto, and pro-Polymarket, which is amazing,\" Coplan said, adding, \"I need help navigating that, right? I'm a young entrepreneur.\"Last month, Polymarket got its biggest validation yet when the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange announced it was investing $2 billion in Polymarket. Polymarket's data will soon be integrated into the exchange to help investors and traders get an edge. Polymarket, which is valued at $9 billion, has not yet turned a profit. It gives away its main product — its predictions — for free, and doesn't charge fees on trades, at least not yet. Hundreds of thousands of people trade on Polymarket and tens of millions of people look at the odds on the prediction market, according to Coplan. His goal is to reach a billion people, though he acknowledges that there's a lot that needs to be done to get there. \"There are billions of people who could find value in this, which means until those people have Polymarket, are getting value from Polymarket, job's not done,\" Coplan said.","summary":"Shayne Coplan started Polymarket five years ago.

In the final month of the campaign, most pollsters were saying the race was too close to call. But that was \"conventional wisdom.\" Polymarket relied on the \"wisdom of crowds,\" and correctly predicted the outcome. It's not just elections Polymarket helps its customers bet on. It's all kinds of questions. \"Who will win the Super Bowl? Will Taylor Swift get married this year? When will there be a ceasefire in Ukraine?\" The company was founded by a precocious college dropout named Shayne Coplan, who started building Polymarket five years ago when he was just 21. Prediction markets aren't new. But not many have earned the backing of billionaire investors like Polymarket has. If it all sounds a bit confounding, it did to us too. So we started by asking Shayne Coplan the most basic question of all: What is Polymarket? Shayne Coplan: It's a site where you can basically bet on current events. Some sort of question about the future, like an election. And as a result, when a ton of people are betting, you get the betting odds, which basically tell you how likely each outcome is. Anderson Cooper: And how accurate is it?Shayne Coplan: It's the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now, until someone else creates some sort of a super crystal ball. Shayne Coplan may be prone to hyperbole, but he is definitely onto something. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, while pundits opined and pollsters canvassed, Polymarket posted a simple question for users to put money on: Who will be the \"Presidential election winner [in] 2024?\" Donald Trump started pulling away in early October.Shayne Coplan: I think one thing that's important to understand about Polymarket is it is not a poll.Anderson Cooper: That's not the function of Polymarket.Shayne Coplan: Correct. Polymarket is trying to predict the outcome. The percentage of people who are gonna vote for a candidate is not the same as who's likely to win. And you would look at Polymarket and it would say 70%-30% for Trump. And people are like, \"No way it's gonna be 70%-30%.\" But he could win by one point, but he's 70% likely to win. Anderson Cooper: Which is a different question than pollsters are askingShayne Coplan: Exactly. But it's the question people actually want to know.Polymarket posted another question months before President Biden's disastrous debate, \"Biden drops out of presidential race?\" Early on the odds hovered between 10-and 30 percent. Shayne Coplan: The market was pricing it that it was unlikely but that it was possible. And ultimately during the debate the price started skyrocketing.Anderson Cooper: You could watch it during the debate.Shayne Coplan: Exactly. And everyone was talking about it. Anderson Cooper: Because by that point, odds were on Polymarket he's gonna drop out.Shayne Coplan: Exactly. Yes. Send a secure tip to 60 Minutes: Here's how to confidentially share information with our journalistsShayne Coplan: The idea that this was able to go and surface this, at a time when a lot of the mainstream media and like, no knock to mainstream media. But a lot of people were trying to say, \"Hey, he's gonna stay in.\" So the fact that Polymarket was able to be the signal through the noise there was our first step on the scene of mainstream politics. Anderson Cooper: This is the main page for Polymarket?At first glance, the site is a lot to take in. There are 15 categories to choose from, like politics, culture, sports and finance. Within each, there are a lot of boxes with simple questions about an upcoming event.Anderson Cooper: Fed decision, Bolivia presidential election, Russian-Ukraine ceasefire in 2025. How many questions are there at any one time?Shayne Coplan: It usually fluctuates around 10,000.Anderson Cooper: 10,000?Shayne Coplan: But a lot of them have multiple outcomes or multiple variations.Every question has a yes or no answer. To wager, you click on one of them. Shayne Coplan: You make money if you're right. You lose money if you're wrong. And as a result it creates this information that's really useful for people.The percentages next to the questions are the odds, determined by all the other bets that have already been made. As more people wager, and news breaks, the odds change. Anderson Cooper: How do you select the questions? Shayne Coplan: Look, if something is being discussed in the news, if something is of importance, whether it's geopolitically, you know, macroeconomically, culturally, we want to have a Polymarket for it. There are questions or markets to bet on just about everything. Not just Taylor Swift's marriage, but \"when will she get pregnant?\" How many tweets will Elon Musk send in a week? Anderson Cooper: This is predictions on who will be the top Spotify artist in 2025?Shayne Coplan: Yeah, and the market's very confident it will be Bad Bunny.Some markets are arguably in bad taste. Wagers on conspiracies, even wars.Elections — everywhere however— are one of the platform's biggest draws.Shayne Coplan: Here you go to global elections and you've got the Irish election is just.. Anderson Cooper: There's $135 million being bet on the Irish election?Shayne Coplan: Yeah. When we met with Coplan last month, more than $3.6 million had been wagered on whether or not Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro would be out of power by the end of the year. Polymarket users didn't think so, they gave it only a 23% chance. Anderson Cooper: And if you buy \"no\" on that and you're buying it at 78 cents, and at the end of the year he's still in power.Shayne Coplan: Yup. You get a dollar per share. Anderson Cooper: So you've made a profit of?Shayne Coplan: 22 cents per share. Anderson Cooper: I can see why this would be, I mean, I don't want to use the term addictive, but it would be compelling. And maybe it is addictive. I don't know, but it's certainly compelling.Shayne Coplan: Look, this is how I see it. If you are into geopolitics, this creates an incentive for you to dig in to what's going on in Venezuela and try and get an edge.Anderson Cooper: You grew up— the West Side?Shayne Coplan: Uptown, yup.Shayne Coplan is a native New Yorker. He dropped out of NYU his freshman year. And when COVID hit, found himself, looking for simple answers to complex questions. Shayne Coplan: New York City was shut down. And it's like, \"When is this gonna end? When's the vaccine gonna be ready? When is shelter in place gonna be over?\" And prediction markets can take all these disparate opinions that people are pontificating about or that they have really good reason to believe, and distill it down into one probability.Anderson Cooper: But if nobody knows for sure?Shayne Coplan: Yeah. Well if people knew for sure it would be 100%. But ultimately it's gonna get you something that's better than whatever you're seeing on the internet, where it's just a complete free-for-all of open outcry.Anderson Cooper: But predictive markets do rely on someone having some inside information.Shayne Coplan: Uh-huh. Yeah. I think that people going and having an edge to the market is a good thing. Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt.The site still has critics. Some worry certain questions could lead people to commit crimes to win a big enough bet. Polymarket was criticized for some of their markets about the L.A. wildfires earlier this year. Anderson Cooper: There was a Polymarket bet about how many acres would burn in the L.A. wildfires. Some have labeled it, like arson markets. Someone could, in order to win that, try to burn more acreage.Shayne Coplan: There were a lot of conversations about it and there was a very select few markets that felt that they were the most informational-- with, like, the least sort of, you know, risk. These are really small markets And there's tons of markets. And I understand this is really sensitive.It's the big markets that draw big bettors and this is one of Polymarket's biggest. He's wagered more than $400 million so far. Online he goes by the name Domer. Domer: I don't think of myself as a gambler, right? I mean, I'm taking very, very well-researched views on things. I feel like it's much more akin to investing Betting is Domer's full time job. He said he made nearly $3 million last year on Polymarket. He used to be a professional poker player, but gave it up. Prediction markets, he says, are more exciting.Domer: Everyday I'm kinda going into battle. Anderson Cooper: You wake up. I don't know, drink coffee, and you're, you're in battle.Domer: You are wrong. I look at my phone, within five seconds of waking up. \"What have I missed?\" My phone is my coffee. What has happened overnight? Yeah, 'cause the news doesn't sleep. Anderson Cooper: Did you bet on the papal conclave?Domer: Yes, for sure.Anderson Cooper: How, I mean, a papal conclave is a hermetically sealed environment. Information does not get out.Domer: Right.Anderson Cooper: Nobody was putting money down that there'd be an American Pope, but you were.Domer: Yeah. And his odds were 250:1. So he was a super, super, super long shot.He won $100,000 on the pope and even more, picking JD Vance to be Donald Trump's running mate. He started betting on him five months before he was selected, when Polymarket was only giving Vance a 2% chance.Anderson Cooper: What did you see that made you think, \"Oh, he might pick JD Vance?\"Domer: So that goes back to 2016 when he picked Mike Pence. And buried in one of the articles for why he picked Mike Pence is that Mike Pence had a one-syllable name, and Trump has a one-syllable name, and Trump is very into marketing. And so I was looking at the names, and I was like, \"Who is one syllable?\" And not only is Vance one syllable, he's only two letters off of Pence. Anderson Cooper: So you bet $4,000 and you ended up winning $250,000? Domer: Yes. Yeah.Anderson Cooper: It's a smart play.Domer: It is a good bet, yeah. Shayne Coplan made a risky bet when he built Polymarket in 2020. He did it fast — in just three months — and didn't seek regulatory approval as the law required. His chief competitor, Kalshi, did. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched an investigation into Polymarket. Coplan cooperated and ultimately paid a penalty. Anderson Cooper: It was a $1.4 million fine and also you-Shayne Coplan: It was a settlement.Anderson Cooper: And you could not have customers in the United States.Shayne Coplan: Yeah, we had to go and geo-block trading in the U.S., and move certain operations offshore. And it wasn't, \"Hey, you're banned from trading in the U.S.\" It's like, \"Until you're licensed.\" Anderson Cooper: I mean, it was breaking the law.Shayne Coplan: I mean, people say breaking the law. It's like which law, you know? So if anything, it's incompatible.Anderson Cooper: It's incompatible with the law.Shayne Coplan: Yeah with the regulatory matrix that existed.The \"regulatory matrix\" was pretty clear. U.S. customers couldn't trade on Polymarket, but plenty continued to. All they needed was a VPN connection to mask their computer's location. In 2024, in the final weeks of the Biden administration, Coplan got a surprise visit at home from the FBI.Shayne Coplan: There was a lotta, like, yelling and banging on the door. Anderson Cooper: Like, knocking, \"This is the FBI\"? Or like…Shayne Coplan: No, like a battering ram.He wasn't arrested, but agents seized his phones and computers. But with a new administration, came a new appreciation for prediction markets. In July, the government dropped its investigations, and Polymarket was able to buy a fully licensed, legally compliant trading platform, paving the way for their U.S. customers to bet openly. How a French \"whale\" made over $80 million on Polymarket betting on Trump's 2024 election winThree months ago, Coplan named Donald Trump Jr. – already an advisor to Kalshi – to Polymarket's advisory board. And Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital fund invested around $10 million in the company.Anderson Cooper: I think there's gonna be people watching who think, that you've put the president's son on your advisory board to get influence, to be able to protect yourself. Shayne Coplan: So it's definitely not to protect myself. I mean, look. Like, they invested, right? We're in this admin. This admin is very pro-innovation, and pro-crypto, and pro-Polymarket, which is amazing.Anderson Cooper: The administration? Shayne Coplan: Yeah. And, you know, I need help navigating that, right? I'm a young entrepreneur. If I have people who believe in what I do, who understand how politics works and can help me, help guide me and teach me, you know, there's nothing wrong about that.Last month, Polymarket got its biggest validation yet. The company that owns the New York Stock Exchange announced it was investing $2 billion in Polymarket. Days later we met Coplan on the trading floor. Anderson Cooper: What's it like to see your name up to there or to see Polymarket?Shayne Coplan: Yeah, I love it, I love it. It's, it's cool, man.He told us Polymarket's data will soon be integrated into the exchange to help investors and traders get an edge.Anderson Cooper: What valuation now has Polymarket been given?Shayne Coplan: $9 billion post-money valuation.Anderson Cooper: $9 billion. Did you anticipate that?Shayne Coplan: I mean I didn't start it to not get here, you know?Shayne Coplan is now a billionaire, at least on paper. And Polymarket? It still hasn't made any profit. It gives away its main product— its predictions— for free, and doesn't charge fees on trades. At least not yet. Anderson Cooper: How many people use Polymarket today?Shayne Coplan: I mean, there's tens of millions of people who are looking at the odds. And it's-- mid-hundreds of thousands of people who are trading.Anderson Cooper: But for you– the goal is-- a billion people?Shayne Coplan: Yeah.Anderson Cooper: So will Polymarket reach a billion people in five years? Yes or no?Shayne Coplan: Yeah. It's a great question.Anderson Cooper: What are the odds on it?Shayne Coplan: I love it. A billion people is a lot. There's gonna be a lot that we have to get right. The thing that drives me is that there are billions of people who could find value in this, which means until those people have Polymarket, are getting value from Polymarket, job's not done.

The US Secretary of Homeland Security said that authorities believe the suspected shooter who opened fire on National Guardsmen in Washington, D.C., last week might have been 'radicalised' after he arrived in the United States. The 29-year-old suspected gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal is an Afghan national, accused of firing at two National Guard members, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe on Wednesday afternoon. \"He was brought into the country by the Biden administration through Operation Allies Welcome. And then, maybe vetted after that, but not done well, based on what the guidelines were put forward by President Biden,\" Noem told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday morning. \"And now, since he's been here, we believe he could have been radicalised in his home community and in his home state.\"While Noem is always trending for her work and opinions, she has also made some buzz due to her dating life despite being married. The 54-year-old Republican Party member has been married for 33 years to her longtime husband Bryon Noem but has also been rumoured to have an affair with Trump aide Corey Lewandowski. Here's all you need to know about her and her complicated love life.Who is Kristi Noem?Born in South Dakota in 1971, Kristi Noem is an American politician serving as the US Secretary of Homeland Security. She was raised alongside three siblings on her family's farm and ranch in rural Hamlin County. In 1990, she graduated from Hamlin High School and in 1994 she left college to manage the family farm after her father was killed in an accident. It was in 2012 that she graduated with a degree in political science from South Dakota State University.In 2010, after serving in the South Dakota legislature for some years, Noem was elected to serve as South Dakota's member of the US House of Representatives. In 2018, she was elected as South Dakota's first-ever female Governor. She has been serving the role since she resigned in January 2025 to accept her role in Homeland Security. She has also authored two books, 'Not My First Rodeo: Lessons from the Heartland' and 'No Going Back'. Childhood sweetheart: Bryon NoemKristi met her husband Bryon in the state of South Dakota and married him at the age of 20, in 1992. Bryon grew up on a farm near Bryant and graduated from Northern State University with a degree in business and finance. However, he returned to work on his family farm. He also operates his own insurance company Noem Insurance and coaches basketball in his spare time.In a column for South Dakota State News, Kristi praised her husband for running their household while she worked as the governor and shared that she married him as she wanted to build a life with him.On his official first gentleman's webpage, Bryon shared that he met Kristi when she wanted to become a farmer and teacher. From operating a farm and ranch, opening an ice cream shop and managing a family restaurant, they have done it all together. The couple has three kids, Kassidy, Kennedy and Booker. Professional affair: Corey LewandowskiIn 2023, multiple reports came out about how Noem had engaged in a years-long affair with longtime Donald Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski. According to the NY Post, sources recalled them making out at a hotel bar during the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando. The liaison emerged after Noem formally endorsed Trump for the 2024 Presidential election, raising rumours that he would pick her as his running mate. Another source added that they personally saw Noem “sitting on his [Lewandowski’s] lap” during an event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in December 2020. Lewandowski, 51, was Trump's first campaign manager and was credited with engineering his victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary. However, he was accused of manhandling Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields following a Trump press conference the same year. While he has been married to Alison Hardy since 2005, he has been accused of numerous affairs and inappropriate acts with high-profile women in the Trump circle. In 2021, Noem also publicly announced that she was cutting ties with Lewandowski whom her office had called a \"volunteer\" advisor. However, at the time DailyMail.com reported it was more show than substance. While neither Noem nor Lewandowski has commented on the reports, the buzz remains that their affair was the truth. Noem seems to be going strong with her husband and family for the time being. Get an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!

We have enough problems,” he said, underscoring the administration’s shift toward extreme restriction.Pressed to clarify his remarks about “those people,” the president responded: “The people from different countries that are not friendly to us and countries that are out of control themselves.”Donald Trump continued with sweeping criticism of several nations: “I don’t think they are all Third World, but in many cases they are Third World. They are not good countries. They are crime-ridden countries. They’re countries that don’t do a good job.”Trump added, “We frankly don’t need their people coming into our country telling us what to do.”Why is Trump linking the asylum pause to Washington DC National Guard shooting?The policy shift comes days after the arrest of Lakanwal, who allegedly opened fire on National Guard personnel in Washington. He arrived in the United States following the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan and applied for asylum in 2024, which the Trump administration approved in April 2025.The attack has fuelled Trump’s long-standing efforts to overhaul immigration systems, with the president portraying the shooting as evidence of systemic failure. The administration is framing the incident as justification for expansive new restrictions, including potential reversals of previously granted protections.Did Trump target Rep. Ilhan Omar during the remarks?During the same conversation with reporters, Trump pivoted to attacking Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the first Somali American elected to Congress and a refugee who resettled in the US more than twenty years ago.He has frequently cited Somalia as an example of what he considers an unsuitable origin country for migrants, and his latest comments appear to extend that long-running line of attack.What did Trump say about denaturalising US citizens?Trump also reignited controversy over his earlier threat to revoke citizenship from some Americans, suggesting he is prepared to pursue such actions if legally permissible.“If I have the power to do it, I’m not sure that I do, but if I do I would denaturalize, absolutely,” he said.The statement marks one of Trump’s strongest endorsements yet of using denaturalisation as a tool of immigration enforcement—a practice that legal scholars warn could have profound constitutional implications.What comes next for US immigration policy?With asylum decisions frozen and the administration signalling further actions, the coming weeks are likely to see heightened political and legal battles over the scope of executive authority on immigration.The DC shooting has clearly become a flashpoint, reshaping the administration’s approach and providing Trump with a fresh platform to advance long-standing objectives—now framed as matters of national security, enforcement, and public safety.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trump-defends-asylum-freeze-after-afghan-shooter-arrest-in-washington-dc-guard-attack-we-have-enough-problems-11764547785492.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/01/1600x900/logo/Trump-25_1764547915882_1764547944651.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 00:22:39","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":383737472,"title":"Portland Faces Backlash Over Renaming Christmas Tree in Inclusive Effort","text":"Portland has ignited controversy by opting to refer to the iconic Christmas tree in the main square as merely ‘the tree.’ This decision has drawn sharp criticism from conservatives who view it as a ‘woke’ attempt at inclusivity that compromises traditional Christmas values.\n\nThe annual tree lighting ceremony at Pioneer Courthouse Square took place on Saturday night, amidst this backdrop of contention.
