The couple's public appearances have fueled growing interest in their blossoming relationship, which began making headlines in late 2024.\nStylish Appearance at the Fanatics Event\nThe couple looked stylish and relaxed as they walked hand-in-hand past reporters on the red carpet. Trump Jr., 47, kept it casual in a loose-fitting black long-sleeved shirt paired with khaki pants, while Anderson chose a chic denim-on-denim ensemble. Their chemistry was evident as they made their way into the star-studded event.\nNews of Trump Jr. and Anderson's relationship first surfaced in December 2024, following sightings during a summer outing. Since then, the duo has been inseparable, sharing memorable moments such as a romantic Italian getaway and spending the holiday season at Mar-a-Lago with the Trump family.\nBonding with the Trump Family\nBettina Anderson has reportedly been warmly embraced by the Trump family. Marla Maples, former wife of Donald Trump, recently shared a video praising Anderson during the Presidential Gala, referring to her as \"beauty\" and \"gorgeousness.\"\nA source close to the couple shared with Page Six, “Bettina and Don have been together for a few months and are super cute and happy together. It’s just a natural fit—everyone is happy for them!”\nBefore dating Anderson, Trump Jr. was in a long-term relationship with Kimberly Guilfoyle. The two began dating in 2018, got engaged in 2022, but eventually parted ways. With Anderson, Trump Jr. appears to have found renewed happiness.\nHigh-Profile Presence at the Super Bowl\nAs Super Bowl weekend continues, former President Donald Trump is set to attend Sunday’s game, adding to the high-profile list of attendees. Trump Jr.'s appearance with Anderson at the pre-game party hints at a weekend filled with spotlight moments.\nThe couple's growing popularity and their seamless blend into the Trump family's social circle suggest that this romance is one to watch in the months ahead.\nRead More : Israel Orders Negotiators To Doha After Fifth Hostage-Prisoner Swap","summary":"Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Bettina Anderson, turned heads at the exclusive Fanatics pre-Super Bowl 2025 party on Saturday.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/donald-trump-jr-and-bettina-anderson-grace-fanatics-pre-super-bowl-event/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-jr.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 01:13:41","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.676},{"id":288523914,"title":"Time to Cut ‘Red Tape’ in Way of Hurricane Recovery, Says DHS Secretary Noem","text":"SWANNANOA, NORTH CAROLINA—Four months after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the federal government will continue to provide support but also needs to get “out of the way” of recovery efforts and cut much of the red tape involved in getting assistance. \n\n“I think that the federal government would do a much better job, much like [President Donald Trump] does, if we got out of the way,” Noem said to Wanda Harvey and her mother as they spoke outside what used to be the Harvey’s home in Swannanoa, 10 miles east of Asheville, on Saturday.\n\nNoem was in western North Carolina to see the progress of the recovery efforts and the damage that still remained from Helene.\n\nRev. Franklin Graham, president of the Christian humanitarian aid organization Samaritan’s Purse stood beside the secretary as she spoke with Harvey. Samaritan’s Purse continues to provide help and assistance to hurricane victims in the region.\n\nStanding on the cement slab by the little single-story house that was flooded during the September hurricane, Harvey told Noem that dealing with the paperwork after the hurricane was a “nightmare”— a common refrain that Noem told press she heard from multiple hurricane victims during her visit Saturday. \n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency “can often be slow and confusing and a lot of paperwork,” Noem said, pledging, “We’re going to fix that.” \n\nThe response structure to natural disasters includes state and federal resources, but begins with local officials, the secretary said. “They know their communities, they know the help that is necessary.” \n\nNoem visited one such effort—The Blessing Project, a small nonprofit that is providing food, clothing, furniture, and other necessities to hurricane victims in Buncombe County. \n\nThe secretary spoke with a young family at The Blessing Barn, a resource center of The Blessing Project, who lost almost everything in the hurricane. Mere feet away, the Army Corps of Engineers worked heavy machinery to pull out debris that had been swept into the river during the hurricane. \n\nAfter one of the equipment operators pulled a load of logs, sticks, and other debris from the river, Noem donned a vest and hardhat and hopped into the machine with him as he explained how it worked. A former rancher, Noem appeared quite at ease in the large machine. \n\nCameron Hamilton, FEMA’s acting administrator, accompanied Noem on her visit to western North Carolina and told the media that FEMA is “dissecting every avenue to ensure that the response” to disasters is “faster [and] more efficient” than it has been. \n\nUnder the Trump administration, FEMA “is taking a new approach on ensuring that everything we do comes from the survivor perspective,” Hamilton said. “Everything and every effort that we engage in has to have that focus at the forefront.” \n\nFEMA, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, received intense criticism for its response to Hurricane Helene, including for at least one report that FEMA workers were directed by a supervisor to avoid homes with political signs supporting Trump. \n\n“I promise you one thing,” Noem said, “President Trump has committed, and I’m committed with him, to bringing FEMA into the 21st century, to becoming a people’s agency.” \n\nOn Jan. 24, Trump signed an executive order establishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council to review FEMA’s effectiveness in responding to natural disasters and to recommend needed changes to the agency. \n\nTrump wants to “streamline” the work of FEMA, Noem told the press. “He wants it to be much less bureaucratic,” adding that Trump has made comments that he might even discontinue the agency and instead have “a process where the federal government sends block grants, or sends the dollars, to the state or to the local communities, and they decide how it’s spent so that the federal government can get out of the way of picking and choosing winners and losers and how those processes go.” \n\n“We’ve always found a lot of times government is not the best solution,” the secretary said, noting that victims of disasters like Hurricane Helene require help and “the federal government should help, but it shouldn’t get in the way and slow that help down.” \n\nThe future of FEMA may include “eliminating a lot of what FEMA is at the federal level and giving the authority, the dollars, and the money to the states so that they can deploy that,” the secretary said. \n\nAsheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, a Democrat, gave brief remarks to the media and thanked Noem and Hamilton for their visit. \n\n“It means a lot to us that even as we see an administration change, we’ve already had a visit from our new president here,” Manheimer said, “and that we already have leadership on the ground to be able to see what we’re working with and how our community’s coming together.”","summary":"SWANNANOA, NORTH CAROLINA—Four months after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the federal government will continue to provide support...

Stereotypes exist for a reason and they all be true,” West wrote. “You can get money with Jewish people but they always gonna steal and invite you over to they house on Friday.”\n\nSchwimmer cited a number of other antisemitic comments by West, including, “Jewish people actually hate white people and use black people.”\n\n“I love Hitler. Now what b******,” the artist wrote. “I’m never apologizing for my Jewish comments.”\n\nSchwimmer called on Musk, the owner of X, to remove West from the platform. \n\n“This is so 2022,” said Schwimmer. “We can’t stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate-filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk.”\n\n“Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X,” he told Musk. “That’s twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence.”\n\n“His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,” the actor argued. “I don’t know what’s worse, the fact that he identifies as a Nazi (which implies he wants to exterminate ALL marginalized communities including his own) or the fact that there is not sufficient OUTRAGE to remove and ban him from all social media at this point.”\n\n“Silence is complicity,” he added. \n\nThe Independent has contacted X for comment. \n\nWest also posted pictures of the actor Oliver Masucci playing Adolph Hitler in the satirical movie Look Who’s Back, as well as a picture of Musk himself – the only person West follows on X – throwing up his right arm at an inauguration event for Donald Trump in what was widely interpreted as a “salute.” West added the caption “Heil Elon.”\n\nBroadcaster and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan slammed Ye on X, saying that he’s “deliberately violating nearly every rule X has.. anyone else doing this would have already been suspended.”\n\nLike Schwimmer, Morgan called out Musk. \n\n“Hey @elonmusk - how much more disgustingly hateful, racist, anti-Semitic, violence-inducing stuff from Kanye are you going to allow him to spew on your platform to his 32 million followers?” he asked. \n\nWest, 47, was involved in a controversy at the Grammys when he appeared with his wife Bianca Censori, who removed her coat to reveal she was wearing nothing but a sheer mini-dress. There was speculation that the couple might attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nWest, the Atlanta-born rapper and fashion designer, recently said he was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and that he’s autistic. \n\nHe was speaking on the podcast The Download hosted by Justin Laboy when he said his wife Bianca Censori told him he should get re-diagnosed. \n\n“I went to this doctor … My wife took me to do that because she said, ‘Something about your personality doesn’t feel like it’s bipolar, I’ve seen bipolar before.’ And I’ve come to find that it’s really a case of autism that I have,” said Ye.\n\nThe rapper said the diagnosis helped him understand some of his behavior, including when he wore a Make America Great Again hat in 2018 and lauded President Donald Trump. \n\n“The mob can’t make me not love him,” he said at the time. \n\n“Autism takes you to a Rain Man thing,” Ye told Laboy. “‘I’ma wear this Trump hat because I like Trump in general.’ And then when people tell you to not do it, you just get on that one point. And that’s my problem.”\n\nAutism is not a mental illness — the Mayo Clinic defines it as “a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication.”","summary":"‘His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews,’ Friends star says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/david-schwimmer-kanye-west-elon-musk-b2694775.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/15/23/Kanye-West-and-Bianca-Censori-attend-the-67th-Annual-GRAMMY-Awards.jpeg?trim=106,163,0,276&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UMfQ2WLs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 01:00:54","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":288522798,"title":"Nelly Performs at ‘Homecoming’ Super Bowl Week Concert in New Orleans","text":"Nelly brought his St. Louis swagger to a New Orleans institution, turning a nearly seven-decade-old restaurant into a Super Bowl week party.\n\n The multi-Grammy winner packed Brennan’s on Friday night (Feb. 7), delivering a hit-filled set at h.wood’s “Homecoming.” As fans rushed the stage, pro football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe and actor Jaleel White kicked back in the VIP area, while Flavor Flav enjoyed the show from a prime onstage spot.\n\n Chainsmokers went on before Nelly, performing a number of their hits, from “Closer” to “Roses.”\n\n Before Nelly’s appearance, attendees mingled for a few hours at the invite-only event.

We didn’t realize it. This is something she looks forward to every year, just jumping in all of them and pretending to drive them.”\n\nNow in its 117th year, the show, running through Feb. 17, is expected to draw nearly 300,000 people of all ages to McCormick Place. \n\nThe event features hundreds of the newest vehicles, from electric and economy to concept cars and convertibles. But there’s plenty to do besides kicking tires. Attractions include indoor and outdoor test tracks, the popular “Camp Jeep” ride, a Family Zone of kid-friendly activities and even “Wheel of Fortune” auditions, which will continue Sunday from 9 a.m. to noon.\n\n“It’s a staple,” Chicago Auto Show General Manager Jennifer Morand said of the event. “There’s just a lot of interactive fun for families. But also the innovation, and just seeing the latest vehicles and technology, because it’s constantly evolving. So I think that’s what keeps people coming back. Even if you’re not in the market for a new car, you’re just always looking to see what that next purchase could be down the road.”\n\nThe growing popularity of electric vehicles could not be ignored. This year, the event expanded its Chicago Drives Electric testing area to two tracks, featuring nearly 25 models from 12 brands. \n\nThe 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona emerged as a fan-favorite. Among those standing in the long line to try out the car was 65-year-old Fred Arias, of Texas, a self-proclaimed “car person.”\n\n“From the old V8 engines all the way up to the new technology, I’m just interested in everything,” said Arias, who attended the event with his 30-year-old son, Mike. “It’s amazing what they do now: the horsepower, the speeds, all the amenities in the cars.”\n\nThe Dodge Charger Daytona was just one of several cars manufactured by Stellantis, which made its return this year after pulling out of multiple car shows in 2024 in a cost-cutting move.\n\n“It was a huge void for us,” Morand said. “Their business was struggling, and they were trying to figure out how to re-imagine their brands. They have a really great brand story to tell now that they’re climbing back out of it. But the fact that they’re back at an auto show does show that these shows do work.”\n\nThe Owens family of Chicago admired another electric vehicle from Stellantis: the 2025 Jeep Wagoneer S. \n\n“I like sleek-looking, unique cars,” said Shareka Owens, 50, who attended the event with her husband, Andre, and their 18-year-old daughter, Klarissa. “I don’t want a car that looks like everybody else’s.”\n\nTo that end, Owens challenged Klarissa, who mentioned that her dream car was the gas-powered, gray 2025 Kia K5 sedan.\n\n“Give me some vibrancy,” Owens said. “I like unique colors. Gray, white, black and red is average.”\n\nStellantis also brought back its “Camp Jeep” obstacle course, including a 28-foot “mountain” with a 45-degree approach. \n\n“It’s funny, when the doors open, you see people running back to get in line for Camp Jeep,” Morand said.\n\nOther attractions include “Overlanding Chicago,” which promotes outdoor activities. The area features specialty vehicles and accessories for off-roading, or driving on unpaved surfaces.\n\nThe new Family Zone allows children to make bracelets, play games and even test drive Power Wheels and mini-Teslas.\n\nBut, all extra fun aside, more than 90% of attendees are there to shop, said Morand, who also acknowledged uncertainty about the market amid President Donald Trump’s plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on auto imports from other countries. \n\n“I know it’s a fear,” Morand said. “It seems like it’s a little bit of a moving target right now in terms of the negotiations that are going on. I hope it wouldn’t deter somebody from making a purchase right now. You have to consider it varies based on make and model and where the parts are sourced from. It’s still really early.”\n\nThose concerns aside, there was still plenty of excitement among consumers at the show.\n\n“I didn’t think it’d be like this,” Mike Arias said. “I’ve only heard about it.

The order, issued by US District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, remains in effect until a hearing scheduled for February 14.\nRestricted Data Access\nThe judge's order restricts access to Treasury payment systems and other sensitive information for political appointees, special government employees, and external agency staff assigned to the Treasury Department. It mandates that anyone who has accessed such data since January 20 must immediately destroy any downloaded copies.\nAllegations of Legal Violations\nThe case was brought against former President Donald Trump, the Treasury Department, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by attorneys general from 19 states. The plaintiffs allege that the administration violated the law by granting expanded data access to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staff.\nJudge Engelmayer stated that the states would face \"irreparable harm\" without immediate injunctive relief. He highlighted concerns over potential data breaches and the heightened vulnerability of payment systems, writing that the new policy posed a significant risk to sensitive information.\nInsider Threat Assessment\nReports surfaced last week that Musk and his team had accessed sensitive Treasury Department data, sparking widespread concern. An internal Treasury assessment reportedly described the DOGE team's access as \"the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.\"\nThe case will continue at the February 14 hearing, where the court will determine whether the temporary order should be extended or lifted.

He told AFP the group did not want to return to war, but was ready to fight if the ceasefire collapsed.\n\nThe next round of negotiations was officially started at the beginning of the week, when Netanyahu met Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, but Naim said talks were not yet under way.\n\nNetanyahu has ordered a delegation to Qatar to discuss “technical matters”, but no substantial talks will start until after he returns from Washington for a security cabinet meeting on Monday, Israeli media reported.\n\nA third stage would see the reconstruction of Gaza, but the process has been thrown into turmoil by Trump’s shock suggestion that the US should take over the territory and Palestinians be resettled elsewhere, prompting the UN secretary general to warn of ethnic cleansing.\n\nIsraelis were also angered by a Hamas ceremony that saw the frail-looking men forced to make statements on a stage in Gaza before they were taken to waiting buses.\n\nIsrael made prisoners due for release watch a film about the destruction of the Gaza Strip in the war, some of those released said, and was criticised last week for releasing prisoners wearing bracelets with pro-Israeli messages.\n\nThe Red Cross said it was “increasingly concerned” about the releases, in a statement that urged all parties including mediators “to ensure that future releases are dignified and private”.\n\nTwo of the Israeli hostages were emerging from captivity to news of painful losses.Eli Sharabi, taken hostage from Be’eri kibbutz, was not told during his entire captivity that his wife and daughters had been killed on 7 October 2023, Israeli media reported.\n\nOr Levy, who was abducted from the Nova music festival, suspected his wife was dead, but did not have the news confirmed.

In the past two presidential terms, that question has been aimed at former presidents themselves.\n\nIn 2021, then-President Biden barred then-former President Donald Trump access to intelligence briefings, arguing that Trump could not be trusted because of his \"erratic behavior.\" \n\nSince returning to office, Trump on Friday said he was doing the same to his predecessor, blaming Biden for setting the precedent and ending a courtesy traditionally provided to former presidents.\n\nMore specifically, Trump said he would immediately revoke Biden's \"security clearances,\" though in reality, Biden did not have a security clearance to begin with.\n\n\"He didn't have a security clearance in the way that folks in the military or intelligence agencies or the FBI have them, by going through the security clearance process,\" said Dakota Rudesill, a law professor at the Ohio State University who has written about national intelligence and secrecy. \n\nHere's what to know about presidents and security clearances.\n\nPresidents have access to secrets, but don't receive formal security clearances\n\nMost Americans, like federal workers or military personnel, need a formal security clearance before they can gain access to classified information or secured facilities. The process can include jumping through a number of hoops, from a background check to a polygraph test, depending on the tier. The purpose is to determine if a person can be entrusted with sensitive information.\n\nBut for the president, vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, and other government official positions outlined in the Constitution, that determination is not made by a federal investigator, but rather by election or appointment. Their access expires once they leave office.\n\nThe sitting president has access to nearly all of the nation's secrets, as well as the powers to classify and declassify material — as seen last month, when Trump vowed to declassify thousands of documents related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhat remains out of the sitting president's purview is the ability to declassify nuclear information, which is determined by law written by Congress, according to Rudesill, who has previously worked in government for the U.S. intelligence community and held a high-level security clearance.\n\n \"Congress statutorily governing nuclear classified information in a way that they have not governed any other kind of national secret is a product of the Cold War and the massive role in the Cold War of nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\nMuch is up to the sitting president's discretion\n\nBecause presidents do not receive formal security clearances, their ability to gain access to classified information once they leave office is completely up to their successor. \n\n \"The history of access to classified information for former presidents has been very ad hoc,\" Rudesill said. \"If a former president knows something about a matter that a current president or administration is working on, that former president will be briefed as a matter of courtesy.\"\n\nHe pointed out that then-President Obama called former President George W. Bush in 2011 to personally share that the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, had been killed.\n\nRudesill added that sitting presidents do not need to go through any formal process to disclose classified information, except in the case of nuclear matters.\n\n\" The president can just make decisions on the spot about who gets access and who does not,\" he said.\n\nFor these reasons, Rudesill calls the sitting president the \"most powerful actor within the massive secrecy apparatus.\" \n\nCongress technically has the authority to limit some of the executive branch's powers around granting and revoking access to classified information, but those efforts have historically not been successful, according to Rudesill. \n\n\"Congress has written actually relatively little law with regard to classified information and security clearances, and mainly provided penalties for people who leak or improperly disclose classified information,\" he said.","summary":"Both former President Joe Biden and President Trump have barred their predecessor access to classified information.

foreign aid freeze?","text":"China is expected to fill the void that’s been left behind by US President Donald Trump’s halt on foreign aid in the Pacific region, with Beijing set to grow its influence in economic and climate adaptation projects in particular.\nTrump signed an executive order on his first day in office putting a 90-day pause on funding from the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, suspending more than US$60 billion in programmes for the world’s most vulnerable nations.\nOn Tuesday, the administration placed direct-hire employees of USAID – except those deemed essential – on leave worldwide, upending the aid agency’s six-decade mission overseas.\nThe measures are part of a string of cuts Trump has enacted through coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which argues USAID is a waste of money amid a need to align with the president’s policy priorities.\nAgency staff, backed by Democratic lawmakers, have protested against the cuts saying they will put lives in danger and hamper national security.\n\nIn the Pacific – one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world – help programmes ranging from governance to women’s economic empowerment were likely to be affected, BenarNews reported, adding that several USAID partners in the region were trying to evaluate the potential impact of the freeze on their schemes.\nHideyuki Shiozawa, director of the island nations division at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation in Japan, said that given the current funding gap, China could increase its involvement in the region through economic projects and those related to climate change, including renewable energy.\n“However, this is not the case when it comes to security,” Shiozawa said, pointing out that there was bipartisan consensus on China in the US Congress.\nIf Beijing were to fill the gap and strengthen its security position in the Pacific in ways that were detrimental to the US, Washington would likely take steps to counter it, according to Shiozawa.\n“China’s superiority would not last long,” he said, adding that Democratic administrations had typically prioritised environmental and social welfare issues in US relations with Pacific countries, while Republican governments focused mainly on security.\nDescribing the cut in aid as “part of a recurring pattern in Western aid albeit an especially dramatic example”, Solstice Middleby, a PhD candidate in Pacific regionalism at the University of Adelaide, said that while the US “talked a big game” under former president Joe Biden, the region had long understood that “these promises rarely hold”.\n“Aid programmes come and go, funding gets reallocated to suit political cycles, and long-term regional priorities remain secondary to domestic agendas,” said Middleby, a former Australian diplomat to the Pacific. “This will be felt acutely, but it isn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last.”\n\nUnder Biden, the US tried to counter China’s growing influence by hosting meetings of Pacific leaders, pledging more funding – particularly for projects aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change – and establishing formal diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands and Niue.\nNew American embassies were also opened across the region, including in the Solomon Islands and Tonga in 2023, and in Vanuatu in July last year.\nIn recent years, China has focused on expanding economic ties with Pacific nations, while also increasing its diplomatic and security footprint, particularly in its cooperation with Solomon Islands’ law enforcement.\n‘A more predictable partner’\nUnlike Western donors, China’s engagement in the region did not shift with every election cycle, Middleby said, making it “a more predictable and strategic partner”.\n“If China continues to offer an alternative to the Western donor-driven model – one void of short-term projects, intermediaries and consultants – I believe its influence will grow, both in the region and globally,” she added.\nMoses Sakai, a research fellow at the PNG National Research Institute, told This Week in Asia that the US withdrawal from the climate agreement was unlikely to affect Washington’s ties with Pacific island nations, but pointed out that the United States needed to understand that climate change remained the region’s “top policy agenda”.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, climate change poses a significant threat to the Pacific island region as rising ocean temperatures contribute to the degradation of coral reefs, which support marine biodiversity and are essential for local livelihoods, nutrition and cultural practices.\nIncreasingly frequent extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones and severe flooding often bring about deaths and injuries, in addition to destroying homes, crops and infrastructure.\n\nWhile countries in the region were likely to interact more with China in future, Sakai said this was mainly to meet their development needs and did not mean they were shifting from traditional partnership with the US.\n“[Both] the US and China are considered Pacific island countries’ key development partners,” he said.\nPointing to the broader failures of foreign aid in the region and beyond, Middleby noted that aid had become increasingly “politicised, privatised and contested” over the last two decades.\n“What is the point of accepting assistance if it can be pulled away so quickly?” she asked. “Why continue to engage with generally ineffective programmes siphoned through layers of intermediaries, consultants and contractors that serve donor priorities rather than long-term regional interests?”\nHowever, Kalinga Seneviratne, author of the recently published GeoPolitics and the Media in Asia and the Pacific: Pulling in Different Directions, suggested that there may be a silver lining to Trump’s freeze on USAID, as a substantial portion of this aid was intended for regime change efforts worldwide.\nSeneviratne highlighted the agency’s involvement in “manipulating young people” in an antimonarchist campaign in Thailand in 2023, and student-led protests in Bangladesh

Trump and JD Vance during the presidential campaign with false and outrageous claims about Haitian immigrants, has sued a neo-Nazi group that helped draw national attention to the small city in the first place.\n\nThe suit, filed in federal court on Thursday, was brought by the mayor, Rob Rue, along with several city commissioners and Springfield residents. It says that Blood Tribe, a four-year-old neo-Nazi group, began a campaign of intimidation focused on Haitian immigrants in the city. It culminated last summer in “a torrent of hateful conduct, including acts of harassment, bomb threats and death threats” against locals who spoke in support of the Haitian residents.\n\nThe plaintiffs cite the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which makes it a crime to deny individuals their civil rights, and accuses Blood Tribe of ethnic intimidation and inciting violence. With the legal support of the Anti-Defamation League, the plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages and compensation for the thousands of dollars spent on extra security as Blood Tribe’s campaign unfolded.\n\nThe suit does not mention Mr. Trump, who falsely claimed at a presidential debate in September that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were eating dogs and cats, nor Mr. Vance, who urged his “fellow patriots” to “keep the cat memes flowing.” But the suit says that Christopher Pohlhaus, the leader of Blood Tribe, “gleefully took credit for the growing notoriety” of the false claims about Haitians in the city, “bragging on social media that the Blood Tribe had ‘pushed Springfield into the public consciousness.’”","summary":"In the lawsuit, the city states that people associated with the group made death threats last year against those who expressed support for Haitian residents.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/springfield-ohio-lawsuit-haitians-neo-nazis.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/08/multimedia/08nat-springfield-suit-01-mzwp/08nat-springfield-suit-01-mzwp-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 23:58:00","author":"Campbell Robertson","authors":["Campbell Robertson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":288517296,"title":"Elon Musk says has no plans to acquire TikTok's US operations","text":"Elon Musk, the world's richest person and a top advisor to US President Donald Trump, said he has no interest in acquiring social media platform TikTok's operations in the United States, in comments released Saturday.\"I've not put in a bid for TikTok and I don't have any plans for what I would do if I had TikTok,\" said Musk in comments made via videolink at a German forum in late January that were released on the weekend.TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company broken off from its Chinese owner ByteDance or otherwise be banned in the United States over national security concerns regarding the data it gathers on users.In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country a day before he took office for a second term.Soon after, Trump said he would be open to Musk — the owner of social media platform X, Tesla and a slew of other companies — buying the platform.Musk, however, said he did not wish to acquire the company.\"I don't use TikTok personally, so, you know, I'm not that familiar with it,\" he said. \"I'm not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok.\"Musk bought social media giant Twitter, which he renamed X, for $44 billion in 2022, insisting he was doing so in order to safeguard \"free speech.\"Since his takeover, rights campaigners warn there has been a spike in hate speech and disinformation on the platform.Musk was one of Trump's main financial backers in his presidential campaign, and is heading the US president's budget-slashing initiatives.His so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) has targeted a range of federal government agencies and regulators, with the apparent intent of shutting them down and firing staff, especially those not in line with Trump's political agenda.On Saturday, a US judge issued an emergency order blocking Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data for millions of Americans stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.In the comments at the forum in Germany, Musk also took aim at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which are meant to support historically oppressed and disenfranchised communities.\"DEI is simply racism rebranded,\" he said. \"I'm against racism and sexism no matter who it's directed against.\"US officials have been racing to enact Trump's war on DEI across the federal bureaucracy — dismantling training initiatives, scrapping grants and sidelining hundreds of workers.In Germany, Musk has voiced firm support for the far-right anti-immigration AfD party — a political taboo in a country whose Nazi past remains a sensitive subject.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/08/elon-musk-says-has-no-plans-to-acquire-tiktoks-us-operations","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-02-08/c6ud67is/BANNER-2025-02-09T073352.506.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 23:50:01","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":288514610,"title":"Senator Adam Schiff advocates for federal firefighters to be excluded from job hiring restrictions.","text":"Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on Friday called on several U.S. agencies to exempt seasonal wildland firefighters from the ongoing federal hiring freeze, as concerns about federal readiness for future blazes have intensified.\n\nSchiff’s letter follows an NBC News report that President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order instituting a federal hiring freeze had halted onboarding for thousands of firefighters and could contribute to a shortfall ahead of the next fire season.\n\n“I urge you to immediately exempt federal firefighters from the freeze on federal funding, to stop encouraging firefighters to resign, and to provide information on how these actions have impacted the hiring and retention of U.S. Forestry Service seasonal firefighters,” Schiff wrote in his Friday letter to the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, a key firefighting agency; the Department of the Interior (DOI); and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which administers the federal budget.\n\nWildfires that started last month in the Los Angeles area killed at least 29 people, destroyed nearly 17,000 structures and forced thousands to flee their homes. U.S. Forest Service firefighters responded to several of the most damaging fires in the Los Angeles area and federal crews were credited with saving a neighborhood.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, as reported by NBC News, wildland firefighters have not been considered exempt from the hiring freeze. Federal agencies, including the DOI’s Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, hire more than 15,000 seasonal firefighters each year.\n\nIn a Jan. 21 memo, Gary Washington, the acting secretary of the Agriculture Department, said there were not any exemptions within his agency, which includes the forest service.\n\n“Seasonal firefighters are essential to the public safety of those who live in fire-prone areas, and I am alarmed that federal firefighters are not party to this exemption,” Schiff wrote in his letter.\n\nThe OMB and USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday about Schiff’s letter. The Office of Personnel Management, which can grant exemptions according to Trump’s executive order, did not immediately respond on Saturday to a request for comment and questions about whether seasonal firefighters would be considered exempt.\n\n“The Department of the Interior is implementing President Donald J. Trump’s Hiring Freeze Executive Order across the federal civilian workforce. The order allows for exemptions for certain positions, including those related to public safety,” wrote Elizabeth Peace, an Interior Department spokeswoman. “The Department is working to hire key positions that will continue to protect public and tribal lands, infrastructure, and communities from the impacts of wildfires through hazardous fuels management, wildfire preparedness, and close collaboration with interagency partners.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSen.

However, in a post on Friday, Trump claimed that Biden used his tenure to instruct the intelligence community to prevent Trump from accessing national security information after he left office.What To KnowTrump on Saturday told the New York Post in an exclusive interview that he would revoke the clearance of eight additional Democrats, which the newspaper wrote was meant to \"punish\" them. Without their clearance, the officials will not be allowed to access classified information or enter federal facilities.The list includes:\nBiden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\nformer national security adviser Jake Sulivan\nBiden's deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco\nLawyers Andrew Weismann, Mark Zaid and Norm Eisen\nEach of those listed were at some point involved with investigations into Trump.James and Bragg both brought cases against Trump. James brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump's real estate company ahead of the 2024 election. Trump maintains his innocence, and the judgment of now over $500 million, including interest, is on appeal.Bragg led the hush money case against Trump that led to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels that led to a conviction and a largely symbolic \"unconditional discharge\" sentence. Trump has maintained his innocence and is appealing the case as well.James is also leading a new lawsuit against Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for its access to sensitive payment systems in the Treasury Department.\"This is to take away every right they have [revoking security clearances] including they can't go into [federal] buildings,\" Trump told the Post, which characterized the revocation as largely symbolic rather than consequential for James and Bragg.However, neither will be able to enter the U.S. attorney's offices for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.What People Are SayingBrian Krassenstein, entrepreneur and anti-Trump internet personality, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"These actions are unprecedented in a democracy. This is not about national security—it's a calculated move of political retribution and obstruction. By targeting officials involved in investigations and foreign policy, Trump is undermining the rule of law and putting America's security at risk.\"Laura Loomer, a conservative activist, wrote on X: \"President Trump just REVOKED the security clearances of the following 8 Democrat lawfare agents,\" adding, \"They are now forbidden from walking inside any Federal buildings since they illegally weaponized law fare to carry out election interference. I told you it would be a spicy weekend full of firings and demotions! A little birdie at the White House told me ... Stay tuned! Even MORE is coming this weekend.\"What Happens Next?With nine officials losing security clearances over the past two days, it is possible Trump is not done and will revoke clearance from other former Democrat officials and lawyers—especially if Loomer's warning pans out.","summary":"President Donald Trump will revoke the security clearance for eight former Democrat officials and lawyers who were

That was color by Clairol,' Paul told Jimmy Fallon as the host held up a picture of the actor sporting blonde hair.\n'That is not natural, guys, you can see the brown going through', he added.\nNBC's Saved By The Bell became a fan favorite when it first aired in the US in 1989.\nAfter airing every Saturday morning, the sitcom soon became a channel flagship and had several spin-off shows during the 90s.\n\nThe Los Angeles native looked debonair in in a tuxedo featuring a white jacket and black bowtie\n\nHave you figured out who is it yet?

Ron DeSantis from seeking a third consecutive term, creating an open race for the 2026 Republican primary.\n\nCasey DeSantis, a former television personality who worked at News4JAX and a significant figure in her husband’s political ascent, has previously dismissed the idea of her own political career.\n\nIn May, she remarked on the Conservative Review podcast, “When people talk about me running for governor, I think it speaks highly about the governor himself.”\n\nLast year, Gov. DeSantis downplayed the notion, stating at an event in Coral Gables that his wife had “zero” interest in running.\n\nDespite her previous denials, her potential candidacy could significantly impact Florida’s political scene.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has expressed interest in running and a poll released in January showed that Donalds has a big advantage over other prospective candidates, though Casey DeSantis was not included in that poll.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson is also considered a contender.\n\nA potential race featuring Casey DeSantis and Donalds could set the stage for a proxy battle between Trump and Gov.

The Washington decision was written by Judge John Coughenour (a Reagan appointee), and the Maryland one by Judge Deborah Boardman (appointed by Biden). Between them, the two rulings do a good job of highlighting the weaknesses of Trump's position on this issue, which goes against the text and original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and longstanding precedent. As Judge Boardman summarizes, \"[t]he Executive Order flouts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, conflicts with binding Supreme Court precedent, and runs counter to our nation's 250-year history of citizenship by birth.\"\n\nReason's Jacob Sullum has a helpful summary and discussion of the two rulings here.\n\nI have previously written about this issue here, here, and here. One key point worth reiterating is that many of the arguments put forward by the administration and its supporters would also have allowed denial of birthright citizenship to many formerly enslaved blacks (even though giving them citizenship was the main purpose of the Birthright Citizenship Clause), and to children of permanent resident legal immigrants, as well. The latter is a logical implication of the administration's argument that birthright citizenship is denied to children of parents who, by virtue of being citizens of another nation, owe that government \"allegiance.\"\n\nThe administration will appeal these rulings and the legal battle will continue, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court. So far, however, courts have forcefully rejected the government's weak arguments.","summary":"The two rulings highlight the weaknesses of Trump's legal position.","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/02/08/two-federal-courts-issue-injunctions-against-trumps-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2022/09/Citizenship.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 23:17:28","author":"Ilya Somin,Ryan Bourne","authors":["Ilya Somin","Ryan Bourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":288515282,"title":"Elon Musk says has no plans to acquire TikTok's US operations","text":"Elon Musk, the world's richest person and a top advisor to US President Donald Trump, said he has no interest in acquiring social media platform TikTok's operations in the United States, in comments released Saturday.\n\n\"I've not put in a bid for TikTok and I don't have any plans for what I would do if I had TikTok,\" said Musk in comments made via videolink at a German forum in late January that were released on the weekend.\n\nTikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company broken off from its Chinese owner ByteDance or otherwise be banned in the United States over national security concerns regarding the data it gathers on users.\n\nIn one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country a day before he took office for a second term.\n\nSoon after, Trump said he would be open to Musk -- the owner of social media platform X, Tesla and a slew of other companies -- buying the platform.\n\nMusk, however, said he did not wish to acquire the company.\n\n\"I don't use TikTok personally, so, you know, I'm not that familiar with it,\" he said. \"I'm not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok.\"\n\nMusk bought social media giant Twitter, which he renamed X, for $44 billion in 2022, insisting he was doing so in order to safeguard \"free speech.\"\n\nSince his takeover, rights campaigners warn there has been a spike in hate speech and disinformation on the platform.\n\nMusk was one of Trump's main financial backers in his presidential campaign, and is heading the US president's budget-slashing initiatives.\n\nHis so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) has targeted a range of federal government agencies and regulators, with the apparent intent of shutting them down and firing staff, especially those not in line with Trump's political agenda.\n\nOn Saturday, a US judge issued an emergency order blocking Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data for millions of Americans stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.\n\nIn the comments at the forum in Germany, Musk also took aim at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which are meant to support historically oppressed and disenfranchised communities.\n\n\"DEI is simply racism rebranded,\" he said. \"I'm against racism and sexism no matter who it's directed against.\"\n\nUS officials have been racing to enact Trump's war on DEI across the federal bureaucracy -- dismantling training initiatives, scrapping grants and sidelining hundreds of workers.\n\nIn Germany, Musk has voiced firm support for the far-right anti-immigration AfD party -- a political taboo in a country whose Nazi past remains a sensitive subject.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"Elon Musk, the world's richest person and a top advisor to US President Donald Trump, said he has no interest in acquiring social media platform TikTok's operations in the United States, in comments released Saturday.

To be fair, this was long before she went full MAGA and became unrecognizable from all the cosmetic tweaks. Back in the early 2000s, Newsom and Guilfoyle were actually a power couple — married from 2001 to 2006 and even dubbed the “new Kennedys” at one point. But their marriage was far from picture-perfect. With Newsom focused on his mayorship and Guilfoyle chasing a broadcasting career, they spent more time apart than together. “The transcontinental marriage is tough,” Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle in December 2004 (via SFGate). “The only godsend is that we don’t have kids. You give up your life in the traditional sense.”\n\nShocking no one, the marriage fell apart. They announced their split in early 2005, blaming their demanding jobs. “Over the past 10 years, we have developed a tremendous bond of love and respect for each other,” they said in a statement at the time. “That will never change.” Except that it did change. Their divorce was finalized in 2006, and from there, they took wildly different paths. Newsom climbed the political ladder to become California’s governor, while Guilfoyle cozied up to the far right, working at Fox News and later for a Trump super PAC. And just to make things even messier, she got engaged to Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAs for where they stand now? Newsom has taken some shady public digs at Guilfoyle. When asked if he still talks to his ex on MSNBC‘s “Alex Wagner Tonight,” his response was a flat “nope.

They won’t be spared from Trump’s tariffs","text":"President Donald Trump’s broad 10 percent tariff on China could drive up the cost, or cause shortages, of popular generic medicines such as antibiotics or cancer treatment drugs for consumers in the United States, experts have warned.\n\nOrdinary painkillers, psychoactive medications, blood thinners, heart medications, antihistamines, antibiotics and diuretics are just some of the essential medications that the U.S. relies on China to manufacture. \n\nIn 2023, the U.S. spent more than $2.02 billion on these kinds of imports from China alone, according to the U.S. Trade Commission. \n\nTrump’s additional 10 percent tax on Chinese imports, without an exemption for this, could disrupt the pharmaceutical and medical supply chain, which could lead to shortages or force companies to increase the cost of generic drugs to consumers. \n\nIn a letter to Trump, the American Hospital Association pleaded with the president to exempt medical equipment and pharmaceuticals from his tariffs, saying the possibility of shortages could put patients “at significant risk of harm, including death.”\n\n“Tariffs, as well as any reaction of the countries on whom such tariffs are imposed, could reduce the availability of these life-saving medications and supplies in the U.S,” the group wrote. “For example, U.S. providers import many cancer and cardiovascular medications, immunosuppressives, antibiotics and combination antibiotics from China.”\n\n“Generic manufacturers simply can’t absorb new costs,” John Murphy III, the president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines said in a statement.\n\n“Our manufacturers sell at an extremely low price, sometimes at a loss, and are increasingly forced to exit markets where they are underwater. The overall value of all generic sales in the U.S. has gone down by $6.4 billion in five years despite growth in volume and new generic launches. Tariffs would make this much worse,” Murphy said. \n\nChina supplies the U.S. with approximately 30 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients, the raw ingredients found in medicines that make them function, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nChina also is one of the U.S.’s main source of medical equipment and devices such as single-use blood pressure cuffs, stethoscope covers, anesthesia instruments and more. Nearly one-third of disposable face masks and almost all plastic gloves come from China. \n\n“For many patients, even a temporary disruption in their access to these needed medications could put them at significant risk of harm, including death. Carefully planned chemotherapy treatments and antibiotic schedules are essential to giving patients the best chance of overcoming their disease. Similarly, the provision of necessary cardiovascular medications must be continuous to preserve their cardiovascular health,” the American Hospital Association said. \n\nFor the last 10 years, the U.S. has become increasingly reliant on foreign countries for pharmaceuticals or medical equipment because it is less expensive to manufacture overseas. \n\nThough tariffs may incentivize the U.S. to begin manufacturing its own drugs, it will not happen overnight and as a result, shortages can occur. \n\nBut the long-term effects of the tariffs – whether that’s shortages or increased drug costs – will not be tangible for several months, Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School whose research focuses on prescription drugs, told NBC News.","summary":"Everyday painkillers, antibiotics, cancer medications, blood thinners and more are just some of the drugs that the U.S. relies on China to help manufacture","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/china-us-tariff-pharmaceuticals-b2694750.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/08/22/10/GettyImages-2196991880.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/b7z4hTQB-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-08 23:09:48","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":288514620,"title":"Chris Hayes Advocates for Pluralism Over Diversity to Promote DEI","text":"It appears many on the left will continue to push DEI initiatives under the guise of “pluralism” and downplay the word “diversity,” a notable shift in language after the 2024 election.\n\nThe shift suggests the left is not prepared to acknowledge that voters soundly rejected DEI ideology with President Donald Trump’s landslide victory, a good sign for Republicans’ hopes of retaining the House and Senate in 2026.\n\n“Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake,” exiled French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once said.\n\nMSNBC’s Chris Hayes, a leading voice among Democrats, is one of the first to deploy the updated political wording. “There is a message of what I would call like common sense, patriotic pluralism,” Hayes told Bill Maher. “Pluralism is another word for diversity.”\n\n“I think there is this sense in which there was this sort of backlash politics,” continued Hayes, acknowledging how conservatives exposed “diversity” as a buzzword for the woke agenda. “If we’re not going to use that one [diversity], let’s use pluralism.”\n\nHayes argued the shift in wording for the same woke ideology can help Democrats win elections. “That’s the thing that I think Democrats can win back a majority of message [with],” he explained.\n\nHayes applied the language of pluralism to his argument for laws allowing transgender mutilation.\n\n“They should mind their own business,” he said of the opponents of transgenderism “If some father and mother have health care for their kid lined up who’s trans, just stay the fuck out of their business … Let them [parents] make that decision.

Time’s latest issue shows Musk sitting behind the Resolute Desk – where President Donald Trump should be positioned in the Oval Office.\n\nIn February of 2017, Time Magazine put White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon on the cover and asked the question: ‘Is Steve Bannon the second most powerful man in the world?’ At the time, Bannon was labeled ‘The Great Manipulator.’\n\nIn April 2017, The New York Times reported that Trump was still annoyed by the cover, telling people ‘that doesn’t just happen,’ a term the president used when talking about underlings overshadowing him. Bannon was out in August of that year.\n\nNow eight years later, Musk’s cover is even more provocative – which prompted uh-ohs from a number of journalists and online observers. Musk, the richest person on the planet, has received just as much attention as Trump since the Republican was sworn back in on January 20th.\n\nDOGE’s early actions – to take a wrecking ball to USAID, are chronicled in Time’s piece about the billionaire’s arrival in Washington. Government employees at the Department of Homeland Security told the magazine how they’re assuming the ‘defensive crouch’ as they wait for DOGE to arrive. In the aftermath of the Time’s cover release, Musk was making his own moves.\n\n‘I love @realdonaldtrump as much as a straight man can love another man,’ he professed on X, the platform he acquired, on Friday morning. In another Friday morning post, he cheered that Trump was the ‘Greatest president ever!’ Musk highlighted a post where Trump said he was going to end the ‘ridiculous Biden push for Paper Straws, which don’t work.’\n\n‘BACK TO PLASTIC!’ Trump wrote. Musk became an ardent MAGA supporter in July, as Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The billionaire SpaceX, Tesla and X boss endorsed Trump and then plowed millions into the Republican’s reelection effort over Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDuring the transition, Musk rarely left Trump’s side – even renting a $2,000-a-night cottage at Mar-a-Lago. During this time period, Vivek Ramaswamy – who has already exited as the co-leader of DOGE – and in turn Musk, started an online war with Bannon and other MAGA traditionalists over the use of H1-B visas. Trump appeared to take the tech entrepreneurs’ side. Musk stirred up some more trouble when he trashed the AI project Stargate, which Trump announced from the White House on January 21, just one day after the inauguration.\n\nThe DOGE leader isn’t a fan of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, one of the three tech leaders involved in the $500 billion project. A Republican close to the White House told Politico that some Trump staff was ‘furious’ at Musk for torching Stargate online. ‘It’s clear he has abused the proximity to the president,’ the Trump ally said. ‘The problem is the president doesn’t have any leverage over him and Elon gives zero [expletive].’ Trump was then asked about it. ‘He hates one of the people in the deal,’ the president shrugged.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Recently he had been on hunger strike to protest against his detention without charge.\n\nHis daughter, who was herself recently released from prison, claimed that he was beaten in the final moments before his release. He had to be carried from the bus to the hospital while connected to a ventilator.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Red Crescent, seven of those being released from Israeli jails needed hospital treatment following their imprisonment. \n\nThere have been numerous reports since 7 October 2023, accusing the Israeli authorities of abusing Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe question now is what impact, if any, Saturday’s releases will have on the fragile ceasefire deal. \n\nIsrael has said it is sending negotiators to Qatar to discuss “technical issues”, before they begin talks around the next phase. It has also warmly welcomed the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza would be emptied of Palestinians.\n\nHamas, meanwhile, has accused Israel of a “lack of commitment” regarding the ceasefire, but said that the group is still ready to join any talks.\n\nHamas also released a slickly produced video of the release of the three hostages.

The company is a founding partner of the New Orleans Super Bowl Host Committee.\n\n'The issue that caused the partial power outage at the beginning of the second half of Super Bowl XLVII was addressed in 2013, and the necessary repairs and upgrades were made at that time,' Entergy told USA Today Sports. 'We discontinued using the protection relay equipment that led to the partial outage.'\n\nWhile the power company seemed to brush away the incident, Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis raised questions about the outage.\n\nLewis helped the Ravens fend off the 49ers, who closed the gap after the lights came back on. That was before Baltimore prevailed, 34-31.\n\nAn old conspiracy theory from the 2013 Super Bowl resurfaced hours before the big game \n\nThe last time the game was in New Orleans, a power outage delayed the action momentarily \n\n'I'm not gonna accuse nobody of nothing — because I don't know facts,' Lewis said after that game, his second Super Bowl win. 'But you're a zillion-dollar company, and your lights go out? No. (Laughs). No way.'\n\nNot long after, Lewis elaborated on his theory about why the outage happened with 13:22 left in the third quarter while the Ravens led, 26-6.\n\n'Now listen, if you grew up like I grew up — and you grew up in a household like I grew up — then sometimes your lights might go out because times get hard. I understand that,' he said.\n\n'But you cannot tell me somebody wasn't sitting there and when they say, 'The Ravens (are) about to blow them out. Man, we better do something.' That's a huge shift in any game, in all seriousness. And as you see how huge it was because it let them right back in the game.'\n\nOn the other hand, Torrey Smith, who caught 35 yards for the Ravens during the game, claimed beliefs among NFL players are not always rooted in facts.\n\n'You think about guys on the team, some of the guys believe the earth is flat,' Smith told USA TODAY Sports. 'So I mean, you're going to hear some crazy things at all times, especially when it happens in that type of moment.'\n\nThe outage came less than two minutes after Jacoby Jones opened the second half with a 108-yard kickoff return - making the timing more suspicious.\n\nSaid Smith, 'I mean, no one had been in a stadium where the power went out and then you have this crazy momentum, and literally Beyoncé just performed (during the halftime show). And the thing that I always remember was Jacoby saying, man, this place didn't even lose power when (Hurricane) Katrina hit. And that stuff was, I was like, oh, you do have a point.'\n\nThe outage naturally sparked fear among fans and media members. Speaking to USA TODAY Sport, Kevin Harlan admitted his colleague Boomer Esiason 'had this look on his face when the lights went out.'\n\nAccording to Harlan, the commentator's fear stemmed from the September 11 terrorist attacks. An office for the Boomer Esiason Foundation on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's North Tower was empty when the hijacked planes crashed into the buildings.\n\nThe blackout happened two minutes after Jacoby Johnson made a 108-yard kickoff return\n\nWhile the 49ers managed to close the gap, the Ravens secured the victory, 34-31, in NOLA\n\nThe prospect of a terrorist attack causing the outage was also a concern in the NFL control room, according to former NFL senior vice president of events, Frank Supovitz. \n\n'The law enforcement team that was up there, the security team that was up there, we're looking after that question,' Supovitz said. 'Did we have a terror attack? Was it a cyber terror attack? Was there a fire? Was there any danger to public safety?\n\n'And happily, the answer to that was very quickly determined to be no.'\n\nA set of generators went off before the lights shut down completely, providing some light into the field as the problem was being fixed behind the scenes.\n\nSideline reporter Solomon Wilcots also said he interacted with Ravens coach John Harbaugh as the players tried to stay loose. He said he pointed across the field at Harbaugh's brother, Jim, then the head coach for the 49ers.\n\n'I said, 'Look at him. He's got his guys over there, man. You better get your guys together and talk to 'em about what to anticipate when this game resumes,'' Wilcots said.\n\nThe conspiracy theory comes as the Chiefs and Eagles gear up to face off at the Superdome for the Lombardi trophy on Sunday. To add suspicion, the Chiefs have been at the center of theories involving them getting a push from the referees toward their third straight Super Bowl title.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWild Super Bowl conspiracy theory reemerges 12 years after last championship game in New Orleans\n\nAdd comment","summary":"As the Super Bowl returns to New Orleans on Sunday, so does an old tale from the last time the Caesars Superdome hosted the big game in 2013.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14376257/super-bowl-theory-reemerges-new-orleans.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/08/22/95010511-0-image-a-190_1739054837955.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:49:47","author":"Editor,Leocciano Callao","authors":["Editor","Leocciano Callao"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":288507898,"title":"Lara Trump is a scene-stealer in glitzy dress for date night with husband Eric following major news","text":"When it comes to bringing glitz and glamor to an event, Lara Trump is somewhat of a poster girl. The 42-year-old looked sensational as she posed alongside her husband, Eric Trump, draped in a sparkly number for a romantic date night.\n\nThe sleeveless black garment featured a high-neckline and a figure-hugging silhouette. The maxi dress was embellished with intricate silver sequins that glistened in the sweet photo. \n\nLara's luscious blonde locks were left down in a sleek straight style while her makeup oozed soft glamor with a shimmery eye, a bronzed cheek, and a glossy lip.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric looked equally suave in a navy tailored suit layered over a crisp white shirt and teamed with a baby blue tie adorned with a white pattern. \n\nThe couple posed for the snap in an opulent room decked out with ivory vintage-inspired sofas, wooden beams, and ornate warm lamp shades. \n\nThe American politician simply captioned the post with two heart emojis. \n\nLara's photograph comes after she announced that she will be joining Fox News with her very own show. President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law will be at the helm of My View with Lara Trump, which will air every Saturday at 9 pm on the news network. \n\nThe exciting news was revealed by the CEO of FOX News Media Suzanne Scott, who praised Lara as a \"gifted communicator\" who \"knows how to connect to the viewers.\" \n\nDiscussing her major career move, Lara said: \"I'm thrilled to bring my voice back to Fox News, talk directly with the American people, and highlight what makes this country so great.\n\n\"As I cover the success of The Golden Age of America, I look forward to where this time will lead our country and where this opportunity will lead me in the future.\" \n\nThe announcement came a few weeks after Eric's wife graced her father-in-law's inauguration ceremony at the United States Capitol.\n\nThe mother-of-two donned a stylish navy ensemble from Rabanne for the occasion. The long, double-breasted coat boasted a skimming silhouette and was crafted from textured chevron. The high-neck garment featured frayed detailing at the cuffs and hem, while being adorned with silver buttons. \n\nFor the evening celebrations, Lara slipped into a glamorous number for the Liberty Inaugural Ball. The former television producer oozed chic in a strapless red gown courtesy of designer Oscar Garcia-Lopez. The bold number boasted a corset bodice and a column skirt that was detailed with a ruffle train.","summary":"Lara Trump is a scene-stealer in a glitzy dress for date night with husband Eric following major news - see pictures.","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/celebrity-style/812914/lara-trump-is-a-scene-stealer-in-glitzy-dress-for-date-night/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c8c4526eec3b-gettyimages-2176802545.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:47:16","author":"Maria Sarabi","authors":["Maria Sarabi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.644},{"id":288517204,"title":"Berisha e militantët braktisin njëri-tjetrin/ Avokati: Nuk jep asnjë shpresë.

To be able to play in front of Donald Trump, that would be something to knock off the bucket list,' the Miami Dolphins star told Fox.\n\n'Not every day you get to play football in front of the guy who people respect and is at the top of the helm of this country.\n\n'I've always been a fan of Donald Trump, by the way.

'I love it. My family loves it. Kids absolutely love being on the beach every morning. So it's an amazing thing, man.\n\n'We are really building something special in Miami. We made it to the playoffs the first two years.

That’s their decision to make, and you don’t have to make that for your family.”\n\n“There’s a majority that understands that, like we all come from different places, and part of what makes this country work is we acknowledge and we negotiate those differences. And that’s the thing that I think Democrats can win back a majority of the message,” he added.\n\nPolitical language is constantly changing. Before Trump’s political rise, for example, conservatives used the phrase “politically correct” to speak about what is now roundly referred to as woke or wokism.\n\nWendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst.

Trump's expected presence sparked an enthusiastic reaction among multiple Kansas City Chiefs players, including Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, and even Gracie Hunt, the daughter of the team's owner. However, one star on the opposing Philadelphia Eagles gave a more lukewarm answer about Trump's attendance. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was asked how he feels about the president attending the game while talking to reporters Tuesday. SIGN UP FOR TUBI AND STREAM SUPER BOWL LIX FOR FREE \"He's welcome to do what he wants,\" Hurts said. When Hurts was asked a follow-up question about whether Trump being there would put more pressure on him, the quarterback responded, \"No.\" Hurts turned down an opportunity to play golf with former President Barack Obama at the end of October. Hurts claimed during a press conference the reason he didn't golf with Obama was because of a clause in his contract that prohibited the quarterback from playing golf. HOW TO WATCH SUPER BOWL LIX BETWEEN CHIEFS, EAGLES STREAMED ON TUBI However, no such clause actually exists in his five-year, $255 million contract. An Eagles spokesperson told The Philadelphia Inquirer there is an unofficial agreement between Hurts and owner Jeffrey Lurie in which the quarterback doesn't become \"golf-obsessed.\" Still, Hurts called Obama an \"all-time leader\" in October. Hurts was not the only Eagles player to address Trump's attendance Sunday. Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata said Tuesday Trump attending was \"cool\" but dismissed it beyond that. \"That's cool, but Donald is not on that field. That's cool, but, again, that's blocking out the noise,\" Mailata said. \"What am I going to do thinking about Donald Trump? How is that going to make me win the game?\" Mahomes and Kelce expressed more excitement for Trump's attendance when they were asked. Kelce called it an \"honor\" earlier this week. \"I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know. And having the president there, you know, it’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool,\" Kelce said. Mahomes gave his thoughts on Trump attending the game to reporters Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president,\" Mahomes said. \"Someone that is at the top position in our country.\" Earlier Wednesday, when Trump was asked who he expected to win the Super Bowl, the president didn't give a definitive answer but alluded to Mahomes' success. \"I don’t want to say, but there’s a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner,\" Trump said when asked which team he's rooting for. While Trump didn't identify Mahomes by name, he has expressed fondness and respect for the quarterback and his wife Brittany in recent months. Mahomes recognized Trump was probably talking about him and gave his thoughts about the cryptic praise from the president. \"It's cool to hear that he's seen me play football and respects the game that I play,\" Mahomes told reporters Wednesday. After the NFL's conference championships wrapped Jan. 26, Trump sent a congratulatory post to the Chiefs on Truth Social, while neglecting the Eagles.

He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Recently he had been on hunger strike to protest against his detention without charge.\n\nHis daughter, who was herself recently released from prison, claimed that he was beaten in the final moments before his release. He had to be carried from the bus to the hospital while connected to a ventilator.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Red Crescent, seven of those being released from Israeli jails needed hospital treatment following their imprisonment. \n\nThere have been numerous reports since 7 October 2023, accusing the Israeli authorities of abusing Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe question now is what impact, if any, Saturday's releases will have on the fragile ceasefire deal. \n\nIsrael has said it is sending negotiators to Qatar to discuss \"technical issues\", before they begin talks around the next phase. It has also warmly welcomed the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza would be emptied of Palestinians.\n\nHamas, meanwhile, has accused Israel of a \"lack of commitment\" regarding the ceasefire, but said that the group is still ready to join any talks.\n\nHamas also released a slickly produced video of the release of the three hostages. Filmed in underground tunnels, apparently learning they are to be released. They speak to the camera, thanking God and then putting on uniforms with their own photos on them.\n\nThe release of the video was soon followed by a statement from the families asking for it not to be broadcast.\n\nFor all the anger about the condition of those being held, there was another conclusion that many have drawn from today. A deal to secure their freedom - and a permanent end to the fighting - cannot come soon enough. \n\nFor in the gaunt, haunted faces of those being freed, was written the cost of delay.","summary":"Concerns were raised over the condition of freed Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners after the latest exchange.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz7124dppo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0db/live/9ac01330-e661-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:24:04","author":"Joe Inwood","authors":["Joe Inwood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":288507934,"title":"Trump ends legal battle over Twitter ban","text":"President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the company formerly known as Twitter appears to be over.\n\nTrump sued the social media platform for banning him in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The move was taken after the African nation had passed a land expropriation law to address racial disparities in land ownership.\n\nIn his order published on Friday, Trump accused Pretoria of “shocking disregard of its citizens’ rights” and claimed that the newly adopted legislation supposedly allows the government to confiscate ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property without compensation.\n\nAfrikaners are descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who had arrived on the territory of modern South Africa back in 17th century. Following the decades of an apartheid regime, which Africa’s most advanced economy dismantled only in 1990s, white farmers still own the majority of land in the country. Pretoria has set a target of transferring 30% of farmland to black farmers by 2030 to address this inequality. \n\nAccording to Trump’s order, the South African government’s policies were supposedly aimed at depriving the white minority of equal employment, education, and business opportunities while fueling violence against “racially disfavored landowners.”\n\nThe presidential decree orders a halt to any aid or assistance to South Africa as long as its “unjust and immoral practices” persist and demands the relevant departments and officials, including the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security “prioritize humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement through the United States Refugee Admissions Program, for Afrikaners in South Africa.”\n\nThe document also criticizes Pretoria over supposedly “undermining United States foreign policy” thus posing a national security threat to Washington, its interests, and its allies. The list of “aggressive positions” taken by South Africa includes accusing Israel of genocide in the International Court of Justice and developing ties with Iran, including “commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.”\n\nThe measures introduced by the executive order are to stay in place as long as South Africa continues “practices that harm” the US, the document said. Washington and Pretoria have already recently clashed over the land ownership law.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has earlier announced his decision to skip a G20 meeting in South Africa later this month, accusing Pretoria of “doing very bad things.” A South African-born billionaire, Elon Musk, who has become Trump’s close advisor, has also branded the legislation “racist.”\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa hit back by saying that his nation would “not be bullied.” He also stated that the world had been witnessing the rise of “nationalism and protectionism, the pursuit of narrow interests” but did not mention the US by its name.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has accused South Africa of racial discrimination over a land ownership law \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612391-trump-offers-resettlement-to-south-africans/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67a7d6a385f5400adc0fc4f4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:15:25","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.039},{"id":288502174,"title":"‘Irreparable harm’: Judge blocks Elon Musk’s DOGE from Treasury data","text":"In an emergency order overnight, US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer cut off DOGE from accessing personal and financial data stored at the Treasury Department, warning there was a risk of “irreparable harm”. \n\nThe temporary restrictive order, which will remain in effect until a hearing on February 14, limits access to the Treasury’s payment systems and “all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside”. \n\nJudge Engelmayer’s order also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department’s records since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president on January 20 must “immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded”. \n\nMORE: Elon Musk’s bizarre move with ex-partner Grimes exposed\n\nMr Musk, the world’s richest person, has been charged with leading the US President’s federal cost-cutting efforts.

Tonight as the UK’s team – all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries and illnesses- entered the stadium a giant screen cut to a shot of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex smiling and waving. Meghan, who wrapped up in a long cream trench coat as she fashionably battled against Canada’s frosty temperatures leaned against her husband, tentatively placing her hand on his arm. The Duchess of Sussex, 43, leaped to the air with glee as the ceremony ensued – and at one point whipped out her phone to capture the energetic atmosphere in the stadium. They sat in front of one of the leaders of the indigenous people on whose land the games are being held in Vancouver and Whistler.Meghan’s attendance is understood to underscore her support for her husband and the mission of Invictus, a cause that is deeply personal to them both.\n\nHer sole focus during these games will be to uplift her husband, the competitors and sharing their stories. \n\nThis years games, which to celebrity service men and women who put their lives on the line for their nations, will include winter sports for the first time ever. \n\nThe games have previously been held in London in 2014, in Orlando in 2016, Toronto in 2017, Sydney in 2018, The Hague in 2022 and Dusseldorf in 2023.\n\nThe opening ceremony began with a parade of nations taking part in the week long event.\n\nGermany, who hosted the 2023 games in Dusseldorf were first to enter the BC Place arena.\n\nTwo competitors from Team Afghan were given a huge cheer, but the loudest noise was reserved for the host nation Canada.\n\nGiant inflatables of a whale and dolphin hovered above the military veterans from the ceiling of the stadium with the sea creatures signifying Vancouver’s links to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAhead of the Invictus games this morning, the charismatic Prince showed off his skills on the dancefloor as he and Meghan Markle ahead of this year’s Invictus Games. \n\nThe Duke of Sussex showed off his dancing skills as he met members of the Canadian team taking part in the Invictus Games.\n\nHe also hugged a female competitor as he and Meghan had a breakfast meeting ahead of the opening ceremony.\n\nThe couple were warmly greeted by the Canadian team with Meghan posting video of the encounter to her Instagram story – complete with Harry seemingly attempting to do the ‘twist’.\n\nHarry and Meghan couldn’t resist handing out hugs as they spent time hearing about how many of the competitors have overcome adversity to make the games.\n\nMeghan has never shied away from showing her support for her home country. At the Dusseldorf games in 2023 she was happy to drape herself in the Stars and Stripes flag.\n\nAides said the couple were able to hear the stories of courage and resilience from competitors taking part in the seventh Invictus Games.\n\nUS Military and Government officials were also at the meeting – but its unlikely President Donald Trump’s less than complimentary remarks about Meghan were raised.\n\nThe meeting with Team Canada was organised by the True Patriot Love organisation who are one of the sponsors of the Vancouver Games.\n\nThe couple famously appeared in public together for the first time at the Toronto Invictus Games in 2017, pictured hand-in-hand at a wheelchair tennis event.\n\nIn 2023, Meghan and Harry cheered on athletes among the crowds at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were sitting side-by-side clapping and also reacting to the game tensely as they watched the wheelchair basketball with Australia supporters.\n\nWhile Meghan is understood to have several projects on the horizon, her family remains her top priority and she is determined to continue to stand together with Harry to support the causes they care about.\n\nThe couple visited Colombia for a four-day tour last August, with the trip focusing on tackling cyber-bullying and online digital violence as well as promoting women’s leadership.\n\nThey also embarked on a three-day visit to Nigeria earlier in 2024 at the invitation of the West African nation’s chief of defense staff.\n\nBritish veterans and serving personnel who were injured during service departed for Canada earlier this week for the games.\n\nThe 62 competitors – all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries and illnesses while serving in the UK Armed Forces – left the country from Birmingham Airport on Thursday.\n\nThe games aim to ‘inspire recovery, support rehabilitation and generate a wider understanding and respect for those who have served their country’, the Royal British Legion said.\n\nAhead of the highly anticipated sporting event, Meghan gave an impromptu speech at a private event for the Games where she divulged she felt ‘at home’ in Canada. \n\nAfter giving her husband an smooch on stage, the Duchess of Sussex began to shower her husband with praise for his dedication to the event. \n\nHighlighting the sporting event’s importance of the event, Meghan told military veterans and their families that they were her husband’s ‘family’.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved to Vancouver Island in 2020 after quitting the royal family in what became known as ‘Megxit’. \n\nMeghan, 43, also lived in Toronto for several years where the Netfix series ‘Suits’ was filmed and famously made their first appearance together as a couple at the 2017 Invictus Games held in the city.\n\nShe said: ‘I was not planning on speaking tonight, and we just arrived, I don’t know, a couple of hours ago, and I touched Canadian soil and I went, oh, it feels like home.’\n\nTurning to Harry she continued: ‘We are just thrilled to be here, and I would be remiss if I didn’t take the opportunity to introduce someone who means a lot to me. And I know he means quite a lot to all of you. You will see him throughout this week.\n\n‘You will see him at the Games.

Costs more to cook the food than it did to buy it.'; 'I think James Martin is wrong about air fryers - It's too expensive to heat up and use a gas or electric oven when cooking a few items,'\n'It's clear he doesn't have to look at or worry about his gas or electric usage...';\n'Ovens cost more to run you idiot, airfryers are much more economical to use, it's called moving with the times!' \nSaturday KitchenJames MartinManchesterBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJames Martin confesses that he has some 'serious' worries as he turns his focus from TV to his UK tour\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nThe Masked Singer semi final: Bush and Bear's identities revealed as a soap icon and a rapper as they narrowly miss out on a place in the grand final\n\nEXCLUSIVEHow Blake Lively REALLY feels about Taylor Swift's Super Bowl 'snub' as insiders reveal her next steps amid It Ends With Us drama\n\nEXCLUSIVEIt's fake news, says Iris Law, as waitress accuses model, 24, of 'Do you know who I am?'

Tens of thousands of Palestinians, including children, have been killed during the Israeli military’s response.\n\nThe order Trump signed on Thursday accuses the ICC of engaging in “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel” and of abusing its power by issuing “baseless arrest warrants” against Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.\n\n“The ICC has no jurisdiction over the US or Israel,” the order states, adding that the court had set a “dangerous precedent” with its actions against both countries.\n\nTrump’s action came as Netanyahu was visiting Washington. He and Trump held talks on Tuesday at the White House, and Netanyahu spent some of Thursday meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe order says the US will impose “tangible and significant consequences” on those responsible for the ICC’s “transgressions.” Actions may include blocking property and assets and not allowing ICC officials, employees and relatives to enter the US.\n\nHuman rights activists said sanctioning court officials would have a chilling effect and run counter to US interests in other conflict zones where the court is investigating.\n\n“Victims of human rights abuses around the world turn to the International Criminal Court when they have nowhere else to go, and President Trump’s executive order will make it harder for them to find justice,” said staff attorney with American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project Charlie Hogle. “The order also raises serious First Amendment concerns because it puts people in the US at risk of harsh penalties for helping the court identify and investigate atrocities committed anywhere, by anyone.” Hogle said the order “is an attack on both accountability and free speech.” “You can disagree with the court and the way it operates, but this is beyond the pale,” Washington director of Human Rights Watch Sarah Yager, said in an interview prior to the announcement.\n\nLike Israel, the US is not among the court’s 124 members and has long harboured suspicions that a global court could arbitrarily prosecute US officials. A 2002 law authorises the Pentagon to liberate any American or US ally held by the court. In 2020, Trump sanctioned chief prosecutor Karim Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, over her decision to open an inquiry into war crimes committed by all sides, including the US, in Afghanistan.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-signs-order-imposing-sanctions-on-icc-over-investigations-of-israel/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P14-AP-1_09022025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:08:59","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":288505382,"title":"State Department Announces $7 Billion Arms Sale, Including Hellfire Missiles and Bombs, to Israel Without Notifying Congress","text":"The State Department announced a $7 billion arms sale, including hellfire missiles and bombs, to Israel without notifying Congress members.\"This move is yet another repudiation by Donald Trump of Congress' rightful and legitimate oversight prerogative,\" Rep.

The state of Hawaii will always put the safety and security of our residents first and foremost.”\n\nThe lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to further his political agenda.\n\nDOGE’s access to the system also “poses huge cybersecurity risks that put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in peril,” the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE’s access.\n\nThe judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the states’ claims were “particularly strong” and warranted him acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing before another judge on Feb. 14.\n\n“That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,” Engelmayer wrote.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE team’s unfettered access to their data.\n\n“We knew the Trump administration’s choice to give this access to unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court agreed,” James said in a statement.\n\n“Now, Americans can trust that Musk – the world’s richest man – and his friends will not have free rein over their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds.”\n\nEngelmayer’s order bars access from being granted to Treasury Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special government employees and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department.\n\nThe judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or downloaded.\n\nThe White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the government. Musk’s efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal workers en masse.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week that the department’s payment system will not be touched by Musk and that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.","summary":"A federal judge early today temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s government efficiency team and Trump administration political appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could be improperly disclosed.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/02/08/breaking-news/u-s-judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-from-accessing-payment-systems/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/web1_20250120_brk_emu01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 22:07:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198}]}
