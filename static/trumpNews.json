In any case, the election in Venezuela was not free and fair – anyway, we have never had a free and fair election in our own country. However, the issue is the legality of the United States’ invasion of Venezuela. Nobody gave the United States the responsibility to go on extractive duties in another country. If you were to do so, even Trump himself should be a target,” he said. \n\nAkinyemi noted that the U.S. President had enormous global influence, enabling him to evade accountability.\n\n“But who goes after the most powerful man in the world and gets away with it?” he asked.\n\nHe urged countries to build their own military capabilities to defend sovereignty. “As countries, you have to build your own military capability to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nProfessor Jinadu Adele described the U.S. intervention as an example of arrogance of power, targeting countries that do not align with its ideology under the guise of promoting democracy.\n\nDr Rita Agu called the arrest illegal under international law. “There should be consent of the people of Venezuela seeking such intervention or a binding approval of an international body before such an intervention. The U.S. should compensate Venezuela for the invasion,” she said.\n\nInternational relations expert Femi Ojumu said the U.S. abduction violated the UN Charter, particularly Article 2 on sovereign equality.\n\n“These principles are recurring themes throughout the UN Charter of 1945 and remain the glue that holds international relations together… Article 51 on collective self-defence could not justify U.S. actions, questioning what exactly was being defended,” he said.\n\nOjumu warned that the U.S., by acting as abductor, detainer, prosecutor, judge, and jury, violated the principle of nemo judex in causa sua. He called for UN reforms to make Security Council membership and veto powers more representative.\n\nProfessor Femi Otubanjo described the U.S. approach as ideologically driven, motivated by Trump’s political relevance, arms sales, and access to Venezuelan crude oil. Journalist Kayode Komolafe echoed concerns over capitalist tendencies and U.S. targeting of Nigeria’s crude under similar pretenses.\n\nPublic policy analyst Magnus Onyibe lamented that the U.S. disregard for UN rules signals the imminent decline of the organisation: “The U.S. can’t be checked,” he said.\n\nFormer Director of Political Affairs at ECOWAS, Prof Remi Ajibewa, and ex-Permanent Secretary in Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Joe Keshi, warned that excessive reliance on the U.S. empowers it to flout international law. Keshi said, “As a result, they feel emboldened to violate rules,” urging countries to develop capacity, enforce domestic laws, and prioritise citizens’ welfare.","summary":"South African President Ramaphosa and Nigerian scholars condemn Maduro&#8217;s capture by the U.S., calling it a violation of international law and sovereignty.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/ramaphosa-nigerian-scholars-slam-trump-over-maduros-capture/","url":"https://punchng.com/ramaphosa-nigerian-scholars-slam-trump-over-maduros-capture/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20175826/AFP__20251120__84LB3BY__v1__MidRes__SafricaBrazilG20SocialSummit-1200x630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 23:40:53","author":"Emmanuel Croset,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Emmanuel Croset","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.009},{"id":391605094,"title":"Divisions in South Africa unity government over Maduro toppling","text":"JOHANNESBURG — President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday voiced South Africa's opposition to the US military operation against deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as divisions emerged within his national unity government over the country's reaction.The United States' strike on Caracas and capture of Maduro on Saturday stunned the world, drawing praise and condemnation from Washington allies and foes alike.Parties within South Africa's unity government reacted differently, some accusing Ramaphosa's ANC of presenting its strong condemnation as the national response.South Africa is itself under pressure from the Trump administration over a range of policy differences, with relations plummeting last year and Pretoria seeking to avoid US trade tariffs of 30 percent.Washington boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa in November and has barred Pretoria's participation under its own presidency of the group of leading economies.Speaking in front of a Venezuelan flag at a commemoration for a late anti-apartheid activist, Ramaphosa said South Africa was concerned by the US aggression and demanded the release of the deposed leader and his wife.\"We reject utterly the actions that the United States has embarked upon and stand with the people of Venezuela,\" Ramaphosa said, urging \"decisive action\" from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).Earlier in the day, his ANC party called on \"progressive forces\" to \"mobilise against the American imperialist aggression\".The second-largest party in the unity government, the Democratic Alliance (DA), accused the ANC of inconsistency and hypocrisy for failing to take a similar stance on Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.It said a foreign ministry statement critical of the US action showed the department had been \"politicised to pursue party political interests instead of pursuing foreign policy in the national interest\".The right-wing Afrikaner Freedom-Front Plus also criticised the foreign ministry's statement as \"unilateral ANC action\".It welcomed the toppling of Maduro, calling it \"the end of the socialist failure\".'Period of might'Pretoria and Washington have fallen out over issues including South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice, the UN's top court.President Donald Trump has accused South Africa of alleged discrimination -- and even \"genocide\" -- of minority white Afrikaners and invited them to move to the United States.William Gumede, professor of public management at the University of Witwatersrand, said the ANC was misreading Trump and its leaders risked sanctions from Washington.\"We are now in a period of might is right. The countries most powerful, can essentially do what they want to do,\" he said.\"If Trump now turns against South Africa, it will crash South Africa's economy,\" he said, urging the country to be more strategic about its relations with Washington.For 30 years after white-minority rule was replaced by democracy, the ANC held an absolute majority and elected a president from its own ranks.It was forced into a coalition government after losing its majority in the 2024 elections amid anger over corruption and mismanagement, and against a backdrop of high crime rates, slow economic growth and a crippling energy crisis.","url":"https://www.newvision.co.ug/category/world/divisions-in-south-africa-unity-government-ov-NV_225806","image":"https://newvision-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/6df60897-54b5-4906-b81e-57f408dfc9e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 21:56:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ug","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":391605090,"title":"US Capitol riot anniversary exposes a country still divided","text":"WASHINGTON - Washington on Tuesday marks five years since a mob overran the US Capitol, with rioters pardoned by Donald Trump retracing their steps even as Democrats revive hearings to hold the president accountable.The anniversary highlights a nation divided between irreconcilable accounts of an attack that reshaped American politics -- one supported by official findings of a violent bid to overturn an election, the other portraying it as a protest unjustly criminalised.\"Five years ago today, a violent mob brutally attacked the US Capitol on January 6. Their mission was to overturn a free and fair election. We will never allow extremists to whitewash their treachery,\" top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries posted on X.Trump supporters gathered in Washington on January 6 2021, after the president urged them to protest Congress's certification of his election defeat to Joe Biden.Several thousand breached the Capitol grounds, overwhelming police lines and wounding more than 140 officers, smashing windows and doors, ransacking offices and forcing lawmakers into hiding as the electoral count was halted for hours.Inside the Capitol on Tuesday, House Democrats convened an unofficial hearing featuring police, former lawmakers and civilians who experienced the violence firsthand.Many involved in the original congressional investigation say the aim is not to relitigate the past but to prevent it from being erased -- particularly after Trump returned to office and pardoned nearly all defendants charged in connection with the attack.Normalising political violenceA new Democratic report documents dozens of pardoned rioters later charged with new crimes, and the party warns that the clemency risks normalizing political violence.Outside the building Trump supporters, including figures linked to the far-right Proud Boys, staged a march retracing the route taken by rioters in 2021.The event is being promoted by the group's former leader Enrique Tarrio, who was serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy before Trump pardoned him.Organizers say it will honor those who died, including pro-Trump rioter Ashli Babbitt, and protest what they describe as excessive force by police and politically motivated prosecutions.The competing events mirror a broader political dispute, with Democrats saying Trump incited the attack to overturn the election. Republicans reject that view, instead citing security failures and criticising the Justice Department.Trump alluded briefly to the riot in remarks at a House Republican strategy retreat, accusing Democrats and the media of misrepresenting his role in the violence.Republican leaders have dismissed Tuesday's hearing as partisan and have shown little appetite for formal commemoration.House Speaker Mike Johnson, an unswerving Trump ally, has yet to install a plaque honouring Capitol Police officers who defended the building that day, despite a federal law requiring it.And Republican investigator Barry Loudermilk has argued that January 6 has been used to advance a political narrative against Trump and his allies.The anniversary arrives against the backdrop of unresolved legal and historical questions.Former special counsel Jack Smith has said the attack would not have occurred without Trump, but abandoned the federal case after the Republican leader's reelection, in line with Justice Department policy barring prosecution of a sitting president.Trump was impeached soon after the riot by the Democratic-controlled House but acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.","url":"https://www.newvision.co.ug/category/world/us-capitol-riot-anniversary-exposes-a-country-NV_225803","image":"https://newvision-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/3a8137ca-3167-40cc-b251-b491423aa277.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 20:58:00","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"ug","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":391604830,"title":"UK, France, Ukraine Ink Declaration on Multinational Force in Ukraine","text":"France, the UK and Ukraine signed a declaration of intent on Tuesday for deploying a multinational force in Ukraine backed for the first time by the US as part of a potential peace deal.\n\nZelensky, European leaders, US envoys and other allies met in Paris on Jan. 6 to discuss finalizing “robust” security guarantees for Kyiv.\n\nThe joint declaration inked by Britain’s Sir Keir Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron and President Volodymyr Zelensky will see Britain and France setting up “military hubs” across Ukraine to facilitate boots on the ground if needed and to assist with post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe US for the first time has offered “to support the force in case of attack,” in a development that has been described by European leaders as game-changing.\n\nIn a post on X after the meeting, Zelensky said that allies had made detailed plans on “force deployment, numbers, specific types of weapons, and the components of the Armed Forces required and able to operate effectively.”\n\n“We already have these necessary details,” he added, without disclosing them.\n\nGermany, which has signalled strong support from Ukraine but has been more cautious about putting boots on the ground, said that it could deploy its forces to a neighbouring NATO territory.\n\nMeanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ruled out Italian troops on the ground outright once again.\n\n“This is a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term.

Delta Force entered Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, to capture President Nicolás Maduro at his compound. At 6:31 a.m., Trump confirmed the mission was successful.\n\nBudd was visiting with family when his team alerted him to the attack.\n\n“I was very supportive of it,” the North Carolina Republican told McClatchy in an exclusive interview.\n\nBudd said Maduro has been using cocaine as his “cash cow” and his willingness to work with Hamas, Iran, China and Russia was concerning. He added that, though it happened before he was born, he worried about a new version of the Cuban Missile Crisis, in which the Soviet Union secretly placed nuclear missiles near the United States in Cuba.\n\n“Do you want that to happen in our backyard again?” Budd asked. “And it certainly could have, if you let that mix develop, so I think it’s in the interest of national security that President Trump made a very bold but rational decision.”\n\nCongressional briefings\n\nBudd said he immediately began monitoring the news Saturday and watched as the rest of the world caught up with the information he now had. Then he called his sources within the Senate.\n\nBudd serves on the Senate Committee on Armed Services, which has oversight authority over the military.\n\nOn Monday, leadership from the Senate and House armed services committees and the Gang of Eight, which includes leadership from both chambers, plus the chair and top Democrats from both chamber’s intelligence committees, met with the Trump administration to be briefed on the attack.\n\nBudd was not part of those meetings but said briefings for the rest of Congress should follow midweek.\n\n“Our job is to hold them accountable and, I think, they did the right thing in this case,” Budd said. “I’m very supportive of what President Trump did.

The New York Times reported that more than 80 people were killed in the attack, including members of the Cuban military and intelligence community. None were American.\n\nBudd, a former House member, also said he understands why the Trump administration did not tell Congress about the attacks ahead of time.\n\n“I’ve been in the congressional auditorium with 435 members of Congress, or 100 senators, and if you were on that side of the table, you would not want to brief that room,” Budd said. “I would trust me, and I would not trust everybody in that room.

The talks in Paris on Tuesday will focus on how to integrate capabilities recently proposed by Washington with plans drawn up by the so-called coalition of the willing that’s made up of Ukraine’s allies, according to people familiar with the matter.French President Emmanuel Macron will host the meeting, which comes after a series of discussions between national security advisers over the last month. The US will be represented by President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the people added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, other European leaders, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Top NATO military official Alexus Grynkewich, who also leads US forces in Europe, will also be in attendance.It is unclear what role US troops would play or where they would be stationed in the event of a peace agreement with Russia. European nations have discussed deploying a multinational “reassurance force,” with Ukraine’s army leading its defense at the front line. The US is also willing to help monitor a ceasefire, including by providing intelligence, the people said. Drones and satellites would be used to identify breaches, they added.European officials said their latest discussions with American counterparts were positive and that the current status of the proposed security guarantees was in a good place. One described the US offer of intelligence and troops as a game-changer. Another said it much more closely resembled the so-called American backstop sought by European nations over the last year.The aim of the recent meetings between US, European and Ukrainian officials has been to finalize an agreement on security guarantees. It remains unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to the proposals. Ukraine’s allies will push for Russian participation after an agreement on security is reached with the US, one of the people said.Other key sticking points remain, especially on territory, where Moscow is seeking the full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region of the country — something Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rejected.Zelenskiy told reporters over the weekend that the Paris meeting will “talk over the final details” of security guarantees. Kyiv and its European allies have insisted a strong deterrent is needed to ensure that Russia doesn’t attack Ukraine again after a peace deal is reached.Zelenskiy said he’s asked Trump for security guarantees that could cover a period as long as half a century. Current proposals set out a 15-year term with the possibility of an extension.Ukraine hopes to set up a meeting in the US at the leaders’ level by the end of January, he added.Bloomberg previously reported that Ukraine’s allies were seeking a tiered approach to security guarantees.

Columbia is very sick too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,” Trump said, in seeming reference to Colombian President Gustavo Petro. “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.”\n\nWhen one reporter asked, “So there would be an operation by the US?”, Trump replied, “Sounds good to me.”\n\nPetro’s administration has long touted its efforts to crack down on cocaine trafficking, by destroying laboratories where the drug is produced and intercepting shipments.\n\nLast November, Petro celebrated what his government called the largest cocaine seizure in a decade, with 14 tonnes, worth nearly $388.9m, confiscated as it reached Buenaventura’s port on the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThere is no evidence that Petro himself is involved in any narcotics trafficking, despite Trump’s claims to the contrary.\n\nHe and Trump, however, have long exchanged barbs, with Petro criticising the Republican leader for his hardline immigration policies, his support for Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, and his deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.\n\nTrump has responded by taking action against Petro, stripping the Colombian president of his US visa in September and sanctioning him in October.\n\nEscalating rhetoric\n\nPetro is the first left-wing president to lead Colombia’s government, and his term ends in 2026.\n\nHe has denounced the US attack on Venezuela and warned that Latin America must unite to avoid being treated as “a servant and a slave” to foreign interests.\n\n“The US is the first country in the world to bomb a South American capital in all of human history,” Petro wrote on Sunday.\n\n“What a terrible distinction that is, because South Americans will not forget it for generations. The wound remains open for a long time.”\n\nHe later made reference to his time as a rebel fighter during his teens and 20s, when he participated in Colombia’s six-decade-long internal armed conflict. He suggested he would take up arms again if Colombia faced foreign attack.\n\n“I swore not to touch another weapon since the 1989 peace agreement, but for the sake of the homeland, I will take up arms again, even though I don’t want to,” Petro posted on social media.\n\nFor her part, Villavicencio has emphasised in a statement that Colombia is addressing drug trafficking with “rigour, sacrifice, and a comprehensive approach”.\n\nOn Tuesday, she added that her ministry rejects any threats against Latin American sovereignty, as well as towards Colombia’s democratically elected president.\n\n“An offence against the president is an offence against our country and a disregard for all the democratic processes that we have carried out,” she said.\n\nShe is slated to meet members of the US Department of State later in the day.","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/colombian-minister-warns-of-military-response-to-any-foreign-aggression/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2025-10-20T140523Z_888092358_RC2QDHAHXFOK_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-COLOMBIA-1767715941-XB3PPl.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 19:06:00","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":391603928,"title":"Trump cuts off $10B in funding to blue states over alleged fraud","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air January 06, 2026 07:25 \n\n Trump cuts off $10B in funding to blue states over alleged fraud \n 'The Big Money Show' reacts to President Donald Trump's sweeping freeze of federal social services funding to California, New York and other blue states over alleged fraud.\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSV-VIDEOS","summary":"&apos;The Big Money Show&apos; reacts to President Donald Trump&apos;s sweeping freeze of federal social services funding to California, New York and other blue states over alleged fraud.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6387308798112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/c408e5b0-8061-43e6-b628-04485e2a7e8f/986cfe17-e681-4212-af9a-ccbfe936f562/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 19:01:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":391604286,"title":"Petro calls on Colombians to defend sovereignty amid Trump threats","text":"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called for a nationwide mobilization Wednesday and urged citizens to \"defend sovereignty,\" responding to statements by the U.S. President Donald Trump that in Colombia have been widely interpreted as threats of intervention and direct attacks against the head of state.\n\nThe call, posted by Petro on X and echoed by government officials and political allies, urges rallies in public squares across the country starting at 4 p.m. local time, with the main protest planned for Bogota's Plaza de Bolivar, the historic square that houses Colombia's main government institutions. Petro said he will address the crowd.\n\nThe escalation follows remarks by Trump in which he referred to Petro in disparaging terms, accused him of backing drug production and left open the possibility of military action, according to reports by Colombian media.\n\nIn recent comments, Trump said a military operation against Colombia \"sounds good,\" following a U.S. military incursion in Venezuela. He also accused Petro of links to drug trafficking and said Colombia is \"very sick.\"\n\nPetro publicly rejected the accusations and framed the dispute as a matter of national sovereignty. He said he would carefully assess the scope of Trump's words before issuing a broader response but insisted that dialogue should be \"the first path\" and defended the legitimacy of his government.\n\n\"Although I have not been a soldier, I know about war and clandestinity. I swore not to touch a weapon again after the 1989 peace pact, but for the homeland, I would take up arms again, which I do not want,\" Petro wrote, referring to the agreement that led to the demobilization of the M-19 guerrilla movement in which he once participated.\n\n\"I am not illegitimate, nor am I a drug trafficker. I own only my family home, which I am still paying for with my salary. My bank statements have been made public. No one has been able to say I have spent more than my salary.

He warned of the risks of military escalation and reiterated that the armed forces must follow their constitutional mandate to defend sovereignty.\n\nThe episode unfolds amid regional upheaval linked to Venezuela's crisis and rising diplomatic tensions in Latin America.\n\nAccording to daily El Tiempo, the situation has pushed Petro's government to return to street mobilization as a political tool while Bogota seeks to manage relations with Washington without losing internal control.","summary":"Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for a nationwide mobilization and urged citizens to \"defend sovereignty in light of Donald Trump's threats.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2026/01/06/latam-colombia-nationawide-mobilization/6911767724622/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/6911767724622/2026/1/17677258217095/v1.5/Petro-calls-on-Colombians-to-defend-sovereignty-amid-Trump-threats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 18:59:45","author":"Macarena Hermosilla","authors":["Macarena Hermosilla"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":391604284,"title":"Rep.

Kentucky has been a firmly Republican-leaning state, voting more than 65% for Trump in 2024.\n\nAlabama voted similarly in 2024, with about 64% of votes going to Trump. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., is ending his time in the Senate to run for state governor.\n\nLike Tuberville, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., will leave the Senate to run for governor of their respective states. Bennet has been a senator since 2009 while Blackburn entered the chamber in 2019.\n\nOf the senators not running for re-election, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is leaving open a seat that is considered to be the most competitive. Ernst has been a senator since 2015.\n\nRepublicans are backing Rep. Ashley Hinson to take Ernst's seat. Hinson was elected to the U.S. House in 2020.\n\nThree candidates are in the Democratic primary seeking to challenge Hinson in November: state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek and Nathan Sage, a military veteran.\n\nWahls was the youngest Iowa Senate Democratic Leader, serving in that role from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe race for an open seat in North Carolina features former Gov. Roy Cooper on the ticket for the Democratic Party. Cooper served two terms as governor.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley has earned the endorsement of Trump but he is being challenged in the primary by Michele Morrow. She ran an unsuccessful campaign for North Carolina's superintendent of public instruction in 2024 and has never held public office.\n\nNorth Carolina has historically been a tightly contested state. Trump earned about 50% of the vote there in 2024. Prior to that, the last time a presidential candidate received 50% of votes was 2012 when Mitt Romney received 50.4%.\n\nNorth Carolina's Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 2014. Kay Hagan was a state senator from 2009 to 2015 before being succeeded by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Tillis is retiring at the end of the term.\n\nThe Democratic Party has tapped former Sen. Sherrod Brown to attempt a return to the chamber in 2026 after he lost a bid for re-election in 2024 to Republican Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown has launched a campaign to challenge Sen. Jon Husted, the Republican who was appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance's seat that he vacated when Trump was elected president.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., is running for re-election in a state won by Trump in 2024. Three Republicans have entered their party's primary to challenge Ossoff: Rep. Buddy Carter, Rep. Mike Collins and former college and pro football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has given Dooley his endorsement.\n\nGeorgia's 6th Congressional District re-elected Democrat Lucy McBath to the House in 2024 by nearly 50 points over her Republican challenger. Democrats hold both of the state's Senate seats.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, will be challenged in 2026 but who will be on the other side of the ticket will not be known until the Democratic primary in June. Collins represents a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried by about seven points in 2024.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills and military veteran Graham Platner are campaigning in the Democratic primary.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn is running for re-election but will first have to win a contested Republican primary. Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has been a key figure in Texas' redistricting battle and often opponent to Biden administration policies, will challenge Cornyn, along with Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nIn another battleground state, the retirement of Democratic Sen. Gary Peters will leave the race for a Michigan Senate seat open.\n\nFormer congressman Mike Rogers is expected to be on the ticket for Republicans after receiving an endorsement from Trump. Three candidates have entered the Democratic primary: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and physician Abdul El-Sayed.\n\nCongresspeople seeking new offices\n\nSeveral members of Congress are running for different offices outside of the House chambers, including 11 running for governor. Meanwhile 18 members of the House are retiring, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans running for governor in their respective states include Iowa Rep. Randy Feenstra, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace.\n\nRep Chip Roy, R-Texas, will not run for re-election as he will try to succeed Paxton as his state's attorney general.\n\nNew Mexico's 2nd Congressional District is held by Democrat Gabriel Vasquez but was won by Trump in 2024. New Mexico has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 2008.\n\nVasquez faces a challenge from Republicans Greg Cunningham, a veteran of the U.S. Marines and former Albuquerque police officer. Cunningham ran for a seat in the state legislature in 2024 and lost.\n\nArizona's 6th Congressional District seat, held by Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, had several Democrats looking to challenge Ciscomani in November.\n\nSome candidates have begun dropping out of the Democratic primary as 2026 has arrived. JoAnna Mendoza, a military veteran, and engineer Chris Donat remain in the race. Mendoza has vastly outraised Donat, tallying $1.9 million in receipts compared to Donat's $21,061, according to Federal Elections Commission data.\n\nTrump won Arizona in 2024 with about 52% of the vote.\n\nColorado's newest seat, District 8, is held by Republican Rep. Gabe Evans. He represents the district located in the northern Denver area after flipping the seat for Republicans in 2024.\n\nEvans has a new challenger in the Republican primary as of November with former Air Force cadet and current Colorado Army Reserve Capt. Adam DeRito filing to run against him.\n\nDeRito has been in a long legal battle with the U.S. Air Force which expelled him hours before he was set to graduate in 2010. He was denied a diploma for allegedly violating academy rules by fraternizing with a subordinate. DeRito claims these allegations were retaliation for him reporting sexual assaults at the academy.\n\nThe Democratic primary is set to feature five candidates, former state legislator Shannon Bird, state lawmaker Manny Rutinel, Marine veteran Evan Munsing, Denis Abrate and self-proclaimed former Republican John Francis Szemler.\n\nMichigan is one of the biggest battleground states in 2026 with three seats expected to feature close races, along with an open Senate seat.\n\nDistrict 7, held by Republican Tom Barrett, has flipped in consecutive elections. Barrett, a U.S. Army veteran, will seek re-election with seven Democrats declared for their primary. He assumed the seat after Democrat Elissa Slotkin ran for and was elected to the Senate.\n\nAmong the Democrats vying to challenge Barrett is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Michigan State professor Josh Cowen and William Lawrence, the founder of nonprofit environmental advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement.\n\nDistrict 10 will feature an open election as Rep. John James, a Republican, enters the state gubernatorial race.\n\nFEC campaign data shows a field of six Democrats seeking their party's nomination. Eric Chung, a former U.S. Department of Commerce official under the Biden administration, has raised the most out of any candidate, followed by Republican Robert Lulgjuraj, a former county prosecutor.\n\nAfter some delay, District 4 Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican, announced last month that he will seek re-election. Four Democrats have filed to appear in the primary, including state Sen. Sean McCann.","summary":"The 2026 midterm elections are coming later this year with 33 seats in the U.S. Senate and all 435 House seats on ballots across the country.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2026/01/06/2026-midterm-elections-house-senate-preview/4231767711258/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4231767711258/2026/1/9539d9099f4e7c96c8b6bab19a90912e/v1.5/2026-midterm-preview-Key-races-in-US-House-Senate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:35:28","author":"Joe Fisher","authors":["Joe Fisher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":391604262,"title":"Rep.

The exchange of subsidized oil for medical and security services allowed Havana to sustain its economy after the Soviet collapse and cushion the impact of the U.S. embargo.\n\nMaduro's fall and the prospect of a regime change in Caracas directly disrupt that balance and place Cuba in a position of heightened economic and political vulnerability.\n\nIn the days after the Venezuelan leader's arrest, the Cuban government responded with a mix of public gestures of support, internal political mobilization and tighter security.\n\nOn Saturday, President Miguel Díaz-Canel led a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in Havana, where he said Cuba was prepared to defend its alliance with Venezuela \"even at a very high cost.\"\n\nThe next day, the government decreed two days of national mourning in response to events in Venezuela. Senior officials dominated state television broadcasts to reinforce the idea of a \"shared homeland\" and a historic resistance to adversity.\n\nThe official narrative sought to counter statements by U.S. President Donald Trump, who publicly warned that allies of chavismo would face direct consequences.\n\nSpeaking about the island nation just 90 miles from Key West, Fla., Trump said, \"Cuba is ready to fall ... going down for the count,\" while aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, according to diplomatic sources, Cuban authorities stepped up surveillance at strategic facilities and convened emergency meetings. At the same time, reports of prolonged blackouts multiplied across several provinces -- a concrete sign of the fragility of the energy system, as Venezuelan assistance could disappear or be sharply reduced within weeks.\n\nCuba's energy crisis stems from a combination of obsolete infrastructure, chronic lack of maintenance and fuel shortages.\n\nMost electricity generation depends on decades-old thermoelectric plants that are frequently offline due to breakdowns. Limited alternative capacity forces the state to rely on floating plants and diesel generators, whose operation depends on imports the country cannot secure due to a lack of hard currency or the loss of free supplies from traditional allies such as Venezuela.\n\nVenezuelan lawyer and former prosecutor Zair Mundaray told UPI that for decades, Cuba depended entirely on Venezuelan oil, and that the collapse of Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., Venezuela's state‑owned oil and gas company, which started around 2014, broke that anchor. That left the island exposed to more frequent blackouts and a deeper economic downturn.\n\n\"In that vacuum, Mexico's assistance emerged,\" Mundaray said.\n\nPress reports indicate that during the peak years of cooperation with Cuba, Caracas sent between 90,000 and 120,000 barrels per day. Since 2023, the Mexican state has shipped hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude and diesel to Cuba in operations valued at more than $300 million.\n\nFor economic historian Leandro Morgenfeld at the University of Buenos Aires, one of the objectives of U.S. intervention in Venezuela is to deepen Cuba's isolation.\n\n\"The United States sees the Western Hemisphere as its exclusive domain. It will not accept the presence of extra-hemispheric forces and is willing to remove governments if it believes its interests or national security are at risk,\" Morgenfeld said.\n\nFrom that perspective, he added, the goal goes beyond Venezuela and seeks to dismantle the political and economic ties that sustain adversarial governments in the region, including Cuba.\n\n\"That is why they want to cut the political and economic link with Venezuela and further suffocate the island. Despite the blockade, they aim to intensify financial pressure to achieve what they have pursued for decades: the fall of the Cuban revolutionary government,\" he said.\n\nMorgenfeld said concern in Havana is real and deep. Cuba has faced a complex economic situation for years, marked by sanctions, lack of hard currency and low productivity.\n\n\"It is no longer, as in other times, an economy with easy sources of financing. If chavismo were to fall, the impact on Cuba would be very severe, economically and politically,\" he said, while noting that a full regime change in Venezuela has not yet occurred.\n\nFrom another angle, Colombian political scientist Christian Arias Barona said it is premature to anticipate an immediate collapse of the Cuban model.\n\nHe told UPI that as long as Delcy Rodríguez remains in power and U.S. hostility does not intensify, an abrupt shift is unlikely.\n\n\"Cuba would not face a drastic alteration in its economy or international relations, especially in its ties with Venezuela, from which it receives significant assistance, particularly in energy,\" Arias Barona said. \"Nor would its links with Russia and China be immediately affected.\"\n\nHe recalled that Cuba's recent history reflects an ability to adapt to adverse scenarios. Since the 1959 revolution, the island has faced what he described as constant \"aggressions and hostilities\" from the United States, including the ongoing economic embargo.\n\n\"That experience has allowed it to develop mechanisms of political and diplomatic survival,\" he said.\n\nArias Barona also noted that the U.N. General Assembly has repeatedly voted against the U.S. embargo on Cuba, calling it a unilateral measure without backing in international law.\n\nHowever, he said the United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has maintained its position and secured occasional support, including from Israel and, in recent votes, Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay.\n\n\"What we are seeing today is a situation that increases Cuba's vulnerability,\" he said.\n\nSociologist Luis Wainer, also an academic at the University of Buenos Aires, agreed it is too early to project definitive scenarios.\n\n\"We do not know whether there will be a change in the political and economic model, how such a transition would look or even whether a transition will exist,\" he told UPI.\n\n\"We are at a moment of negotiations, where what will be defined is who manages to impose the conditions,\" he said.\n\nWainer said strong interest exists in framing this moment as a return to the Special Period, the severe economic and social crisis that began in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main ally and supplier, and resulted in extreme shortages of fuel, food and medicine.\n\n\"There is a tendency to think Cuba will return to that scenario, but Cuban experience itself shows the country has developed creative responses to sustain itself without surrendering sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nThose responses include selective openings to new trade schemes, agreements with strategic sectors in other countries and the promotion of activities such as international tourism.\n\nIn that context, he highlighted the political and economic impact of Latin America's leftward shift following Hugo Chávez's electoral victory in 1998.\n\n\"That progressive cycle was a key lifeline for Cuba,\" Wainer said. \"It enabled regional integration, political cooperation and economic agreements that were fundamental for the island, especially with Venezuela.\"","summary":"Cuba is navigating another delicate moment in its recent history after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces Saturday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2026/01/06/cuba-cuba-future-after-Maduro/3791767717576/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/3791767717576/2026/1/17677194608636/v1.5/Cuba-faces-new-challenge-after-Maduros-fall.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:12:36","author":"Banyeliz Mu","authors":["Banyeliz Mu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.053},{"id":391603936,"title":"Venezuelan-American issues challenge to Maduro capture critics: 'Come talk to our community'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nVarney Co January 06, 2026 03:50 \n\n Venezuelan-American issues challenge to Maduro capture critics: 'Come talk to our community' \n South Florida Venezuelan-American Luis Valdez-Jimenez addresses criticism of the Maduro capture and President Donald Trump's plan for Venezuela on 'Varney & Co.'\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSVARNEY| LATEST EPISODESVARNEY AND COV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"South Florida Venezuelan-American Luis Valdez-Jimenez addresses criticism of the Maduro capture and President Donald Trump&apos;s plan for Venezuela on &apos;Varney &amp; Co.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6387303142112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/8bed4574-c035-41ae-9024-1ebd1c6fe52c/301b876b-73da-4124-b211-e065627badd0/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:10:17","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.25},{"id":391604366,"title":"Trump's tough talk evokes a return to the days of American imperialism","text":"By AAMER MADHANI\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn’t minced words about the larger message he’s trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” Trump declared following Maduro’s capture, “will never be ...","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/06/trump-american-imperialism/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Trump_18143_f56de5-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:06:30","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.322},{"id":391604386,"title":"Trump says the US 'needs' Greenland for Arctic security.

Her loyalty to the Maduro regime notwithstanding, she’d be best positioned to shepherd through the US plan to restore Venezuela to its glory days as an oil gusher, argued executives and lobbyists.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s inner circle came to the same conclusion, though people familiar with the matter say they did so independently. Both groups believed that the vice-president, long seen as a bridge between the government and private sector, could stabilise Venezuela’s oil-based economy and facilitate US business faster than leading dissident María Corina Machado could, said the people.\n\nAdministration officials were mindful of the chaos that ensued in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Business interests aside, maintaining a semblance of business continuity will be critical to a successful transition – one that the Trump administration has yet to define. And Rodríguez fits both those bills: she oversees Venezuela’s oil apparatus and has decades of relationships among the remaining socialist stronghold in government.\n\nThe advocates for Rodríguez didn’t directly include the biggest US oil majors, who were surprised by the removal of Maduro and are still racing to figure out how to work with Washington on next steps, according to people familiar with the matter. But there’s a wider universe of US and international companies that have operated in Venezuela for years, and many have contacts in the White House and on Capitol Hill, the people said.\n\nA spokesperson for Chevron Corp, the only major US oil company licensed to operate in Venezuela, said it “had no advance notice of the recent operation and did not engage in any discussions with administration officials regarding governance for a post-Maduro Venezuela.” It also said operations in the country were continuing uninterrupted and in full compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nIn a triumphal press conference Saturday, Trump endorsed Rodríguez to lead Venezuela for now. Machado, he said, lacked “respect” to lead the country, a stunning blow to the recent Nobel Peace Prize winner and the regime opponents at home and abroad who have pinned their hopes on her.\n\nThe White House declined to comment beyond remarks made Sunday by US Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio, who is playing a key role in managing Venezuela. He said that the US would leverage its oil blockade and regional military presence to further its policy goals. He also said the US would watch Rodríguez’s actions more than her rhetoric. \n\nIn a Bloomberg Television appearance Monday, Greylock Capital Management Chief Executive Hans Humes, who is part of the creditor committee of Venezuela’s sovereign debt, reiterated what some global oil executives have said in private regarding Rodríguez: “If you want somebody who can operate in reasonably OK conditions, get the person who operated in the worst conditions,” he said. \n\nHe added that Trump was making a big gamble, one that if successful, could “reorder the entire energy configuration of the world.”\n\nGlobal oil interests\n\nOil companies with interests in Venezuela, home to some of the world’s largest hydrocarbon reserves, now want to make sure that the Trump administration swiftly eases those sanctions to ensure that Rodríguez can start delivering results. There is no time to waste, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. \n\nIn late December, Venezuela had already started closing oil wells because it had run out of storage to hold production stranded by the blockade. More shut-ins would make it harder for Venezuela to recover its economy and jeopardize Rodríguez’s hold on power, the sources said.\n\nSo far she looks to be consolidating control on the regime’s existing foundations. On Monday, she was sworn in by the National Assembly as acting president. In a fiery speech on Saturday, she described Maduro’s capture as a “kidnapping” and called for his return, but the sources said they believe her rhetoric was meant to shield her from internal reprisals. \n\nOn Sunday, she took a more conciliatory tone, inviting the US to “to work together on a cooperation agenda, aimed at shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”\n\nRodríguez, 56, had been a key figure in Maduro’s tight inner circle, heading a string of key portfolios including the Foreign Ministry that enabled her to build international bridges. She was named oil minister in 2024 after Maduro’s widely contested reelection, putting her in charge of the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA, with the task of cleaning up corruption and bringing more transparency to the bloated firm’s accounts.\n\nAn accomplished table-tennis player, Rodríguez regularly fields calls from senior executives at international oil companies, from Houston to Mumbai, and has longstanding relationships in Beijing and Moscow, which she visits on her government jet.\n\nOne of the companies with the most to gain from a successful revival of Venezuela’s oil industry is Chevron. ConocoPhillips, a US peer that’s owed some US$10 billion in unpaid arbitration awards from the 2007 state seizure of its Venezuelan assets, would gain as well if it decides to implement a proposal to return to the country to recoup its debt. Among non-US companies, Shell Plc has an offshore Venezuelan gas deal on ice that could be reactivated on short notice. Other incumbents in Venezuela include Spain’s Repsol SA, Italy’s Eni SpA and France’s Maurel et Prom SA.\n\nThe revolutionary’s daughter\n\nRodríguez began her political career under late former president Hugo Chávez after graduating as a lawyer from the Central University of Venezuela. \n\nHer father, Jorge Antonio Rodríguez, was a prominent leftist in the 1960s and 1970s and a Marxist party founder. He died in 1976 after being tortured in prison by state security forces, a defining feature of Delcy’s political narrative. Her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, is another regime stalwart and was Maduro’s longtime chief negotiator with the US.\n\nThose who have worked alongside the new acting president often remark on her long hours, with Maduro recently saying she responded to messages well into the night and early morning. She was also by Maduro’s side as he ordered the most aggressive wave of repression the country has seen to crack down on dissidents in the aftermath of his contested re-election in 2024.\n\nIn meetings with financial advisers in the weeks ahead of Maduro’s capture, Rodríguez was very focused on the status of Venezuela’s debts and relationships with US oil majors, among other international financial matters, according to one of the sources.\n\nSuch diligence, together with the absence of a US indictment that had dogged Maduro for years, made Rodríguez the favourite, not just for oil companies, but also some bondholders who are looking to restructure some $60 billion of debt. \n\nThe endorsement by the White House is “a very clear-eyed sort of realist approach,” said Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs during Trump’s first term.\n\nRodríguez “liaises with energy companies, and they have been able to deal with her, but that doesn’t mean she is a long-term solution,” Breier added, highlighting her deep association with a regime blamed for widespread human rights violations.\n\nIn 2021 Rodríguez showed two Bloomberg News journalists the room at the Economy Ministry in downtown Caracas where she’d practice table tennis, with three of her sparring partners on hand to demonstrate. The cavernous space contained two ping-pong tables. Portraits of Maduro, Chávez and Simón Bolívar, who liberated Venezuela from Spanish rule, looked on.\n\nby Patricia Garip, Ben Bartenstein & Eric Martin, Bloomberg","summary":"Delcy Rodríguez oversees Venezuela’s oil apparatus and has decades of relationships among the remaining socialist stronghold in government.

Smartmatic’s technology was exclusively utilized in Los Angeles County during the 2020 election.\n\nSmartmatic was drawn into the Dominion lawsuit as a third-party defendant after Lindell countersued, alleging RICO violations.

In April, the judge requested Lindell to prove his “inability to pay,” leading Lindell to submit sealed financial records on April 18.\n\nIn early June, Smartmatic said, the company “filed under seal a Declaration and certain information pertaining to its understanding of Mr. Lindell”s financial position,” and served copies on Lindell’s counsel “the same day.” Nichols one week later “issued a sealed order to Defendants.”\n\nOn Halloween, Nichols ordered Lindell to explain “why he has not complied” with that sealed order. Lindell attorney Christopher Kachouroff, in turn, offered up as an explanation that he wasn’t able to access the sealed orders and hadn’t received them by mail.\n\nKachouroff, seeking an extension, also revealed that Lindell had “obtained new counsel who is expected to enter an appearance within weeks and the undersigned is working diligently to transition this case to new counsel.”\n\nNichols responded by granting that extension, issuing an order directing the clerk’s office and Smartmatic to “ensure” Lindell’s team received copies of both the sealed order and Smartmatic’s declaration and filed exhibits about Lindell’s finances, and setting a deadline for an update in mid-December.\n\nThe ensuing Smartmatic update stated that its assessment of Lindell’s finances showed he “raised an additional $86,000 for his legal defense fund, totaling $448,819” and, in addition, “based upon publicly available documentation,” raised “$125,222 in defense funds” relating to the defamation lawsuit that Smartmatic brought in Minnesota.\n\nSmartmatic further said it “provided the documents” to Lindell’s “new counsel,” without naming the attorney or attorneys. As of Tuesday, the court docket still lists Kachouroff as Lindell’s lead attorney of record.\n\nNichols’ Monday minute order set a deadline of Jan. 19 at the latest for Lindell to show cause “for why he has still not complied with the Sealed Order” and the judge’s Oct. 31 order.\n\nNichols then put Lindell on notice, issuing a clear warning that threatened “further contempt sanctions” if he fails to govern himself accordingly.\n\n“The Court warns Defendant Lindell that failure to comply with this order may result in further contempt sanctions,” the judge said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMike Lindell, also known as the My Pillow Guy, listens to former&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump-Appointed Judge Cracks Down: Mike Lindell Faces Contempt Threat Over Non-Compliance first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/trump-appointed-judge-cracks-down-mike-lindell-faces-contempt-threat-over-non-compliance/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Lindell-must-give-debt-info-to-election-challenge-winner.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 16:43:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.623},{"id":391604362,"title":"Trump’s vague claims of the US running Venezuela raise questions","text":"By MATTHEW LEE, AP Diplomatic Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has made broad but vague assertions that the United States is going to “run” Venezuela after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro but has offered almost no details about how it will do so, raising questions among some lawmakers and former officials about the administration’s level of planning for the country after Maduro was gone.\n\nSeeming ...","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/06/venezuela-us-plans/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Congress_Venezuela_78310_92796b-1-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 16:41:34","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":391604266,"title":"George Conway joins race for Jerry Nadler's House seat","text":"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- Vocal Trump critic George Conway officially announced his run for the House of Representatives as a Democrat in New York for the seat being vacated by Rep.

The ministry said any official presence or engagement in Somali territory without Mogadishu’s consent was “illegal, null, and void”.\n\nThe Israeli visit comes as regional opposition to Israel’s recognition intensifies, with the African Union convening an emergency ministerial session on Tuesday to address the move.\n\nThe session, which was not part of the AU Peace and Security Council’s original January agenda, was specially convened following requests from member states.\n\nEgypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty told the session that Israel’s recognition represented “a blatant violation” of Somalia’s sovereignty and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nIn the meantime, Ismail Shirwac, a Somaliland diplomat, described the Saar visit as marking “a defining moment in the deepening relations between two democratic nations operating in a strategically critical region”.\n\nHe said the diplomatic partnership was “not only significant, it is irreversible”.\n\nIsrael formally recognised Somaliland as an independent state on December 26, marking its second major breakthrough following the establishment of ties with Taiwan in 2020.\n\nSomaliland’s president, in a New Year’s Eve message, said he expected more countries to follow.\n\nTed Cruz, the staunchly pro-Israel US senator from Texas, and a prominent supporter of Somaliland, has urged President Donald Trump to recognise it, calling it a matter of strategy that “aligns with America’s security interests”.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared uninterested when asked about the issue in a recent interview with the New York Post, only saying the matter was being studied.\n\nSomaliland broke away from Somalia unilaterally in 1991 as the country collapsed into civil war.\n\nWhile Somalia only began emerging from the chaos in the early 2000s, Somaliland had stabilised by the late 1990s, establishing its own constitution, parliament and currency.\n\nSomalia swiftly condemned Israel’s move as the “gravest attack” on its sovereignty and has mobilised diplomatic support across the region and beyond.\n\nMore than 50 countries have criticised Israel’s decision, while tens of thousands of Somalis took to the streets in late December demanding national unity.\n\nPresident Hassan Sheikh Mohamud alleged in an interview with Al Jazeera that Somaliland accepted three Israeli conditions in exchange for recognition: resettling Palestinians from Gaza, effectively facilitating ethnic cleansing; hosting an Israeli military base; and joining Trump’s Abraham Accords, which a handful of nations have joined and normalised relations with Israel.\n\nSomaliland has denied agreeing to resettle Palestinians or host military facilities, insisting its engagement with Israel is “purely diplomatic” and conducted “in full respect of international law”.\n\nHowever, Bashir Goth, Somaliland’s representative to the United States, told the Middle East Forum that “as two independent countries which recognise each other, with diplomatic relations, there is nothing that can stop us from having a security cooperation or a security pact.”\n\nThe timing of Saar’s visit also occurs amid a backdrop of growing tensions across the Red Sea region.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s foreign minister held talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday, with both countries affirming their commitment to preserving Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nDays earlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held separate phone calls with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, emphasising that Turkiye “supports the territorial integrity and unity” of both Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe coordination reflects broader regional realignments, with Saudi Arabia and Turkiye increasingly allied against the United Arab Emirates’ influence across the Red Sea region, including in Yemen, where Saudi forces recently clashed with UAE-supported separatists, prompting UAE troops to withdraw.\n\nThe leader of Yemen’s Houthi rebels has also warned that any Israeli presence in Somaliland would be considered a “military target”.\n\n“We consider any Israeli presence in Somaliland a military target for our armed forces, as it constitutes aggression against Somalia and Yemen, and a threat to the security of the region,” said the group’s chief, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, according to a statement published by rebel media online in late December.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/israeli-fm-visits-somaliland-after-world-first-recognition-storm/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/afp_695017bc062a-1766856636-Eci806.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:52:53","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":391601550,"title":"Congress’s role questioned as Democrats vow to rein in Trump on Venezuela  - Dominica Gazette – Dominica","text":"Washington, DC – It has become a familiar pattern. United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.\n\nOn Saturday, in the hours after the US military abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another resolution to rein in President Donald Trump’s military actions.\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.\n\nSince Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.\n\nBut the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nExperts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.\n\n“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.\n\n“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”\n\nAn uphill battle\n\nSince August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.\n\nThat month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.\n\nThat deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a buildup of US military assets near Venezuela.\n\nTrump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.\n\nThe strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.\n\nBoth resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.\n\nBut speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the US operation on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.\n\nRepublicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military buildup in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.\n\n“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nBash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.\n\n“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.\n\nInstead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorisations of the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\nNo AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.\n\nWhen lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a war powers resolution requiring Congressional approval for further actions.\n\nBeyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.\n\nHowever, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.\n\nGiven the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.\n\nRepublicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.\n\nIn November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.\n\nDecember’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nBut Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a tiny fragment of his party.\n\nOverall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.\n\nSenator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.\n\n“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.\n\nSome Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.\n\nThat included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.\n\n“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.\n\nIn December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has sought to send the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.\n\nTrump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.\n\n“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”\n\nSince Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.\n\nThat threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was formally sworn in as the country’s interim president on Monday.\n\n“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.\n\nThe administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.\n\nConstitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.\n\nFailure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s growing power over the military.\n\n“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.\n\n“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.\n\n“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/congresss-role-questioned-as-democrats-vow-to-rein-in-trump-on-venezuela/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/AP26006037081044-1767663789-rU9znD.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:52:51","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":391603912,"title":"New York mayor picks fight with Trump as critics say he is playing politics instead of governing","text":"New York mayor picks fight with Trump as critics say he is playing politics instead of governing\n\n Gristedes CEO John Catsimatidis joins ‘Varney & Co.’ to weigh in on New York City’s new mayor and why he says hatred of President Donald Trump is driving the left’s response to a foreign tyrant.","summary":"Gristedes CEO John Catsimatidis joins ‘Varney &amp; Co.’ to weigh in on New York City’s new mayor and why he says hatred of President Donald Trump is driving the left’s response to a foreign tyrant.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6387298167112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/624f74ec-bf04-4580-9cb3-10ae95ef6fbc/6e1f4205-d25d-4537-bc6b-f702daf407ba/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:47:02","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":391603138,"title":"Divisions in S.Africa unity government over Maduro toppling","text":"President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday voiced South Africa's opposition to the US military operation against deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as divisions emerged within his national unity government over the country's reaction.\n\nThe United States' strike on Caracas and capture of Maduro Saturday stunned the world, drawing praise and condemnation from Washington allies and foes alike.\n\nParties within South Africa's unity government reacted differently, some accusing Ramaphosa's ANC of presenting its strong condemnation as the national response.\n\nSouth Africa is itself under pressure from the Trump administration over a range of policy differences, with relations plummeting last year and Pretoria seeking to avoid US trade tariffs of 30 percent.\n\nWashington boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa in November and has barred Pretoria's participation under its own presidency of the group of leading economies.\n\nSpeaking in front of a Venezuelan flag at a commemoration for a late anti-apartheid activist, Ramaphosa said South Africa was concerned by the US aggression and demanded the release of the deposed leader and his wife.\n\n\"We reject utterly the actions that the United States has embarked upon and stand with the people of Venezuela,\" Ramaphosa said, urging \"decisive action\" from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).\n\nEarlier in the day, his ANC party called on \"progressive forces\" to \"mobilise against the American imperialist aggression\".\n\nThe second-largest party in the unity government, the Democratic Alliance (DA), accused the ANC of inconsistency and hypocrisy for failing to take a similar stance on Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt said a foreign ministry statement critical of the US action showed the department had been \"politicised to pursue party political interests instead of pursuing foreign policy in the national interest\".\n\nThe right-wing Afrikaner Freedom-Front Plus also criticised the foreign ministry's statement as \"unilateral ANC action\".\n\nIt welcomed the toppling of Maduro, calling it \"the end of the socialist failure\".\n\n 'Period of might' \n\nPretoria and Washington have fallen out over issues including South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice, the UN's top court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has accused South Africa of alleged discrimination -- and even \"genocide\" -- of minority white Afrikaners and invited them to move to the United States.\n\nWilliam Gumede, professor of public management at the University of Witwatersrand, said the ANC was misreading Trump and its leaders risked sanctions from Washington.\n\n\"We are now in a period of might is right.

However, his statements lack specificity, leaving many lawmakers and former officials questioning the administration’s strategy for Venezuela’s future governance.\n\nConflicting remarks from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicate an ambiguous stance. Trump’s comments imply U.S. control over Venezuelan affairs, while Rubio suggests that the U.S. does not intend to manage the nation’s daily operations and will allow Maduro’s associates to maintain leadership roles temporarily.\n\nRubio highlighted that the U.S. strategy involves leveraging existing sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and crime syndicates to influence Maduro’s potential successors.\n\nThis uncertainty over concrete plans for Venezuela is notably different from the extensive preparation that preceded U.S. military actions against other dictators, such as in Iraq in 2003, where the outcomes often fell short of expectations.\n\nThe inconsistency between the public statements of Trump and Rubio has stirred concern among some former diplomats, who are uneasy with the lack of a unified approach on the matter.\n\nThe discrepancy between what Trump and Rubio have said publicly has not sat well with some former diplomats.\n\n“It strikes me that we have no idea whatsoever as to what’s next,” said Dan Fried, a retired career diplomat, former assistant secretary of state and sanctions coordinator who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n“For good operational reasons, there were very few people who knew about the raid, but Trump’s remarks about running the country and Rubio’s uncomfortable walk back suggests that even within that small group of people, there is disagreement about how to proceed,” said Fried who is now with the Atlantic Council think tank.\n\nSupporters of the operation, meanwhile, believe there is little confusion over the U.S. goal.\n\n“The president speaks in big headlines and euphemisms,” said Rich Goldberg, a sanctions proponent who worked in the National Energy Dominance Council at the White House until last year and is now a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish think tank.\n\nGoldberg does not see Rubio becoming “the superintendent of schools” but “effectively, the U.S. will be calling the shots.”\n\n“There are people at the top who can make what we want happen or not, and we right now control their purse strings and their lives,” he said. “The president thinks it’s enough and the secretary thinks it’s enough, and if it’s not enough, we’ll know very soon and we’ll deal with it.”\n\nIf planning for the U.S. “to run” Venezuela existed prior to Maduro’s arrest and extradition to face federal drug charges, it was confined to a small group of Trump political allies, according to current U.S. officials, who note that Trump relies on a very small circle of advisers and has tossed aside much of the traditional decision-making apparatus. \n\nThese officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss their understanding of internal deliberations, said they were not aware of any preparations for either a military occupation or an interim civilian governing authority, which has been a priority for previous administrations when they contemplated going to war to oust a specific leader or government. The White House and the State Department’s press office did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nLong discussion among agencies in previous interventions\n\nPrevious military actions that deposed autocratic leaders, notably in Panama in 1989 and Iraq in 2003, were preceded by months, if not years, of interagency discussion and debate over how best to deal with power vacuums caused by the ousters of their leaders. The State Department, White House National Security Council, the Pentagon and the intelligence community all participated in that planning.\n\nIn Panama, the George H.W. Bush administration had nearly a full year of preparations to launch the invasion that ousted Panama’s leader Manuel Noriega. Panama, however, is exponentially smaller than Venezuela, it had long experience as a de facto American territory, and the U.S. occupation was never intended to retake territory or natural resources. \n\nBy contrast, Venezuela is vastly larger in size and population and has a decadeslong history of animosity toward the United States.\n\n“Panama was not successful because it was supported internationally because it wasn’t,” Fried said. “It was a success because it led to a quick, smooth transfer to a democratic government. That would be a success here, but on the first day out, we trashed someone who had those credentials, and that strikes me as daft.”\n\nHe was referring to Trump’s apparent dismissal of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whose party is widely believed to have won elections last year, results that Maduro refused to accept. Trump said Saturday that Machado “doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country” to be a credible leader and suggested he would be OK with Maduro’s No. 2, Delcy Rodríguez, remaining in power as long as she works with the U.S.\n\nHoped-for outcomes didn’t happen in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nMeanwhile, best-case scenarios like those predicted by the George W. Bush administration for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq that it would be a beacon of democracy in the Middle East and hopes for a democratic and stable Afghanistan following the ouster of the Taliban died painfully slow deaths at the tremendous expense of American money and lives after initial euphoria over military victories.\n\n“Venezuela looks nothing like Libya, it looks nothing like Iraq, it looks nothing like Afghanistan. It looks nothing like the Middle East,” Rubio said this weekend of Venezuela and its neighbors. “These are Western countries with long traditions at a people-to-people and cultural level, and ties to the United States, so it’s nothing like that.”\n\nThe lack of clarity on Venezuela has been even more pronounced because Trump campaigned on a platform of extricating the U.S. from foreign wars and entanglements, a position backed by his “Make America Great Again” supporters, many of whom are seeking explanations about what the president has in mind for Venezuela.\n\n“Wake up MAGA,” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has bucked much of his party’s lockstep agreement with Trump, posted on X after the operation. “VENEZUELA is not about drugs; it’s about OIL and REGIME CHANGE. This is not what we voted for.”\n\nSen. Rand Paul, also a Kentucky Republican, who often criticizes military interventions, said “time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost.”\n\n“Easy enough to argue such policy when the action is short, swift and effective but glaringly less so when that unitary power drains of us trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, such as occurred in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Vietnam,” he wrote on social media.\n\nIn addition to the Venezuela operation, Trump is preparing to take the helm of an as-yet unformed Board of Peace to run postwar Gaza, involving the United States in yet another Mideast engagement for possibly decades to come.\n\nAnd yet, as both the Iraq and Afghanistan experiences ultimately proved, no amount of planning guarantees success.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has proclaimed that the United States plans&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Ambiguous Assertions on U.S. Influence in Venezuela Spark Debate on Future Strategies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-ambiguous-assertions-on-u-s-influence-in-venezuela-spark-debate-on-future-strategies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trumps-vague-claims-of-the-US-running-Venezuela-raise-questions.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:34:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":391602138,"title":"US Fed governor Miran says rates should fall over 1%-point in 2026","text":"Since taking office in September, Stephen Miran has consistently pushed for bigger rate cuts in Fed policy meetings.

The ministry said any official presence or engagement in Somali territory without Mogadishu’s consent was “illegal, null, and void”.\n\nThe Israeli visit comes as regional opposition to Israel’s recognition intensifies, with the African Union convening an emergency ministerial session on Tuesday to address the move.\n\nThe session, which was not part of the AU Peace and Security Council’s original January agenda, was specially convened following requests from member states.\n\nEgypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelaty told the session that Israel’s recognition represented “a blatant violation” of Somalia’s sovereignty and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nIn the meantime, Ismail Shirwac, a Somaliland diplomat, described the Saar visit as marking “a defining moment in the deepening relations between two democratic nations operating in a strategically critical region”.\n\nHe said the diplomatic partnership was “not only significant, it is irreversible”.\n\nIsrael formally recognised Somaliland as an independent state on December 26, marking its second major breakthrough following the establishment of ties with Taiwan in 2020.\n\nSomaliland’s president, in a New Year’s Eve message, said he expected more countries to follow.\n\nTed Cruz, the staunchly pro-Israel US senator from Texas, and a prominent supporter of Somaliland, has urged President Donald Trump to recognise it, calling it a matter of strategy that “aligns with America’s security interests”.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared uninterested when asked about the issue in a recent interview with the New York Post, only saying the matter was being studied.\n\nSomaliland broke away from Somalia unilaterally in 1991 as the country collapsed into civil war.\n\nWhile Somalia only began emerging from the chaos in the early 2000s, Somaliland had stabilised by the late 1990s, establishing its own constitution, parliament and currency.\n\nSomalia swiftly condemned Israel’s move as the “gravest attack” on its sovereignty and has mobilised diplomatic support across the region and beyond.\n\nMore than 50 countries have criticised Israel’s decision, while tens of thousands of Somalis took to the streets in late December demanding national unity.\n\nPresident Hassan Sheikh Mohamud alleged in an interview with Al Jazeera that Somaliland accepted three Israeli conditions in exchange for recognition: resettling Palestinians from Gaza, effectively facilitating ethnic cleansing; hosting an Israeli military base; and joining Trump’s Abraham Accords, which a handful of nations have joined and normalised relations with Israel.\n\nSomaliland has denied agreeing to resettle Palestinians or host military facilities, insisting its engagement with Israel is “purely diplomatic” and conducted “in full respect of international law”.\n\nHowever, Bashir Goth, Somaliland’s representative to the United States, told the Middle East Forum that “as two independent countries which recognise each other, with diplomatic relations, there is nothing that can stop us from having a security cooperation or a security pact.”\n\nThe timing of Saar’s visit also occurs amid a backdrop of growing tensions across the Red Sea region.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s foreign minister held talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday, with both countries affirming their commitment to preserving Somalia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nDays earlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held separate phone calls with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed, emphasising that Turkiye “supports the territorial integrity and unity” of both Somalia and Yemen.\n\nThe coordination reflects broader regional realignments, with Saudi Arabia and Turkiye increasingly allied against the United Arab Emirates’ influence across the Red Sea region, including in Yemen, where Saudi forces recently clashed with UAE-supported separatists, prompting UAE troops to withdraw.\n\nThe leader of Yemen’s Houthi rebels has also warned that any Israeli presence in Somaliland would be considered a “military target”.\n\n“We consider any Israeli presence in Somaliland a military target for our armed forces, as it constitutes aggression against Somalia and Yemen, and a threat to the security of the region,” said the group’s chief, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, according to a statement published by rebel media online in late December.","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/israeli-fm-visits-somaliland-after-world-first-recognition-storm/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2026/01/afp_695017bc062a-1766856636-w6jVlV.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:29:10","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":391604398,"title":"Congress’s role questioned as Democrats vow to rein in Trump on Venezuela  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St","text":"Washington, DC – It has become a familiar pattern. United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.\n\nOn Saturday, in the hours after the US military abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another resolution to rein in President Donald Trump’s military actions.\n\nChuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.\n\nSince Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.\n\nBut the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nExperts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.\n\n“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.\n\n“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”\n\nAn uphill battle\n\nSince August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.\n\nThat month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.\n\nThat deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a buildup of US military assets near Venezuela.\n\nTrump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.\n\nThe strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.\n\nBoth resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.\n\nBut speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the US operation on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.\n\nRepublicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military buildup in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.\n\n“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nBash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.\n\n“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.\n\nInstead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorisations of the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\nNo AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.\n\nWhen lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a war powers resolution requiring Congressional approval for further actions.\n\nBeyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.\n\nHowever, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.\n\nGiven the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.\n\nRepublicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.\n\nIn November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.\n\nDecember’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.\n\nBut Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a tiny fragment of his party.\n\nOverall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.\n\nSenator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.\n\n“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.\n\nSome Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.\n\nThat included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.\n\n“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.\n\nIn December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has sought to send the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.\n\nTrump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.\n\n“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”\n\nSince Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.\n\nThat threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was formally sworn in as the country’s interim president on Monday.\n\n“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.\n\nThe administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.\n\nConstitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.\n\nFailure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s growing power over the military.\n\n“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.\n\n“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.\n\n“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/congresss-role-questioned-as-democrats-vow-to-rein-in-trump-on-venezuela/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2026/01/AP26006037081044-1767663789-yfkWyk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:29:07","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":391605150,"title":"Doug LaMalfa’s death shocks Washington, Northern California","text":"Rep. Doug LaMalfa, one of California’s leading conservative voices in Washington, has died.\n\nLaMalfa, 65, had been a congressman since 2013, representing California’s 1st District. He was known as a strong, personable voice for rural and small community interests. News of his death was announced by House Republicans on social media.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff’s Office confirmed LaMalfa died Tuesday morning at Enloe Medical Center in Chico after the congressman underwent emergency surgery. Officials are conducting an autopsy to determine the cause of death.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, speaking to House Republicans Tuesday, lauded LaMalfa.\n\n“He voted with me at 100% of time,” Trump said at a GOP congressional retreat at the newly renamed Trump-Kennedy Center in Washington. “He was with us right from the beginning.”\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom ordered flags at the state Capitol and Capitol Annex to fly at half-staff to mark LaMalfa’s passing.\n\n“Congressman Doug LaMalfa was a devoted public servant who deeply loved his country, his state, and the communities he represented. While we often approached issues from different perspectives, he fought every day for the people of California with conviction and care,” Newsom said in a statement. “Jennifer and I are holding Doug’s family, loved ones, and colleagues in our thoughts as California mourns his passing.”\n\nLaMalfa rated highly, and often perfectly, by virtually every conservative measure. National Right to Life rated him at 100%. Americans for Prosperity lauded his budget-cutting votes, rating him at 87% last year. He had a lifetime 76% score from the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nHe did show a bipartisan streak when his sprawling district was involved. A few weeks ago, he joined other Republicans and Democrats in urging the Interior Department to stop cutting jobs in national parks.\n\nAn Oroville native, LaMalfa was a fourth-generation rice farmer and business owner who lived in his northern California district his entire life, earning a college degree in agribusiness from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.\n\nHe was a state assemblyman from 2002 to 2008 and state senator from 2010 to 2012. In 2012, he easily won the seat of retiring Rep. Wally Herger, and won every succeeding congressional election by wide margins.\n\nChanges in the House\n\nLaMalfa was a familiar presence in the halls outside the House chamber, routinely talking with reporters and whoever else came by.\n\nHis death stunned colleagues.\n\n“I’m heartbroken to learn of the passing of Congressman Doug LaMalfa. Doug served Northern California with steady grit, a great sense of humor, and a genuine love for the people he represented,” said California GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\n“He was widely respected and deeply beloved by those who knew and worked with him. May God comfort his wife Jill, their children Kyle, Allison, Sophia, and Natalie, and give strength to his staff, friends, and all who loved him during this incredibly difficult time.”\n\nAssemblymember James Gallagher, R-East Nicolaus, called LaMalfa a mentor and said he was “in shock.”\n\n“I’m lost and can’t imagine life, public service or politics without Doug,” he said. “There was no one who took the job of ‘representative’ more seriously than Doug. He traversed the district, going to every dinner and community event. He demanded answers from bureaucrats. He pushed hard for the things his people needed. He waited til the very end of every State of the Union so he could talk to the President, Republican or Democrat, about his district.”\n\nLaMalfa’s death creates a new complication for House Republicans, who already had a razor-thin majority. They’ll now have 218 seats, barely more than the 217 it takes for a majority.\n\nVoters passed Proposition 50 in November, which redrew California’s congressional lines and roped more liberal Bay Area voters in with LaMalfa’s rural district to shore up Democratic House seats. With his passing, voters will now elect a replacement under the old district lines, according to redistricting expert Paul Mitchell.\n\nNewsom is required to call a special election within the next 14 days, to be held within the next 140 days. That replacement will likely be a Republican, as LaMalfa easily won reelection in 2024 with 65% of the vote.\n\nRemembrances pour in\n\nAs news of LaMalfa’s death reached the Capitol and the White House, lawmakers remembered their colleagues affectionately.\n\nTrump spoke at length about LaMalfa, calling him a “great member, great, great, great member.”\n\n“He wasn’t a 3 o’clock-in-the-morning person. Do you know what I mean by that? Where the speaker goes, ‘Sir, could you call up, could you call.’ I said, ‘What time is it?’” Trump said.\n\nBut he didn’t have to make that sort of call to LaMalfa, he said, because he was always a supporter.\n\nLaMalfa, Trump said, was “a fierce champion on California water issues. He was great on water. “ The congressman was also a “a true defender of American children. He was a defender of everybody.

I don’t doubt that Trump would have attacked Ethiopia if the Ark of God were still there or if he knew its whereabouts.\n\nAs a counterpoint to reliance on military power, some people take pride in their chariots, while others take pride in their horses. However, since there is no evidence that the Ark of the Covenant was in America but rather in Ethiopia, Africa's pride is in its spiritual and heavenly might, aside from the abundant resources on the continent that industrialized nations continue to plunder and later call the Black Continent “a shithole.”\n\nThe Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament both describe the Ark of the Covenant as a holy chest built by the Israelites at God's direction. It was constructed in accordance with instructions from God that Moses received while the Israelites were camped at Mount Sinai, about a year after their flight from Egypt.\n\nThe chest was made of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold both inside and out, and measured approximately 2.5 cubits long, 1.5 cubits wide, and 1.5 cubits high (about 111 cm × 67 cm × 67 cm or 44 in × 26 in × 26 in). Four gold rings were attached to its sides, through which gold-plated acacia wood poles were inserted for carrying the Ark, ensuring that no one would touch it directly.\n\nThe most important aspect of the Ark was its golden lid, sometimes called the mercy seat or propitiatory cover. It had two golden cherubim facing each other with their wings spread wide, signifying the presence of God. Biblical stories state that God communicated through the Ark by speaking from between the cherubim on the mercy seat.\n\nThe Ark of the Covenant housed the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, which were inscribed by God and delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai. In addition, later traditions state that it also contained a jar of manna and Aaron’s rod that had budded, though these items were not present when the Ark was moved into Solomon’s Temple.\n\nGod's bond with Israel was symbolized by the Ark, which stood for His holy presence among His people. During the Israelites' wilderness adventure, it was carried by the Levites and was crucial to several significant occasions, including the fall of Jericho and the crossing of the Jordan River.\n\nEthiopian Orthodox history holds that Menelik I, the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, transported the Ark of the Covenant to Ethiopia. Since ancient times, it has been kept at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum. The 14th-century book Kebra Nagast, which describes the fabled voyage of Menelik and the purported transfer of the Ark from Jerusalem to Ethiopia, is the source of this fundamental Ethiopian identity idea.\n\nThe Ark of the Covenant was eventually relocated to the Most Holy Place of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem around 1026 BCE, and only the high priest had access to it once a year on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, when he would sprinkle sacrificial blood on the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the populace. However, despite the Ark's vital function, its ultimate fate is still unknown. \n\nWhy would Donald Trump target the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia? Donald Trump, in my opinion, would have attacked Ethiopia for the Ark of the Covenant for two reasons.\n\nSince the Bible does not mention the modern nation of America by name, nor does it reference any of the 50 current U.S. states or the country as a political entity, but rather African countries, such as Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia, and the region of Nubia, which includes parts of modern Sudan, jealous Trump will be forced to invade Ethiopia like Venezuela to take possession of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nAccording to the Bible, Obed-Edom the Gittite had the Ark of the Covenant temporarily in his home for three months. During that time, it bestowed blessings upon him and his family. 2 Samuel 6:11 describes this incident. Trump would have taken control of the Ark for the United States to fulfill his political dreams, to “Make America Great Again.” \n\nWhen the oxen stumbled and the ark tipped, Uzzah reached out to steady it, but he was struck dead for his rude actions. Although Uzzah's goal was to prevent the ark from collapsing, his actions violated the divine decree that only the designated Levites could touch it. Donald Trump would still try despite this account.","url":"https://www.modernghana.com/news/1461584/the-hypothetical-scenario-of-trump-seeking-the.html","image":"https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/16202621650-l5gsj7v331-maxresdefault.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 15:17:00","author":"Joel Savage","authors":["Joel Savage"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.197},{"id":391604282,"title":"France to host Ukraine allies to secure guarantees after cease-fire","text":"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- French President Emmanuel Macron will host a meeting of Ukraine allies Tuesday to secure guarantees of support if Ukraine and Russia sign a peace deal.\n\nThe leaders of about 35 countries calling themselves the \"Coalition of the Willing\" will meet Tuesday afternoon in Paris.

Holidaymakers on board the P&O cruse Arvia were due to dock at Martinique today after setting sail from Barbados on January 2. They were then set to head to St Kitts, British Virgin Islands and other destinations. But following military action in Venezuela the passengers claims they haven't gone beyond 30 miles from shore, and have already returned to Barbados three times to pick up passengers whose flights were cancelled or delayed. Lizzy Meadowcroft, 56, and her partner Mark Crowther, from Morecambe, Lancashire, said that the ship is currently docked in Barbados for the third time, where it will remain until 7pm local time today this evening before heading to St Lucia. Many passengers who were due to be on the cruise did not make it after aircraft were instructed to avoid parts of the Caribbean by the US Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of the military action. Lizzy said: \"We are disappointed as the communication hasn't been great. First, we were told that the delays were due to the weather, then there was a problem with the aircraft, and now we're being told it is because of Trump. \"We would have rather known the truth from the start.

Trump first watched the capture from his Mar-a-Lago resort where he boasted it was like \"watching a TV show\". More than 150 fighter jets and bombers swooped into Venezuela under the cover of darkness, before targets inside and close to Caracas were hit, including air fields, military bases and telecommunications towers. Incredibly, no visible air defence response was ever detected, with Trump later boasting the \"lights of Caracas\" were \"turned off due to a certain expertise that we have\". According to the Daily Mail , some experts believe the US deployed a \"blackout bomb\", as was used in the Gulf War.","summary":"A cruise ship carrying British tourists and circling Barbados has been left &quot;in limbo&quot; after Donald Trump dramatically invaded Venezuela to remove leader Nicolas Maduro.","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/cruise-ship-carrying-brits-in-36506396","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36506358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Cruise-ship-carrying-Brits-circling-Barbados-after-US-military-action-in-Venezuela.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 14:44:39","author":"David Rivers","authors":["David Rivers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":391603124,"title":"US has violated the territorial integrity of Venezuela — South African President condemns invasion","text":"The President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has condemned what he describes as the illegal invasion of Venezuela by the United States of America.\n\nU.S. forces reportedly entered the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the early hours of Saturday, January 3, 2026, leading to the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nThey are facing U.S. federal charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons-related offences.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump later stated from his Mar-a-Lago residence that America would temporarily “run” Venezuela and allow U.S. companies access to the country’s oil reserves.\n\nThe move has drawn widespread international condemnation, despite criticism of Maduro’s nearly decade-long administration.\n\nReacting to the developments, President Ramaphosa described the invasion as a clear breach of international law.\n\n“I think everybody now in the world agrees that what has happened is a violation of international law and also violation of the United Nations Charter, and that is why we call for the Security Council to meet to discuss this matter,” he said in a video sighted on his X page.\n\nRamaphosa emphasized the threat the invasion poses to global norms, warning that it sets a dangerous precedent.\n\n“What has happened now basically is giving carte blanche to anyone to mount an invasion on any country.

The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.\n\nWhat’s more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be “proudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.”\n\nBut both the T1’s shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.\n\nNot long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be “proudly American.” Trump Mobile’s website now touts the T1 as having an “American-proud” design, with no further explanation.\n\nAnalysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 — the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump’s demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.\n\nLater in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile’s website continues to list the T1’s targeted release date as “later this year.”\n\nThe Trump Organization didn’t respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the delays or when the device is now expected to be shipped. The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.\n\nWhatever the reason, the T1’s ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn’t come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.\n\n“We have always been quite skeptical about this phone,” Jeronimo said. “They are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let’s see if this thing comes to life or not.”\n\nWhile the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month — a price tied to Donald Trump’s titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung’s Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.\n\n“Maybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,” Jeronimo said.","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/06/trump-phone-mystery/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_New_Years_Eve_31765.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 14:41:42","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":391600960,"title":"Nicolas Maduro's famous prison cellmates - from Luigi Mangione to El Mayo","text":"Former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro might be joining a very different court these days.

They now call it the Donroe document,” Trump said, attaching the first letter of his name to the series of principles.\n\nThe Monroe version (1823) basically claimed that any interference by a European country in the Americas could be met by US military force. The Americas were a no-go zone for European powers.\n\nThis meant that the US was the pre-eminent political, military and economic power in the western hemisphere. The Donroe version maintains that status but has a significant add-on.\n\nIn essence, this new doctrine gives Washington a free hand in its sphere of influence. But, crucially, China and Russia are also allowed, by extension, a great deal of latitude in what they view as their spheres of influence.\n\nThis is a vision of hemispheric dominance backed by military power, but with the US actually curtailing its global presence. Make no mistake, we are witnessing a rupture from Europe that is profound and deep. The US, for the first time since 1945, is not a global power not through force of arms but because it chose to.\n\nThis is ominous, for obvious reasons, for both Taiwan and Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will not be losing too much sleep over Maduro’s fate. Indeed, the actions by the US encourage Putin, a close ally of the former Venezuelan leader, to continue his war against Ukraine. The head of a nuclear-armed Russia will not have to check his security detail before hitting the sack for fear of being apprehended. Nor is Moscow unduly worried by the loss of an ally, as it has gained something far more valuable. Its sphere of influence has been accepted.\n\nThe US, by its actions in Caracas, has granted Russian influence over former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine.\n\nChina’s president faces a slightly different set of circumstances. Trump can hardly point an accusatory finger at Xi Jinping in the event that he attacks Taiwan. But there is another viewpoint in the closed, heavily fortified leadership compound in Beijing. Trump just might feel emboldened enough to send in the troops to protect Taiwan, something he would never do for Ukraine. It’s an unlikely scenario, but one that nonetheless needs to be considered.\n\nIt is also worth noting that US control of Venezuelan oilfields denies China a guaranteed energy supplier.\n\nChina is an addicted customer of Venezuelan oil. But the new world could also play into Beijing’s hand. If Beijing is considered the more moderate on global policy and the more reliable in terms of its actions, using coercion instead of force, then it could reap the benefit.\n\nGreenland is being mentioned as the next victim of Trumpian swagger. What this means is deeply concerning. A US president unwilling to commit troops to defend Ukraine will instead commit troops to invade an autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark. The temptation seems too great for Trump to resist. Greenland’s strategic location and mineral wealth give it all the characteristics of a tethered lamb with a salivating wolf pack inching closer.\n\nAn invasion of Greenland would sow confusion, foster a sense of betrayal, and end NATO as a credible force.\n\nIn that scenario, the temptation for Russia and China to deploy their armed forces to grab more land would be immense.\n\nEurope is isolated and must decide whether to accept or oppose Washington’s new policies. Giving the thumbs up might appear on the surface to preserve a carry-on-as-normal appearance, but it would only reward bullying.\n\nTo oppose Washington would be politically costly, and it may not even be possible to put up a united front. Some European leaders privately applaud Trump’s new approach.\n\nIs Europe willing to defend its legitimate concerns when the challenge comes from its most powerful ally?\n\nCan it take on Moscow and Washington at the same time?\n\nMore to the point, what does this mean for Ukraine?\n\nThe omens are not good for Kyiv regarding any peace deal Trump might seek to impose on Ukraine. A distracted US involved with a military intervention in Latin America will inevitably see resources taken from Europe.\n\nThis weaker US presence can only embolden Moscow.\n\nThis is the European reality. It inhabits a strategic environment in which the US is unreliable and possibly even threatening.\n\nAn erratic ally is not an ally, no more than a drunk friend is reliable in a street fight.\n\nThe new year has given Putin and Xi a US president mired in problems in the Western hemisphere. The Russian and Chinese leaders, with the potential end of NATO, will heartily welcome the Donroe Doctrine.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author’s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.","summary":"The birth of the Donroe Doctrine will see the world divided into spheres of influence to the benefit of Russia and China.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/67535","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2026/01/06/47ee94bc8cd21826f2b96d4620553c84.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 14:32:43","author":"Tom Clifford","authors":["Tom Clifford"],"language":"en","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":391600956,"title":"Cubans fear Trump will 'bomb city and kill people' as Havana 'could fall like Venezuela'","text":"Cubans are in fear that the United States could bomb Havana and kill civilians, with many warning that the island \"could be next\" following the US military operation that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.\n\nWhen Maduro and Flores were captured and taken out of Venezuela by military forces in the early hours of Saturday morning, a group of young Cubans were celebrating a birthday at a house in Havana's Vedado neighbourhood. The gathering, initially filled with music, jokes and drinks, took a darker turn after an alert appeared on the hostess' phone announcing the US strike on Caracas as part of the operation against the Venezuelan leader. \n\nShock quickly gave way to fear, with some guests saying that \"Cuba could be next\" as they watched videos of an event that, despite repeated predictions, had seemed improbable to many.\n\n\"The first reaction was disbelief,\" said the hostess, a 26-year-old Havana native who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. \"Maduro is a dictator who was illegitimately occupying power, but the United States has no right to carry out a military intervention in any country. It's difficult to take sides in these circumstances: on the one hand, you feel a certain excitement that things will change and that the new scenario will be positive,\" reports El Pais.\n\n\"On the other hand, we know that these kinds of foreign interventions don’t end well. The fear of them bombing your city and killing your people becomes terrifying.”\n\nTwo days after the operation, which resulted in Maduro and Flores being imprisoned in a Brooklyn jail, the Cuban government issued a statement of condolence for the deaths of 32 Cuban military personnel who were part of the Venezuelan president's security detail at the time of his capture. \n\nAuthorities also declared two days of national mourning. At the same time, Cubans have been trying to assess what the fall of a long-standing ally, though one already in decline, could mean for the island and whether Cuba itself could become Washington's next target, as suggested by comments from US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nOn Saturday morning, news of the US operation spread across the island through state television channels such as Cuban Television, Telesur and Russia Today, messages from relatives abroad, and social media, where memes and AI-generated images about the arrest circulated widely. \n\nCuban authorities simultaneously called for a rally outside the US diplomatic mission at Havana's Anti-Imperialist Tribune on the Malecón. By mid-morning, thousands of people had gathered to express support for Chavismo and to demand proof of life for Maduro, who had not yet been presented publicly by US authorities.\n\nCuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel denounced the US action as \"state terrorism,\" reaffirmed Latin America as a \"zone of peace\" and said it was \"a time for defining positions\", declaring that Cuba would stand with Venezuela and that he was prepared to shed his own blood for the country. \n\nAmong those listening was Karla Picart, a professor at the University of Havana’s School of Communication, who said: \"They have taken off their masks and are no longer even trying to hide it\", in reference to a press conference held the same day by Trump, who said the United States would take control of Venezuela and its oil industry until a reliable transition was achieved.\n\nAt that press conference, held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort hours after Maduro's capture, the president also said that his administration would eventually address Cuba because, he claimed, \"it's a failed nation\". Rubio, appearing alongside Trump, warned that if he lived in Havana and were part of the government he'd \"be concerned\".\n\nDeep ideological divisions among Cubans, both on and off the island, have been reflected in reactions to Maduro's capture. While Cuban authorities and their supporters describe the event as a \"kidnapping\", many Cubans in exile, and some on the island, have celebrated the US operation with memes and posts predicting a similar fate for Cuba's leadership.\n\nCristal, a 30-year-old Havana resident, said: \"So now it turns out that María Corina doesn’t have the support of the United States? I understand the feelings of many Venezuelans who are happy with what has happened. They got rid of that guy, a dictator who has imprisoned so many people, who has violated human rights. \n\n\"And I don’t care if it's the result of foreign intervention. Venezuelans, and us Cubans, have already lost that patriotic feeling of putting sovereignty above all else. People who are hungry and in need want something better for their lives and they don’t care how it comes. I think many Cubans are seeing hope, even in something that might not be hopeful at all.\"\n\nAs events continue to unfold, uncertainty has become the dominant sentiment. \"The watchword now is uncertainty,\" said Fabio Fernández, a historian and professor at the University of Havana, who questioned whether Chavismo could consolidate without Maduro. He warned that the situation could quickly shift toward Cuba, with potentially severe consequences.\n\n\"Will the commitments between Cuba and Venezuela be maintained? Will Venezuelan oil continue to arrive in Cuba? What will become of the Cuban collaborators in the country? How will these collaborators be relocated if, suddenly, the ties are severed? What will be the economic impact of all this on Cuba?\" Fernández asked. \"These are complex questions, and if the answer is that Chavismo collapses and Venezuela changes, the implications for Cuba will be dire.\"\n\nAlthough Venezuelan aid to Cuba has declined in recent years alongside Venezuela’s economic crisis, PDVSA documents show that as recently as September 2025, Venezuela was sending 52,000 barrels of oil per day to the island, the highest monthly figure of that year.\n\nFernández said a definitive fall of Chavismo could push Cuba into a crisis far deeper than its current one, particularly as the island is \"in the crosshairs of Trump and Marco Rubio\", as both have acknowledged. He described the situation as \"an exercise in the politics of force\" and \"a revival of the Monroe Doctrine\", in which the United States seeks to define its sphere of influence. \n\nFor now, Cubans remain closely focused on developments in Venezuela, trying to anticipate what they see as an increasingly unpredictable and threatening regional landscape.","summary":"Civilians in Cuba are terrified that Trump could carry out attacks on Havana and kill their people, with some fearing that the island could be 'the next Venezuela'","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/breaking-cubans-fear-trump-bomb-36506047","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article36506405.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cuba-Venezuela-US-26003682665462.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 14:31:38","author":"Abigail Hunt","authors":["Abigail Hunt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":391600282,"title":"House GOP Rep Doug LaMalfa dead at 65","text":"House GOP Rep.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., confirmed LaMalfa's death on X. \"Jacquie and I are devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa. Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America. Our prayers are with Doug’s wife, Jill, and their children,\" Emmer said. LaMalfa was known as a champion of conservative causes as well as a kind man to both reporters and his fellow House lawmakers. With his death and the recent resignation of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., House Republicans currently can lose only two votes to still pass anything along party lines. It's a perilously slim majority as Republicans kick off the second half of the 119th Congress with hopes of passing a second \"big, beautiful bill.\" LaMalfa's death appears to have caught a majority of his colleagues by surprise, with tributes pouring out for the late congressman on Tuesday morning. \"Doug was a principled conservative and a tireless advocate for the people of Northern California. He was never afraid to fight for rural communities, farmers, and working families.

Young Kim, R-Calif., said in a statement, \"Doug was not only a respected colleague in the California Republican Delegation, but a genuinely kind, decent man who treated everyone with warmth and respect. His leadership, friendship, and steady presence will be deeply missed.\" The news comes just as House Republicans are meeting for an all-day policy brainstorming session at the newly renamed Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
