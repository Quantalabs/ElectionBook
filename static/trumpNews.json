A total of 623 murders were recorded last year -- up from 577 in 2023 -- some of them blamed on Latin America-based criminal gangs like Tren de Aragua from nearby Venezuela.According to a US Department of State report from March, the murder rate of 37 per 100,000 people made Trinidad and Tobago the sixth most dangerous nation in the world last year.The Caribbean's second-largest producer of natural gas has also been battling an economic downturn due partly to a decline in gas production.It had been banking on developing the Dragon gas field in Venezuelan waters, but had its licence revoked by the administration of US President Donald Trump as part of its sanctions on Venezuela.","summary":"Trinidad and Tobago's centrist former prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar will return as leader of the Caribbean nation after her party's victory in Monday's parliamentary election, the electoral commission confirmed Tuesday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/opposition-leader-confirmed-winner-trinidad-elections-3771878","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4597640/former-trinidadian-prime-minister-kamla-persad-bissessar-set-return-power-after-her-center-right.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 01:06:17","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.082},{"id":316218186,"title":"Carney’s Liberals win Canada election defined by Trump","text":"OTTAWA: Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged Tuesday to beat the United States in Donald Trump’s trade war after winning Canada’s election and leading his Liberal Party to another term in power. \n\nWhile the Liberals won control of parliament, they looked set to fall just short of a majority, with a handful of races in Canada’s 343 electoral districts still uncalled.\n\nCongratulatory messages from world leaders poured in, with countries including China and India saying they would welcome cooperation with Carney’s government.\n\nFollowing a campaign dominated by Trump’s tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a United States that is newly hostile to free trade. \n\n“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and Britain before entering politics only earlier this year. \n\n“We will win this trade war and build the strongest economy in the G7,” Carney said.\n\nCarney should be able to pass large parts his agenda through deals with smaller parties, in an extraordinary comeback for the Liberals, who until recently looked headed for an electoral wipeout.\n\nPierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party had been on track to win the vote but Trump’s attacks, combined with the departure of unpopular former prime minister Justin Trudeau, transformed the race.\n\nCarney, who replaced Trudeau as prime minister just last month, convinced voters that his experience managing economic crises made him the ideal candidate to defy Trump.","summary":"OTTAWA: Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged Tuesday to beat the United States in Donald Trump’s trade war after winning Canada’s election and leading his Liberal Party to another term in power. \n\n\n\nWhile the Liberals won control of parliament, they looked set to fall just short of a majority, with a handful of races in Canada’s 343 electoral districts still uncalled.\n\n\n\nCongratulatory messages from world leaders poured in, with countries including China and India saying they would welcome cooperation with Carney’s government.\n\n\n\nFollowing a campaign dominated by Trump’s tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a United States that is newly hostile to free trade. \n\n\n\n“We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,” said Carney, who led the central banks of Canada and Britain before entering politics only earlier this year. \n\n\n\n“We will win this trade war and build the strongest economy in the G7,”","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40360199/carneys-liberals-win-canada-election-defined-by-trump","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/04/68113288dfc2c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:57:45","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.192},{"id":316218180,"title":"China waives tariffs on US ethane imports","text":"SINGAPORE: China has waived the 125% tariff on ethane imports from the United States imposed earlier this month, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, among a group of products that have been granted exemptions. \n\nThe move will ease pressure on Chinese firms that import US ethane for petrochemical production as well as provide an outlet for the natural gas liquid, a byproduct of US shale gas production. \n\nThe sources said the tariff on ethane had been waived in recent days.

It must be noted, however, that even before tensions between the South Asian neighbours had reached boiling point, investor confidence had already been eroded by a combination of the Trump Administration’s erratic trade tariff policy, a persistently weakening rupee and volatile foreign exchange reserves, prompting downward revisions of Pakistan’s GDP growth forecasts by the IMF and the World Bank. \n\nInevitably, this had led to patchy stock market performance of late, with the wider economy also under pressure from these headwinds, and appearing increasingly susceptible to significant underperformance as geopolitical risks intensify. \n\nHere, the unpredictability of President Donald Trump’s trade tariff decisions in particular carries broader implications, as such disruptions tend to ripple across global markets via trade and financial linkages. For developing economies like ours, which already grapple with elevated debt burdens, fragile foreign exchange buffers and institutional weaknesses, the likelihood of external shocks — such as a reckless, reactionary trade policy pursued by the world’s preeminent economic power, shaped more by flawed ideology than solid economic logic – triggering systemic instability becomes significantly higher. By injecting deep uncertainty into global trade norms, such erratic policymaking has not only undermined confidence in the US as a stable economic leader but also eroded trust in the dollar’s credibility as the anchor currency of international commerce. \n\nThe resulting volatility has unsettled markets and disrupted long-standing supply chains — including ironically in the US itself — and could prompt a broader re-evaluation of reliance on dollar-denominated assets and US-centric financial systems. Governments and businesses worldwide are grappling with the chaos and struggling to contain its impact. \n\nWhile geopolitical events like terrorism, diplomatic rifts and military conflicts can severely disrupt economic activity by shaking investor confidence, driving down asset prices and straining financial systems – and the ramifications of the Pahalgam incident will prove this in the coming days — it is evident that the impact of trade-related geopolitical tensions, particularly erratic tariff policies, can be just as severe. \n\nThe flip-flopping trajectory of US tariff policy exemplifies this volatility: initial blanket tariffs on all countries were partially rolled back for 90 days except in the case of China, followed by signals that there may be an easing of Chinese tariffs as well. This extreme policy shock represents a pattern of the US deliberately using unpredictability as a tool to negotiate with its trading partners. While the Trump Administration may have softened its initial stance, it has demonstrated a disturbing willingness to escalate towards a broader global trade war.\n\nFor Pakistan, such global trade volatility amplifies existing vulnerabilities, disrupting export markets, deterring foreign investment and complicating economic planning. As has been previously noted, this uncertainty has already rattled the PSX, where investor sentiment is highly sensitive to external shocks, leading to heightened instability and sustained downward pressure on valuations. And with a constrained fiscal space and a heavy reliance on external financing, Pakistan remains particularly exposed to the spillover effects of global economic turbulence.\n\nIt is evident then that geopolitical shocks, especially in the form of foolish and short-sighted economic and trade policies, can inflict widespread damage, disrupting global economic stability and undermining long-term economic resilience. Struggling economies like Pakistan’s are especially vulnerable, as such disruptions exacerbate existing challenges and hinder the path to sustainable growth.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025","summary":"EDITORIAL: Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and instability in the region – intensified by the ongoing repercussions of the Pahalgam tragedy, pushing Pakistan and India further towards a dangerous confrontation — the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a turbulent trading session on April 24. \n\n\n\nThe KSE-100 Index plummeted by 2,206.33 points, or 1.88 percent, closing at 115,020 compared to the previous day’s 117,226, reflecting growing investor anxiety over looming economic instability.

I love this state and a lot of auto jobs are coming,\" Trump said, as he thanked the auto workers for their support. \"They all want to come back to Michigan to build cars because of our tax and tariff policy. They're coming up from all over the world.\"\n\nTrump spent much of his speech during his \"100 Days of Greatness\" rally, touting the 142 executive orders he has signed since taking office. He also talked about immigration, government spending cuts, and tariffs, as he targeted many of his comments to the autoworkers in the crowd.\n\n\"You finally have a champion for workers in the White House and instead of putting China first, I'm putting Michigan first and I'm putting America first,\" Trump said to loud cheers. \"Week by week, we're ending illegal immigration. We're taking back our jobs.\"\n\n\"What the world has witnessed in the past 14 weeks is a revolution of common sense,\" Trump added. \"We like strong borders, we like good education, we like low interest rates. We want a strong military. We want low taxes.\"\n\nWhile Trump touted the stock market of his first term, he did not comment on the stock market during his current term following his tariffs announcement earlier this month. Instead, he focused on money that he said was saved through government cuts and the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"After a lifetime of unelected bureaucrats stealing your paychecks and attacking your values and trampling your freedoms, we are stopping the gravy train and ending their power trip and telling thousands of corrupt, incompetent and unnecessary deep state bureaucrats, 'You're fired. Get the hell out of here. You're fired!'\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're ushering in the Golden Age of America,\" the president continued. \"Nowhere has this transformation been more dramatic than at our southern border. The last administration engineered a massive border invasion, allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate our communities.\"\n\n\"Standing before you today, I can proudly report that this heinous betrayal is over and that we have achieved the most secure border in American history, by far,\" Trump reported. \"For two months in a row, we have now set all-time records, and this is from the fake news media, for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded.\"\n\n\"The number of illegal border crossers released into the United States is down 99.999%,\" Trump announced to cheers. \"Three people got in compared to hundreds of thousands during the last administration.\"\n\n\"Under President Trump, America is no longer a dumping ground for criminals,\" Trump added. \"But while we're trying to protect Americans, the radical left Democrats, who are so bad for this country, are fighting to protect TDA and MS-13 criminals.\"\n\nAfter introducing much of his Cabinet, who were in attendance, Trump jumped to cost of living and inflation.\n\n\"Since I took office, the price of eggs is down 87%,\" he claimed, without specifically mentioning inflation. \"And you had so many eggs for Easter and the prices were way down.\"\n\n\"Gasoline prices are down by a lot. Energy prices are down. Mortgage rates actually just went down. Prescription drug prices just saw their largest monthly decline ever recorded,\" Trump listed, adding, \"The fake news will never tell you that. And grocery prices are also down.\"\n\n\"In three months, we have created 350,000 jobs,\" Trump said. \"For the first time in recent memory, job gains for native-born Americans exceed job gains for foreign workers. I want everyone to do well.\"\n\n\"To curb inflation, we are cutting a record number of job-killing regulations,\" he continued, as he credited his first administration with cutting \"more regulations than any president in history.\"\n\nAfter passing the hour mark of his speech, Trump turned to tariffs and global relations. He urged patience with his tariffs policy as it plays out with other countries who \"have drained us for 40 years.\"\n\n\"Now we're respected all over the world. They're coming from all over the world to see your president. They're coming from India. They're coming from France. They're coming from Spain. Yeah, they're coming from China, too,\" Trump said, adding, \"They want to make a deal.\"\n\n\"With my China tariffs, we are ending the greatest job theft in the history of the world. China has taken more jobs from us than any country has ever taken from another country. But that doesn't mean we won't get along. I think it's going to work out, but it's going to be a fair deal,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Remember this, we were losing $5 billion dollars a day on trade and now we're making money,\" the president added.\n\nTrump touched on his working relationship with Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk and insisted he is \"not under the thumb of Musk,\" questioning \"then why would I be allowed to end the all-electric mandate? I don't think he was too happy.\"\n\n\"By the way, it's not fair what they have done to him. That is a disgrace!\" Trump added, as the crowd booed. \"But he's a great guy and he's really helped us. And you know, they've saved $150 billion on waste, fraud and abuse with DOGE.\"\n\nTrump concluded his 100 days rally by listing the dozens of executive orders he has signed, including banning men in women sports and banning transgender members in the military, as he announced recruiting numbers in the military, police and fire departments are on the rise.\n\n\"We have a waiting list of people who want to go into our military, because our country has spirit again,\" Trump proclaimed, as he turned to another executive order he signed that would eliminate the Department of Education and \"send education back to the states.\"\n\n\"And I made myself very unpopular in Mexico by renaming the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,\" Trump quipped. \"And I signed an order to require proof of citizenship to vote in American elections. And the Democrats fought me on that.\"\n\n\"We've done this all in 14 weeks, that's 100 days, we've done all of the things that I've named and a lot more,\" Trump concluded, as he looked ahead.\n\n\"In the coming weeks and months, we will pass the largest cuts in American history and that will include no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security and no tax on overtime. It's called the one, big beautiful bill and it will be the biggest bill ever passed in our country's history.\"\n\n\"We will end inflation, slash prices, raise wages and give you the greatest economy in the history of the world,\" Trump vowed. \"And every single day of my administration we will live by the motto, 'Promises made, promises kept.'\"","summary":"President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally in Michigan on Tuesday to mark his first 100 days of his second term in office, proclaiming, \"we've just gotten started.\"","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/04/29/president-Donald-Trump-100-days-rally/1881745970552/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1881745970552/2025/upi/b91d1e6493c945893463f0672dcac909/v1.2/Trump-celebrates-first-100-days-with-campaign-style-rally-in-Michigan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:53:58","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":316216768,"title":"Cuba re-arrests two high-profile dissidents after Vatican prisoner release","text":"Cuba’s highest court has ordered two prominent dissidents to be taken back into custody on the basis that both had separately violated the terms of their parole.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Tribunal Supremo Popular – sometimes translated as the People’s Supreme Court – authorised the arrests of Jose Daniel Ferrer and Felix Navarro.\n\n“In addition to failing to comply with the terms of their parole, [Ferrer and Navarro] are people who publicly call for disorder and disrespect for authorities in their social and online environments and maintain public ties with the head of the United States embassy,” said Maricela Sosa, the court’s vice president.\n\nBoth men had been released earlier this year as part of a deal mediated by the late Pope Francis and the Catholic Church. As part of the agreement, Democrat Joe Biden, the outgoing United States president, briefly removed Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nBiden’s decision was quickly reversed as Republican Donald Trump replaced him as president on January 20. The very next day, Trump ordered Cuba to be restored to the list, which restricts foreign assistance, defence sales and other financial interactions with designated countries.\n\nStill, by March, Cuba had announced it had completed its end of the bargain, releasing a total of 553 people. While critics of the Cuban government have called them “political prisoners”, Havana maintained that the released people represented “diverse crimes”.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Department of State issued a statement condemning the latest arrests, which also reportedly swept up Ferrer’s wife and child.\n\n“The U.S. strongly condemns the brutal treatment and unjust detention of Cuban patriots [Ferrer], his wife and son, as well as Felix Navarro and several other pro-democracy activists,” it said in a social media post.\n\nIt added that the US Embassy in Havana “will continue meeting with Cubans who stand up for their fundamental rights and freedoms”.\n\nOne of the most prominent critics of the prisoner release was Ferrer himself. A fisherman and founder of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), Ferrer has advocated for democratic reforms on the island, leading to clashes with Havana’s community government.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times following his release in January, Ferrer framed the Vatican-brokered deal as a publicity stunt for the Cuban government.\n\n“In a gesture of supposed good will, they free a number of people who should never have been jailed, and then they want in exchange for that for the Church and the American government to make concessions,” Ferrer said.\n\n“They are applauded, and the world sees that they are so generous.”\n\nFerrer had publicly refused to accept the conditions of his release, including mandatory court appearances, on the basis that he should have never been imprisoned in the first place.\n\nBoth he and Navarro had been arrested before, beginning in 2003 with an incident known as the Black Spring. That saw 75 dissidents be swept into detention based on accusations they were colluding with the US government.\n\nFerrer had also been arrested in 2019 on allegations he had kidnapped and assaulted a man, a charge he denies.\n\nThen, in 2021, Cuba convulsed with mass protests at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, as basic supplies like food and medicine grew scarce. Many protesters blamed the Cuban government for the shortages and denounced the limits to their civil liberties.\n\nCuba – which has long blamed US sanctions for the island’s economic distress – answered the demonstrations with a police crackdown, resulting in widespread arrests. Navarro and Ferrer were among those detained, until their release in January of this year.\n\nIn a series of social media posts, Ferrer’s sister Ana Belkis Ferrer Garcia announced he had been taken back into custody early on Tuesday morning. Her brother had recently been running a soup kitchen in the city of Santiago de Cuba.\n\nShe noted that UNPACU’s headquarters were “looted” and multiple activists were arrested, along with Ferrer’s wife Nelva Ismarays Ortega Tamayo and their son Daniel Jose.\n\n“All of them were taken to an unknown location,” Ferrer Garcia wrote on X. “Miserable and cowardly criminal tyrants! We demand their immediate release and that of all detainees and political prisoners.”\n\nLater, she added that Ortega Tamayo and Ferrer’s son were released “after being held for several hours”.\n\nHuman rights organisations also offered condemnations of Ferrer’s and Navarro’s arrests. The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, a nonprofit based in Spain, tied the incident to the death of Pope Francis, who passed away at age 88 on April 21.\n\n“Raul Castro and Miguel Diaz-Canel have not waited even 72 hours after Francis’s burial to undo their commitments,” the observatory said in a statement, naming Cuba’s former and present president, respectively.\n\nThe decision to re-incarcerate Ferrer and Navarro, the observatory added, “betrays the Pope’s request”.","summary":"Jose Daniel Ferrer and Felix Navarro had been released earlier this year as part of a deal brokered by Pope Francis.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/cuba-re-arrests-two-high-profile-dissidents-after-vatican-prisoner-release?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-29T143826Z_282031594_RC2QTDA4PGVD_RTRMADP_3_CUBA-DISSIDENT-1745972473.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:53:28","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":316216044,"title":"Trump tears into 'lunatic' enemies trying to impeach him as he marks major 100-day wins on border and tariffs in wild Michigan rally","text":"President Donald Trump tore into his 'lunatic' detractors during his rally celebrating '100 Days of Greatness' in Michigan Tuesday, where he touted his efforts to revive U.S. manufacturing. \n\nFlanked by giant signs that read 'Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!' and 'Buy American, Hire American,' the president noted how he turned the critical swing state red 'after decades of leaders who have destroyed Detroit to build up Beijing.'\n\nTrump promised the crowd of residents from the Detroit area - the heartland of American automotive manufacturing that has been hollowed out by jobs being sent overseas - that he's just getting started.\n\n'Gasoline prices are down by a lot, energy prices are down,' he proclaimed to the 'Motor City' crowd.\n\nEarly on in his remarks the 78-year-old took a detractor head-on, calling them out for being a 'radical left lunatic.'\n\n'Is that a radical left lunatic? He's just a child! Get him out,' he said to applause.\n\n'Oops, I'm sorry ma'am. I thought you were a guy… I said he and it's a she. I'm sorry,' he joked. 'And now she has to go home.'\n\nA protestor was later escorted out of the rally as they fought with security, video captured by DailyMail.com shows. It's unclear if it was the individual Trump began ridiculing, who apparently was yelling and swearing at the president during the address. \n\nThe president also took on his enemies in Congress and finally broke his silence on the newest impeachment effort against.\n\n'What the hell did I do they want to impeach me,' he asked after mentioning the Democrats' most recent attempt to remove him.\n\n'Did I just hear I'm being impeached again?' he remarked slyly. 'They've gone totally crazy.'\n\nThe impeachment bid, launched this week by Michigan Democrat Rep. Shri Thanedar, includes over half a dozen articles implicating the president.\n\nThe charges include obstruction of justice, bribery, corruption, abuse of power and more.\n\nThe impeachment bid is a long shot at best in a Republican-led Congress. It is likely that the effort to oust Trump won't even get a vote given the GOP control.\n\n'We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act,' Thanedar said announcing his articles of impeachment, adding Trump is 'unfit to serve as President and represents a clear and present danger to our nation's constitution and our democracy.'\n\nTrump didn't just tear into Democrats, though.\n\n'Every once in a while you have a grandstander Republican,' the commander-in-chief told the crowd.\n\n'We have some grandstanders. Not many. Not many. But remember who those grandstanders were and vote them the hell out of office.'\n\nIt's unclear which Republican the president was talking about.\n\nHe then dove into more auto-specific policies he has been rolling out, like a proposed 25 percent tariff on foreign-made vehicles and incentives for automakers to manufacture their products in America.\n\nTrump vowed to keep 'protecting our great American autoworkers.'\n\n'I'm proud to be the president of the workers, not the outsourcers,' he said.\n\nThe Republican also wanted to share an update on his deportation efforts, telling the crowd how he is getting criminal aliens out of the country as fast as possible.\n\n'The worst of the worst are being sent to a no-nonsense prison in El Salvador,' he shared.\n\nHe then paused his speech to play a highlight reel for the crowd of migrants getting deported to CECOT, El Salvador's maximum-security prison where the Trump administration has been shipping deportees.\n\nThe video showed deportees getting filed onto buses before they arrive at the prison and have their heads shaved while shackled in their prison garb.\n\n'Best 100 days of any president,' Trump proclaimed. 'And were just getting started.'\n\nThe administration's tariff plans, the president shared, is going exactly to plan. \n\n'They're coming from all over the world,' to make deals, he said. 'China too.' \n\nThe president also remarked how he won't wait too long to make deals should U.S. trading partners delay in reaching out.\n\n'If it takes too long, I'll just set a price,' he said with a smile.","summary":"President Donald Trump tore into his 'lunatic' detractors during his rally celebrating '100 Days of Greatness' in Michigan Tuesday, where he touted his efforts to revive U.S. manufacturing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14661943/Trump-tears-lunatic-enemies-trying-impeach-marks-major-100-day-wins-border-tariffs-wild-Michigan-rally.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/30/00/97847197-0-image-a-9_1745970361110.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:45:45","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":316218556,"title":"Canada’s Liberal Party wins election dominated by Trump’s trade war","text":"Canada’s governing Liberal Party has won national elections dominated by United States President Donald Trump’s trade war and annexation threats.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney, a career economist and banker who cast himself as a champion for Canada in the face of Trump’s threats, led the Liberals to a fourth consecutive term on Monday, a stunning turnaround for a party that until recently was on track for a crushing defeat at the hands of the Conservative Party.\n\nCarney, who had never held office before taking the top job in March, cast the outcome as an opportunity to “stand up for Canada” and “build Canada strong”.\n\n“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” Carney said in a victory speech, in which he called on Canadians to never forget the lessons of the “American betrayal”.\n\n“These are not idle threats.

Email fran.wolfisz@mailonline.co.uk\nBy FRANCINE WOLFISZ \n Published:01:27 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:01:41 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nHomeowners on a new build estate claim they have been 'gagged' from objecting to another housing development because of a clause in their buyer contracts. \nCrest Nicholson built 191 houses in the Highlands Park development in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in 2020 and has now submitted plans to South Oxfordshire District Council for permission to build 131 more nearby.\nBut residents who bought homes in the first phase say they have been banned from objecting to the second development.\nA guide price on a two-bedroom property on the estate is currently £495,000, while a three-bedroom home is on the market for £620,000 and a four-bed for £850,000, according to listings on Zoopla.\nResidents say they were shocked to discover a clause in their buyer contracts with Crest Nicholson prohibiting them from expressing objections to neighbouring planning applications.\nThe clause stipulates that 'the buyer agrees not to object or cause any objection to be made to any planning application made by the seller in respect of any neighbouring or adjoining land which relates to the development or other residential development, and in particular not to lodge an objection or objections with the local planning authority or relevant government department or object or be represented at any public enquiry called in connection with such planning application'.\nCommunity facilities promised in the first development, such as a community centre and football pitches, will also be relocated, as part of the new planning application.\nResidents say they want to object, but are afraid of the consequences. But one says he will not be 'silenced' by the firm.\n\nHomeowners on a new build estate claim they have been 'gagged' from objecting to plans for more than 100 new homes in a neighbouring field by developer Crest Nicholson\n\nResidents who bought homes in the first phase say they have been banned from objecting to the second development\n\nA guide price on a two-bedroom property on the estate, which was built in 2020, is currently £495,000, while a three-bedroom home is on the market for £620,000 and a four-bed for £850,000, according to listings on Zoopla\nHe said: 'They can do what they want. You're entitled to object.\n'You can put anything into a contract. It doesn't make it legal or defendable.'\nHe says while he would not object to the new homes in the plans, he has expressed an objection to the changing football pitch plans.\nThe resident said other neighbours were scared of lodging objections.\nHe added: 'To the people that have objected, I'm not aware of anyone that's received any feedback from Crest - positive or negative, which is a shame, you would hope that they would contact the residents and say: \"You're one of the stakeholders here.\" That would be really great.\n'I see it as a gagging order. That's the whole purpose of putting it in there. It's to gag you.\n'Whether that's legal or not is undecided, but it's 100 per cent a gagging order.\n'It gives them total freedom to do what they want.\n\nResidents say they were shocked to discover a clause in their buyer contracts with Crest Nicholson prohibiting them from expressing objections to neighbouring planning applications\n\nResidents say they want to object, but are afraid of the consequences of breaking the clause\n\nOne resident said he wondered whether it was legal to include such a clause in the contract\n'It's horrendous. People are afraid. It's intimidation.'\nHe added that most people might have agreed to the contract after skim-reading it, adding that his solicitor, who was recommended by the company, did not mention the clause.\nIt was only in January that he saw the clause after being told by a neighbour.\nHe said: 'I don't think they're going to sue all of us for objecting, but at the same time there are lots of people who want to object that just won't.'\nAn anonymous resident said: 'It's a bit of a weird clause to put in.'\nWere he allowed to object, he said he felt he 'probably' would.\nAnother resident said he initially wondered whether it was possible to include such a clause in the contract.\nHe said: 'I would have thought legally and particularly in the climate we're living in, it's not the way we want to live our lives.\n\nOne resident objecting to the plans said a new development on the nearby green space would 'exacerbate the loss of wildlife'\n\nResidents have spoken out about 'loving' the countryside close to their development \n'If you believe that people are going to be either unduly politicised or awkward for the sake of it, then good won't necessarily come from it.\n'But it seems to me that certainly in a democracy, we give people a voice.\n'I think there was an element of gagging, otherwise why would you put it in there? It's pretty stark, actually: if you wanted to work with the community, you certainly wouldn't write agreements in that form.\n'It's a very aggressive and black-and-white way of doing things.'\nHe said he had written about a number of aspects of the development complaining about the football pitch and facilities and the community centre as he felt the changes had been done 'in haste'.\nThe developers have applied to relocate the community centre to another part of the site, and for additional facilities to accompany the sports pitches, such as toilets and car parking spaces.\nAnother resident said she and her husband would have objected if they were 'allowed to'.\nShe said: 'We've relocated for work. We wouldn't be able to buy in an area like Henley if there had not been a new housing estate.\n\nA neighbour who is renting a house in an estate next to the Crest Nicholson development said they would 'never' buy it because of the planned second phase\n\nA decision on the planning application was due by April 25 but has still not been made\n\nScores of objections have been submitted to the local authority by residents. in the area\n'But we personally love the countryside which we live in and have watched the slower selling of the houses onsite currently - everything else got snapped up really quickly - and we don't want any further development here.\n'There have been a big number of developments around the town which we think fulfill the housing requirement and there is such a lovely amount of biodiversity - we have deer grazing every evening, all these beautiful wildflowers - and it does feel a shame but that's hypocritical for me to say because I live in a new-build house. So we're very torn.\n'It is freedom of speech that we don't have anymore.\n'I would like to exercise my rights.'\nA neighbour who lives in an estate next to the Crest Nicholson development said: 'We're just renting and we would never buy this house because of that.'\nThe plan submitted to South Oxfordshire District Council, the housing authority, is for 131 homes in its 'northern field' - comprising a mix of one- and two-bed apartments, one-bed maisonettes, and two-, three-, four- and five-bed houses - and outline permission for land for up to 20 residential dwellings to be provided and owned by the Henley Community Land Trust.\nA decision was due by April 25, according to the planning portal, but has still not been made.\nScores of objections have been submitted to the local authority by residents. \n\nA Crest Nicholson spokesperson said the clause 'was included in our contracts previously'\n\nThe first housing estate was originally built in 2020 - with residents airing concerns that plans have been put forward for a second nearby\nOne wrote: 'Henley has more than enough appropriate grey and brownfield field sites available for housing without having to destroy a valuable natural green site.\n'It is a mistake to convert this type of natural land into housing, to do so would produce irreversible negative environmental impact and increase the local flooding, pollute the river and destroy the aquifer, exacerbate the loss of wildlife, cause soil degradation and add greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. \n'Each year the field gains more pollinators and native plants, trees and grasses, which sustain a large variety of animals, insects, birds and invertebrates.\n'It provides a run for badgers and a safe place for ground nesting birds and dormice, a feeding ground for nocturnal animals, a breeding ground for moths and small mammals and a larder of airborne insects for owls, skylarks, bats and swifts. \n'It connects the surrounding green areas allowing wild species to roam, feed, find mates and raise their next generation. \n'Britain is already the most nature depleted country in in the world, loss of habitat is the main cause. \n'Blatantly this site, if developed, would be responsible for doing just that.'\nA spokeswoman for Crest Nicholson said: 'This clause has been included in our contracts previously. \n'As a member of the New Homes Quality Code, we regularly review the provisions in our agreements and are currently reviewing our documentation in line with upcoming changes to the Code issued by the New Homes Quality Board.'\nA spokesperson for South Oxfordshire District Council said: 'This isn't a matter we would comment on. The residents would need to seek their own legal advice on this issue.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWe've been banned from objecting to 100 homes next to our new-build estate because of a 'gagging' clause in our contracts - we won't be silenced\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Canada's Prime Minister hailed his party's impressive turnaround , although they fell short of winning an outright majority in parliament on Tuesday . Although they will have to seek help from another, smaller party, the Liberals were behind in the polls by double digits a few months ago. Speaking in the wake of the win, Mr Carney, 60, said Mr Trump \"is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never – that will never, ever happen.\" He referenced the US President's threats to Canada's economy and its sovereignty , suggesting it should become the \"51st state\" of the US. \"We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\" Mr Carney, who was governor of the Bank of England for seven years until 2020, added. Mr Carney's victory will be seen as a stand of defiance by Canadians against Mr Trump following the 78-year-old politician's continued threats against the country. Leader of Canada 's Conservative Party , Pierre Poilievre, who had attempted to emulate the \"MAGA\" movement in Canada, saw his comfortable poll lead dramatically collapse after Mr Trump signed three executive orders in February imposing 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada. This excluded oil and energy exports, which received a lower 10% tariff. Mr Trump has congratulated Mr Carney on the win, with both agreeing on the importance of Canada and the US “working together as independent, sovereign nations”, the Canadian prime minister’s office said. Prior to the election though, Mr Carney suggested people north of the border should vote for him to make Canada the United States' 51st state. Mr Trump wrote: \"Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminium, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, with ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America.\" \"America can no longer subsidize Canada with the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year that we have been spending in the past. It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!\" During his first 100 days of his second term as US President , Mr Trump has seen most of his presidential appointments sail through the GOP-controlled Senate, and has seen his agenda taken over the American government with shocking speed - helped, of course, by billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE programme, which claims to have slashed billions from federal spending.","summary":"Donald Trump's trade war dominated the Canada election campaigns - but the US President saw Mark Carney and his Liberal Party claim a remarkable triumph on Tuesday","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/canada-election-result-mark-carneys-35142210","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35142217.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Canada-Election-25119250556556.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:34:23","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":316215994,"title":"Trump ousted Kamala Harris’s Jewish husband from Holocaust Memorial Council","text":"President Donald Trump has dismissed many of former President Joe Biden's nominees to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Doug Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris.

He subsequently paused the levies for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, but left 10 percent baseline tariffs on most countries. \n\nAfter weeks of behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing, India is now emerging as a key ally in Trump’s recalibration strategy. \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent made similar remarks earlier in the day at the White House press briefing, suggesting that India could be among the first countries to come to new terms with the United States. \n\nRelated StoriesTrump Delivers 100th Day Achievement Speech in Michigan4/29/2025Trump to Ease Tariff Impact on US Carmakers, Lutnick Says4/29/2025\n\nBessent said that “America’s Asian trade partners and allies ... have been the most forthcoming in terms of doing the deals,” noting that India’s existing trade strategy is easier to manage than other nations that use a host of indirect policies to restrict trade. \n\n“The non-tariff trade barriers can be much more insidious and also harder to detect,“ he said. ”So a country like India, which has posted and ready tariffs, it’s much easier to negotiate with them, so I think the India trade negotiations are moving well.”\n\nVice President JD Vance was in India last week meeting with Modi about, among other things, the proposed 26 percent tariffs on Indian goods. \n\n“I think that he and Modi made some very good progress,” Bessent said. “So, I could see some announcements on India.” \n\nHe additionally mentioned progress on discussions with Korea and Japan. \n\nTrump’s “America First” trade policy actions were followed by heavy volatility in global equity markets. Trump declared a national emergency on April 2 and imposed tariffs ranging from 10 percent on some countries to 50 percent on others. China, which chose to retaliate with tariffs of its own, entered a back-and-forth with the United States that ended in a crippling 145 percent levy on most Chinese goods. \n\nThe president on April 9 announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. \n\nIndia’s proactive negotiating strategy is rooted in necessity and opportunity, with bilateral trade topping $129 billion between the two nations in 2024, equaling a $50 billion trade surplus benefiting the world’s most populous country. \n\nReliant on exports of electronics, marine products, and gems and jewelry to the United States, India is reportedly ready to offer concessions to stem tariff-related economic losses. \n\nOnce dubbed the “king of tariffs” by Trump, India has reduced duties on some U.S. made products, including bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and offered tariff cuts totaling $23 billion on medical devices and some agricultural products. \n\nNews of an impending deal comes on the heels of Modi visiting the White House in February to discuss elevating trade between the two countries to $500 billion by 2030. \n\nThe plan, known as “Mission 500,” includes agreements to eliminate trade barriers, such as restrictive testing and certification regulations in India that limit chemical and telecommunications sales, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy and consulates in India.\n\nTrump is also seeking to increase the amount of liquefied natural gas and national security and defense equipment sold to the Asian nation. \n\nIndian officials are seeking expanded manufacturing investments to bolster electronics and semiconductor companies. \n\nWith both countries looking to establish a post-China supply chain, market analysts are watching to see if leaders can successfully navigate domestic economic challenges while aligning mutual interests.","summary":"Administration officials said negotiations are underway and could yield positive results to reduce trade barriers and tariffs.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-signals-trade-deal-with-india-could-materialize-soon-5849779","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/29/id5849778-President-Donald-Trump-April-29-2025-300x180.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:28:48","author":"Travis Gillmore","authors":["Travis Gillmore"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.4},{"id":316214744,"title":"Trump laughs off protester who attempted to disrupt 100 days speech: ‘Thought it was a guy’","text":"President Donald Trump laughed off a protester who attempted to disrupt a speech he was giving in Michigan marking his first 100 days in office, joking that he \"thought it was a guy.\" As the president was praising Republican National Committee leader Michael Watley, there appeared to be some type of disruption in the crowd, causing the president to pause his speech. \"What's the problem over there?\" Trump said. \"What’s the problem?

We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse, and above all, we're saving the American dream. We're making America great again, and it's happening fast,” said Trump, who added that his whirlwind first 100 days back in office have brought a “revolution of common sense” to the United States.\n\nBut what seemed to animate Trump most in his return to the rallies that have defined his political career was seeing his friends.\n\nAt multiple points during his stem-winding, rambling 89-minute address, the president stopped to acknowledge people in the crowd who he recognized as part of the traveling circus that characterized his three presidential campaigns, which collectively spawned a class of super-fans who followed him from town to town like some people followed The Grateful Dead in that iconic ensemble’s heyday.\n\n“Look at you ‘Front Row Joes,’ he said to one group who gave themselves that nickname because they spent collective years waiting in lines so they could be in the front row for his campaign speeches.\n\n“I’ve missed you guys — I miss the campaign,” the president continued, adding that some of the aforementioned “joes” had “lost a couple of pounds.”\n\n“Perhaps you’re getting one of those jabbers,” he added as he mimed the act of injecting himself with one of the auto injector pens used to administer GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic.\n\nHe also called out Blake Marnell, a mainstay at Trump rallies dating back to 2019 when the president invited him to the stage after spotting him wearing a bespoke novelty suit patterned to look like a brick wall.\n\n“I have Mr. Wall here, this guy — how many rallies have you gone to?”\n\nMarnell replied that he’d been to hundreds by now, at which point Trump suggested he would one day acquire a suit like Marnell’s to wear on stage.\n\nContinuing, Trump went on to boast of the record low border crossing numbers that have been reported since he instituted a crackdown on the right to claim asylum in the United States and reimposed harsh anti-migration policies from his first term, before reliving how the Democratic Party candidate in 2024 changed from then-president Joe Biden to then-vice president Kamala Harris after Biden’s somnolent, confused performance in his sole debate against Trump last June.\n\nReturning to the subject of illegal immigration and his crackdown against it, Trump praise the efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and bragged about having designated a pair of South American street gangs — Tren de Aragua and MS-13 — as “foreign terrorist organizations,” a category the administration claims as giving them the right to bypass due process protections for anyone they deem to be a member of either group.\n\n“We are delivering mass deportation, and it's happening very fast,” he said, adding later that the “worst of the worst” migrants are being sent to what he called a “no-nonsense prison in El Salvador” — the infamous CECOT constructed by self-described Salvadoran dictator Nayib Bukele.\n\nAt that point, the giant video screens erected at the rally venue played a wordless sizzle reel accompanied by dark mood music, showing detainees arriving on American military planes before being processed and huddled into the hellish prison by Salvadoran military police.\n\nTrump called the scenes depicted in the video “lovely” and went on to repeat a series of oft-told but unverified claims he debuted during the 2024 campaign regarding foreign countries emptying prisons and “sending” violent criminals to the U.S. to seek asylum.\n\n“They come in from Africa. The Congo, they emptied out their prisons into our country, but they come from Africa, Asia, South America. They come from all over bad parts of Europe. That's why we've invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expel every foreign terrorist from our soil as quickly as possible,” he said.\n\nThe president’s focus on immigration-related accomplishments not only harkened back to his previous presidential campaign rhetoric, but it allowed him to keep most of his remarks on a subject that remains a relative strength for him amid dismal polling numbers showing him with the lowest approval ratings of any president in the modern era after the first 100 days of an administration.\n\nOne Reuters/Ipsos survey released this week shows just 42 percent of respondents approve and 53 percent disapprove of his performance thus far, a number he said was “actually not bad” while positing that a “legit poll” would give him at least 60 percent approval.\n\nThe Reuters poll also showed that the percentage of respondents who approve of his economic stewardship had declined a point to 36 percent – the lowest level in his current term or in his 2017-2021 presidency, while disapproval rose 5 points to 56 percent.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-marks-first-100-days-002433139.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/5d558beb812df816605dd5a8595f8aa8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:24:33","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":316213038,"title":"Trump highlights ‘revolution of common sense’ at Michigan rally","text":"WARREN, MI — Nearly seven months after his hectic Michigan campaign concluded, President Donald Trump returned to “The Mitten State” for an indoor rally to mark his first 100 days in office.\n\nStanding in front of a banner that read “The Golden Age,” Trump during a 90-minute address championed his policies ranging from border security to the economy to military spending.\n\n“This is the best 100-day start of any president in history,” Trump told a crowd of more than 1,000 people inside Macomb Community College’s gym. “We’re just getting started.”\n\nHe called his early term policies “a revolution of common sense” while criticizing opponents of his initiatives.\n\n“We’re ending illegal immigration,” Trump said. “We’re taking back our jobs. We’re restoring the rule of law.”\n\nTrump used the platform to respond to news that U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, a Democrat from Detroit, introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump earlier in the week. Thanedar criticized Trump for allegedly “violating the constitution” and “doing real damage to our Democracy.”\n\nAt the Tuesday rally, Trump referenced Thanedar as “some guy I never heard of” and “a lunatic.”\n\n“Did I just hear we’re getting impeached again?” Trump said, seemingly jokingly. \n\nEchoing a go-to 2024 campaign message, Trump repeated disproven claims he won the 2020 presidential election against Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“We love you. We just had the biggest victory (in Michigan),” Trump told the crowd. “We won it twice. We actually won it three times.”\n\nThe president at one point paused his remarks to screen footage showing the March transportation to an El Salvador prison of Venezuelan immigrants who were accused of being gang members.\n\n“I think the No. 1 thing I won on was border (security),” Trump told the crowd. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration. We are delivering mass deportation. The worst of the worst are being sent to a no-nonsense prison in El Salvador.”\n\nThe president was critical of judges who have ruled against the constitutionality of his policies, including on border control issues.\n\n“Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president,” Trump said. “I hope, for the sake of the country, the Supreme Court saves us. Nothing will stop me from keeping America safe again.”\n\nTrump also was critical of pollsters and journalists who report on polls detailing Americans’ declining favor of Trump policies. He claimed pollsters “poll more Democrats.”\n\n“97% of stories written about me are negative,” Trump said, “and yet we won in a landslide.”\n\nHe took jabs at other political rivals too.\n\nAt one point, Trump asked the crowd to vote on their favored nickname for former President Joe Biden: “Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe?”\n\nThe crowd cheered loudest for the latter option.\n\nThe rally was the second of two Michigan stops Tuesday for Trump. He arrived at the college after first visiting Selfridge Air National Guard Base, where the president announced plans to station new fighter jets at the site.\n\nEarlier in the day, White House officials announced Trump on Tuesday planned to sign an executive order to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts. It was news the president relayed later to the crowd at the college, framing it as support for Michigan’s auto industry.\n\n“We’re bringing jobs back to Michigan,” Trump told the crowd at the rally.\n\nHe responded to critics of the high tariff rates aimed at China, saying he planned to work out a “fair deal” with the Asian nation.\n\nTrump also talked about policies and initiatives he plans to pursue before his term ends, including “the largest tax cuts.”\n\n“I will give you the greatest economy in history,” the president said.\n\nTrump repeated a campaign promise that Michigan would serve as a manufacturer of a military defense “dome” that would protect the United States from enemy attacks. He has compared it to the “iron dome” defense system operated by Israel as a protection against missile strikes from neighboring nations.\n\nTrump rallied the crowd to cheer high-profile cabinet members in attendance including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Mehmet Oz, the president’s pick to lead Medicare and Medicaid. Trump also rallied cheers for Michigan Republican leaders such as state House Speaker Matt Hall, state Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt, and Michigan Republican Party Chairman Jim Runestad.\n\nTrump during his rally thanked Elon Musk, the billionaire who has led Trump’s administration in slashing federal programs and jobs and attracted the distaste of many Americans unhappy with those cuts.\n\n“He’s an amazing guy,” the president said of Musk, who was not in attendance Tuesday. “He’s a great American. He loves America.”\n\nSeveral high-profile Trump supporters spoke to the crowd before Trump’s arrival at the college gym. \n\nAmong them were Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, a Detroit native and leader of 180 Church in the city, who led the group in an opening prayer.\n\nLivingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy, who hosted a Trump campaign event at the sheriff’s county facilities in August, expressed support for the president’s border control efforts. \n\nBrian Pannebecker, a retired autoworker and outspoken Trump fan who once organized a protest outside a Detroit Lions game against players who kneeled during the national anthem, rallied the Tuesday crowd to applaud the president’s economic policies.\n\n“In his first 100 days, he’s accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years,” Pannebecker told the room, inciting chants of “U-S-A.”\n\nMike Lindell, founder and CEO of My Pillow, was in attendance but did not address the crowd. Walking among the gym in the hours leading up to Trump’s remarks, Lindell was a regular target for people seeking selfie photos.\n\nThe scene inside Macomb Community College’s gym was a throwback to last summer and fall, when Trump hosted campaign rallies across Michigan in his bid to clinch the swing state’s favor.\n\nOn bleachers and 23 rows of fold-out chairs, supporters sat — and sometimes stood — to cheer the president as he boasted he was successful in delivering on a number of campaign promises.\n\nAnd, like last year’s campaign season, Trump supporters wore some of the standard attire associated with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement: Red MAGA hats. Shirts with Trump catchphrases and insults directed at rivals. Hair and beards dyed in colors of the American flag.\n\nWhile some recent polls showed Americans do not agree with Trump’s aggressive efforts in his first 100 days, the crowd inside Macomb Community College cheered approvingly and loudly as he recounted his 2025 executive orders and policy plans.\n\nAlthough, at one point, Trump directed security to remove an attendee who seemingly shouted opposition at the president.\n\nSupporters began filing into the facility five hours before his remarks began at 6 p.m.\n\nDuring the wait, the gym speakers blasted some recognizable Trump campaign soundtrack hits — “YMCA” by The Village People, chief among them — along with tunes from performers including Toby Keith, Guns N’ Roses, DJ Khaled, Dolly Parton, The Weeknd and Toto. Several Billboard-charting singles from Michigan-born Trump supporter Kid Rock’s music catalogue thumped the facility’s walls with bass.\n\nTuesday was not the first time Macomb Community College hosted a Trump event. The school hosted one of the Republican candidate’s last Michigan stops: A Nov. 1 rally, four days before Election Day.\n\nIn September, he hosted a roundtable-style gathering at the college, located about 20 miles north of downtown Detroit. \n\nApril 29 marked Trump’s 99th day since returning to the White House on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump in November 2024 won Michigan’s 15 electoral college votes, flipping the state again in a victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nMacomb County was one of the southeast Michigan communities where voters favored Trump.\n\nThere, voters chose Trump over Harris, 284,660 votes to 214,977 votes, for a nearly 14-percentage point victory margin.\n\nTrump in 2016 was the first Republican to win Michigan’s vote since 1988. With his victory last year, he added to that bragging right.\n\nTrump’s favor in Michigan has wavered over the years, but his supporters have kept the vote counts close. He defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 10,704 Michigan votes in 2016 and then lost to Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 154,188 Michigan votes four years later.\n\nTrump defeated Harris by 80,103 Michigan votes last November.\n\nClick here to follow MLive’s complete coverage of President Trump’s impact on Michigan.","summary":"President Trump showcased deportation efforts and promised \"the greatest economy in history\" at a rally marking his 100th day in office.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/trump-highlights-revolution-of-common-sense-at-michigan-rally.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EU4YOPCUSZGEHJRWGQCT4NR4DY.JPG?auth=c9d5b2d7dbab8f41cfcad27d27f40ecd11ec2d79cf542021f2978e7270dfbcfe&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:20:59","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":316219254,"title":"World News | Iraqi Man Charged with Illegally Voting in 2020 Election in New York","text":"Albany (US), Apr 30 (AP) An Iraqi man living in upstate New York has been charged with illegally voting in the 2020 election, according to US prosecutors, who said Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency assisted in the investigation.

He is charged with voting by aliens, a misdemeanour punishable by up to one year in prison. “Election security is and will continue to be one of the FBI's highest national security priorities,\" Craig Tremaroli, special agent in charge of the FBI's Albany field office, said in a Justice Department news release.

Messages e-mailed to addresses used by Jamiel in the past either bounced back or didn't result in an immediate response. A message was also left at a phone number listed for Jamiel in a court filing in an unrelated lawsuit. Court records did not indicate whether he has an attorney. President Donald Trump has blamed widespread voter fraud for his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election, despite analyses showing that claim was false. Public records indicate Jamiel registered as a member of New York's Conservative Party the month before the election. “Only American citizens can vote in American elections,” the Justice Department post said. “Thanks to our partnership with DOGE, this DOJ has charged an Iraqi man for illegal voting in the 2020 election.” It isn't clear who Jamiel voted for in the election. In a 2019 lawsuit, however, he identified himself as a Trump supporter. In the suit against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Jamiel claimed his rights were being violated because New York was too tolerant of illegal immigration. He included several letters in the suit that he had sent to the White House complaining that America was “under invasion” by people entering the country illegally. Jamiel also included a letter he had received from the White House in response, signed by Trump, thanking him for his correspondence. Since DOGE was established by Trump to reduce waste and fraud in government, its staffers have scrutinised departments managing the government workforce and federal properties. The prosecutor's office did not elaborate on DOGE's role in the investigation of Jamiel.

It's like Valentine's. No one asked for it, but we're all expected to act like it's a big deal.\n\nIf you listen to the alarmist leftist press, which is gorging itself on the latest polls (the worst First 100 days survey in 80 years!), Americans are furious, the economy is crashing, the sky is falling and Trump had better pack it in because his White House goose is cooked.\n\nSixty percent of voters in a Washington Post poll feel Trump is out of touch with their concerns, 72 percent fear that he's driving the country into recession and 99 percent believe that Kennedy is the most beautiful and intelligent woman in America.\n\nNow, I understand that I number among the blabbering political punditry, but that doesn't mean that I'm incapable of independent thought.\n\nSo, instead of focusing on the polls (because when are they ever wrong?) and a manufactured media festival, let's look at some measurable achievements of Donald's second term.\n\nIn a controversy-rich climate, nothing is more of a hot button than Elon Musk's DOGE.\n\nThe baby-making billionaire pledged to cut federal agencies by 'at least $2 trillion' before revising his estimate by 50 percent.\n\nBut Elon and his merry band of nerds are still stealing from the bureaucracy and giving back to Americans, saving at least $150 billion by 'cutting fraud and waste.'\n\nTheir bushwacking targets include a $2.9 billion migrant facility in Texas, a shady $1.9 billion IRS IT contract and a nearly completely useless, unaccountable and, frankly, anti-American government agency.\n\nUSAID doled out grants by the hundreds of millions for everything from Iraqi Sesame Street to dance classes in Wuhan and handouts for Syrian terrorists.\n\nNow, DOGE's rankled foes are furious that Elon is both cutting and not cutting enough, got it. They quibble with how much taxpayer money he's re-claimed yet decry the loss of every misspent penny.\n\nIf anything, DOGE's disinfecting sunlight is shining a much-needed light on the dark underbelly of the bloated federal government. And Elon - and Trump - deserve our thanks.\n\nShutting 'un-shuttable' border\n\nIt didn't take Trump 100 days to secure the open southern border. He sealed that leaky deal of a campaign pledge on Day One.\n\nOne year ago this month Droopy Joe Biden claimed that he didn't have the authority to halt the endless throng of caravans and asylum seekers bum-rushing every point of entry from Nogales, Arizona to Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n'We're examining whether or not I have that power,' mumbled the Tripper-in-Chief.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas even had the stones to say, 'The border is closed.' Sure, if by 'closed' you mean WIDE OPEN. Dork.\n\nThe political backlash to that obvious and damaging lie landed Trump in the White House for a second time.\n\nNow Customs and Border Protection data show a 94 percent drop in nationwide, single-day border apprehensions.\n\nOne White House official I spoke to poo-pooed the polls and pointed to the staggering decline, telling me, 'This is the President's marquis issue. Republicans have been campaigning on it for decades. Most administrations don't achieve their prime objective in four to eight years. We accomplished it in 100 days.'\n\nBut while the snapped-shut border may have happened quickly, trade is a more perplexing puzzle that my White House buddy promises, 'will be solved within the next 100 days.'\n\nTricky Trade War\n\nEven Trump's tall tale-tellers admit people will have to be a little more patient with this one. Unfortunately, if there's one thing a combative press and struggling Americans have very little of, it's patience.\n\nWith a volatile stock market and 145 percent tariffs on China, it's easy to slam trade hawks like Peter Navarro who foolishly promised '90 deals in 90 days.' What about the small businesses that might go bankrupt if they make their goods in China and have no way to find alternate manufacturing?\n\nThe White House pointed to me a bike manufacturer setting up shop in my ancestral home of Seymour, Indiana.\n\nGuardian Bikes will start making their frames in the southern part of the Hoosier state, crowing it is, 'a significant step in reshoring a critical industry that was once a cornerstone of American manufacturing but has been nearly offshore for decades.'\n\nWell, if the point of this trade war is to bring bike manufacturing home – then they've made great strides. But I suspect that the real goals are a bit grander.\n\nEven handsome Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had loudly admitted to reporters that a tariff tit-for-tat with China is 'not sustainable.' But no one ever claimed that overhauling the world economy would be an easy lift.\n\nPerhaps, putting an arbitrary 100-day grade on the historic re-alignment of trillions of dollars in global commerce is a bit preposterous?\n\nCulture wars won\n\nOf course, you don't hear the Left harping about certain polls. Take, for instance, a recent New York Times survey on whether transgender people should compete against biological women in sports.\n\nThe poll showed 79 percent of voters now oppose former dudes spiking women on volleyball courts and in pools.\n\nGiven the lopsidedness of these issues, you'd think that progressives would be forced to come around... but no. They're still leading their party around by the boa and Democrats have chosen to die on this silly hill.\n\nForty-five lefty senators voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in January, but that didn't stop Trump's Education Department (which he hopes will soon be abolished) from slapping the University of Pennsylvania with a Title IX violation this week for allowing Lia Thomas to compete against bio-gals in swimming.\n\nThe Department of Ed is requiring Penn president J. Larry Jameson (sounds like a snob) to vacate and erase any trans female awards and records 'or similar recognition for Division I swimming competitions', which means Lanky Lia would have to give back her she-medals.\n\nSmoldering Ceasefire\n\nAfter that tender Vatican moment shared between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Pope's funeral last weekend, Mad Vlad Putin has sheepishly called a three-day ceasefire.\n\nTrump is a long way from realizing his campaign trail pledge to end the war in 24 hours, but it does look like progress.\n\nPerhaps, all it took was a good tongue lashing from Trump who told Putin, 'Stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal.' (Putin adores being bullied, so this should end well.)\n\nThe frustrated White House wants to make this short-term token permanent, and they're applying new pressure to the sociopathic Russian leader to stop the nonsense and give peace a chance.\n\nBut Trump once again has backed himself into a corner, bragging this week that he wants a deal in 'two weeks or less' and his administration is turning up the heat on both sides, suggesting that America will walk away.\n\nEven if Trump comes somewhat close and achieves what for his predecessor would've been unthinkable, he won't get the credit.\n\nCritics aligned against this administration would rather give Ukraine another unaccounted for $200 billion and prolong the killing and destruction than allow this president a political win. It's callous and disgusting. But it's the truth.\n\nPony up, Saudi Arabia\n\nOne clear a bright spot, the flow of foreign investment into the US, will die in darkness in America's newsrooms.\n\nThis is a victory for American manufacturing as well as the global economy, but you won't hear more than a peep about Saudi Arabia pledging $600 billion in investments over the next 4 years or UAE investing more than double that in the next decade.\n\nJapan and India, already reportedly rushing to make trade deals, are also pledging well over $1 trillion that will hopefully result in thousands of new American jobs.\n\nSome of these anti-Trumpers are downright prudes, but I find this stripe of good news to be very sexy.\n\nThis all comes in addition to private companies like Oracle, Open AI, Nvidia and Hyundai - to name a few - rounding out the global behemoths who are happy to make a splash in the consumer-rich, contiguous American economy.\n\nSo far, the full tally comes in at around $5 trillion.\n\nWho knows what the next 100 Days will bring, but you can count on a weaponized, left media bringing you fewer of the wins and more of the fails of an administration that is damned if they do and double damned if they don't.","summary":"President Donald Trump's administration has reached the 100-day milestone!

Will you speak to him about trade?”\n\nSign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\n\nTrump replied: “They are calling and I will be talking to him, yes.”\n\nThere was no indication when the conversation would take place.\n\nThe Australian government has been seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration over America’s controversial tariffs regime, which includes a minimum 10% tariff on almost all imports from Australia and 25% tariffs on specific items, including steel and aluminium.\n\nTrump’s tariff regime has been an election issue in Australia, though not a pre-eminent one, and Albanese has fielded criticism during the campaign for not making personal contact with the president to argue for exemptions.\n\nRelated: Dutton refuses to specify what Coalition’s $21bn of pledged defence spending would be used on\n\nThe opposition argued that Australia’s position as a security ally that consistently runs a trade deficit with the US should have helped Albanese secure special consideration, as Australia did in Trump’s first term.\n\nAlbanese was under pressure for failing to secure a call with Trump to negotiate, and during an election debate the prime minister said he was not even sure if the president has a mobile phone.\n\nBut, in the initial tariff announcement, Australia did secure the lowest tariff rate – 10% – imposed on all countries without a higher rate.\n\nAlbanese has consistently described Trump’s tariff regime as “an act of economic self-harm” and damaging to the US relationship with Australia.\n\n“The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend,” he said when they were imposed.\n\nThe Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told ABC radio on Wednesday morning the government had been “engaging” at all levels with the US administration.\n\nRelated: Fears Australia underestimated Trump’s trade war after IMF slashes $13bn off forecast growth\n\n“That engagement has been ongoing,” he said. “Prime Minister Albanese has already had a couple of conversations with President Trump in recent months. We flagged an interest in more discussions and I think what President Trump said today just reflects that.\n\n“We’re speaking up for and standing up for our national economic interest.”\n\nMost of the US tariff regime has been put on pause. A 90-day reprieve on the imposition of tariffs above the 10% baseline is due to expire in July.\n\nChina, the main target of the tariff regime, is the exception: 125% tariffs on Chinese goods, with carve-outs for Chinese-made smartphones, computers and semiconductors, are in place. They are in addition to a 20% tariff related to the US fentanyl crisis.\n\nChina has responded with 125% tariffs on US-made goods.\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told business network CNBC on Tuesday, US time, that a compromise on tariffs had been struck with one country – a parliamentary democracy – though he would not say which one.\n\n“I have a deal done,” Lutnick said. “But I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give its approval, which I expect shortly.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-says-talking-australia-001050466.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:10:50","author":"Ben Doherty","authors":["Ben Doherty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":316210944,"title":"UCP proposes sweeping changes to Alberta’s provincial election laws","text":"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith delivered a note of congratulations — along with a sharply worded warning and a blanket condemnation — to Prime Minister Mark Carney and his new Liberal government on Tuesday.\n\nIt comes the same day her government proposed the Election Statutes Amendment Act, which would make sweeping changes to provincial election rules, including making it easier for citizens to call for a referendum on seceding from Canada.\n\nIn a statement, Smith urged Carney to immediately reset Ottawa’s relationship with her province, accusing the Liberals of undermining Alberta’s resource-based economy for a decade.\n\n“I will not permit the status quo to continue,” she wrote.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, Smith said more than 300 members of Parliament were elected because they stood on a platform to get resources developed, while the federal NDP and the Green Party were “crushed” and the Bloc Québécois “lost ground” because they were opposed.\n\n“I would hope that the current prime minister understands that his mandate comes from moderate voters who actually want this province to be a genuine energy superpower,” she said.\n\n“I guess the ball will be in (Carney’s) court to see how he responds,” she said, adding she hopes she can work with him to find common ground.\n\nSmith wrote that she will see about steps to shield Alberta from what she calls “future hostile acts” from Ottawa.\n\nThe Liberals were returned to power in Monday’s federal election in a minority government.\n\nTuesday’s proposed bill will change citizen-initiated referendum rules to require a petition signed by only 10 per cent of the eligible voters in a previous general election — down from 20 per cent of registered voters. Applicants would also get 120 days, rather than 90, to collect the signatures.\n\nSmith said it would have been introduced by her Justice Minister Mickey Amery regardless of what the outcome of the election was.\n\n“We haven’t seen any citizen-initiated referendum – that also suggested to us that people just thought it was pointless to try to go out and try to get that many signatures,” she said.\n\n“We wanted to recalibrate to be able to allow for voters to express an interest,” she said.\n\nIf passed, the bill will also make dozens of changes, many mirroring those already legislated on the municipal level by Smith’s United Conservatives, including banning voting tabulator machines and reintroducing corporate and union donations.\n\nSmith, in her statement, praised Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who lost his long-held seat in Ottawa, calling him a “true friend of Alberta” who advocated for anti-tax and pro-resource policies, and drove debate in the country for years.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Smith said she hopes Poilievre stays on as leader.\n\nShe was also asked if she took responsibility for undermining Poilievre’s campaign with her earlier comments to American media that Poilievre was more “in sync” with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nSmith answered that the vote solidified because of federal campaigning in the past two weeks, and “I don’t think I was in the media in the last two weeks.”\n\nShe insisted that she tried to keep herself out of the federal election.\n\n“I know the media kept on trying to draw me in.” \n\n Tweet This\n Click to

about annexing the country.\n\nAlberta has long held a frosty relationship with Liberal governments in Ottawa.\n\nLast month, Smith outlined a list of nine demands for the next prime minister, which includes scrapping the greenhouse gas emissions cap and ditching a ban on single-use plastics “so we can start using straws again.”\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Smith warned of an “unprecedented national unity crisis” if her demands weren’t met within six months.\n\nLater, she said she would strike a second Fair Deal Panel — one she would dub the “What’s Next” panel — to “listen to what it is that Albertans want to do in consequence.”\n\nIt all came as some, including former Reform Party leader Preston Manning, have warned of a sovereignty reckoning from westerners frustrated by the thought of four more years of Liberal government.\n\nSmith said Tuesday it’s up to Albertans, not her government, to put the separation question on a referendum ballot, but said the issue is bubbling to the surface because they “feel hurt and betrayed.”\n\nOpponents, including Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi, have criticized Smith for flirting with Alberta separatism in the midst of a trade tariff war with the United States.\n\nNenshi told reporters Tuesday that attacking Carney the first day after his election victory is not a winning strategy to negotiate a good deal for Alberta.\n\n“(Smith’s) going to spend millions of dollars on another fair deal panel, yet another panel, to appease her base that she won’t do anything with.”\n\n— with files from Jack Farrell, The

first 100 days — and challenges the president faces","text":"WASHINGTON — White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told The Post in a rare interview Tuesday that President Trump’s first 100 days had been a smashing success — but there is more to do.\n\n“Well, like in school, you get grades for different things, so for productivity, I’d give us an A+,” said Wiles, 67, citing Trump’s 142 executive orders signed since his swearing-in Jan. 20, his successful crackdown on illegal immigration, and his work on securing foreign investment in the US and trade deals with America’s biggest economic partners. \n\nBy contrast, Wiles gave the Trump White House an “incomplete” on their efforts to reverse the worst outcomes wrought by their predecessors.\n\n“Where I would say there was not just sort of great, amazing success is perhaps our underestimation of the size and scope of the government that Joe Biden left us,” she said. \n\n“The economy, the war between Russia and Ukraine, the budget, the taxes writ large, which I consider to be different than the budget, the sort of institutional resistance to even recognizing that we’ve been ripped off by foreign nations that require us to do tariffs.\n\n“Within the system, there’s not even the ability, in many cases, to recognize that the patient was very sick and dying a slow death and needed some, you know, some serious and quick resuscitation.”\n\nWiles, the first-ever female White House chief of staff, was instrumental in getting the administration ready to hit the ground running the ground in the West Wing. \n\nThe co-chair of Trump’s 2024 campaign recruited a loyal staff, many coming from the trail and pledging to be faithful to the president’s agenda and avoid chaos in the second administration.\n\nWiles, nicknamed the “ice maiden” by Trump, said that she has never seen her role as being a gatekeeper for the president — a core historical function of her position — and that she wants him to have access to the people that matter.\n\n“I want him to have more inputs, not less, more information, not less, more people talking to him, not fewer. So I don’t really think that’s gatekeeping, per se. That’s the way he works best, and that’s what he wants,” she said.\n\n“I view my responsibility as making sure he gets unvarnished information and complete truth. And however many people it takes to get there, and whoever they are — of course, within reason — we actually encourage it.”\n\nWhile most modern presidents have set 100 days as the benchmark for early success Wiles argued a better metric will be how the administration does in the next six months.\n\n‘If peace is not achieved… it can’t be achieved’\n\nWhen discussing the White House’s goals for Trump’s first months, Wiles said that while Trump hopes to quickly settle the Russia-Ukraine war, it simply may not be achievable.\n\n“The president has devoted 100 days and his very top people to Russia and Ukraine, and if peace is not achieved, it will be because it can’t be achieved. It just cannot,” she said.\n\n“I don’t know whether that will be the case or not. I mean, it may well be that we can make some headway in the next couple of weeks, but nobody would have tried it but Donald Trump. Nobody would have gotten these people to the table but Donald Trump. And if they want to continue to kill people, while it’s abhorrent, you know, he can’t stop that.”\n\nShe also said that she wasn’t surprised at all when Trump dramatically announced at a Feb. 4 press conference that the US would take over the war-torn Gaza Strip.\n\n“Somebody else said I looked surprised. But no, he’d been talking about it,” Wiles said.\n\n“I was not surprised at all. And he believes it ought to be a freedom zone, a peace zone, and that the only people that can accomplish that is us. And so he meant that, still means it.”\n\nTrump the trade deal ‘closer’\n\n“He’s been extremely hands on. He’s taken a call with virtually every leader of every country… there’s sort of 15 countries that really matter in all of this,” Wiles said of her boss.\n\n“He has either talked to or met with all of them. The team is actively engaged with all of them right now,\n\n“And he’s a closer. So I think, I think what will happen is [Commerce Secretary] Howard [Lutnick], [Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent], [US Trade Representative] Jamieson [Greer], whomever will get a deal and then he’ll close it.”\n\nWiles added that “they’re very close on a couple of countries” — speaking after Lutnick claimed Tuesday afternoon that a deal was “done, done, done” with an unidentified nation.\n\n‘You never get all that you want’ in legislation\n\nTrump said Tuesday afternoon while leaving the White House for a 100-day rally in Michigan that his next 100 days would focus on getting Congress to pass a sweeping series of campaign promises — including ending taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\n“The next period of time, I think, my biggest focus will be on Congress, the deal that we’re working on,” Trump said on the White House lawn. “That would be the biggest bill in the history of our country in terms of tax cuts and regulation cuts, and other things.”\n\nWiles offered a candid assessment of the path forward, which will require Trump to maintain unity among the slim Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n“I think we can get there. The president laid out to the speaker [Mike Johnson] and to the leader [John Thune] his firm priorities. Those things are his priorities. But you know, maybe you won’t go to the mat to them — things that are important, but not in the top tier, and then those things that he would oppose,” Wiles said.\n\n“The Hill is very clear on what he thinks. And you never get all that you want. You go into it that way. But I think we have a great working relationship with both houses, and I think we’ll get most of the things that he campaigned on — in sort of order of importance to him, and that will be done without any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, or any senior benefits.”\n\nNo Cabinet changes coming\n\nWiles also said that she expects that Trump will keep all of his cabinet secretaries through the first year of his term — including those who have taken some heat.\n\n“They’re all spectacular performers, spectacular professionals. It’s a diverse group, and it’s — some of them are very atypical, so you’re never quite sure — but they have been spectacular, and they like each other,” she said. \n\n“They like what they’re doing. They’re committed. It is part of the secret sauce of this administration.”\n\nWiles did not specifically address controversies involving Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who recently fired or demoted five close staffers, ostensibly over leaks.\n\n ‘Zero tolerance’\n\nAsked about the administration’s relationship with the press, Wiles said that she doesn’t think that White House journalists fear crossing the president or the possibility that their credentials will be revoked.\n\n“Only one person in the whole 400 or however many credentialed press have been removed [from the pool], one. So if there’s a fear factor, I feel that it’s unfounded, because 1/400th of the press corps isn’t a reason to be fearful,” she said.\n\n“And I think, I think at some level, while there are many views about the president’s agenda and what we’re doing and what he ran on, maybe they don’t all agree with that, but I think they appreciate the transparency and the availability, particularly coming off of the Biden administration,” Wiles said.\n\n“They like the ability to be able to ask the president [questions]. He doesn’t have really much of a press gatekeeper either. He’s available — people call him on a cellphone. So I think at some level, that’s appreciated by members of the media.”\n\nIn another major change from Trump’s first term, West Wing in-fighting has been substantially reduced, which Wiles credits to careful picking of staffers.\n\n“We have zero tolerance for leaks. It doesn’t mean there aren’t any, but we have zero tolerance for it. And we take serious precautions to prevent it where it’s important,” she said.\n\n“Some things don’t matter if they leak. I think we’re transparent, so transparent that they’re not that many things to leak about. You know, if you try to keep everything the secret, then anything that gets out is a leak. We’re the reverse of that. I also think the team is really good and understands the nature of what it means to be a team member.”\n\nWiles said many of the staff have known each other for years and that “we picked the staff with deliberateness to make sure we didn’t have you know people who were trying to become a star or necessarily make a name for themselves, but we’re really here for the president’s mission.”\n\n“We don’t have arguing and fighting,” she said. “We don’t have as many leaks. It’s much more cohesive.”\n\nNear the close of The Post interview, Wiles volunteered that Trump is enjoying his second stint in Washington. \n\n“The president is having fun,” she said. “Yeah, everything is reported to be so deadly serious and described as such a pressure cooker. And you know, that’s true, but the president is enjoying being president, being able to fulfill the commitments he made to the voters, making new friends and meeting new people, at the same time enjoying being back in the White House, back in Washington.”","summary":"The White House chief of staff told The Post the US \"was very sick and dying a slow death\" after four years of Joe Biden.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/29/us-news/susie-wiles-gives-behind-the-scenes-look-at-a-first-100-days-and-the-challenges-trump-faces-ahead/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103553540.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dsldUYiF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:05:14","author":"Diana Glebova,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":316208862,"title":"Tariff uncertainty threatens to raise drug prices and stall medical innovation, experts warn","text":"LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- In this time of fluctuating tariff talks, many are concerned and confused about what it will cost us.\n\nPresident Donald Trump put most of them on hold for now, but when it comes to paying for medications, tariffs could have some long-term consequences.\n\nAt various pharmacies, customer uncertainty is bringing worry especially for those already spending more than they can afford.\n\n\"One inhaler is $60 to $100 in order for me to get a breathing treatment,\" said Lucky Goodrich of Los Angeles.\n\n\"Of course we get lots of calls, lots of inquiries and people want to know what's going on,\" said Sherri Cherman of Elements Pharmacy in Studio City.\n\nTrump says he believes tariffs would drive drug makers to open manufacturing plants in the U.S., which would ultimately lower costs for Americans and create more jobs. Economists said the industry doesn't work that way.\n\n\"It's just completely different,\" said Bill Padula, a scholar with the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.\n\nHe said unlike other products, pharmaceutical prices are locked in with insurance companies at the start of every year.\n\n\"What pharmaceutical manufacturers may be in the position of is having to lower their price so that the price plus the tariff equals what health insurers will continue to expect as the cost of things,\" he said.\n\nThe result is that drug companies will take the hit first.\n\nBut down the line, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, estimated a proposed 25% tariff would boost drug prices by as much as 12.9%.\n\nExperts say the raw ingredients for almost all medications are manufactured overseas, which means it could drive up cost even for drugs manufactured in the U.S.\n\n\"Even if there's a 25% tariff on the drug itself being imported, the increased tariffs on active or raw ingredients that go into a drug could increase the total cost by 40%,\" Padula said.\n\nHe added another potential consequence of drug makers making less profit means less money toward research and development for breakthrough treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases.\n\n\"So in the long run, Americans could pay by not having the availability of new innovative medications,\" Padula said.\n\nIs there a better solution? Padula said tax credits for drug makers have worked before. One example is the 1980s Orphan Drug Act which he said helped reduce costs and incentivize innovation.\n\n\"We saw instantaneous responses from the pharmaceutical industry trying to find ways to take existing drugs and create new indications for them,\" he said.\n\nBut tax credit legislation on a federal level takes a very long time to pass, so Padula said local action would be faster.\n\n\"These credits could be deployed at the state level and incentivize manufacturers coming back to certain states,\" Padula said.\n\nAt the cash register, Cherman said worry has prompted some customers to get as many prescriptions filled as possible, but she tells her customers change will be slow.\n\n\"I feel like there's going to be a lot of negotiation between the drug industry and the government before we finally see what might happen,\" she said.","summary":"In this time of fluctuating tariff talks, many are concerned about what it will cost us.

In his latest partial reversal of tariff policies, the Republican president agreed to provide carmakers with credits for up to 15% of the value of vehicles assembled domestically. These could be applied against the value of imported parts, allowing time to bring supply chains back home.Auto industry leaders had lobbied the administration furiously during the weeks since Trump first unveiled his 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The levies, aimed at forcing automakers to reshore manufacturing domestically, had threatened to scramble a North American automotive production network integrated across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

I feel compelled to write it:\n\nI know our president 55 years. He was then a nobody kid out of school. Me a nobody kid reporter. Small NYC dinner party. Me: “Who are you?” Him: “I’m Donald Trump.” Me: “So what’s a Donald Trump?” Roy Cohn overhearing said: “One day this kid is going to own New York.”\n\nFlash forward. Donald’s office. Night of his first election. Just us. Waiting for the results. Standing, not breathing, riveted to one another in a room of workers. Nobody but us standing together alone. Even family behind barricades. Staring at wall-size TVs, he whispered to me: “You remember what Roy said?” I said: “Yes.”\n\nNeither of us said one word afterward.\n\nA lifetime later, the Donald I know hugged me tight at his first inauguration as Melania stood watching. He’s flown me on his jet cross-country. When I had to move because my husband wasn’t well, Donald brought his experts in to create my security system. When life was difficult, his pilot flew my husband and me around our beloved NYC in his helicopter.\n\nI’ve shared Donald’s own downhill slides. I was alongside the night he opened his superfabulous Atlantic City hotel. But I was also there when that hotel went bust and he went flat, and Mayor David Dinkins and I were traveling together on a tiny junky crowded airplane — two seats across. Donald behind us, rumpled into a too small too tight seat. Where were we all headed? I don’t remember. But did he say anything about his change of circumstances? Refer to it? Remind me of the glory days of his jet and helicopter? No. Not one word.\n\nMy point is, I have gone to his weddings. I have been to his Mar-a-lago. But I have seen him flat, too. We’ve all seen him high, mighty, up in the clouds, sending instructions directly to God — but he has also known what it’s like when the world gets tough. He pulls in, he pulls tough. He pulls through.\n\nDo we speak on the phone? Yes. Has he sent me notes? Yes. So, world, take it easy. Give him time. He knows what it’s like to win — and lose. He’s done both. Who’ll be better? Clattering Kamala? Musk who’s either a genius or a jerk? The Kennedy guy whose kinfolk didn’t even want him, while Donald’s family are superstars? How about California’s governorlite who doesn’t know his spit from a hole in the ground? Or Hillary’s former aide? She married creep Weiner whose main accomplishment was flashing his wiener and she’s now marrying the son of a man who funds anti-USA protests?\n\nListen, half of us can’t even clean our desk drawers in three months, so give him time. Little of his doings with Putin, Zelensky or some zero elected to Congress can be done privately. This world, decisions, choices, ideas are all out there for TV’s elves to massacre. Besides reading off their prewritten scenarios, little’s left to do besides attempting to destroy him.\n\nGive him time. Space. Respect. If he did nothing, we’d be down his throat. He moves too fast — we’re down his throat. Who’d be better? Ventriloquist Jill Biden? Barack’s wife, the climber? You don’t love him? So, OK. Give him time. Donald’s no dummy. He’s smart. Think you can do better? Fine. Great. Meanwhile, just shove your clothes in the washing machine — and wait.\n\nAnd let us all honor other persons of immense accomplishments. Many — scrabbling for attention — came up in the world with only 20 cents in their pockets, but another few thou in their clothes lining.\n\nOnly in Washington, kids, only in Washington.","summary":"Give President Trump time.

(AP) — An Iraqi man living in upstate New York has been charged with illegally voting in the 2020 election, according to U.S. prosecutors, who said Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency assisted in the investigation.\n\nAkeel Abdul Jamiel, 45, was living in South Glens Falls, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Albany, when he voted in Saratoga County “fully knowing he was not a United States citizen,” according to an April 25 charging document.\n\nHe is charged with voting by aliens, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\n“Election security is and will continue to be one of the FBI’s highest national security priorities,” Craig Tremaroli, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Albany field office, said in a Justice Department news release.\n\nAttempts to reach Jamiel were unsuccessful. Messages emailed to addresses used by Jamiel in the past either bounced back or didn’t result in an immediate response. A message was also left at a phone number listed for Jamiel in a court filing in an unrelated lawsuit. Court records did not indicate whether he has an attorney.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has blamed widespread voter fraud for his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election, despite analyses showing that claim was false. Public records indicate Jamiel registered as a member of New York’s Conservative Party the month before the election.\n\n“Only American citizens can vote in American elections,” the Justice Department post said. “Thanks to our partnership @DOGE, this DOJ has charged an Iraqi man for illegal voting in the 2020 election.”\n\nIt isn’t clear who Jamiel voted for in the election. In a 2019 lawsuit, however, he identified himself as a Trump supporter.\n\nIn the suit against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Jamiel claimed his rights were being violated because New York was too tolerant of illegal immigration. He included several letters in the suit that he had sent to the White House complaining that America was “under invasion” by people entering the country illegally. Jamiel also included a letter he had received from the White House in response, signed by Trump, thanking him for his correspondence.\n\nSince DOGE was established by Trump to reduce waste and fraud in government, its staffers have scrutinized departments managing the government workforce and federal properties. The prosecutor’s office did not elaborate on DOGE’s role in the investigation of Jamiel.","summary":"Akeel Abdul Jamiel, 45, was living in South Glens Falls, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Albany, when he voted in Saratoga County “fully knowing he was not a United States citizen,” according to an April 25 charging document.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/29/us-news/iraqi-man-charged-with-illegally-voting-in-2020-election-in-ny-doge-helped-investigation/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/sample-ballot-inserted-new-york-103557201.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dsldUYiF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:44:46","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":316211334,"title":"At BRICS Summit, Brazil Warns Against Protectionism Amid Trump Tariff War","text":"Foreign ministers from the BRICS group of developing nations failed to reach a joint communique on Tuesday after meeting in Rio de Janeiro, but chair Brazil issued a statement speaking out against trade protectionism.In the statement, Brazil said the group's foreign ministers expressed \"serious concern at the prospect of a fragmented global economy and the weakening of multilateralism\".The United States has implemented a new tariffs-focused trade policy under President Donald Trump, raising concerns about a global economic slowdown, although the statement did not name the U.S.The expanded BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa as well as new joiners Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran, faces daunting challenges from U.S. trade actions.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"The ministers voiced serious concerns about the rise of unjustified unilateral protectionist measures inconsistent with WTO rules, including indiscriminate raising of reciprocal tariffs and non-tariff measures,\" the statement said.Brazilian Foreign Relations Minister Mauro Vieira told journalists the BRICS ministers had reached a consensus on the tariffs issue, saying it could be seen in the statement issued by the South American country.He added that the nations were working to have a final joint statement at their July summit, also in Rio de Janeiro.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Foreign ministers from the BRICS group of developing nations failed to reach a joint communique on Tuesday after meeting in Rio de Janeiro, but chair Brazil issued a statement speaking out against trade protectionism.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/at-brics-summit-brazil-warns-against-protectionism-amid-trump-tariff-war-8290957","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/id88612c_brics-meeting_625x300_30_April_25.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:42:49","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":316206204,"title":"Olivia Colman shocks with her choice of crumpet topping as she is the latest Hollywood star to appear in a Warburtons advert","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton share tender moment in new photo to mark 14 years of marriage\n\nControversial Irish rappers Kneecap DROPPED from top music festival after they told cheering concert-goers to 'kill your local MP' - as pressure mounts for Glastonbury to axe them from its line-up\n\nNotorious hackers are 'behind M&S cyber raid': Retail giant calls in Scotland Yard as finger is pointed at gang that blackmails firms for millions\n\nTruth about £1million YouTubers Jonathan Joly and Anna Saccone and trans daughter they're accused of exploiting as they creep back from deleting 3,000 videos\n\nSARAH VINE: The Queen asked just ONE thing of Harry and Meghan.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:01 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:40 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nOti Mabuse has opened up about having a 'toxic' relationship with her body image after spending her career as a professional dancer.\nThe former Strictly star, 34, who quit the show in 2022 after seven years, admitted it has been a 'continuing journey' to rebuild a healthy relationship with body.\nOti said part of the journey is accepting that she no longer has a dancer's body after going through 'ups and downs' and welcoming her baby daughter.\nSpeaking to Prima magazine, Oti discussed her body image struggles, how she has adjusted to motherhood and a possible return to Strictly Come Dancing.\nDetailing her early thoughts as a child about her body, Oti said: 'Growing up, I always thought that the people who did the best (in dancing) were the thinnest, and you always felt like, \"If I need to be successful, I need to look like that.\" And I think it's not just Latin and ballroom dancers, it's across the board.\n'All dancers, we always feel like that. And so we then have this very toxic relationship with our bodies, and even when you walk into the room, and if you've lost weight, they go, \"Oh my gosh, she looks so good.\"\n\nOti Mabuse has opened up about having a 'toxic' relationship with her body image after spending her career as a professional dancer\n\nThe former Strictly star, 34, who quit the show in 2022 after seven years, admitted it is a 'continuing journey' to rebuild a healthy relationship with body\n\nOti discussed how dancer's are often judged on 'how small they are' (pictured in 2016)\n'And it's like, \"Wait, do I look good because I'm small, or do I just look good in general?\" Words hold power over a lot of us as women. So it's trying to rebuild that relationship and it's a continuing journey. \n'It will be every day, I guess, for the rest of my life, that I'll just have to work on that relationship, and hopefully by talking about it, it's going to create more of a conversation around the fact that we need to build our relationship with our bodies in a very healthy way.'\nDespite her previous struggles, Oti revealed she has now found peace with her body, telling the publication: 'I'm now coming into the world as a human being who used to dance, not as a dancer. I still dance, but I'm a person first, before the dancer.\n'My body has had its ups and downs; the gaining of the weight, the losing of the weight, having the baby. It's been such a rollercoaster, but I think it's normal to experience that as a woman. Yes, there are some moments where I feel, \"Oh my gosh, I'm not happy with what I look like,\"... \n'And then I have to say to myself in the mirror \"No, you are good. You are perfect. You have had a baby, you've had a human being come out of you. It's okay to not look perfect, as long as you move, as long as you're trying to be healthy.'\nOti's time on Strictly was hugely successful and she walked away a two-time champion following successive wins with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey.\nReflecting on her time on the show, she said: 'When I look back on Strictly, I think the whole seven-year journey was amazing. I still work on the show. I still do choreography, I'm still talking to the producers.\n'I say that the show brought me everything, like me sitting here today, and the relationship still very much continues. There were ups, there were downs; if you can imagine being the first Black anything, anywhere, there will always be ups and downs.'\n\nOti said part of the journey is accepting that she no longer has a dancer's body after going through 'ups and downs' and welcoming her baby daughter\n\nSpeaking to Prima magazine, Oti discussed her body image struggles, how she has adjusted to motherhood and a possible return to Strictly Come Dancing\n\nOti's time on Strictly was hugely successful and she walked away a two-time champion following successive wins with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey\n\nReflecting on her time on the show, she said: 'When I look back on Strictly, I think the whole seven-year journey was amazing'\n\nOti is married to fellow professional dancer Marius Iepure, who she shares a little girl whose name is unknown, after giving birth in November 2023\nOti confessed she is regularly asked whether she would ever return to the show and she teased that is a case of 'never say never' \nShe said: 'Everyone asks me [if I'd return to Strictly]. I think right now, with a daughter and everything I'm doing, I'm quite busy, and I'm happy with what I'm doing at the minute. But never say never. The doors are always open, which is really, really nice. \n'Aljaž [Škorjanec] went back and he's doing really well. I went back to choreograph with him and he's just in a different space. He's absolutely sensational. So, you never know.'\nOti is married to fellow professional dancer Marius Iepure, who she shares a little girl whose name is unknown, after giving birth in November 2023.\nElsewhere in the interview, Oti spoke about when she first moved to London and she immediately felt at ease being in an interracial couple.\nShe said: 'When I lived in Germany [where Oti moved to broaden her dancing horizons, appearing on the German version of Strictly], Marius and I used to come to London. The best dance school was in Croydon, and all the best couples would go there. \n'I remember the first time we'd be walking the streets, and there were so many interracial couples. I would say to Marius, \"There's us! There's us! Oh, there we go again!\" And I was just like,\n'Wow, where have I been living? Why am I not here? I just see so many multicultural couples,' and it felt like, 'I need that diversity in my life.' And when I came here, every time we took a lesson, we'd always take a walk. It just felt amazing; it felt like I belonged.'\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Oti spoke about when she first moved to London and she immediately felt at ease being in an interracial couple\n\nOti also touched on her experiences as a mother as she described it as her 'most challenging journey yet'\n\nThe June 2025 issue of Prima is now on sale\nOti also touched on her experiences as a mother as she described it as her 'most challenging journey yet'. \nShe said: 'Motherhood is amazing. It's really incredible. But if I'm being brutally honest, it's also the most challenging and exhausting journey of self-discovery that you will ever be on. \n'I have a one-year-old who's very expressive but doesn't speak, so when something's happening, I don't know what's going on. But she's so incredible, fun and so determined. \n'She's like a little me – and it scares the life out of me, because my mum didn't know what to do with me and I moved to another continent. \n'So now I'm like, \"I will follow her wherever she goes. If she's going to a jungle in the Amazon, we're moving to the jungle in the Amazon.\" She's a very determined child and it's exhausting trying to keep up, but I love it.'\nThe June 2025 issue of Prima is now on sale \nBill BaileyStrictly Come DancingLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOti Mabuse reveals 'toxic' relationship with her figure and no longer having a 'dancer's body' after leaving Strictly as she teases return to the show\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But soon, Woods started his truck. He pulled away and drove west, the officer said. And a Sangamon County jury on Tuesday learned what happened next, through video and dramatic courtroom testimony.\n\nJurors saw Woods’ headlights descend north, in the darkness, into the southbound lanes of I-55 near Springfield. They saw the fiery crash that followed, along with the smoke and debris spread across the expressway. They saw how Woods’ truck landed on its passenger side. They heard how glass wound up in the eye of one victim, while his wife suffered the “worst pain ever.”\n\nFinally, the jury saw a Mercury Sable, crumpled and crushed by the GMC Sierra, holding the body of Lauren Wegner, 35, of Skokie. The panel heard a Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy label her death “obvious” at the scene. And they learned her body had to be identified later by her fingernail polish.\n\nAfter the crash, jurors were told, Woods complained “it was only supposed to be me.”\n\nWoods survived that crash on Nov. 8, 2022, near Springfield’s southern border. Now he’s on trial for first-degree murder over Wegner’s death. At the time of the crash, Woods faced up to nine years behind bars for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a sweeping pardon in January to nearly everyone convicted for their role in that riot.\n\n“Lauren died because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Special Prosecutor Derek Dion told the jury while delivering his opening statement in Woods’ murder trial Tuesday. “And she couldn’t get out of the way.”\n\nCrucial to the trial, the prosecutor explained, will be whether Woods knew he “had a strong probability of causing great bodily harm or death” when he drove his truck into oncoming traffic on Interstate 55 near Lake Springfield. Dion and his co-counsel summoned 17 witnesses Tuesday to make their case.\n\nDefense attorneys Mark Wykoff and Daniel Fultz chose to save their opening statement until after prosecutors finish calling their witnesses. Wykoff and Fultz have so far told the jury that Woods plans to testify, and they’ll hear about the Capitol riot, alcohol and suicide.\n\nThe defense team also focused Tuesday on a police report that cited reckless homicide — not first-degree murder — as among the original reasons for Woods’ arrest.\n\nWykoff and Fultz will likely begin calling witnesses Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWegner’s parents and their supporters watched the trial from the front row of Sangamon County Judge Ryan Cadagin’s courtroom Tuesday. They stepped out of the courtroom at times to avoid graphic video of the crash scene.\n\nWoods, who is in custody of Sangamon County officials but was dressed in a blue-plaid shirt and blue tie, could sometimes be seen holding his head in his hands while jurors viewed the wreckage.\n\nProsecutors also played footage from an Auburn bar known as Benderz. An acquaintance of Woods testified she saw him there on Nov. 8, 2022. She said he seemed drunk but happy. A former bartender there testified Woods drank “vodka cranberry.”\n\nA forensic scientist testified that Woods’ blood-alcohol concentration was later measured at 0.141%, well above the legal limit of 0.08%.\n\nFormer Divernon police officer Patrick Hurley, who confronted Woods before the crash, explained to jurors how he pulled Woods over after spotting his speeding truck on I-55. Hurley told jurors his wife’s step-sister was in a relationship with Woods at the time.\n\nWoods pulled off I-55 at exit 88. That’s when Woods allegedly complained about the argument with his significant other. He allegedly mentioned suicide and his pending prison sentence, as well.\n\nIn dash-cam video, Hurley could be heard telling another officer that Woods was “involved in that Capitol deal.”\n\nMoments later, after Woods allegedly fled the traffic stop and drove the wrong-way onto I-55, Hurley told the jury, “All I seen was a ball of fire.”\n\nThe crash injured a couple from Granite City driving home from Chicago by way of Decatur. Kathryn Roustio explained how she’d been on her phone, leaning back in her seat in their Toyota Corolla, at the time of the crash.\n\n“I didn’t see what was coming at us,” Kathryn Roustio testified. “It was like an explosion.”\n\nStephen Roustio testified that glass wound up embedded in his body, including in his eye. Both said they’re still being treated for their injuries.\n\nAs for Wegner, Dion told the jury the crash broke “just about every bone in her body.”\n\nBefore court adjourned for the day, prosecutors also summoned Woods’ sister, Michelle Hemberger, to testify. She told the jury how she saw her brother at a hospital after the crash, and that he was “very very upset and said that he killed someone.”\n\nHowever, Hemberger quibbled with Dion when the prosecutor pressed her over whether Woods told her that night what he meant to do.\n\n“He did say, ‘I wish it would have been me,’ or something to the like,” Hemberger said.\n\nDion pressed her further, on a statement she’d previously made to police.

Bush.\n\n5 Number of presidents' faces there may soon be on the Mount Rushmore monument if congressional Republicans get their way and carve Mr Trump's stern features alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt on the iconic sculpture.\n\n11 Percentage fall in the number of foreign tourists visiting the US in March. \n\nExperts say visitors are frightened off by increased border scrutiny.\n\n24 Number of days Mr Trump – who once berated Mr Obama for doing the same thing – has spent playing golf.\n\n25 Record-breaking number of hours –without pausing to eat, sit down or take a break – that Democrat Senator Cory Booker spent making a marathon speech about Mr Trump's policies in the Senate.\n\n43 Percentage probability of a US recession, according to a survey of economists in March.\n\n50 Number of minutes that Mr Trump spent verbally mugging Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February.\n\n71 Percentage plunge in Tesla profits in the first three months of the year that has been in large part blamed on the unpopularity of the car giant's boss, Elon Musk, as well as Mr Trump's tariffs.\n\n95 Percentage probability that bookies in January gave Canada's Conservative Party of winning this week's election. \n\nThen Mr Trump started bullying his neighbour with tariffs and talk of it becoming the 51st US state, prompting a backlash and allowing the Liberals to cling to power.\n\n142 Record number of executive orders that Mr Trump signed in his first 100 days, including 26 on day one. \n\nHowever, his opponents are fighting back in the courts, arguing that they are unconstitutional.\n\n185 Tally of countries and territories listed by the Trump administration this month as targets for sweeping 'reciprocal' tariffs. \n\nThe list included the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic that don't even have people on them.\n\n238 Venezuelan migrants shipped off to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador after the administration accused them of being gang members. \n\nUS officials declared them 'alien enemies' under a rarely used 1798 law that allows the government to deport citizens from an invading country.\n\n381 Number of books removed from the library of the US Naval Academy as part of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's crackdown on what he says are the 'woke' social policies of the Pentagon.\n\n7,180 Record low number of illegal Mexico border crossings in March. \n\nThe monthly average was 155,000 over the past four years during the more migrant-friendly Biden administration.\n\n121,000 Approximate number of federal government employees who have lost their jobs as part of sweeping cuts to the three million-strong workforce.\n\n$5m Price deep-pocketed foreigners may be able to pay for a Trump 'Gold Card', a visa to allow what he called 'very high-level people' to buy their way into living in the US.\n\n$2.2bn Amount the Trump administration has said it will freeze in government grants to Harvard. \n\nAmerica's most famous and richest university is paying the price for rejecting White House demands that it introduce more political diversity and clamp down on campus anti-Semitism.\n\n$800bn Total that a delighted Nato Secretary General, Mark Rutte, said other members were 'pouring in' to the military alliance after Mr Trump warned that the US wouldn't support them in a conflict if they didn't contribute more resources.\n\n$5 tn Amount wiped off the value of shares on Wall Street in just two days after Mr Trump announced his Liberation Day and swingeing import tariffs that plunged the global financial system into one of its worst ever crises.","summary":"It has certainly been a roller-coaster ride as he has announced policies with an unprecedented forcefulness and pace, making his -

Gretchen Whitmer just weeks after she made the trek to Washington to advocate for the state. \n\n“For decades, they’ve been trying to save this facility,” Trump told the crowd. “I didn’t realize that. … I heard about it from some people, including your governor, who has done a very good job. She came to see me. \n\n“That’s the reason she came to see me, by the way, to save Selfridge, and she was very effective along with some of the other politicians and some of the military people that love this place and what it stands for.”\n\nTrump thanked Whitmer for bringing Selfridge to his administration’s attention, joking he’s “not supposed to do that” because she’s a Democrat. \n\nThe governor appeared among other government representatives behind Trump, including Republican state House Speaker Matt Hall and Senate Leader Aric Nesbitt. \n\nThe A-10, also known as the “Warthog,” Trump said, was “an incredible plane.” He recalled the original Selfridge field’s first take off in 1917, its legacy in training Tuskegee airmen during World War II and other “generations of Michigan patriots” and its history as a “crucial pillar of North American air defense” as the largest military airspace complex east of the Mississippi River. \n\nAdding Michiganders “have feared for the future of the base” and the $850 million economic impact it represented for the state, Trump said, “Wow. Wouldn’t that have been a shame to close?”\n\nIt was a sentiment shared by other dignitaries on site, who lauded Trump’s leadership in ushering the new fighter mission forward. \n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth thanked him “for restoring the warrior ethos” and rebuilding the military at large. Woven into his announcement, Trump trumpeted a proposed $1 trillion defense investment. \n\nHall said it was the “first time in decades” they could say “Selfridge is winning” because of the new mission. “No one else could save Selfridge,” he said. \n\nWhitmer‘s remarks were also brief, sharing gratitude for the announcement itself and the work that went into it.\n\n“I am really damn happy we’re here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge,” she said. “It’s crucial for the Michigan economy. It’s crucial for the men and women here, for our homeland security and our future.”\n\nIn a separate statement released Tuesday, the governor called the investment a “huge, bipartisan win” for Michigan that was “decades in the making” to help grow the local economy and keep the country safe. \n\n“Since day one, I’ve been laser-focused on securing a new fighter mission at Selfridge and supporting the brave service members who step up for our communities every day,” Whitmer said. “I appreciate the president’s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.”\n\nRogers, too, credited bipartisan leadership with Tuesday’s announcement. \n\nAlthough centered in Macomb County, he pointed to the air space historically utilized by the base’s training pilots up over Lake Huron and toward Alpena. The new mission, he said, continues that history and the role pilots who train at Selfridge play around the world. \n\n“This is a huge kind of influencer within that training capability here. And then, of course, they’re always training for their war fighting mission, so they deploy overseas,” Rogers said. “The A-10 unit was in Jordan last year. They’re scheduled to go to a yet-to-be disclosed location this coming year in ’26. Then, as soon as they come back now, they’re going to be in this transition to a new aircraft. So, it’s a very exciting time.”\n\nThe rollout of the F-15s, he said, was expected to begin in 2028. \n\nAlthough the initial personnel numbers will remain the same, Rogers said the incoming change overall will mean an expansion in footprint for the base. \n\nIn addition to the F-15s, they’re also set to replace eight KC-135 Stratotankers with 12 new KC-46 Pegasus refueling tankers. \n\n“Selfridge will be growing with those two new aircraft coming in,” Rogers said.","summary":"It was an announcement met with brief cheers and applause from more than 250 service members who greeted President Donald Trump in a hangar on base.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/trump-touts-new-fighter-jet-mission-at-selfridge-shares-credit-with-effective-whitmer.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/7BO2ILXYCBF33HGYLDESVG4Z6E.JPG?auth=a13aa8d0f524f7b79a97961bb7d6767083ff6ae595d8cf252831dea3920a330e&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:34:49","author":"Jackie Smith","authors":["Jackie Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.111},{"id":316213662,"title":"Trump targets sanctuary cities like Chicago with new orders: 'This administration already has it in for us'","text":"President Donald Trump signed three executive orders addressing immigration enforcement Monday night, including targeting officials who uphold sanctuary city laws and boosting access to the military for state and local law enforcement.\n\nObservers said it’s the latest in a series of actions demonstrating how the administration “has it in for” sanctuary cities like Chicago.\n\nOne of the orders signed by Trump orders state and federal officials to publish lists of jurisdictions often referred to as sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal officials’ efforts to arrest immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nA second order signed by Trump calls for increasing access to excess military for state and local law enforcement. It also calls for bolstering legal support for officers accused of wrongdoing while carrying out their official duties.\n\nTrump also directed the office of Attorney General Pam Bondi to set up a system that would provide legal aid and financial protection to law enforcement officers “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”\n\nA third order reinforces an existing federal law requiring English-language proficiency as a requirement for commercial motor drivers.\n\nThe executive orders are the latest effort to crack down on immigration and target sanctuary cities — and Chicago — by the Trump administration.\n\n“This administration already has it in for us,” said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.\n\nThe executive order to make a list of all the sanctuary cities that don’t comply with federal immigration laws doesn’t do anything new, Tsao said.\n\n“So far as putting a list together, we know that the state of Illinois, Cook County and the city of Chicago are already on that list. How do we know that? Because the Justice Department is already suing us over our welcoming policies,” he said.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Trump administration has gone after Chicago for its sanctuary policies, he added.\n\n“The first Trump administration also went after the city of Chicago by trying to take away federal police grant funding that was issued through the Justice Department,” he said. “The city of Chicago sued, and the city of Chicago won.”\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson wasn’t immediately available for comment about Trump’s latest orders. Earlier this month, the mayor took his running feud with the president to another level when he characterized Trump’s threats to withhold billions in federal funding from sanctuary cities as “terrorism.”\n\n“Trying to force your will to break the spirit of working people in order to have a conversation — that’s terrorism. And we’re not going to negotiate with terrorists,” Johnson said then.\n\nTrump’s executive orders are the latest in a series of shots taken at the city that has long been one of his favorite political punching bags.\n\nBefore Trump’s inauguration, border czar Tom Homan warned Johnson to “come to the table or get out of the way” of mass deportations where Chicago will be “ground zero.”\n\nIn March, Johnson, along with mayors of other sanctuary cities — Michelle Wu of Boston, Mike Johnston of Denver and Eric Adams of New York — were grilled by conservative lawmakers in a high-stakes congressional hearing. \n\nChicago has been a sanctuary city since March 1985, via an executive order from Mayor Harold Washington that has since been passed as an ordinance.\n\nThe city’s sanctuary city status does not block federal agents from lawfully carrying out their jobs. The ordinance calls for the city to not cooperate with immigration officials.\n\nContributing: Dorothy Hernandez, AP","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/04/29/trump-executive-orders-sanctuary-cities-law-enforcement","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dbe5800/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5031x2872+0+241/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F29%2Fc7%2F52cacfa54d42b032a4ca6a06e6c9%2Ftrum","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:34:41","author":"Adriana Cardona-Maguigad | Wbez,Violet Miller","authors":["Adriana Cardona-Maguigad | Wbez","Violet Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":316204720,"title":"Kathy Hochul and lawmakers’ budget deal isn’t just late, it’s reckless too","text":"It took Gov. Kathy Hochul and lawmakers an extra month to agree on this fiasco?\n\nLegislative leaders and the gov sealed a budget deal Monday, nearly a month after the deadline.\n\nYet the plan — with its mind-blowing $254 billion price tag, $15 billion more than last year — risks fiscal disaster within just months.\n\nIt makes zero provision for cuts in federal aid that are clearly coming, nor does it prepare for a possible slip in tax revenue should the economy slow.\n\nInstead, the state — which already boasts the highest tax burden in America — will hike taxes yet again, this time via a $1.4 billion-a-year payroll surcharge that will slam workers and consumers.\n\nSo much for Hochul’s “affordability agenda.”\n\nAnd no, the gov’s one-time “refunds” for roughly 8 million lower-income New Yorkers ($200 for singles, $400 for married couples) don’t make for affordability: They’re naked “re-elect me” bribes. \n\nMeanwhile, the deal bakes in huge budget shortfalls for coming years.\n\nAnd, again, almost certainly for this year: Hochul and the Legislature’s leaders “plan” for dealing with federal cuts is to . . . head back to Albany in a few months to (most likely) impose new taxes that they’ll surely blame on President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.\n\n“The month-late state general budget agreement fails to address the imminent threat facing New York: looming federal budget cuts,” thundered the Citizens Budget Commission head Andrew Rein. \n\n“Instead of shoring up the state’s fiscal foundation, lawmakers are dramatically increasing spending the state cannot afford in the long run.”\n\nYes, Hochul’s aides say the gov got almost everything she sought in her bid to fix the discovery laws (which govern evidence-gathering in criminal cases) and to expand involuntary commitment of the mentally ill.\n\nThey say the tweaks to discovery, for example, will make it harder for defense attorneys to get judges to toss out cases on absurd technicalities; let’s hope the fine print of the actual bills bears that out.\n\nMeanwhile, her proposed ban on public masking got watered down to a triviality, and thus almost an invitation for masked goons who terrorize Jews and shut down campuses to keep it up.\n\nMainly, New York’s “leaders” agreed to up both spending and taxing — and to kick the hard questions a month or three down the road. \n\nNo wonder so many taxpayers keep moving out of state.","summary":"Gov.

New Democrat has ruled himself out of leadership contention — B.C. Premier David Eby, who says Singh's successor will face a \"massive job\" to rebuild the party.\n\nDespite the party's hammering in the province, B.C.'s three members still represent the largest provincial faction in the federal NDP caucus of seven.\n\nKwan, who won her seat by the widest margin among the three surviving NDP incumbents, said they have to focus first on making sure their constituents are heard in Parliament.\n\n\"The leadership conversation will unfold in due time, and I'm sure that there will be a process for that,\" Kwan said. \"But for the most immediate moment, what I'm thinking about is the work ahead of me.\n\n\"It's not about me. It is about bringing a strong Van-East voice to the House of Commons, fighting for people and making sure that their concerns and their issues are not lost in the process.\"\n\nB.C. Opposition leader John Rustad of the provincial Conservatives also chimed in on the election results, saying he would like Prime Minister and Liberal Leader Mark Carney to address issues beyond those \"from the south,\" referring to the trade war and annexation talk emanating from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\"They need to be addressed obviously, but it is much broader than that,\" Rustad told reporters.\n\nHe said Canada's quality of life had been declining for the last decade, and B.C. had \"all this potential\" that was being wasted.\n\nPolitical scientist Prof. David Black said the collapse of the New Democrat vote raised the prospect of a U.S.-style two-party system in Canada.\n\nBlack, at the school of communications and culture at Royal Roads University in Victoria, said the possibility of such a \"structural realignment\" was \"one of the most intriguing questions to emerge\" from Monday's vote.\n\nBlack said while it is possible that voters in Canada may return to the \"conventional multi-party system\" after the tariff and annexation threats from the United States dissipate, there's also a chance the voting pattern will carry on.\n\nUniversity of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said he didn't believe the vote split in Monday's vote — where the Liberals and the Conservatives combined to take 85 per cent of the popular vote — is a \"permanent state.\"\n\nHe says the heightened anxiety likely pushed voters toward the two major parties.\n\n\"I think NDP has got its work cut out for it, to take some time off and to step back and reflect on what direction they would like to go under a new leader,\" Prest said.\n\n\"And once they do that, I think they will still be in a position to offer up an alternative that will speak to a subset of the population, because even during this campaign we did hear them speaking about issues that the other two major national parties were not.\"\n\nBlack said there was no way to know yet if it's a permanent restructuring.\n\n\"I think, given the recklessness of the Trump White House, I don't think we will know finally until the next presidential election (in the United States),\" Black said.\n\nKwan said party isn't worried about its long-term survival, citing her previous experience as a Vancouver councillor and a provincial legislator under the B.C.

The celebrations — performances by artists, speeches by leaders and former soldiers, and a squadron of jets — focused not just on the past but on the future.\n\n“National reconciliation does not mean forgetting the history or erasing differences, but accepting different perspectives in tolerance and respect, to work towards a greater goal: building a peaceful, unified, powerful, civilized and prosperous Vietnam,” Communist Party general secretary To Lam said in an article published on a government website. \n\nHe said that the war had historical roots and had resulted in divisions in the country, but now Vietnam was armed with “lessons of its past.”\n\n A change in emphasis \n\nThe emphasis on reconciliation and not, like previous years, on military victory reflected how Vietnam was approaching the changing tides of the global economy and geopolitics today, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. He added that the Vietnam War remains central to how the Communist Party framed its legitimacy, not just as a military triumph but also as a symbol of national unity. But To Lam’s comments underlined that the reconciliation remains unfinished.\n\n“The war still defines Vietnam’s unity, and its unresolved divides,” Giang said.\n\n A time for peace \n\nPham Ngoc Son is a 69-year-old veteran who was an army truck driver bringing troops and supplies from the north to the south through the Ho Chi Minh trail — the secret route used by North Vietnam. He's on a weeklong tour of the city, which he remembers entering as a part of the northern troops that took over. \n\nHe said he cherished those memories and couldn't describe the joy he felt at that moment. But now there was ”only space for peace and friendship\" between the U.S. and Vietnam.\n\n“The war is over a long time ago,\" he said.\n\nNguyen Thi Hue, a resident of Ho Chi Minh city, agreed. \n\n“The war has ended and we shake hands (with the former enemy) for development. Now it’s time for peace. Peace is the dream that everyone in the world wants,” Hue said.\n\n A new relationship \n\nThis year also marks the 30-year anniversary of diplomatic ties between Vietnam and the United States. In 2023, Vietnam upgraded its relations with the U.S. to that of a comprehensive strategic partner, the highest diplomatic status it gives to any country and the same level of relations as China and Russia.\n\nVietnamese officials insist that this relationship has been built on a bedrock of trust intrinsically linked to U.S. efforts to address war legacies such as Agent Orange and unexploded bombs in the countryside that still threaten lives. The future of those projects is now at risk because of the Trump administration’s broad cuts to USAID. Moreover, the export-dependent country is vulnerable in a global economy made fragile by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans.\n\n Who's took part in the parade? \n\nAbout 13,000 people, including troops, militias, veterans and local citizens, were expected to take part in the parade. And, apart from China, troops from Laos and Cambodia also were due to attend the parade, which will march on the main boulevard leading to the Independence Palace before branching out through the streets in the city. The route will also pass the U.S. Consulate in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a video of Chinese troops singing the iconic “As If Uncle Ho Were With Us on Victory Day” during an earlier rehearsal was shared widely on social media. Chinese leader Xi Jinping had visited Vietnam earlier in the month in a bid to present the country as a force for stability in contrast with Trump. \n\nClose ties with Washington helped Vietnam balance its relations with its much larger and more powerful neighbor China, said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. Vietnam is among the countries involved in maritime disputes related to the South China Sea.\n\n Tariffs pose questions \n\nBut the Trump administration’s focus on tariffs — Vietnam was slammed with reciprocal tariffs of 46%, one of the highest — puts a “big question mark” on what the U.S. wants to achieve in Asia, she said. Focus on economic and not strategic competition may mean that Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia become less important for the U.S.\n\n“It really will be shaping up (on) how the new administration sees the strategic picture in the Indo-Pacific and where countries like Vietnam would fit in,” she said.\n\nHau Dinh contributed to this report.","summary":"Vietnam marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the war with the U.S. and the formation of the modern nation","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/united-states-communist-party-ho-chi-minh-city-donald-trump-xi-jinping-b2741919.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/30/00/Vietnam_War_Anniversary_72577.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:31:27","author":"Aniruddha Ghosal","authors":["Aniruddha Ghosal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.458},{"id":316207272,"title":"Trump slams Republican ‘grandstanders’ opposing budget bill, predicts massive US tax increases if it fails","text":"During a Michigan speech marking his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump slammed Democrats and Republican \"grandstanders\" opposing his \"big beautiful\" budget reconciliation bill — saying that if they succeed Americans will see the \"highest tax increase in history.\" He said that his bill has \"100 percent, just about Republican support,\" but said it \"would be nice if we had just a couple of Democrats just to make sure, because, you know, every once in a while, you have a grandstander Republican.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SONIA HORON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:25 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:29 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nThe director of the upcoming 'Freaky Friday' sequel revealed she 'begged' Jodie Foster for a nostalgic cameo, but the star refused. \n'Freakier Friday' reunites Lindsay Lohan, 38, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 66, the stars of the beloved 2003 body-swapping film, while Jodie, 66, originated the role in the 1976 Freaky Friday that launched the franchise.\nNisha Ganatra, the director of the upcoming movie, revealed she tried to get Jodie to join the film — which is set to hit theaters August 8 — to no avail.\n'We begged her,' Ganatra, 50, told Entertainment Weekly, before revealing that Jodie declined. 'She's not going to do it.' \n'Honestly, we tried everything,' the filmmaker shared, explaining that she 'never found out why' the Silence of the Lambs star refused. \n'We were going to make her the principal at the school,' Ganatra said, in reference to the school Lohan's character Anna goes to.\n\nJodie Foster, 66, refused to do a nostalgic cameo in the upcoming Freakier Friday film, despite the director 'begging' her; pictured in February \n\nThe Freaky Friday sequel reunites Lindsay Lohan , 38, and Jamie Lee Curtis , 66, the stars of the beloved 2003 body-swapping film\n\nJodie originated the role in the 1976 Freaky Friday that launched the franchise; pictured in a still\nThe 'Freaky Friday' franchise launched with the 1976 hit starring Foster and Barbara Harris.\nBefore Lohan and Curtis led the successful 2003 remake, the series saw some TV movie sequels and a stage musical adaptation.\nFoster previously recalled her contrasting experiences as a child actor in 1976, starring in the family friendly 'Freaky Friday' and the Oscar-nominated, R-rated 'Taxi Driver.'\n\n Fans are all saying the same thing about Freakier Friday trailer \nIn Taxi Driver, Foster, who was 12-years-old at the time, played the role of Iris Steensma, a teen prostitute. \n'[My mother] really wanted to make sure that I would go back and forth and do different kinds of movies and so that people wouldn't pigeonhole me as one type of character,' she said in a 2002 interview with NPR.\n'And at that time, you know, Freaky Friday was probably the first feminist movie out there for youngsters.'\nFreakier Friday will follow a similar plotline to the first movie in which Lohan and Curtis' characters switch bodies - but with a big twist.\nThe official trailer kicks off with Lohan (Anna) and her mom Curtis (Tess) talking to a fortune teller - played by SNL alum Vanessa Bayer.\nAs she gave them a reading, the fortune teller could be heard saying, 'Your lifelines... it's like they've intersected before! You've walked in each other's path.'\nLindsay and Jamie then looked at each other and pretended to be shocked over the revelation.\nHowever, the fortune teller added, 'You learned a lesson. A lesson that may serve you again.'\nThe next morning, Lohan and Curtis wake up to shockingly realize they were no longer in their bodies and loudly scream into the mirror as they peer at their reflections.\n\n'We begged her... Honestly, we tried everything,' Nisha Ganatra, 50 (pictured) the director of the upcoming movie, told Entertainment Weekly, before revealing that Jodie declined \n\nGanatra added that she 'never found out why' the Silence of the Lambs star refused to do the cameo; Foster seen in February at the Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nFoster previously recalled her contrasting roles at age 12 in 'Freaky Friday' and the Oscar-nominated 'Taxi Driver,' where she played a teen prostitute, noting her mother's desire to avoid her being 'pigeonholed'; seen in a 1976 still from Taxi Driver \n\nBut all is not what it seems when Lindsay's daughter Harper (Julia Butters) and soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily (Sophia Hammons) appear to also be involved in the switch as well. \nCurtis can then be seen dramatically saying, 'My face looks like a Birkin bag that's been left out in the sun to rot!'\nThe rest of the teaser shows snippets as the family figure out how to reverse the switch while pretending to be each other in their normal daily lives.\nAt the end, Curtis and Lohan strolled down a sidewalk while glammed up, with Jamie telling Lindsay, 'Okay, I'll let you know when it's time for you to make your sexy grand entrance.'\nShe replies with, 'Sexy grand entrance?' and the scene cuts to Chad Michael Murray pulling up in a motorcycle and removing his helmet.\n'Oh, like that,' Lohan says out loud which concluded the trailer.\nThe premise of the sequel is: 'Years after Tess and Anna endured an identity crisis, Anna now has a daughter and a soon-to-be stepdaughter.\n'As they navigate the challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might strike twice,' per an IMDB synopsis.\nOther stars that have been cast in the movie include Manny Jacinto, Mark Harmon, Ryan Malgarini, Haley Hudson and Christina Vidal Mitchell.\n\nFreakier Friday will follow a similar plotline to the first movie in which Lohan and Curtis' characters switch bodies - but with a big twist; the duo seen April 3\n\nThe 2003 movie raked in $160.8 million in the box office on a budget of $26 million; Lindsay and Jamie Lee seen in a still from the Freakier Friday trailer\n\nThe 'Freaky Friday' sequel is set to hit theaters August 8\n\nLate last year in November, Lindsay appeared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon and reflected on reprising her role of Anna alongside Curtis in the sequel.\n'It's just been such a labor of love to make happen,' she gushed. 'Jamie [Lee Curtis] and I... even at the table read, we were just smiling so big that we couldn't...\n'I don't think we were acting well because we were so happy. But the movie's funny - it's really funny,' the Mean Girls actress added.\nFreaky Friday (2003) earned positive reviews from critics upon its release and earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.\nThe movie also raked in $160.8 million in the box office on a budget of $26 million.\nJamie Lee CurtisJodie FosterLindsay Lohan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJodie Foster REFUSED Freakier Friday cameo with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Nahh, SHE-OUT!! 40% Off EVERYTHING + FREE 1-Day Shipping!\" The texts touted \"Lower Prices, Faster Shipping!!\" with a discount code labeled \"SHEOUT40.\"Newsweek reached out to Fashion Nova for comment on Tuesday.Why It MattersShein and Temu, two China-based e-commerce companies, will raise prices for U.S. customers starting next week. The move follows the closure of a key import loophole, part of a new policy driven by President Donald Trump's push to reduce the trade imbalance with China through higher tariffs.Until now, Americans could buy inexpensive goods from China and Hong Kong without paying tariffs or filling out customs forms. That exemption is ending, likely driving up costs for both retailers and consumers.What To KnowMultiple versions of the text message circulated on social media, all using the same \"SHE-OUT\" code—a not-so-subtle jab at Shein, which is currently grappling with a trade crackdown that ends the duty-free \"de minimis\" exemption for imports under $800 from China and Hong Kong.One version of Fashion Nova's text message featured the phrase \"Better Quality, And Faster Shipping!\"—a direct shot at Shein's reputation for cheap products and slow delivery.\"This is a full-blown diss track in SMS form,\" one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Fashion Nova is funny as hell for that Shein text. Give the marketing team a RAISE!\" another user added.Behind the marketing drama is a serious pricing shift for shoppers. The average price of Shein's top-selling women's clothing items rose by 8 percent last week, with some categories like health and beauty up by 51 percent. One kitchen towel set spiked 377 percent in price.In a statement on its website, Shein confirmed that the tariff increase will be included in the listed price. Customers won't have to pay anything extra upon delivery.E-commerce companies have been the biggest users of the widely used exemption. As many as 4 million low-value parcels—most of them originating in China—arrive in the U.S. every day under the soon-to-be canceled provision.A Congressional Research Service report released last month found these low-value packages totaled $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion just five years earlier in 2018. About 67 percent of imports using the loophole came from China from 2018 to 2021, according to the report.What People Are SayingShein said on its website earlier this month: \"Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up.\"William Alan Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Newsweek: \"Getting rid of 'de minimis' will hurt those companies in the short term, but it appears they have concluded their customers are willing to tolerate slower delivery if they can still get favorable prices.\"What Happens NextStarting Friday, shipments arriving through the U.S. Postal Service will be hit with a tariff equal to 120 percent of the package's value or a flat fee of $100—whichever is higher. That fee will rise to $200 in June.","summary":"Starting Friday, shipments from the Chinese retailer arriving through USPS will be hit with a tariff equal to 120 percent of the package's value.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fashion-nova-trolls-shein-over-trump-tariff-price-hikes-2065910","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2635656/fashion-nova.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:28:56","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":316205252,"title":"Trump says Michigan Congressman looking to impeach him is a “lunatic”","text":"WARREN, MI – President Donald Trump said a Michigan congressman who called for his impeachment is a “lunatic” during his visit to Warren commemorating his first 100 days in office Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“They’ve gone totally crazy,” Trump said, referring to Democrats during the April 29 rally at Macomb Community College’s Sports and Expo Center in Warren.\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) introduced seven articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump Monday, April 28 claiming the president is unfit to serve in office. \n\nRead More: Michigan Congressman introduces articles of impeachment against President Trump\n\nThe president referred to the congressman as “some guy I’ve never heard of.”\n\nTrump said when first heard on television that Thanedar was calling for his impeachment, he asked the First Lady, “did I just hear I’m being impeached again?”\n\nThanedar specifically pointed to Trump’s refusal to cooperate with a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling regarding the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The Court ruled last week that Trump’s administration must facilitate Garcia’s return to the U.S. so proper due process can be followed in that case.\n\n“The Court said the wrongfully deported Kilmar Garcia must be allowed to return and receive due process,” Thanedar said. “Trump ignored it. He ignored the Constitution. He ignored the very checks and balances that keep our Democracy intact.”\n\nThanedar, who represents Michigan’s 13th Congressional district, went on to say the actions weren’t an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern. Thanedar accused Trump of obstruction of justice, violations of first amendment rights, creation of an unlawful office (Department of Government Efficiency), and more.\n\nThe move to impeach Trump is highly unlikely to gain traction in Congress as both the House and Senate are Republican controlled. The introduction of the articles comes as Thanedar faces public challenges for his seat, well ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTrump’s visit comes the same day White House officials said he will sign an executive order to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts.\n\nRead More: Auto tariff relief: Trump to sign executive order on day of Michigan trip\n\nAs part of his Michigan visit, Trump also announced his administration’s plans to put a new fighter-jet mission at Selfridge. The plan calls for 20 F-15EXs to be stationed at Selfridge.\n\nRead More: Trump lands at Selfridge, makes big announcement at Michigan air base\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was at the base for the announcement, called it a game-changing fighter mission that her administration has advocated for. Whitmer did not join Trump at the rally.","summary":"President Donald Trump responded to the recent call for his impeachment during his visit to Michigan Tuesday afternoon commemorating his first 100 days in office.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/trump-says-michigan-congressman-looking-to-impeach-him-is-a-lunatic.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/4KYC3A4VFRHW7NE3SXARXFEFEM.JPG?auth=ebf0322ccc49f6c6a68f802cf74f5ac06e80337426bf40a264938582c1026d7c&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:28:55","author":"Sophia Kalakailo","authors":["Sophia Kalakailo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":316216766,"title":"Trump marks tumultuous first 100 days in office with rally in Michigan","text":"Speaking at a rally in Michigan to mark his first 100 days in office, US President Donald Trump has promised to bring back jobs to the United States.\n\nDubbed an “achievement speech” by the White House, the rally on Tuesday at the Macomb County Community College comes amid slumping approval ratings and dismal consumer confidence as Trump has pursued norm-busting trade, immigration and government overhauls.\n\nStill, Trump hailed what he called “the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country”.\n\n“And that’s according to many, many people,” he added. “And everyone is saying it… We’ve just gotten started”.\n\nThe president walked onto the stage to God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood, as he did on the campaign trail.\n\nHe quickly shifted to his familiar rally fare, saying his administration was “ending illegal immigration”, “taking back our jobs”, “restoring the rule of law” and getting what he called “woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government”.\n\nHe also took jabs at former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, continued his years-long attack on the US media and falsely claimed that Democrats attempted to “rig” the 2024 election.\n\nTrump then pivoted to his tariff policy, which has roiled global markets and caused disquiet among industry leaders.\n\nHours earlier, Trump signed an executive order seeking to ease some tariff pressures amid pushback from US auto manufacturers. The order would prevent “stacking” of Trump’s various tariffs on auto part imports for vehicles manufactured in the US.\n\nHis administration has imposed 25 percent tariffs on foreign auto imports, blanket 10 percent levies on nearly all trade partners, 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, as well as 25 percent tariffs on trade with Mexico and Canada not covered under a pre-existing deal.\n\nTrump has framed the moves as part of a hard reset to force industries back to the US, a claim he repeated to reporters in his Michigan speech.\n\n“They all want to come back to Michigan and build cars again,” he said. “You know why? Because of our tax and tariff policy.”\n\nMichigan significant\n\nReporting from the rally, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said the location was significant. Trump won the so-called battleground state of Michigan in the election last year, but the state, and its reliance on the auto industry, could be one of the hardest hit by his tariff policy.\n\n“We’re just about 20 miles [32km] down the road from Detroit, Michigan. That’s the home of the ‘Big Three’ automakers: General Motors, Ford and Stellantis,” Culhane said.\n\n“We’ve seen automakers really come out against these tariffs because virtually no car is made completely in the United States, as Donald Trump wants to see happen,” she said.\n\n“Meanwhile, in the crowd, you see a lot of T-shirts that say ‘UAW’, the United Auto Workers union. The union came out in favour of these tariffs because they believe, in the long run, it will force companies to bring jobs back to the US.”\n\nRecent polls have shown the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters at the Michigan rally is not reflected among the wider public, with nearly every major pollster finding higher disapproval than approval for the president in recent days.\n\nThese included separate Morning Consult and New York Times/Siena polls that showed 54 percent disapproval, a Marist College poll that showed 53 percent disapproval and an Ipsos poll that recorded 55 percent disapproval.\n\nTrump dismissed the polls as “fake” and run by a “bunch of crooked people”.\n\nHours earlier on Tuesday, The Conference Board, an organisation that tracks views on the US economy, released new data showing tanking US consumer confidence.\n\nConfidence fell 7.9 points to 86 in April as Trump’s tariff rollout caused widespread economic uncertainty, the lowest level since May 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no new trade deals have been reached since the country-specific tariffs were announced, and then paused, Trump told his supporters that officials were “coming from all over the world to see your president”.\n\n“They want to make a deal,” he said.","summary":"President pledges to bring jobs to US in &#039;achievement speech&#039;, as tariff policies continue to cause economic disruption.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/29/trump-delivers-speech-in-michigan-marking-one-hundred-days-in-office?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25119807421993-1745965866.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:26:27","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.471}]}
