On Dec. 14, the couple was found dead at their Brentwood home in what police are investigating as an apparent homicide. The following day, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that one of the couple’s sons, 32-year-old Nick Reiner, was in police custody and booked on suspicion of murder. That same morning, the President wrote in part on Truth Social, “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.” During Monday’s episode of “The View,” the co-hosts addressed the antisemitic terror attack in Australia, the mass shooting at Brown University, as well as Trump’s remarks about the legendary director’s passing. At one point, host Ana Navarro blasted the President, saying in part, “I’m going to say it. Damn it, there’s an American family grieving. This is a tragedy – Not just for the family, but for all who knew and loved him and for the President of the United States to make this about him and a way to attack Rob Reiner, because he exercised his American right to speak up with what he disagreed with is shameful [and] is disgraceful.” Later, Whoopi Goldberg issued a similar take, sharing, “Have you no shame? No shame at all. This is — can you get any lower? I don’t think so.”","url":"https://www.accessonline.com/videos/the-views-whoopi-goldberg-ana-navarro-blast-donald-trumps-post-about-rob-reiners-death","image":"https://prod-accessonline-be.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/the_view_rob_trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 02:00:00","author":"Access Contributor","authors":["Access Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":387294628,"title":"What to know about Rob Reiner and wife Michele’s deaths","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nFlowers rest on director Rob Reiner's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 15, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

It comes after Mr Trump threatened the BBC with a billion-dollar litigation for selectively editing one of his speeches in an episode of Panorama. The scandal unfolded earlier this year after a leaked memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to “fight like hell”. Speaking at a press conference on Monday afternoon in Washington, Mr Trump said: “In a little while, you’ll be seeing I’m suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth literally. They had me saying things that I never said. We’ll be filing that suit probably this afternoon or tomorrow morning.” After the report, which was written by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee, was leaked, BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised on behalf of the BBC over an “error of judgment” and accepted the editing of the 2024 documentary gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action”. The programme was broadcast a week before the US election in November 2024. The fallout from the report also led to the resignation of both the director-general Tim Davie and the head of news Deborah Turness. Despite the apology, Mr Trump said he would proceed with legal action for “anywhere between one billion dollars (£759.8 million) and five billion dollars (£3.79 billion)”. Mr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US and is currently engaged in legal action with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. BBC News reported that the broadcaster had set out five main arguments in a letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim. The BBC has been contacted for comment.","url":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-says-file-lawsuit-33063406","image":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article32905394.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 22:17:38","author":"Tom Burnett","authors":["Tom Burnett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":387295100,"title":"Donald Trump Abruptly Interrupts Speech After Spotting Ivanka Trump Lookalike | Access","text":"Donald Trump veered off script during a White House Christmas reception on Dec. 14, after spotting a seemingly familiar face in the crowd.

Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote.\n“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” he added before ending with, “May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\nAs Us previously reported, Rob and Michele were found inside their home on Sunday, December 14. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” a spokesperson for the family said. “We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”\nPer TMZ, Rob and Michele “suffered lacerations consistent with a knife,” and the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the matter.\nRob and Michele’s son Nick Reiner was arrested by the LAPD and is currently in custody over allegations of murder. Nick struggled with drug addiction for years. In 2016, he spoke to People about being homeless for a period of his life.\n“I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas,” Nick, 32, said. “I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun.”\n“I met crazy great people there, so out of my element. Now, I’ve been home for a really long time, and I’ve sort of gotten acclimated back to being in L.A. and being around my family. But there was a lot of dark years there,” Nick told the outlet at the time.\nRob wed Michele in 1989. The duo shared three children: Nick, son Jake and daughter Romy. The director also had an adopted daughter, Tracy, with his first wife, Penny Marshall.\nFollowing the news of his murder, countless celebrities spoke out to honor Rob.\nFormer President Barack Obama wrote, “Michelle [Obama] and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele.”\n“Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action,” Obama, 64, added. “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired. We send our deepest condolences to all who loved them.”\nKathy Bates, who won an Oscar for her role in Rob’s film Misery, said, “I loved Rob. He was brilliant and kind, a man who made films of every genre to challenge himself as an artist.”\nBates, 77, added, “He also fought courageously for his political beliefs. He changed the course of my life. [Michele] was a gifted photographer. She shot my beautiful photos for the Misery campaign. My heart breaks for them both. My thoughts are with their family.”","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/donald-trump-claims-rob-reiner-was-killed-over-trump-derangement-syndrome/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donald-Trump-Rob-Reiner-Post-.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1998px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=86&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 21:55:21","author":"Kaitlin Simpson,Ryan Naumann","authors":["Kaitlin Simpson","Ryan Naumann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":387295586,"title":"Meghan McCain Reacts After Landman Pokes Fun at The View","text":"Meghan McCain subtly clapped back at The View after they mocked the talk show on Taylor Sheridan’s series Landman.\nOn Sunday, December 14, McCain, 41, wrote, “I love Taylor Sheridan 😆,” via X after reposting Variety’s article “Landman Slams The View: Taylor Sheridan Script Mocks Hosts That ‘Hate Millionaires and Trump and Men and You and Me.”\nDuring an episode of the Paramount+ drama series, which aired on Sunday, December 14, Billy Bob Thornton’s character, Tommy, urged his father, T.L. (Sam Elliott), to watch a TV show like The View to waste time. When T.L. didn’t know what the show was about, Tommy revealed that it was a talk show about “a bunch of pissed-off millionaires bitching about how much they hate millionaires and [Donald] Trump and men and you and me and everybody else they got a bee up their ass about.”\n“It’s pretty funny,” Thornton’s Tommy said.\nAfter T.L. responded that the show didn’t “sound funny” to him,Tommy explained that it’s not “joke funny,” but more like “‘fart in church’ funny.”\n“That don’t sound funny either,” T.L. shared before Tommy clarified, “Well, it depends on your proximity to the fart.”\nMcCain was previously a cohost on ABC’s The View from 2017 to 2021.\nSince her departure, McCain has opened up about how she believes that it is a “show with a lot of demons that started in the beginning, and none of those demons have been exorcised.”\n“There is an expectation you won’t survive,” the daughter of former United States Senator John McCain told Variety in October 2021. “When you come in as a host, you are a rotating peg on a carousel, and you’ll be in and out.

At a certain point, I made the decision it was more important to be honest than to be liked.”\nThe View — currently hosted by cohosts Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Ana Navarro and Alyssa Farah Griffin — has made headlines for discussing political issues and hot button issues including Jimmy Kimmel’s brief suspension from ABC following his comments the host made about Charlie Kirk.\n“You can not like a show and it can go off the air, someone can say something they shouldn’t and get taken off the air. … The government can not apply pressure to force someone to be silenced,” Goldberg, 70, explained on an episode of The View in September, before addressing Trump, 79, saying, “I don’t understand how you are the man in charge of the nation and you still don’t understand how the First Amendment works.”","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/meghan-mccain-reacts-after-landman-pokes-fun-at-the-view/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-914608164-Meghan-McCain-Reacts-to-Landman-Poking-Fun-at-The-View.jpg?crop=0px%2C65px%2C1333px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=40&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 21:29:02","author":"Caitlyn Somers","authors":["Caitlyn Somers"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":387293660,"title":"Honduras election official says ‘disturbances’ preventing vote recount  - Dominica Gazette – Dominica &amp;","text":"The head of Honduras’s National Electoral Council (CNE) has decried acts preventing the ongoing recount of the Central American country’s presidential election, as a regional body said there was no reason to suspect fraud in the November 30 vote.\n\nAna Paola Hall’s statement on Monday came amid ongoing protests and unrest over the unresolved election. Nasry Asfura, a right-wing businessman publicly supported by US President Donald Trump, has held a razor-thin lead over his top opponent, Salvador Nasralla.\n\nAt least 99 percent of votes have already been counted, but CNE has said that nearly 2,800 ballots will need to be re-examined through a special recount.\n\nIn a post on X, Hall said disturbances seen in the country’s capital, Tegucigalpa, have “prevented the necessary conditions for the special recount to begin”.\n\nObservers have said infighting at the CNE, which is run by three officials each representing one of the major political parties, has delayed reaching the final results.\n\nBoth Nasralla, a conservative, and outgoing left-wing President Xiomara Castro have alleged vote tampering, although several international missions have dismissed the claims.\n\nOn Monday, the Organization of American States (OAS), a regional body, said that despite a lack of expertise in overseeing the election, there was not “any evidence that would cast doubt on the results”.\n\nThe OAS mission “urgently calls on the electoral authorities to immediately begin the special recount and to explore all possible ways to obtain the official results as quickly as possible,” OAS official Eladio Loizaga said in a report he read to the group’s members.\n\n“The current delay in processing and publishing the results is not justifiable,” he said in the report.\n\nThe OAS statement added that its mission of 101 observers from 19 countries “did not observe any malice or obvious manipulation of the electoral materials or computer systems”. The finding was in line with that of a parallel European Union mission.\n\nThe election in Honduras had been in turmoil even before polls opened, with several major parties, political figures, and foreign interference for months casting doubt on the election’s integrity.\n\nThe most prominent scandal involved an investigation by the attorney general into a member of Asfura’s National Party for allegedly discussing plans with a military officer to influence the vote.\n\nThe candidate for outgoing President Castro’s LIBRE party, Rixi Moncada, later told Reuters news agency that the alleged conspiracy proved the election was “the most rigged in history”.\n\nSeveral candidates have also criticised the influence of Trump, who endorsed Asfura in the final stretch of the race and vowed to withhold US funding if his candidate did not win.\n\nThe US president also pardoned former Honduran President and National Party member Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted in the US of drug trafficking, two days before the vote.\n\nAuthorities in Honduras, a country of about 11 million, subsequently issued a fresh arrest warrant for Hernandez.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/honduras-election-official-says-disturbances-preventing-vote-recount/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/afp_694046892b3f-1765820041-Q2ayue.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 21:21:53","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":387293668,"title":"Ukraine claims strike on Russian submarine in Novorossiysk with sea drones  - Dominica Gazette –","text":"Ukraine has carried out a successful underwater drone strike on a Russian submarine in the port of Novorossiysk, causing critical damage to the vessel, its domestic security service says.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said the Kilo-class submarine was knocked out of operation in the first such attack by Sea Baby drones.\n\n“The Security Service of Ukraine carried out another unique special operation and launched a naval attack in the port of Novorossiysk,” the SBU said on Telegram.\n\nThe SBU said the submarine “carried four Kalibr cruise missile launchers” used to strike Ukrainian territory. It suffered “critical damage and was effectively put out of action”, the service said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia on the Ukrainian claim.\n\nThe SBU made its announcement amid a flurry of diplomatic activity as United States, European and Ukrainian officials held talks in Berlin on a US plan to end Russia’s war on its neighbour.\n\nUkraine has been trying to show it can inflict significant damage on Russia, especially after US President Donald Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not “have the cards” in the negotiations.\n\nKyiv has stepped up naval attacks in on what it said were Russia-linked vessels, and continued to carry out attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure as well as military targets.\n\nRussia has escalated attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent weeks and continues to claim advances on the front lines in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said the operation to hit a submarine, a most difficult target to hit, marked “another turning point” in the naval battle between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“This day once again upends the perception of the possibilities of naval combat in this war,” he told the news agency Reuters.\n\nIt will be hard for Russia to repair the submarine because that would have to be done above water, which would mean the vessel would again be exposed to attack, he added.\n\nRussia has now lost one of its four submarines stationed in Novorossiysk, three of which are Kalibr carriers, Pletenchuk added.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/ukraine-claims-strike-on-russian-submarine-in-novorossiysk-with-sea-drones/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/ap_6940527913907-1765823097-hv6crN.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 21:21:50","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":387293670,"title":"Judge in Wisconsin, US faces trial over claims of aiding ICE evasion  - Dominica Gazette – Dominica &amp;","text":"The trial has begun for a Wisconsin judge accused by the administration of US President Donald Trump of helping a man evade immigration authorities, and therefore obstructing the president’s mass deportation drive.\n\nThe proceedings, which began with opening statements from both federal prosecutors and lawyers for Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, could be a bellwether in Trump’s efforts to punish local officials for resisting his federal immigration campaign.\n\nProsecutors allege that Dugan led 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz through a back door after she told agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to speak to the chief judge about whether they were allowed to arrest people in the courthouse.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Keith Alexander alleged that Dugan said she would “take the heat” for helping Flores-Ruiz, who had appeared in court on a state charge.\n\n“[The ICE agents] did not expect a judge, sworn to uphold the law, would divide their arrest team and impede their efforts to do their jobs,” Alexander said.\n\nDefence attorney Steven Biskupic, meanwhile, said the judge had no intention of obstructing agents and was following the court’s policy in directing them to speak to the chief judge.\n\nDugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted on charges of obstruction and concealment.

The White House also announced financial sanctions on three of Maduro’s nephews and six oil tankers and shipping firms linked to them last week.\n\nExperts say the EU’s sanctions differ from those of the US, as they have a political focus rather than targeting the vital oil sector.\n\n“The European Union sanctions have a specific, stated political objective: to pressure people in the regime, not the population of Venezuela, and to preserve humanitarian and diplomatic channels and signal disapproval of human rights violations and the weakening of democracy,” Vitelio Brustolin, adjunct professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, told Al Jazeera.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/venezuela-slams-european-councils-renewed-sanctions-as-futile/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/2024-03-28T024858Z_1224717752_RC2LU6AFW7WU_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-DAILYLIFE-1764894200-1nqzff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 21:21:45","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":0.174},{"id":387292248,"title":"DeSantis warns of dangers of AI, calls for state regulation","text":"Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that artificial intelligence holds immense promise to make lives better through advances such as medical research, but also cited many actual and theoretical perils that he said compel Florida government to intervene and regulate.\n\n“It’s very hard to tell what’s real or what’s not real anymore,” he said, outlining a range of restrictions he wants to place on the companies developing AI.\n\nDeSantis also said that President Donald Trump’s executive order last week designed to block states from crafting their own AI regulations wouldn’t get in Florida’s way.\n\n“The president issued an executive order and some people were saying, ‘Well, no, this blocks the states from doing.’ It doesn’t,” DeSantis said during an event livestreamed from the Florida Atlantic University campus in Jupiter. “An executive order can’t block the states. … Clearly we have the right to do this.”\n\nDeSantis was joined by three parents who outlined the horrors of uncontrolled AI — a child’s suicide and another’s attempted suicide — and by the commander of the South Florida Cyber Crimes Task Force, who outlined other threats.\n\nThe governor isn’t alone in his desire to impose government regulation on AI.\n\nLast week was “Artificial Intelligence Week” in the Florida House of Representatives, during which lawmakers held multiple hearings to consider the impact of the technology and legislation to restrict it. Some of the proposals the governor touted Monday mirror what lawmakers are working on.\n\nInsurance: Proposed legislation would order insurance companies not to rely solely on AI to resolve claims. “We also want to make sure that artificial intelligence cannot be used as the sole determination for adjusting or denying an insurance claim,” DeSantis said Monday.\n\nA House committee last week unanimously voted to advance House Bill 527, sponsored by state Rep. Hillary Cassel, R-Dania Beach, which would require humans to make decisions about denying insurance claims. Insurers could still use AI and algorithms to process claims and make recommendations about approvals and denials.\n\nUtilities: DeSantis also said he wants to make sure Florida utility customers don’t have to pay more for electricity to cover the power needs of enormous data centers, if they locate in the state. That endorsement comes in the aftermath of criticism from consumer advocates that the DeSantis-appointed Public Service Commission has approved rate increases that place an unfair share of electricity system costs on residential consumers.\n\nDeSantis fashioned himself as a champion of residential electricity customers on Monday. “You should not have to pay one dime more in utility costs — water, power, any of this stuff — because of (AI),” DeSantis said. “Making sure that Floridians are protected against that I think is really, really important.”\n\nOther proposals: DeSantis unveiled his list of proposed AI “Bill of Rights” regulations on Dec. 4. They include a proposed requirement that consumers get notified if they’re interacting, including by phone or written correspondence, email, with an AI chatbot.\n\nDeSantis also wants prohibitions on state or local government agencies using Chinese-created AI tools; banning use of chatbots as licensed therapy or mental health counselors; and prohibiting AI use of an individual’s name, image or likeness without their image for commercial purposes.\n\nCan state act?\n\nFlorida’s ability to act is unclear.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump signed an executive order attempting to stymie state regulation of AI — something critics from both parties along with consumer groups see as a favor for big AI companies.\n\nThe president directed federal agencies to identify burdensome state AI regulations and pressure states not to enact them by withholding federal funding or challenging the state laws in court.\n\nDeSantis said he didn’t think it would interfere with the moves he wants to take, and said he believes the state has authority to act unless Congress passes nationwide regulation. A Trump executive order can’t bind the state, DeSantis said.\n\nParents’ warnings\n\nMegan Garcia, of Orlando, described the interactions her son, Sewell Setzer III, had with a chatbot before dying by suicide in February 2024.\n\nShe said the chatbot started to engage in sexual roleplay that amounted to grooming. Engaging with the chatbot, which claimed to be a licensed therapist, she said her son was told that she was “was there waiting for him and he needed to find a way to come home with her.”\n\nGarcia said her son explicitly told the bot that he wanted to die by suicide and it did nothing to inform him that it was AI and he needed to talk to a human.\n\nAlso appearing Monday with DeSantis was the boy’s father, Sewell Setzer Jr. The family is suing the company in federal court.\n\nMandi Furniss, a Texas mother of four, said her family had “every guardrail” involving the internet and social media. They took the kids’ phones every night, blocked apps on their phones, and didn’t allow access to social media. “We thought we did everything right.”\n\nStill, she said her oldest child, a boy with autism, suffered serious consequences from his interaction with a chatbot. Furniss said her son is just finishing treatment in a mental health facility after trying to take his life.\n\nFurniss said the bot told her son that his parents were trying to take his phone away because they didn’t love him, that he should call child protective services and the police when they tried to take his phone away, and that killing them would be justification for taking away the app.\n\n“We lost our son. He’s still alive. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same,” she said.\n\nFurniss also filed a federal lawsuit against the company behind the chatbot; she said it is currently in arbitration.\n\n‘Campaign of misinformation’\n\nMaj. George Perera, commander of the Miami-Dade County Sheriff’s Office Cyber Crimes Bureau and the South Florida Cyber Crimes Task Force, said artificial intelligence has created other ill effects, especially with so-called deep fake images.\n\n“It allows bad actors to create a campaign of misinformation” — and worse. The technology can allow someone to take clothed photographs of children, remove the clothes, and depict them performing sexual acts.\n\nHe said AI can facilitate hacking, using their knowledge of human behavior and interactions “to be able to convince you that this is the right thing to do and to give them money.”\n\nAnd, Perera said, it is happening fast. “Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. There is nothing in the history of mankind that has gotten the traction that artificial intelligence has,” he said.\n\nRapid change\n\nDeSantis said the problems could get worse if the companies are not restrained.\n\n“They’re spending ungodly amounts of money on capital investment for AI. The stocks have gone up, all this other stuff. They have not gotten the return on that investment, not even close yet. And maybe they will,” DeSantis said. “But to the extent they’re not getting it, they are going to find ways to make money, and if they can get more young people addicted to some of these products, if that helps monetize, like that’s their incentive to do it.”\n\nDeSantis, 47, contrasted today’s technology with the bygone era of his youth.\n\n“We didn’t have smartphones. We didn’t have the internet,” he recalled. “And yet, you know what? We had fun. We lived. We enjoyed childhood. I mean we learned. We were productive. We were outside a lot more than kids are today.”\n\nThis report includes information from The Associated Press and the News Service of Florida.\n\nPolitical writer Anthony Man can be reached at aman@sunsentinel.com and can be found @browardpolitics on Bluesky, Threads, Facebook and Mastodon.","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/15/desantis-warns-of-dangers-of-ai-calls-for-florida-to-regulate-the-technology/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chatbots_Teen_Safety_80088.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 20:16:33","author":"Anthony Man","authors":["Anthony Man"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":387290356,"title":"US Bishops’ New Immigration Chairman Responds to Critiques From Catholics","text":"Immigration is a divisive issue, including within the Catholic Church. \n\nDespite the U.S. bishops’ concerted opposition to elements of President Donald Trump’s immigration-enforcement campaign, especially mass deportation, the president’s approach has the support of a majority of American Catholics — including the most sacramentally active.\n\nAccording to a just-released EWTN News/RealClear Opinion Research poll, 54% of Catholic voters say they support “the detention and deportation of unauthorized immigrants on a broad scale.” The level of support is even higher — 58% — among Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly. The Trump administration has deported around 605,000 people since January. The White House has said the focused campaign is a necessary response to more than 10 million undocumented immigrants entering the country during the Biden presidency, but the administration has also deported individuals who have been in the country for more than a decade.\n\nSome bishops contend that political ideology is responsible for the disconnect they’re experiencing with some of their flock on the issue. But other Catholics say that a failure of Church leaders to openly engage the faithful on the issue is part of the problem. \n\nInto the mix steps Bishop Brendan Cahill, the bishop of the Diocese of Victoria in southeast Texas and the new chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) immigration committee. Elected to the USCCB role in November 2024, Bishop Cahill began his three-year term last month, succeeding El Paso’s Bishop Mark Seitz.\n\nAnd he told the Register that improving intra-Catholic conversation on the immigration issue is one of his top goals.\n\n“Among Catholics, I hope we will have moved beyond talking past one another and toward a deeper unity rooted in the Gospel: unity that allows for reasonable disagreement about policy without losing sight of the dignity of immigrants, the wholistic needs of communities, and the common good,” said Bishop Cahill when describing what he hopes to accomplish in the next three years.\n\nIn an effort to help bridge the gap between the bishops and the faithful, the Register shared with Bishop Cahill some of the more common critiques of the bishops’ messaging on immigration, including on topics like the morality of deportation and the relevance of the country’s common good in determining immigration policies.\n\nBishop Cahill, a native of Houston, also reflected upon his experience as a priest and bishop near the southern border and shared his hopes for engaging the Trump administration on immigration enforcement.\n\nBishop Cahill responded to the Register’s questions via email. His responses are republished in their entirety below, with slight edits for clarity and style. \n\nYou are a bishop near the border. How does your own experience as the shepherd of a place like the Diocese of Victoria, Texas, inform your approach to immigration on a national level?\n\nI grew up in Houston, Texas, and was a priest in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston for 25 years before coming to Victoria as the bishop of the diocese 10 years ago. From my very first week as a priest, I’ve celebrated Mass in Spanish and English, and I’ve served with many different cultures: African American, Vietnamese, Korean. Texas has people from all over the world and many priests and religious from many countries. It’s very clear to me that we are one Body in Christ throughout the world, and I see my brothers and sisters in the Catholic faith as united to me in the Holy Spirit. The question of immigration follows the reality of the dignity of the human person, who receives value from God Who created us. Whatever our thoughts and beliefs about the issue of immigration, we are speaking about children of God, and I hope my language would reflect respect for human life and trying to build a culture of life. \n\nAt the November meeting, Bishop Mark Seitz shared with us that there is no ongoing dialogue with the Trump administration over immigration enforcement issues — this despite several high-ranking Catholics in the administration. Is this kind of dialogue important to the bishops, and, if so, how do you think it can be established?\n\nDialogue with any administration, regardless of party, is always important to the bishops. The Church does not align herself with political ideologies; rather, she seeks to bring the light of the Gospel and the moral teachings of our faith into every public conversation that touches on human life and dignity. Immigration is one of those areas where the stakes are profoundly human.\n\nWhen we hear that there is no ongoing dialogue at the federal level, that is naturally a concern, because durable solutions to our broken immigration system will only come through sustained, respectful engagement. The bishops are not policymakers, but we are moral teachers and pastors, and the Church calls all of us to be engaged citizens. \n\nFortunately, we have begun undertaking dialogue in various forms with this administration, though it might not always be readily apparent to onlookers in the media or the general public. There are challenges and points of disagreement, as is inevitable with any government comprised of different perspectives and the Church, but persistence and goodwill on all sides help us to work through those differences. And of course, there are also many shared concerns, including the potential for vulnerable people to be exploited along migratory routes. Even where the proposed response to certain issues may differ, there is always common ground to be found. \n\nUltimately, we seek to foster a shared recognition that immigration is not merely a political problem to be managed, but a human reality calling for just and morally responsive solutions worthy of our great nation. We will remain committed to seeking that dialogue in a respectful way, while staying faithful to the Gospel of Our Lord.\n\nAt last month’s meeting in Baltimore, the bishops issued a rare, nearly unanimous “special message” addressing immigration. The message made an impact in the national news cycle and received praise from Pope Leo XIV. However, the message has been less well-received by some U.S. Catholics, pointing to a broader disconnect between the bishops and some of their flock on this issue. What do you make of this disconnect? How important is it to address it, and how can that be done successfully?\n\nI guess I would need to speak personally to the person who feels disconnected from the statement. There could be a million different reasons that a million different people would feel we don’t connect with them, and I believe we can continue to take time to listen to people. The only way that I feel that I can address this is with the people in my community, and I have had conversations with people who don’t agree with my belief on this issue. Nevertheless, my hope is that we left those meetings with greater respect and a better understanding of each other. At the least, I hope we can stay away from making broad generalizations about groups of people and acknowledge that every child has God-given rights and dignity from conception to natural death.\n\nSome bishops told the Register that resistance to their overall message on immigration comes from placing ideology over the Gospel. But some Catholics have pushed back, arguing that Church leaders not addressing good-faith questions and concerns from the faithful is also part of the problem. In an effort to bridge the gap, I’m hoping you can respond to some of the more frequent criticisms we see.\n\nOne is that the bishops give the impression that deportation is never a morally legitimate immigration-enforcement option. So can you clarify: Is it ever legitimate? Can it ever be done in a way that respects human dignity? If no, why not? And if so, what are the principles for prudently and justly determining when deportation is legitimate and when it’s not?\n\nThe Church does not teach that deportation is never morally legitimate. The Catechism affirms that nations have the right and duty to regulate immigration in the service of the common good. At the same time, that right is not absolute; it must always be exercised in a way that respects the inherent dignity of every human person, the sanctity of life, and the well-being of families (including mixed-status families with a combination of citizens and noncitizens). So yes, deportation can be morally legitimate, especially when individuals pose a threat to public safety or when they’ve exhausted all legal options after appropriate due process. However, for deportation to be morally just, several principles must guide it:\n\n Respect for human dignity at every stage, including humane treatment in custody and during removal, Due process and proportionality, ensuring that enforcement is not arbitrary or excessive, Consideration of family unity, particularly when U.S.-citizen children or spouses are involved, [and] Special protection for the vulnerable, including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking, and those fleeing violence. \n\nWhat the bishops have consistently opposed is immigration enforcement that is sweeping, unnecessarily harsh, or disconnected from these moral principles. A system that relies primarily on mass or sweeping deportation as its solution fails to reflect the balance of justice and mercy that our faith demands and our nation’s history warrants.\n\nAnother criticism is that the bishops do not acknowledge the impact that historically unprecedented levels of undocumented immigration are having on members of American society, including the less privileged. As one commenter on a recent article said, “Where is the equal compassion and consideration for all the millions of legal citizens whose health care, social security benefits, schools, housing, personal safety, etc. have been vitally impacted by the sudden influx?” What is your response to this kind of critique? Should these kinds of considerations be factored into immigration policy?\n\nUnregulated immigration can be a serious and understandable concern; its impact deserves to be understood better and addressed in good faith. The bishops do recognize that communities — especially poorer communities — can feel real strain on schools, housing, health care, and social services. These pressures are not imaginary, and people who feel them should not be dismissed or shamed for raising them. At the same time, Catholic social teaching insists that we must never pit the poor against the poor. Immigrants are generally not the root cause of social and economic struggles in our country, and in many ways the labors of immigrants over the generations have helped this country to amass tremendous wealth. They are our brothers and sisters; that reality does not change based on someone’s immigration status or where they were born. Domestic considerations and the needs of current residents should absolutely be factored into immigration policy. That is precisely why the bishops advocate for meaningful immigration reform — reform that promotes safe and orderly borders, creates reliable legal pathways for workers and family members, and provides an earned path to legal status for longtime residents who contribute in many ways to our country’s prosperity. Such reform benefits both immigrants and citizens. Compassion for immigrants and concern for struggling American families are not competing values; morally speaking, they are intrinsically linked.\n\nFinally, some Catholics question why the bishops are responding so forcefully now, when they did not speak out during the Biden administration’s non-enforcement of immigration laws, which contributed to millions of people entering the country illegally. Others ask why the bishops are communicating more strongly on immigration — issuing a special message, recording video versions of the bishops delivering it — than they have on other issues in recent years, such as abortion, IVF and transgender ideology. How do you respond to those critiques?\n\nThe bishops have spoken consistently on immigration across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic alike. We raised serious concerns during the Biden administration about border management, the asylum system, and the humanitarian consequences of certain policies, including when it came to, for example, the safety of unaccompanied noncitizen children. It may be that some of those statements received less media attention, but our advocacy has never wavered simply because a president of one party or another is in the White House.\n\nAs for why the bishops are speaking with particular urgency now: The circumstances on the ground, especially regarding enforcement practices and their human consequences, have shifted in significant ways. When policies change rapidly and have immediate human impact, we have a pastoral obligation to respond clearly and promptly to what our people are sharing with us.\n\nThis does not mean the Church has been silent on other issues, whether they are points of alignment or disagreement. Different issues, however, call for different forms of engagement at different moments. Immigration is uniquely visible right now because of policy changes and enforcement actions that directly affect families in real time, and these impacts are certainly not isolated to immigrants who entered the United States unlawfully or don’t have a lawful immigration status. Even longtime U.S. citizens have expressed concerns to us, their pastors, and reported negative experiences. No matter what, though, speaking strongly about one issue does not diminish the Church’s commitment to the others. The Church’s concerns span the spectrum of experiences and hardships lived out by the human persons she accompanies, just as Our Lord embodied in his own ministry. \n\nYour term as chairman of the migration committee ends in three years. Where would you like to see the conversation around immigration — both among Catholics and in U.S. politics — be at when you finish your term?\n\nBy the end of my term, my hope is that the conversation among Catholics and all people of goodwill be marked by less polarization and more openness to listening to one another in a spirit of charity. As Pope Francis so often reminded us, and as our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIV, has reiterated, learning to listen to one another is essential. \n\nAmong Catholics, I hope we will have moved beyond talking past one another and toward a deeper unity rooted in the Gospel: unity that allows for reasonable disagreement about policy without losing sight of the dignity of immigrants, the wholistic needs of communities, and the common good.\n\nIn the political arena, my hope is for tangible progress toward meaningful, humane and bipartisan immigration reform, not just executive actions that change from one administration to the next, but stable legislative changes that gives clarity to families, employers, law enforcement and local communities.\n\nAbove all, I hope the national conversation will become more humanized. Behind every statistic is a person: a mother, a father, a child, a brother or sister. If, in three years, we are speaking about immigration with greater seriousness, greater charity and greater respect for one another’s dignity, I would consider that real progress.","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/interview/bishop-cahill-on-usccb-immigration-response","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20251215121244_b3913778ebe0396e02f49ad51034c2a7c0dd4cf94d8201842f701e8c86d1c4bf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 20:06:51","author":"Jonathan Liedl","authors":["Jonathan Liedl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.239},{"id":387292466,"title":"Keir Starmer and European leaders set out six major Ukraine peace deal commitments","text":"Keir Starmer and European leaders have set out six key commitments to support Ukraine if a peace deal is struck with Vladimir Putin's Russia .

It came as Mr Starmer travelled to Berlin on Monday evening for talks with Ukraine's war-time leader Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies. Earlier the PM had warned a botched peace deal for Kyiv risks paving the way for worse conflict as pressure mounts from Donald Trump to end the war. The Prime Minister said the UK cannot \"let up\" in its support for Kyiv and warned the UK must be \"alert to that ever-present danger from Russia\".

There’s no obstruction.”\n\nEyes on Milwaukee for bellwether case\n\nDugan's case had drawn national attention and put the 66-year-old judge at the forefront of the clash between the judiciary and the Trump administration as it conducts a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nDugan is charged with two counts: obstruction of a federal agency, a felony, and concealing a wanted person, a misdemeanor.\n\nIf convicted, she faces up to six years in prison, though first-time nonviolent offenders typically get shorter sentences or probation. She has been suspended from the bench with pay during the case by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. She makes nearly $175,000 a year.\n\nThe trial opened Dec. 15 before a packed courtroom including media, the public and lawyers. Outside, protesters rallied starting at 8 a.m.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, the trial judge, announced at the outset that one of the jurors called in sick. Both sides agreed to proceed with 13 jurors, with one alternate instead of 12. One person will be eliminated before deliberations.\n\nThere are eight men and five women in the jury. They come from 12 counties that make up the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n\nDugan moved up case, whispered on audio\n\nBy April 18, agents from U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement or ICE had already made several arrests in the Milwaukee County Courthouse, leading to media coverage and concern among judges.\n\nAlexander told the jury that arrests are common in courthouses; they are safer to do because everyone goes through security.\n\nSix federal agents came to Dugan's court that day to arrest Flores-Ruiz, who was charged with assaulting his roommate and two others. Those victims were in court that day, which Alexander mentioned several times.\n\nFlores-Ruiz was in the U.S. illegally, having re-entered the country after he was deported in 2013.\n\nArmed with a warrant to arrest Flores-Ruiz, agents alerted Dugan's court staff that they would do the arrest in the hall after his appearance, Alexander said.\n\nOnce Dugan learned of the agents' presence, a routine morning became unusual, Alexander said. Dugan took several steps that, taken together, amounted to hiding Flores-Ruiz and obstructing agents, he said.\n\nDugan went into the court of fellow Judge Kristela Cervera, called her off the bench, asked her to come with her, and told her to keep her robe on, he said.\n\nThe pair went to talk to the agents, with Dugan ultimately sending them to the nearby office of Chief Judge Carl Ashley.\n\nAlexander said Cervera will testify that her “heart sank” when she realized they were confronting agents, but felt she couldn’t challenge Dugan because of her demeanor.\n\nOnce the agents were sent to Ashely's office, Dugan returned to her court and took several unusual actions: she took Flores-Ruiz's case first, told the attorney to come back for a date and then can be heard talking in a whisper that the pair should go \"down the stairs,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nAt another point, Dugan says: \"I'll do it.

There are two doors out of that hallway, one into an enclosed stairwell, the other into a public corridor.\n\nFlores-Ruiz and his attorney, Mercedes de la Rosa, went through the door into the public corridor where two federal agents were waiting. Flores-Ruiz was followed and arrested outside the building.\n\n\"She knew what she was doing was wrong and she did it anyway,\" Alexander said.\n\nMore: Milwaukee County denies access to key Hannah Dugan court audio for trial\n\nICE tactics led to confusion in the courthouse\n\nIn the defense opening, Biskupic described a chaotic time in the Milwaukee County Courthouse between late January and early April as immigration agents were coming in to make arrests.\n\nWith Donald Trump back in the White House, it was clear \"ICE was going to be aggressive and go into courthouses,\" Biskupic said.\n\nCiting emails and upcoming testimony, the roughly 50 Milwaukee County judges were reacting with \"anger, confusion and paranoia\" about the immigration arrests, he said.\n\nThe day of the incident, Ashley, the chief judge, was still working on a policy of how federal immigration arrests would be handled.\n\nBiskuipic said Dugan was concerned people were not coming to court because of a fear of ICE.\n\n\"Little did she know it would be her head that was at risk,\" he said.\n\nBiskupic also stressed that if Dugan really wanted Flores-Ruiz to avoid agents, she would have pointed him and his attorney to the enclosed stairs. Instead, the pair emerged just about 12 feet from the public door \"with one federal agent to the right, and one federal agent to the left.\"\n\nBiskupic also noted agents chose not to arrest Dugan in the hallway.\n\n\"Judge Dugan is charged with obstructing a hallway arrest when the agents chose not to make that arrest in the hallway,\" he said.\n\nAudio, video takes starring role\n\nFBI Special Agent Erin Lucker, the first witness, described the audio recordings from inside Dugan's courtroom. They portray the scene as Dugan's staff learned ICE agents are in the hallway, as Dugan's clerk tells her, \"five ICE guys are in the hallway.\"\n\nLucker also testified what was happening in video from the hallway, as Dugan is seen talking to the agents and then pointing all of them to the chief judge's office.\n\nLucker said about 100 witnesses were interviewed for the case and agents pored over audio, video and other records for the case.\n\nLucker also described how Judge Laura Gramling Perez highlighted training on ICE in courthouses. Emails went to other judges, including Dugan. Gramling Perez said she learned ICE can arrest people in public places in a courthouse though there is protection for victims.\n\nThe document Gramling Perez shared was from the National Judicial NetworkForum on Human Trafficking and Immigration in State Courts.\n\nDemonstrators gather outside to protest the trial\n\nTo the sound of honking horns and rattling cowbells, more than 60 protesters braved the cold as temperatures dropped to 12 degrees outside of downtown's federal courthouse the first day of the trial.\n\n\"Free Hannah Dugan,\" they chanted.\n\nAs protesters shivered, Whitefish Bay resident Jean Erickson, 72, vigorously shook a cowbell and carried a sign saying “No military occupation of our cities.”\n\n“I’m concerned about our democracies, and I’m just here to be a part of this,” Erickson said of the rally.\n\nNick Ramos, executive director of the political watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, opened speeches from a coalition of local and statewide groups gathered on the courthouse steps, with speakers taking to a podium to talk about Dugan's case and the impact it will have on different areas of society.\n\n“We’re here today because what’s happening inside this courthouse is bigger than one judge, one case or one community,\" Ramos said. \"We’re here because the rule of law depends on people being able to walk into a courthouse without fear.”","url":"https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/2025/12/15/first-day-of-hannah-dugan-trial-starts-with-contrasting-views-of-judge/87733035007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/PMJS/87721860007-img-6434-1.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=2158,1214,x0,y282&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:49:54","author":"Journal Sentinel","authors":["Journal Sentinel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":387286764,"title":"‘Racial profiling’: Tim Walz says Ilhan Omar's son, questioned by ICE, was 'following the law'","text":"Minnesota Democratic leader Tim Walz criticised federal immigration enforcement after Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s son was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents while returning from a shopping trip, calling the encounter “racial profiling”.In a post on X, Walz said: “Congresswoman Omar’s son was pulled over by ICE while he was following the law, on his way home from Target. This isn’t a targeted operation to find violent criminals, it’s racial profiling.”Omar told Minneapolis broadcaster WCCO that her son, whom she did not name, was pulled over on Saturday after leaving a Target store. “Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [ICE] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,” she said. She added that he “always carries” his passport with him.Earlier the same day, ICE agents reportedly entered a mosque where her son had been praying but left without incident. Omar said she warned him to be careful because federal enforcement appears focused on areas with young Somali men. “They are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,” she said.'Operation Metro Surge'The stop comes amid “Operation Metro Surge”, a federal effort targeting undocumented Somalis and Latinos in the Twin Cities area. Omar is the first Somali American in Congress. She criticised the operation as racial profiling and accused President Donald Trump of inciting hate against Somalis and herself. She said: “I had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in.”Omar sent a letter to Homeland Security officials describing the enforcement as involving “blatant racial profiling, an egregious level of unnecessary force, and activity that appears designed for social media rather than befitting a law enforcement agency.”","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/racial-profiling-tim-walz-says-ilhan-omars-son-questioned-by-ice-was-following-the-law/articleshow/125989572.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125989572/125989572.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:35:07","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":387278150,"title":"Farmers and politics threaten to put EU’s free-trade deal with South America on ice","text":"She said that the deal reflects limits on the EU’s geopolitical strength, political unity and capability.\n\n“If we cannot get this done even with (U.S. President Donald) Trump’s pressure, what can you expect from the EU?” she said. “I hope France cannot fully torpedo this because the EU cannot afford a further delay in Mercosur if it wants to be credible with other ongoing trade deals, such as Indonesia and, even more so, India.”\n\nIn the wake of Trump’s tariff blitzkrieg earlier this year, when Washington imposed levies of 15% on most imports from the EU, the bloc has sought bilateral trade deals to help weather with aggressive trade tactics from both the U.S. and China, its historical top trading partners.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said that Brussels would push to have the Mercosur deal signed by the end of the year because it puts the EU’s geopolitical credibility on the line.\n\n“We’re talking about bringing together two of the world’s biggest trading blocs.

Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested for murder and is being held on $4 million bail, police said Monday.Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\" \"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president. Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on Twitter. CBS News has asked the White House if the president has any evidence the Reiners' deaths were linked to their political views. The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties. Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned the president's message in a post on X. \"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis pleaded guilty in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"","summary":"Actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home over the weekend.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-disparages-rob-reiner-political-views-murder/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/15/e76c7ecf-c9ee-4e97-9ac2-04acfb1a9845/thumbnail/1200x630/d24a37205b0839b2a893da70f8f6d9d2/gettyimages-2250983479.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:26:02","author":"Kathryn Watson","authors":["Kathryn Watson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":387275340,"title":"The Guardian view on combating Europe’s national populists: protect the less well-off from the winds of change | Editorial","text":"More than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis.

Kamala Harris’s campaign, its authors argued, failed to connect with core constituencies because it did not focus enough on addressing basic economic anxieties.

The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” parties in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) lead the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.\n\nThe challenges Europe faces are expensive and era-defining. They include the war in Ukraine, maintaining the momentum of the green transition, addressing demographic change and developing economies that are less vulnerable to bullying by Mr Trump and China. According to the Brussels-based Breugel thinktank, the new age of geopolitical insecurity could require an additional €250bn in annual EU defence spending. Mario Draghi’s report last year on European economic competitiveness demanded massive investment in public goods and infrastructure, to be partly funded by jointly held EU debt.\n\nSuch a fiscal paradigm shift would boost growth figures that have flatlined for years. But at both the pan-European and national levels, there continues to be a lack of boldness when it comes to revenue raising. The EU’s so-called “frugal” nations oppose the idea of collective borrowing, and Brussels’ budget proposals for the next seven years are deeply unambitious. In France, the idea of a wealth tax on the super-rich is overwhelmingly popular with voters. But Emmanuel Macron’s beleaguered centrist government – though desperate to cut its budget deficit – refuses to contemplate such a move.\n\nThe reality is that in the absence of such measures, the less well-off will pay the price of financial adjustment through austerity budgets and greater inequality. Bitter recent disputes over pension cutbacks in both France and Germany testify to a developing struggle over the future of the European social model – a phenomenon that the RN and the AfD have happily exploited to promote a politics of welfare chauvinism. Ms Le Pen’s party, for example, has opposed moves to raise the retirement age and has said that it would target any benefit cuts at non-French nationals.\n\nIn the US, Mr Trump’s pledges to protect blue‑collar interests were deeply disingenuous, as subsequent Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy underlined. But in the absence of a convincing progressive counteroffer from the Harris campaign, they worked on the campaign trail. Without a fundamental change in economic approach, social contracts across the continent risk being ripped up. Governments must avoid handing this political gift to the Trumpian forces already on the march in Europe.","summary":"As EU countries face multiple challenges in a new era, they must fight to preserve the continent’s social model.

Adults and children, some rushing to reach the barriers to get a better look, snapped their fingers as if willing the colt to go faster. They erupted in cheers when it crossed the finish line.\n\nOn Sunday, the crowd of mostly lower-income people at the racetrack in Venezuela’s capital enjoyed a day of races that drew jockeys from the United States and elsewhere, despite the increasingly tense political climate around them. Their country’s protracted crisis has accustomed them to unpredictability. Years of political promises or threats — even of a possible U.S. military attack on Venezuelan soil — now hardly move them.\n\n“Given the circumstances and the situation in Venezuela, we all have that uncertainty and anguish,” fan Mari Alegría said Sunday after Silk Eyes won the seventh of 13 races. “But we move forward, and just as one works, one also has to have fun.”\n\nTense political climate\n\nThe South American country is wrapping up another year marked by a complex social, political and economic crisis that began when Nicolás Maduro became president in 2013. He, again, is vowing to remain Venezuela’s president for years to come. His opponents, once more, pledge to end his rule soon. But unlike other years, U.S. military assets are deployed off the country’s Caribbean coast and U.S. President Donald Trump is consistently threatening to strike land.\n\nThe threats are part of the Trump administration’s strategy to pressure Maduro, who was charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. in 2020, during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe White House has said the military operation, which began in the Caribbean and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, is meant to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. The operation has killed more than 80 people, with Venezuelans among them.\n\nMaduro, who denies the drug-related accusations, and his allies have repeatedly said that the operation’s true purpose is to force a government change in Venezuela.\n\nJust days before the race, Trump escalated his campaign against Maduro, when U.S. commandos fast-roping from helicopters seized a tanker carrying tens of millions of dollars’ worth of illicit crude oil near the coast of Venezuela. Oil is the backbone of Venezuela’s economy.\n\nOpposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado in an interview aired Sunday on news program “Face the Nation” expressed support for the seizure. She argued that as a “criminal structure,” Maduro’s government will suffer “when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut.” The inflows, she said, include oil, drug, gold, arm and human smuggling and trafficking.\n\n“So that’s what we believe, it was so important to apply law enforcement (pressure), and we have been asking this for years, so it’s finally happening,” Machado said from Norway, where she appeared in public for the first time last week after hiding in an undisclosed location in Venezuela for 11 months. “That’s why I believe the regime has its days numbered.”\n\nDay at the track\n\nNone of this seemed to matter at the racetrack.\n\n“It’s true that all Venezuelans are anxious (wondering) what’s going to happen and all that,” Luigi Achique, who visits the track regularly, said holding a racing magazine he had marked with his bets. “But I come here on Sundays to unwind. You never know what’s going to happen.”\n\nNearby, a section of the stands was dedicated to government workers and uniformed members of a pro-Maduro civilian militia.\n\nAs the races took place, children formed long lines to use a variety of bouncy castles set up next to the track. But in many families, children were the ones interested in the races, not the adults.\n\n“The children love horse racing; they’re fascinated by it,” Roxany Hernández said as her 10-year-old son and other children tried to get pictures of the jockeys. “Despite the difficulties, we’re working, we’re enjoying ourselves.”\n\nAmong the jockeys the crowd cheered on was American Katie Davis, who rode Silk Eyes to victory, despite a U.S. travel alert warning citizens against visiting the country sent before the military operation began earlier this year.\n\nDavis said she arrived to Venezuela hours before the event. She explained she “was a little nervous being” in Venezuela but also “felt very safe.”\n\n“Everybody has their opinion on it,” Davis said of her visit. “It’s like life in general, you can listen or you can do what you think is best. At the end of the day, it’s your life on the line, just like horse racing, our lives are on the line, and I come in peace.”","summary":"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The stands roared as Silk Eyes galloped past Mr. Thunder at the top of the stretch.

Trump also maintained that he had “surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness … with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before”.\n\nLos Angeles police on Monday confirmed the Reiners’ 32-year-old son, Nick, had been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the deaths of his parents. His bail was set at $4m.\n\nCelebrities and lawmakers, meanwhile, were swift to lambast Trump over what they described as “petty” and “disgusting” comments.\n\n“What a disgusting and vile statement,” actor Patrick Schwarzenegger wrote on X.\n\nSimilarly, television host Whoopi Goldberg, who described Reiner as her friend and “quite an amazing man,” condemned Trump.\n\nReferencing Trump’s own attacks on critics of the far-right political activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot dead in September. That killing prompted reprisals from the White House against those who cited Kirk’s history of hostile rhetoric toward immigrants, women and other marginalized groups. And Goldberg said: “I don’t understand the man in the White House. He spoke at length about Charlie Kirk and about caring, and then this is what he puts out. Have you no shame? No shame at all? Can you get any lower? I don’t think so.”\n\nMeanwhile, California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X: “This is a sick man.”\n\nEchoing Newsom, US House member Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat, said: “What a despicable piece of garbage.”\n\nUS senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, similarly said of Trump: “He’s just lost it. Now saying Rob and Michele Reiner caused their own murder because they didn’t support him. So sick.”\n\nUS House member Zoe Lofgren, another California Democrat, called Trump’s comments “a new low for this petty, hateful man”. Lofgren added: “His party needs to condemn this.”\n\nSimilarly, US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”\n\nGreene also seemingly alluded to Nick Reiner’s past experiences with addiction and homelessness, writing, “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nGreene’s fellow Republican US House member Thomas Massie struck a similar chord. The Kentucky representative said: “Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nMassie also said he challenged anyone in his party – including vice-president JD Vance and White House staff – to defend Trump’s commentary.\n\nReiner had long been a vocal critic of Trump. In a 2017 interview with Variety, he said Trump was “mentally unfit” to be president. And Reiner warned the Guardian that the US could slide into autocracy if Trump successfully ran for a second presidency in 2024 – which he did.\n\n“We see autocracy making its move around the world,” Reiner said at the time. “If we [the US] crumble, there’s a danger that democracy crumbles around the world.”\n\nDespite his criticisms of Trump and far-right Christian nationalist movements, Reiner expressed “absolute horror” and unequivocally condemned political violence after Kirk was shot.\n\n“It’s beyond belief what happened to him,” Reiner said at the time. “That should never happen to anybody. I don’t care what your political beliefs are. That’s not acceptable.

The Hawleys conducted polling through OnMessage Inc. showing strong majorities value pro-life, pro-family policies. \n\nOf those surveyed, 77% said they agree that “as a society, we should be working towards having as few abortions as possible.” Another 80% agreed, with 62% saying they strongly agree, that “there needs to be at least some point during pregnancy when we can all agree that a baby cannot be aborted, unless the life of the mother is at risk.”\n\n“Most women have an abortion because of a lack of support,” Erin Hawley said in a statement to The Daily Signal. “We want to change that. We want to build a culture that is pro-life and pro-family, and we can do that by providing broader support for women in need.”\n\nOverall, 88% of Americans said that family formation is important to them, with 60% saying that raising a family is essential to a meaningful life\n\n“We believe there needs to be a strong voice advocating for life and making it easier to start a family,” Josh Hawley said in a statement to The Daily Signal. “That is fundamental to who we are as Americans and the future of our country. And it is how we will be judged as a society. This is a generational project, not just about the next election cycle.”\n\nThis polling comes after Axios reported that President Donald Trump’s advisers are displeased with Sen. Hawley for starting the nonprofit, as the White House reportedly views abortion as a losing issue in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nLove Life Initiative’s polling found that the majority of Americans oppose the Biden-era Food and Drug Administration’s decision to axe the in-person dispensing requirement on the abortion pill. \n\nWithout any introduction, 37% of those surveyed said that chemical abortion drugs that women can receive through the mail and take at home are safe, while 42% said they are unsafe.\n\nAfter the pollster told the respondents that the FDA recently reduced its safety standards for these drugs, making them available through mail and allowing them to be taken without doctor supervision despite many women suffering complications, 64% said they oppose the FDA’s decision. That number includes 53% who say they strongly oppose the FDA’s decision, reaching majorities of opposition across party lines. \n\nIn April 2021, the Biden administration’s FDA stopped requiring that abortion drugs be dispensed to women in person, which allowed women to receive them through telehealth appointments and by mail. The FDA has not enforced the in-person dispensing requirement ever since.\n\nThe Ethics & Public Police Center study found that about 11% of women experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious adverse event within 45 days following a mifepristone abortion. This has led to calls to reinstate the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone.\n\nWhen asked in the Love Life Initiative survey about the FDA’s decision to reduce safeguards on the abortion pill, 54% said health and safety need to be top priorities, while 27% said abortions should become more accessible.\n\nThe Hawleys, who met while clerking for Chief Justice John Roberts in 2007 and are the parents of three children, have been fierce advocates for limiting the abortion pill. Erin Hawley was the head counsel in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, where she unsuccessfully argued in front of the Supreme Court that the FDA’s removal of commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs was unlawful. \n\nJosh Hawley has repeatedly pressed FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary to do a safety review on mifepristone. \n\nHawley wrote a letter to Makary on Dec. 10 demanding answers after the commissioner declined to give The Daily Signal a time frame for his review on the abortion pill.\n\n“Yesterday, in response to the latest reports, you said, ‘There has been an ongoing review of mifepristone. It’s actually required as part of a policy called REMS,’” Hawley wrote, linking to The Daily Signal interview. “But that is not what you promised. You promised a new and comprehensive study taking account of all available safety data, not the standard monitoring FDA already performs for countless drugs.”\n\nMakary told The Daily Signal last week that the review of the abortion drug mifepristone is in the “data acquisition phase,” following a Bloomberg report saying he is delaying the process until after midterms.\n\n“We do an ongoing review, but we’re also engaging in a robust study that can serve to validate or not validate other numbers that have been put out there in the literature,” the FDA chief said.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—Josh and Erin Hawley&#8217;s new pro-family nonprofit is touting polling showing the majority of Americans believe society should provide pregnant women...

But he ultimately did and established a legacy for himself.\n\nThe abrupt and brutal end of his life and the life of his wife Michele over the weekend is certainly nothing anyone expected. And the arrest of their own son, Nick, on suspicion of murdering them, is an even sicker twist.\n\nMost people have reacted, naturally, with shock, grief and remembrances of Reiner’s great works. But then came, of course, President Donald Trump.\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nI will pause for a moment so the presumably well-meaning and especially the self-described religious supporters of the president can reflect on the words of their dear leader.\n\nIt seems fitting that Trump would post this in response to the death of Rob Reiner, given Reiner’s outspoken liberalism and attacks on Trump as “mentally unfit” to be president.\n\nNeedless to say, every passing day provides stronger evidence for Reiner’s argument.\n\nYes, Reiner was a proud and often outspoken liberal throughout his life.\n\nHe campaigned in support of gay equality co-founding American Foundation for Equal Rights to challenge California’s Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage. Though it seems like a settled issue now, it really wasn’t that long ago that a majority of people thought gay people marrying was some detestable thing.\n\nReiner campaigned for a litany of environmental causes. His efforts included his fight against the development of the Ahmanson Ranch, now the sprawling Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, which incidentally is one of my go-to hiking spots in the western part of the San Fernando Valley.\n\nReiner’s campaigns against tobacco led to the successful passage of Proposition 10 in 1998, imposing taxes on tobacco products to find early childhood education. These efforts would get him satirized by “South Park,” which depicted Reiner as an obese bully trying to ban smoking.\n\nAs a “South Park” fan who saw the episode when it came out in 2003, their depiction of Reiner often came to mind when his name would pop up.\n\nReiner, for his part, later commented when asked about his depiction in “South Park”, “I thought it was funny, but I’m not quite that fat.”\n\nBut, of course, for Reiner, Trump and the rise of Trumpism were no laughing manner. He saw the rise of Trump as an attack on America itself, a blow to democracy and a threat to freedom around the world.\n\n“We see autocracy making its move around the world. And so if we crumble, there’s a danger that democracy crumbles around the world,” he said.\n\nSomething to think about.\n\nAgree with Reiner’s politics or not, appreciate his works or not, the fact is that Reiner left a mark on America. He evidently made such a mark that he got Trump to reveal that “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is best understood as a self-description of what plagues the president himself than anything else.\n\nSal Rodriguez can be reached at salrodriguez@scng.com","summary":"Agree with Reiner’s politics or not, appreciate his works or not, the fact is that Rob Reiner left a mark on America.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/12/15/rob-reiners-death-exposes-what-trump-derangement-syndrome-really-is/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Obit_Rob_Reiner_25732_daa5b3-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:10:13","author":"Sal Rodriguez","authors":["Sal Rodriguez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.143},{"id":387266670,"title":"Rob Reiner mourned by Barack Obama, Jerry O’Connell, James Woods and many others","text":"Reactions to the death of actor-director Rob Reiner, who was found dead with his wife Michele Reiner at their home in Los Angeles on Sunday.

Though he once considered running for Governor's office, he chose to focus on activism rather than elected positions.Meanwhile, the deaths are being investigated as a homicide by the Los Angeles Police Department, with reports indicating that the couple was stabbed to death.\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" the family said in a statement.Reiner, the son of famed writer and comedian Carl Reiner, first rose to prominence as \"Meathead,\" the hippie son-in-law on CBS's groundbreaking sitcom All in the Family, winning Emmys as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy in 1974 and 1978.He later transitioned into film, making his directorial debut with 'This Is Spinal Tap' (1984), an improvisational mockumentary about a heavy metal band.Reiner delivered box office hits and beloved films across multiple genres, including the coming-of-age drama Stand By Me (1986), fantasy classic The Princess Bride (1987), romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989), thriller Misery (1990), and courtroom drama A Few Good Men (1992). He co-founded Castle Rock Entertainment in 1987 and produced most of his films, including hits such as In the Line of Fire and Needful Things, according to Variety.Born on March 6, 1947, in the Bronx, Reiner was raised in Hollywood and attended UCLA Film School. He began acting in TV shows like Batman, That Girl, and The Beverly Hillbillies, and appeared in his father's film Enter Laughing (1967).Reiner is survived by his children, Jake, Nick, and Romy, and was the adoptive father of actress Tracy Reiner, daughter of his first wife, the late Penny Marshall, as per Variety.

Within hours, Trump posted a commentary that many saw as politicising a family tragedy.Tragedy and Arrest: Reiner Family Murder InvestigatedPolice found Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, 68, dead at their Los Angeles residence on Sunday afternoon. Officers responded to a medical-aid call and discovered the couple with serious injuries consistent with stabbing. Law enforcement later treated the deaths as a homicide and took their son, 32-year-old Nick Reiner, into custody.Official records show Nick Reiner was booked on suspicion of murder and held on £3.4 million ($4 million) bail. Court and jail logs confirm his detention as investigators continue probing motive and circumstances.Reiner was a towering figure in Hollywood whose career spanned acting and directing. His work included classics such as When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, Stand by Me, and A Few Good Men. He was also a vocal political critic, especially of Trump's policies and rhetoric, in public interviews and on social media platforms.National Outcry Over 'Shameful' RemarksRather than offering condolences, Trump's morning post on Truth Social shifted focus to political judgment. In the controversial message, he described Reiner as 'tortured and struggling, but once very talented' and claimed that he and his wife died 'reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.' Trump also suggested Reiner's 'raging obsession' had driven people 'CRAZY'.The remarks ignited immediate criticism across the political spectrum. Congressional figures from both parties condemned the tone; critics said the president's response was not just insensitive but demeaning to the gravity of a double homicide investigation.On the ABC programme The View, co-host Whoopi Goldberg, who worked with Reiner, expressed shock. Goldberg said, 'Don't read it. I don't know how to process this,' adding that Trump had made the tragedy about himself at the expense of empathy for a grieving family. Co-host Ana Navarro called the remarks 'shameful and disgraceful,' emphasising the need for compassion in moments of tragedy.Bipartisan Condemnation and Political FalloutRepublicans also broke with the president's framing. Some conservative lawmakers and commentators labelled the Truth Social post a misstep, describing it as tone-deaf and inappropriate given the severity of the couple's deaths. Democratic leaders echoed these critiques, with demands for more respectful discourse surrounding loss and violence.Rob Reiner's political activism was long a subject of public debate. In media interviews and on social platforms, he criticised Trump's leadership and warned of dangers to democratic norms, reflecting his broader engagement with civic concerns outside his film career.Tributes Pour In for Hollywood 'Titan'Despite the controversy surrounding the presidential response, tributes to Reiner's artistic and social contributions poured in from around the world. Political figures, actors, directors, and fans highlighted his influence on culture and activism. Statements from public figures described him and his wife as compassionate and committed to bettering society through art and public engagement.Tributes also recognised Michele Singer Reiner for her achievements in photography and production. Together, the Reiners were seen as part of a shared legacy of accomplishment in both the entertainment industry and civic life.With a high-profile criminal investigation underway, legal watchers note that no formal motive beyond police suspicion and arrest has been publicly disclosed.

Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness,” the president posted.\n\n– A beloved director –\n\nDemocratic politicians and Hollywood figures expressed shock over the deaths. \n\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris was friends with the couple and said on X she was “devastated to learn of their passing,” while former president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were “heartbroken.”\n\nReiner gave television and movie viewers “some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people,” Obama said on X.\n\nMovie heavyweight John Cusack said he was “at a loss for any words that make sense” about the deaths.\n\nHorror and thriller writer Stephen King, whose novella “The Body” was the basis for Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age classic “Stand By Me,” lauded a “wonderful friend.”\n\nReiner rose to acting fame as the oafish son-in-law Michael “Meathead” Stivic on groundbreaking 1970s sitcom “All in the Family,” before transitioning to directing. Even as a force behind the camera, he often appeared in cameo roles in his own films.\n\nHe directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and famously cast his real-life mother Estelle Reiner to utter the line “I’ll have what she’s having” after Ryan’s classic fake orgasm scene in Katz’s Delicatessen.\n\nHis 1992 thriller “A Few Good Men,” starring Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.\n\nReiner backed efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products.\n\nHe also helped fundraise for Democratic presidential candidates including Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe was the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who won 11 Emmy Awards for his television performances and wrote screenplays with movie greats Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","summary":"Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home.

Today, police confirmed their son Nick Reiner, 32, has been arrested and remains in custody.\n\nAfter several high-profile celebrities paid tribute to Reiner, who created some of the most well-known movies of the 1980s and 1990s, the US president took to social media to criticise the late director, claiming he had \"a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome\" and had \"driven people crazy by his raging obsession\" with the Republican politician. Reiner, a vocal critic of Trump, was one of the most active Democrats in the film industry, regularly campaigning on behalf of liberal causes and hosting fundraisers.\n\nThe US president wrote on Truth Social: \"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\n\n\"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican whom Trump branded a \"traitor\" for disagreeing with him, responded to Trump's message by saying: \"Rob Reiner and his wife were tragically killed at the hands of their own son, who reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak. \n\n\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"\n\nTrump was also criticised by Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky who tweeted on X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, \"this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump's post: \"This statement is wrong. Regardless of one's political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It's a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.\"\n\nAmong those expressing their condolences to Reiner's family were former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Biden tweeted: \"Jill and I send our deepest condolences to everyone whose lives were touched by Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's extraordinary contributions. We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"\n\nObama said: \"Michelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele. Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people - and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. \n\n\"Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.

While gasoline in Iran remains among the cheapest in the world, economists warn the change could feed inflation at a time when the rapidly weakening rial is already pushing up the cost of food and other basic goods.\n\nThe fall comes as efforts to revive negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear program appear stalled, while uncertainty persists over the risk of renewed conflict following June’s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel. Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.\n\nIran’s economy has been battered for years by international sanctions, particularly after Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time the 2015 accord was implemented – which sharply curtailed Iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief – the rial traded at about 32,000 to the dollar.\n\nAfter Trump returned to the White House for a second term in January, his administration revived a “maximum pressure” campaign, expanding sanctions that target Iran’s financial sector and energy exports. Washington has again pursued firms involved in trading Iranian crude oil, including discounted sales to buyers in China, according to U.S. statements.\n\nFurther pressure followed in late September, when the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the “snapback” mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran’s ballistic missile program.","url":"https://news.net/news/irans-rial-currency-plummets-to-new-low-sparking-fears-of-higher-food-prices/","image":"https://dymlcaxjpm5z9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/14053519/Iran_Gasoline_64289-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:56:00","author":"Amir Vahdat","authors":["Amir Vahdat"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":387292218,"title":"Trinidad and Tobago will open its nation's airports to US military","text":"By ANSELM GIBBS\n\nPORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — The government of Trinidad and Tobago said Monday that it would allow the U.S. military to access its airports in coming weeks as tensions build between the United States and Venezuela.\n\nThe announcement comes after the U.S. military recently installed a radar system at the airport in Tobago.

Gallego dejó atrás a algunos de sus colaboradores al buscar apoyo para una compañera demócrata que se postulaba a la alcaldía de la ciudad de mayoría hispana.\n\n“Mucho gusto”, dijo a los feligreses. “Soy Ruben Gallego, de Arizona”, dijo al presentarse sin mencionar que es senador federal.\n\nEl demócrata de Arizona se perfila como una figura crucial para un partido que busca desesperadamente recuperar el apoyo latino que se desvaneció en 2024 con la elección del presidente Donald Trump. Sus viajes en otoño incluyeron Nueva Jersey, Virginia y Florida, donde hizo campaña por los demócratas que posteriormente ganaron sus elecciones. Los estrategas dicen que Gallego demuestra su fuerza como estrella emergente del partido, a la vez que sienta las bases para una candidatura presidencial en 2028, a pesar de no ser tan conocido como Gavin Newsom, el gobernador de California, o Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, legisladora federal.\n\nEs un rol que se cree que Gallego mantendrá el próximo año, cuando los demócratas esperan poner fin al control republicano en el Congreso y contrarrestar la agenda de Trump.\n\n“Ruben Gallego va a ser nuestra arma secreta, no tan secreta”, dijo Maria Cardona, una operadora demócrata de larga trayectoria y miembro del Comité Nacional Demócrata.\n\nUna figura muy solicitada\n\nGallego se encuentra entre los demócratas nombrados como posibles contendientes para 2028 que tuvieron la agenda de viajes más apretada en 2025. Hizo campaña por las candidatas demócratas en las contiendas para el gobierno estatal de Nueva Jersey y Virginia, y para la alcaldía de Miami.\n\n“Ruben les brinda una validación instantánea, no sólo porque su apellido es Gallego”, dijo Chuck Rocha, quien movilizó a los latinos en la candidatura presidencial del senador Bernie Sanders, en 2020, y la de Gallego, en 2024. “Ha sacrificado su vida por su país, creció en un hogar de inmigrantes sin recursos, y ahora es senador federal. Ese es el tipo de persona que quieres a tu lado hablando con los latinos sobre por qué deberían votar por esta mujer blanca”.\n\nEn las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, Trump logró avances en zonas predominantemente puertorriqueñas del este de Pensilvania; transformó el valle del Río Grande, en el sur de Texas; y mejoró sus cifras a lo largo del corredor de la carretera Interestatal 4 de Florida. Lo hizo al centrarse con fuerza en la economía y la seguridad fronteriza.\n\nNo obstante, los resultados de las elecciones recientes han dado indicios de que grupos clave de votantes —incluidos los hispanos—, se alejan de los republicanos. Y en Miami, Eileen Higgins se convirtió en la primera persona demócrata en ser elegida para la alcaldía de la ciudad en casi 30 años.\n\n“Vamos a lugares donde hay una gran población latina”, dijo Gallego a The Associated Press en Miami. “Obviamente, se inclinaron demasiado por Trump la última vez, en nuestra opinión, y queremos hablar con los demócratas, y queremos hablar con los latinos y queremos hablar con los candidatos sobre cómo volver a tener a esa población en nuestra esquina”.\n\nEl propio Gallego superó a la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris en 2024, cuando ganó por más de 2 puntos un escaño en el Senado por Arizona y Trump se alzó con el triunfo en el estado por casi 6 puntos. Y reconoce el mérito del presidente republicano por sus medidas de seguridad fronteriza y, en ocasiones, elogia el estilo directo de Trump de no darle demasiadas vueltas a las propuestas económicas al elaborar su mensaje populista con ideas como “sin impuestos a las propinas”.\n\n“Necesitamos que nos identifiquen como alguien que apoya a la clase trabajadora”, expresó Gallego en un evento reciente.\n\nCómo la asequibilidad es personal\n\nGallego creció en la pobreza en Evergreen Park, un suburbio del área metropolitana de Chicago, y frecuentaba la zona de Little Village, un barrio predominantemente mexicano en el sudoeste de la ciudad. Fue criado por una madre soltera luego que su padre abandonara a la familia y fuera encarcelado por narcotráfico. Gallego trabajó en varios empleos para ayudar a pagar las facturas cuando aún estaba en la preparatoria. Fue aceptado en la Universidad de Harvard, se unió a la infantería de Marina y combatió en Irak con una unidad que sufrió numerosas bajas.\n\n“Todos los demócratas hablan ahora de asequibilidad, asequibilidad, asequibilidad”, dijo Jesse Lehrich, estratega demócrata. “¿Pero cuántos de ellos saben realmente lo que se siente no saber de dónde saldrá el próximo cheque para el alquiler? ¿O no saber cómo van a pagar los comestibles esta semana?”.\n\nLehrich, quien sigue de cerca los viajes y las apariciones en los medios de los contendientes para las elecciones de 2028, agregó que no hay muchos demócratas de alto nivel que hablen como personas comunes, y agregó que, en contraste, Gallego puede “carecer de modales pulidos”.\n\nAl senador, quien anteriormente sirvió en la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, le gusta alardear de que no escuchó a la clase dirigente de Washington cuando decidió realizar fiestas para ver peleas de box y organizó un rodeo y una exhibición de autos lowrider —clásicos de la cultura chicana—, con lo que desestimó las preocupaciones de que eso será percibido como condescendiente con los partidarios hispanos.\n\nNo da la impresión de ser tan refinado como otros —como Josh Shapiro, el gobernador de Pensilvania, o Pete Buttigieg, exsecretario de Transporte—, pero Lehrich opina que eso podría beneficiar a Gallego porque la gente anhela lo directo.\n\n“Como que se siente que él es perfecto para este momento”, añadió Lehrich.\n\nUn latino en el Partido Republicano\n\nAlgunos estrategas y comentaristas afirman que el Partido Demócrata no ha hecho un buen trabajo a la hora de impulsar a candidatos hispanos a nivel nacional. Les preocupa que los republicanos apoyen a otro exsenador latino, Marco Rubio, el actual secretario de Estado, quien se postuló a la presidencia en 2016 y a quien Trump menciona con frecuencia cuando habla de 2028.\n\nXochitl Hinojosa, comentarista política, dijo que ve la fortaleza de Gallego no sólo en lo atractivo que resulta para los votantes latinos, sino también en un electorado más amplio en áreas en disputa, y enfatiza lo difícil que es para un candidato cruzar la meta cuando el candidato presidencial no lo logra en ese estado.\n\n“Creo que el haber ganado un escaño muy difícil lo ha catapultado a la cima”, dijo Hinojosa. “Los demócratas deben reflexionar que debemos pensar en los latinos si los republicanos tienen a un latino en su papeleta electoral y los demócratas no”.\n\nAl preguntarle sobre una posible candidatura presidencial para 2028, Gallego indicó que es demasiado pronto para responder.\n\n“Pienso en que tengo tres hijos. Y tengo seis años en el Senado”, dilucidó. “Nos vamos a centrar en eso y estamos aquí para ayudar a los demócratas de todo el país. Y veremos qué sucede en el futuro”.","summary":"Por ADRIANA G&#211;MEZ LIC&#211;N MIAMI (AP) &#8212; En una c&#225;lida ma&#241;ana de domingo en Miami, el congresista Ruben Gallego se baj&#243; de un auto y se acerc&#243; a los feligreses que sal&#237;an de una iglesia bajo las palmeras para repartir volantes en este barrio dominicano.

Trump Library Foundation. \n\nPart of that headway was the state of Florida, somewhat controversially, giving Trump a parcel of land appraised at $60 million, but that real estate investors have said could be worth closer to $300 million. \n\nThe land, which had been used as a parking lot for Miami Dade College, is located next to the Freedom Tower, a recently restored landmark on Biscayne Boulevard that represents 'freedom of the press,' having formerly housed the Miami News. \n\nIt's also called the 'Ellis Island of the South,' as the building was used by the federal government to process Cuban refugees in the 1960s, fleeing Communism. \n\nBuilding a Trump library next door to the Freedom Tower has been met with opposition by some groups, who point to the president's hardline immigration policies. \n\nIncluding a 'fake news wing' in a high-rise adjacent to a press freedom monument could also ruffle some feathers. \n\nIt was conservative podcast host Benny Johnson, a former BuzzFeed News reporter who was fired for plagiarism, who gave Eric Trump the idea for a 'fake news wing.' \n\nJohnson pointed to the millions of dollars President Trump has received in settlements from media companies and suggested that those funds could be used to create the wing.\n\n'Please, for the love of God, make the fake news wing of the library sponsored by ABC News and CBS and 60 Minutes and put their logos right up there,' Johnson told Eric Trump during a podcast interview in late October. 'And just show everyone who paid for the fake news of the library.' \n\nEric Trump called Johnson's suggestion 'beautiful.' \n\nThe president's son suggested the wing would be a floor of the planned high-rise building, which Politico reported earlier this month could stretch to 47 stories, as Trump is the 45th and 47th president.\n\nThe high-rise could also include a hotel, restaurant and office space, making it stand out from other presidential library projects. \n\nEric Trump said 'fake news' exhibits could include former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview played on repeat, which Trump's team claimed was deceptively edited ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nCBS said Harris' interview was edited for time, as is customary for most taped television interviews. \n\nStill, Paramount, CBS' parent company, paid Trump a $16 million settlement in July, as the company was trying to finalize an $8 billion sale to Skydance Media, which Trump's FCC approved. \n\nThe settlement was paid specifically to the Trump Library Foundation. \n\nEric Trump also suggested there be an exhibit on Charlottesville, arguing that his father's 'very fine people on both sides' comments got twisted by the mainstream media.\n\n'We can remind people who all these people are,' he continued. 'The fact that Stephanopoulos literally ran the Clinton war room but now they have to fairly moderate debates,' Eric Trump said.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos worked in President Bill Clinton's White House before working for ABC News. \n\n'I will do an entire floor dedicated to the fake news, and I'll have a little trademark in your honor, Benny,' Eric Trump told Johnson.","summary":"President Donald Trump could include a 'fake news wing' as part of his high-rise presidential library that he wants to build in downtown Miami.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15385535/donald-trump-presidential-library-fake-news-wing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/15/17/104742463-0-image-m-13_1765818327336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:47:20","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":387277832,"title":"Merriam-Webster’s 2025 word of the year is ‘slop’","text":"Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called “slop.” \n\nThe word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.\n\n“It’s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s announcement. \n\n“It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.”\n\n“Slop” was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. \n\nThe definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nIn other words, “you know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,” Barlow said.\n\nAI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright. \n\nSuch content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now — and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela. \n\nThe Canadian animated show Franklin teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity — but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.\n\nThe word “slop” evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.\n\nFor some, the word induces dread. \n\nBut to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse. \n\n“They want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It’s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn’t seem so intelligent.”\n\nTo select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year. \n\n“We like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.\n\nOver the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.\n\n“Words like ‘ubiquitous,’ ‘paradigm,’ ‘albeit,’ ‘irregardless,’ these are always top lookups because they’re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. “'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It’s used. It’s been used for decades to mean ‘regardless.’”\n\nThe dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word “ polarization.” \n\nA fresh edition came out last month that adds over 5,000 new words — a rare step that involves fully revising and reimagining one of its most popular dictionaries.\n\nRounding out Merriam-Webster’s top words of 2025:\n\nThe viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It’s an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla’s 2024 song “Doot Doot (6 7).” \n\n“It's self-referential,\" Barlow said. “It’s all the rage, but it’s not a defining term.”\n\nThe \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level “ kindness content.” The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.\n\nThere's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.\n\nThe definition of this popular internet phrase is “to participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.” It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to “describe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,” Barlow said. \n\nA conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian “con clave” — meaning “with a key” — to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.\n\nSome learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history’s first American pope in May 2025. “It was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.\n\nOriginally from Italian and Arabic for “free of charge,” the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is “a schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.”\n\nTrump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit — a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025. \n\nYes, you read that correctly. “The name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,” the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake’s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.\n\n1. 2024: polarization\n\n2. 2023: authentic\n\n3. 2022: gaslighting\n\n4. 2021: vaccine\n\n5. 2020: pandemic\n\n6. 2019: they\n\n7. 2018: justice\n\n8. 2017: feminism\n\n9. 2016: surreal\n\n10. 2015: ism","summary":"Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word ‘polarization’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/merriam-webster-word-of-year-slop-b2884978.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/15/05/US--Merriam-Webster-2025.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:43:45","author":"Anna Furman","authors":["Anna Furman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.292},{"id":387260314,"title":"Mbyllen negociatat në Berlin për paqen në Ukrainë/ SHBA: 90 për qind të çështjeve mes Kievit e Kremlinit janë zgjidhur","text":"Dita e dytë e bisedimeve në Berlin mes Volodymyr Zelensky-t dhe ndërmjetësve amerikanë, Steve Witkoff dhe Jared Kushner, për planin Trump të paqes në Ukrainë, është cilësuar si pozitive, por ende ka çështje të pazgjidhura.\n\nPas bisedimeve, negociatorët amerikanë janë shprehur për mediat se 90% e çështjeve mes Kievit dhe Kremlinit janë zgjidhur gjatë këtyre negociatave, duke shtuar se vendimi final për sa i përket territoreve i përket Ukrainës.\n\nKancelari gjerman Merz, i cili në një konferencë për shtyp tha se tani kemi mundësinë për një proces të vërtetë paqeje për Ukrainën, edhe pse ky proces është ende i vogël, por mundësia është reale.\n\n“Steve Witkoff dhe Jared Kushner, dy negociatorët e Presidentit Trump, kanë luajtur një rol kyç në këtë.

And even our brains as disinformation manipulates our understanding of each other and ourselves… We are now operating in a space between peace and war.\n\n“This is not a temporary state or a gradual evolution. Our world is being actively remade with profound implications for national and international security.”\n\nBreaking with a tradition by previous chiefs of offering a view on a range of threats when speaking publicly, Ms Metreweli said she was choosing to focus on Russia.\n\n“We all continue to face the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and harass NATO,” she said.\n\nOn the conflict, she said Putin was “dragging out negotiations and shifting the cost of war on to his own population”.\n\nHer comments come as Donald Trump is attempting to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrskyi, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, told Sky News in an interview earlier this month that he believed Putin was using the US push for negotiations as “cover” while Russian troops attempted to seize more land by force.\n\nThe MI6 boss said the UK’s support for Ukraine would endure regardless of Moscow’s stalling actions.\n\nShe also flagged a growing wave of “grey zone” hostilities – deliberately carried out under the threshold of conventional armed conflict – that she attributed to Moscow.\n\n“It’s important to understand their [Russia’s] attempts to bully, fearmonger and manipulate because it affects us all,” she said.\n\n“I am talking about cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. Drones buzzing airports and bases. Aggressive activity in our seas, above and below the waves. State-sponsored arson and sabotage. Propaganda and influence operations that crack open and exploit fractures within societies.”\n\nWhile she did not specify any particular incidents, there have been a spate of mysterious drone sightings in Denmark, Germany and Sweden; while a Russian spy ship was spotted off the coast of Scotland and acts of arson and sabotage have been carried out in the UK, such as a blaze at a warehouse in east London that was providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nDrawing attention to another method to attack a country and its people, Ms Metreweli underlined how information is being weaponised, with falsehoods spread online that are designed to erode trust in a society and amplify divisions.\n\n“The export of chaos is a feature not a bug in this Russian approach to international engagement and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus,” she said.\n\nMI6, she said, is adapting to respond to the evolving threats.\n\nBut unusually Ms Metroweli also said the wider British public had a role to play, such as with schools helping to educate children to spot disinformation on social media and to check sources of news “and be alive to those algorithms that trigger intense reactions like fear”.\n\nShe added: “It also means everyone in society really understanding the world we are in – a world where… the frontline is everywhere.

Working-group level discussions may continue this coming weekend in the US, possibly Miami, the site of previous discussions, the US official said. Trump is likely to call into a dinner meeting of European leaders on Monday hosted by Merz and also attended by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \n\n“An agreement has been reached that a ceasefire should be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the US and Europe,” Merz said on Monday. “This is a truly far-reaching and substantial agreement, which we did not have before.”\n\nZelenskiy’s top security official, Rustem Umerov, cited “real progress” in the German capital after the Ukrainian leader and his team held a second day of discussions lasting about five hours with with US officials led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. \n\nOn Monday evening, European leaders released a declaration outlining a framework agreement in which EU officials “committed” to security guarantees including a multinational force from within the European coalition supported by the US that would help secure Ukraine, a US-led “ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism,” as well as Ukraine maintaining a peace-time army of 800,000 troops — well above a cap that Russia had wanted.\n\nThe document — signed by countries including Germany, the UK, Poland and France — also foresees a “legally binding commitment” to help restore peace in case of a future attack as well as future investment to rebuild the war-battered country, as well as support for Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.\n\nAs the Trump administration tries to pressure Ukraine, it was unclear the new US effort would be able to overcome the obvious but so-far insurmountable hurdles that have halted previous rounds of talks. Russian leader Vladimir Putin hasn’t budged from his maximalist demands about seizing a vast swathe of territory, including areas of the eastern Donbas region he’s been unable to capture. Kyiv, which was attacked by Russian forces in February 2022, has refused to cede land.\n\nBoth issues have bedeviled previous rounds of talks. While the US official said Trump was not trying to pressure Ukraine and that they believed Russia could agree to the details negotiated in Berlin, Moscow was not included in the talks, which came after a pro-Russia proposal drafted by Washington and Moscow enraged Ukrainian and European officials. \n\nEven as he lauded the progress on guarantees, Zelenskiy made clear that the positions between Moscow and Kyiv when it comes to territory lie far apart. He urged the US to continue mediating on the “painful” issue. The Ukrainian leader also said that many “destructive” elements in the first draft of the Witkoff plan had been removed.\n\n“We’re making efforts to make our position clear,” Zelenskiy said.\n\nThe Americans and Ukrainians discussed territorial issues, with the US backing a Russian demand for Kyiv to withdraw from areas of its eastern Donetsk region that Moscow’s forces have failed to seize since 2014, a person familiar with the matter said. \n\nZelenskiy repeatedly rejected the demand and — together with European allies — is insisting on a ceasefire along the current line of contact, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive issues. \n\nThe Ukrainian president signaled on Sunday that Kyiv could step back from its long-term goal of joining NATO if it reached bilateral security agreements with the US, European and other states, potentially including Canada and Japan. Speaking at the same conference in Berlin, Merz vowed to stand by Kyiv. \n\nUkraine’s Umerov lauded Witkoff and Kushner for “working extremely constructively” for peace — and said the Ukrainians were “enormously grateful” to Trump. \n\nUkraine has sought to join NATO for years as a way to protect its independence, though the US and some European states have been unwilling to back its membership in the face of Russian hostility. Putin has repeatedly demanded Ukraine abandon its goal of NATO membership as part of any peace deal. The Trump administration has already ruled out support for Ukrainian entry into the defense alliance.\n\nKremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov has made clear Russia is unlikely to accept changes advanced by Europe and Ukraine to US-led proposals that have been favorable to Moscow. Witkoff and Kushner held five hours of talks with Putin in Moscow on the plan on Dec. 2. \n\n“If relevant amendments are made, we will have very strong objections,” Ushakov said in pre-recorded remarks to state television broadcast on Sunday. “There will be provisions which are completely unacceptable for us, including on territorial issues.”\n\nEuropean Union foreign ministers also plan talks on Ukraine at their meeting in Brussels on Monday. The bloc’s foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged it’s becoming increasingly difficult to reach agreement on a reparations loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian state assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the new chief of Britain’s foreign intelligence service MI6 accused Putin of deliberately prolonging negotiations to put an end to the war.\n\nRead More: New MI6 Chief Warns Putin Is ‘Dragging Out’ Ukraine Peace Talks\n\n“We all continue to face the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and NATO members,” Blaise Metreweli said in her first public appearance since she became head of MI6 in September. She said of Putin: “He is dragging out negotiations and shifting the cost of war onto his own population.”","url":"https://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-15/us-offers-security-deal-in-ukraine-talks-but-territory-still-key?srnd=homepage-americas","image":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irnUYi7eW2iU/v0/1200x801.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:39:09","author":"Kate Sullivan","authors":["Kate Sullivan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.033}]}
