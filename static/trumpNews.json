The Japan Business Federation made the opinion public in a rare statement regarding specific corporate activity after U.S. reports said President Joe Biden's administration is in the final stage of rejecting the offer by Japan's largest steelmaker to acquire the Pittsburgh-based firm. The buyout plan \"has garnered significant interest among Japanese companies, especially those considering investing in the United States,\" the federation said. \"We sincerely hope that the review procedure will be conducted with the utmost integrity and fairness in accordance with the law,\" it said. An official of the federation, also known as Keidanren, said, \"We don't understand why (the U.S. government) is trying to block the deal. If rejected, the reason should be a focus.\" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee running to succeed Biden, has opposed the planned acquisition by Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer in the 2023 World Steel Association tally, of U.S. Steel, the 24th-largest. She said at a recent rally in Pittsburgh that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated. Former President Donald Trump, Harris' Republican rival for the White House, and his running mate JD Vance have also been critical of the deal. U.S. Steel, founded in 1901, and the United Steelworkers union are both headquartered in the city, which is located in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Gordon shared two pictures from the celebrations with Taylor kissing Travis on the cheek in one of the images in the aftermath of the dramatic win at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs beat the Ravens 27-20 at Arrowhead Stadium, with Baltimore having a touchdown ruled out in the final second of the game when it emerged Isaiah Likely's toe was out of bounds. It meant that Kelce and the Chiefs started the road to a potentially historic Super Bowl 'three-peat' with a win - and they made sure the victory got the celebration it deserved. Travis and Taylor have since flown to New York for the weekend, with Kelce not needed back in Kansas City until Tuesday to prepare for next Sunday's game against Cincinnati Bengals. Kelce later held a party at Prime Social in Kansas City for his team and their partners, with Page Six reporting that Swift 'got a little drunky', according to a source. Swift certainly arrived to the stadium dressed to party, strutting her stuff in an expensive ensemble. The pop star, 34, made her debut this season sporting a $1,750 Versace denim corset top that had gold Medusa detailing at the top, coupled with a matching pair of denim short-shorts. She accessorized the look with a pair of $1,650 sky-high, patent leather Giuseppe Zanotti boots in maroon, and small black Louis Vuitton trunk bag with gold hardware that retails for $3,950 - in theme with the Chiefs' signature red color, of course. Page Six says that the party was 'intimate' and no social media posts of the bash were online. But the outlet reports that no phones were confiscated. The celebratory pictures have surfaced amid question marks over the relationship between Swift and Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany. Last year, Swift and Mahomes sat together on several occasions to cheer the Chiefs on. But they were watching on from separate suites on Thursday night, with the distance notable because Mahomes has recently pledged support for Donald Trump to win the election later this year. It is seemingly at odds with Swift, who previously said she wanted Hilary Clinton to in the 2016 election over Trump. She also accused Trump of treating the presidency as 'an autocracy'.","summary":"Gordon shared two pictures from the celebrations with Taylor kissing Travis on the cheek in one of the images in the aftermath of the dramatic win.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-13823403/Taylor-Swift-kisses-Travis-Kelce-Chiefs-Ravens.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/07/01/89379499-0-image-m-17_1725667337989.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 00:20:48","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.528},{"id":255835944,"title":"House GOP unveils bill to avert partial government shutdown","text":"House Republicans on Friday unveiled legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government until March 28, when a new president and Congress would be able to decide agency spending and priorities for the 2025 fiscal year.However, Republicans added a contentious immigration issue to the short-term spending bill, requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when people register to vote. Inclusion of the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating prospects for the spending bill's passage.At least one Republican, conservative Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana, indicated he opposed the measure. And the bill is not supported by House Democrats, who favor a shorter-term bill.The Rules Committee plans to take up the temporary funding bill — known as a continuing resolution — on Monday, which could tee up a floor vote next week. Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week after their August recess. A stopgap spending measure will be needed to keep the government running after the end of September because they're not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund the agencies during the next fiscal year.\"Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. \"Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.\"But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party.\"If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans' hands,\" Schumer and Murray said.Johnson's decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of their priorities in legislation. Some GOP leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with spending disagreements.The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28, though there's also money to help cover additional security costs associated with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.","summary":"House Republicans released a bill to avoid a looming partial government shutdown at the end of September.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republican-cr-continuing-resolution/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/06/c86d4361-3c6a-4ba6-83ad-f6ff10d38c7a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8a0f6e3ef79f7ed8ee890b330829410a/gettyimages-2162706308.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/06/2369815619552/3175207_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-07 00:17:57","author":"House Democrats","authors":["House Democrats"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":255835400,"title":"Liz Cheney's Four-Word Message for Texas Voters","text":"Former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney had a short and direct message for any Texans who are \"discouraged\" by the state's political leader's \"embrace\" of former President Donald Trump.\"Vote for Colin Allred,\" Cheney told attendees during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Friday, throwing her endorsement behind the Democrat running against Texas Senator Ted Cruz this November.Cheney, a once high-ranking Republican, has been increasingly vocal against the former president as the 2024 election inches closer. During an appearance at Duke University on Wednesday, the former congresswoman announced her intent to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. At Friday's event, she said that her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, plans to do the same.Elaborating on her endorsement for Allred, Cheney said from the stage in Austin that \"you might not agree on every policy position, but we need people who are going to serve in good faith.\"\"We need people who are honorable public servants, and in this race that is Colin Allred, so I'll be working on his behalf,\" Cheney added, according to a report from Dallas Morning News. Cruz, who has endorsed Trump for president, shot back at Cheney's comments in a statement to Dallas Morning News, calling her the \"poster child of flip-flopping.\" Cheney was one of two Republicans who served on the House Special Committee tasked with investigating the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Chloe Louise For Mailonline Published:00:24 BST, 7 September 2024 |Updated:00:41 BST, 7 September 2024 e-mail 12 shares 4 View comments Strictly Come Dancing's cast and crew are reportedly furious over the return of professional dancer Aljaž Škorjanec, as it's claimed he was involved in backstage row with a female dancer. The Slovenian dancer, 34, is set to return to the BBC show for its new series, two years after an altercation on the 2022 live tour, according to The Sun. Two years after his exit, it's reported that Aljez departed the show after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour. The decision to bring back the star to the BBC show has reportedly raised eyebrows, especially given a string of scandals that have beset the show in recent weeks. A source told the publication: 'Has the BBC learned nothing from the past ten months? Strictly Come Dancing's cast and crew are reportedly furious over the return of professional dancer Aljaž Škorjanec The Slovenian dancer, 34, is set to return to the BBC show for its new series, two years after an altercation on the 2022 live tour (pictured with celebrity partner Sara Davies in 2021) 'Amid ongoing furore around the behaviour of its male pros, they actively recruited a dancer who left under a cloud. 'Aljaž was touted as an unproblematic, returning legend but that couldn't be further from the truth.' The source claimed the crew and cast were 'relieved' to see his departure two years ago and are now 'aghast' to see him back on the show They revealed he allegedly got 'very drunk' on a night out on tour two years ago which led him being involved in a 'very serious, pretty shocking altercation' with a female. The incident was said to have made the female dancer feel 'deeply uncomfortable'. Aljaž's scene has been reportedly discussed backstage at length since and the decision to bring him back has 'baffled' the crew. 'Execs would have to be living in a cave not to have heard the rumours', the source added. According to the publication, the BBC denied an official complaint was made over the incident, and it had been previously stated that Aljaz left of his own accord. The BBC declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline, and told The Sun that they did not recognise the claims against Aljaz. MailOnline has reached out to Aljaž's representatives for a comment. At the time, Aljaz reportedly agreed to exit the show after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour Aljaz is married to fellow Strictly pro and It Takes Two host Janette Manrara, and sources claim that after his 2022 altercation, the crew are 'aghast' bosses have invited him back The return of the professional dancer, who is married to fellow Strictly pro and It Takes Two host Janette Manrara, is the latest drama to hit the BBC show, as several allegations of abuse from professionals have come to light. The scandal erupted when actress Amanda Abbington quit the show last year before claiming that her partner Giovanni Pernice was abusive towards her - later leaving the show. Giovanni has vehemently denied the claims. Amanda, 50, abruptly left the BBC show citing 'personal issues' and hasn't been seen on screen since, even quitting social media last month in the wake of her former dance partner's sacking. Giovanni, 33, was suspended while a BBC probe is underway over allegations made by Amanda and two other former celebrity partners. Sources previously claimed Amanda, Ranvir Singh and Laura Whitmore had an 'emotional summit' where they 'compared notes' about their time working with Giovanni on the show. Amanda quit Strictly due to 'personal reasons' before reports she had demanded footage of their rehearsals after the experience in the competition left her with PTSD. Meanwhile Ranvir complained about Giovanni to producers back in 2020, during their time on the show, while Laura said she 'cried every day' and felt 'uncomfortable' while dancing with him in 2016. The BBC are currently believed to be scouring through nine years of Strictly footage to confirm or deny claims from three celebrities. Giovanni has not returned for the show's 2024 season. Soon after, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. Strictly bosses then announced plans to introduce chaperones during training, and the appointment of two new welfare producers, after Graziano's shock sacking from the show. Love Island star Zara broke her silence on the scandal as she wrote on Instagram on Tuesday morning that while much of her time on Strictly 'was everything I could have dreamt of' inside the training room with Graziano there were 'particular incidents which are incredibly distressing'. 'I felt it was right that I post something regarding the recent media reports,' Zara began. 'Strictly is one of the most magical shows on TV and one that I dreamt of being on since I was a little girl.' He reportedly agreed to exit the show and competition after an alleged 'shocking' incident with a fellow female professional dancer on the nationwide tour (pictured in 2019) despite the show''s controversial months, Aljaž - who was accused of upsetting show staff with 'aggressive and pompous behaviour' in 2022 - is set to return (pictured in 2019) Zara explained that she didn't report the incidents at the time as she was 'scared' of backlash. New reports then emerged claiming that Zara also suffered a leg fracture during training, and continued to dance. She picked up the nasty injury while preparing to dance and despite being in agonising pain, pushed through to compete in the dance-off. Zara is thought to have told BBC bosses of the 'rigorous' training sessions she endured while paired with Graziano on the show. However, a source close to Graziano told the publication that he encouraged her to take breaks, and she wanted to continue training despite her pain. Then an unnamed female Strictly dancer was brought into the scandal after it was reported that they screamed in their male partner's face and berated him off-camera. The Daily Mirror reported that the household name's allegations do not include physical abuse. A source said: 'The man in question felt very much victimized by the behaviour of his Strictly partner. 'He alleges that on several occasions she flew into a real fury when he couldn't get the steps right, and on one occasion screamed full in his face. They rowed every single day. 'He was left upset, struggling to sleep, and feeling isolated in the process. But even worse, he felt totally unsupported by Strictly. When he suffered the setback, it was clear he was struggling, but he felt there was no duty of care. After leaving the show, he was not contacted again, even by phone.' The source said he had been in a bad place and feared a public -backlash if he spoke out. And despite the show''s controversial months, Aljaž - who was accused of upsetting show staff with 'aggressive and pompous behaviour' in 2022 - is set to return. Aljaz, who the series before was paired with Dragon's Den star Sara Davies, revealed in 2022 that he would be leaving Strictly, with sources adding he was 'on the fence' about leaving before deciding to move onto other projects. A source told The Sun that members of the crew were left 'really upset' by 'incidents' involving Aljaz during Strictly's previous series. They added: 'He verbally lashed out at various staff members behind the scenes in what some thought was an unnecessarily aggressive manner. 'Aljaz was seen by some as arrogant and pompous too – and it left a bad taste in some of the staff's mouths. Not many people will miss him.' However a representative for Aljaz told the publication: 'Aljaz has the utmost respect for everyone working on the show and it is untrue to say he was forced out or acted in an aggressive manner at any time. 'It was Aljaz's decision to leave the show after an incredible 9 years.' Sarah James, Executive Producer of Strictly Come Dancing said at the time: 'We are so sad to be saying goodbye to Aljaž after almost a decade as a professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing. 'Since lifting the glitterball with Abbey Clancy in his debut series he has become a firm favourite with viewers across the country. 'During his nine series he has provided us with some unforgettable moments on the show through his incredible choreography, passion for dance and heart of gold. 'He will be missed by his Strictly family, both on and off the dancefloor, and we wish him only the very best as he embarks on his next chapter.' It came after sources revealed that Aljaz had made his decision to leave Strictly 'a little while ago' having pondered for some time, and is grateful to the show for allowing his 'dream become a reality'.

Gavin Newsom vetoes $150K down payment ‘handout’ to illegal immigrant home buyers","text":"Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom struck down a bill Friday that would have made the Golden State the first in the nation to offer down payment assistance to illegal immigrant home buyers. Assembly Bill 1840, which was approved by both chambers of the Democrat-controlled California Legislature last month, sought to grant undocumented immigrants access to the state’s taxpayer-funded home loan program, which provides up to $150,000 in down payment assistance for eligible first-time home buyers. Newsom, 56, expressed concern over the budgetary impact the expansion of the program would have in his veto announcement. “Given the finite funding available for [California Housing Finance Agency] programs, expanding program eligibility must be carefully considered within the broader context of the annual state budget to ensure we manage our resources effectively,” he wrote in a memo to California lawmakers. “For this reason, I am unable to sign this bill.” California faced a $46 billion budget deficit last fiscal year before Newsom signed the state’s new spending plan in June. Newsom’s veto follows intense criticism of the bill from California Republicans, who argued that it was nothing more than a “handout” and a “betrayal” of citizens of the state that would incentivize illegal immigration. “Expanding state-funded home loans to include illegal immigrants is not just another handout — it’s a massive overreach that shifts the financial burden onto law-abiding taxpayers,” San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond said of AB 1840 in an X post. “One million Californians live in deep poverty, and 180,000 are homeless … This is an unbelievable betrayal to the citizens of this state,” Assemblywoman Kate Sanchez (R-Rancho Santa Margarita) wrote on X after the measure cleared the state assembly. The California governor’s decision not to sign the bill into law also comes one day after former President Donald Trump slammed the legislation during a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, where he announced that if elected, he would “ban mortgages for illegal aliens.” “In California they’re passing a law where they’re going to give illegal aliens money to buy a house,” Trump said. “But our soldiers, our veterans that are laying on the streets can’t have them.” Newsom denied that politics played any role in his veto decision. “The bill that was sent to me was a program that had no money, and it was expanding eligibility to a program that had no money,” Newsom told reporters, according to Politico. “It seemed rather curious to me,” he added. “So it was unnecessary and completely consistent with prior vetoes along those similar lines.”","summary":"Newsom, 56, expressed concern over the budgetary impact the expansion of the program would have in his veto announcement. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/california-gov-gavin-newsom-vetoes-150k-down-payment-handout-to-illegal-immigrant-home-buyers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89100181.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YGX4W9rR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:40:54","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":255834806,"title":"House Republican unveil bill to avoid shutdown. Senate Democrats say they're wasting precious time","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled on Friday their legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government into late March, when a new president and Congress would make the final decision on agency spending and priorities for fiscal year 2025. Republicans are also adding a hot-button immigration issue to the measure by requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when someone registers to vote. Inclusion of the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating prospects for the spending bill’s passage. Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week following a traditional August recess spent mostly in their home states and districts. They are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund the agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. “Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. “Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.” But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party. “If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans’ hands,” Schumer and Murray said. Johnson’s decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of their priorities in legislation. Some Republican leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with spending disagreements. Republicans say requiring proof of citizenship would ensure American elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the nation’s federal election system. But opponents say the available evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly rare and such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who don’t have the necessary documents readily available when they get a chance to register. What remains to be seen is what happens if the bill passes the House this week and the Senate declines to take it up or votes it down. The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28, though there’s also money to help cover additional security costs associated with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans unveiled on Friday their legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund the government into late March, when a new president and Congress would make the final decision…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/house-republican-unveil-bill-to-avoid-shutdown-senate-democrats-say-theyre-wasting-precious-time/article_e9d4d034-cc9c-55d2-8cfb-22d3f27a5009.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/5a/f5a868ea-63a4-5980-b2ed-cc52766d3430/66db93fd0f413.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:39:50","author":"Kevin Freking The Associated Press,Wire Content","authors":["Kevin Freking The Associated Press","Wire Content"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":255835162,"title":"Republican former VP Dick Cheney says he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"WASHINGTON - Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday he will vote for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris over Republican former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. elections, following a similar statement made by his daughter Liz Cheney this week.Trump and Harris are locked in a tight race for the vote and face off in a debate next week.Some Republicans upset with Trump's control over their party and his actions have recently thrown support behind Harris, including dozens of former staffers of former Presidents George H.W.

Lemon, 58, made his plea to DailyMail.com as he walked the streets of Greenwich Village in New York City on Friday. He was predicting her endorsement would encourage younger voters to cast their ballot for Harris come November Swift, who has almost 500 million followers between her social media accounts has more recently steered clear of politics preferring instead not to intervene so as not to alienate her fan base, known as ‘Swifties’, although she did speak out in 2020. But as far as Lemon is concerned, time is of the essence and believes Swift should make her political allegiances clear once again. ‘Taylor Swift needs to step forward. She’s very influential. She can move an election,’ Lemon said. ‘If she believes in women’s reproductive rights and a women’s right to choose – and in democracy, I would say that Taylor Swift needs to come through. It would be a wasted opportunity if she does not use her platform for good,’ Lemon said. Swift has previously criticized the GOP nominee and vowed to ‘vote [him] out’ ahead of the 2020 election after being left ‘completely blindsided’ by his 2016 victory. Ahead of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton, Swift kept quiet on her political leanings leading some to suspect she was actually a secret Republican. But during the 2018 midterms, she voiced strong support for Tennessee Democrats including Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and House candidate Jim Cooper. She explained in an Instagram post: ‘In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. ‘I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.’ In 2020, the Blank Space singer came out in full support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. ‘I will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year’s presidential election,’ she said. ‘Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs,’ she said in an interview with V Magazine ahead of the election.’ She also tagged Trump in an X post blasting him: ‘After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November.’ In her documentary, Miss Americana, which came out in 2020, Swift addressed her decision to speak publicly about politics further saying: ‘I need to be on the right side of history.’ Swift has been a close ally of the LGBTQ community. She also slammed the United States Supreme Court after it overturned Roe v Wade ending the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022. The Swifties have mobilized to throw their support behind Vice President Kamala Harris with the ‘@Swifties4Kamala’ X account already attracting 76,000 followers. During last month’s Democratic National Committee convention in Chicago, the event even paid homage to Swift with stations where DNC attendees could make friendship bracelets – which are traded by Swifties at concerts and fan meet-ups. The New York Times reported earlier this year that Joe Biden’s campaign had been actively seeking Swift’s endorsement. Trump has previously questioned whether Swift is ‘legitimately liberal’ or if it’s all an act. The former president discussed the megastar in an interview with Variety co-Editor-in-Chief Ramin Setoodeh for his book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass which was released in June. ‘She is liberal, or is that just an act?’ Trump asked. ‘She’s legitimately liberal? It’s not an act?’ He added: ‘It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.’ Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 following a short and disastrous run as a morning show host. His sudden downfall came months after he had said then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was past her prime. CNN chairman and CEO at the time Chris Licht announced that they had ‘parted ways.’ Lemon characterized it as a firing and said it was surprise to him. ‘After 17 years at CNN I would have thought someone in management would have the decency to tell me directly,’ Lemon said. CNN offered no public explanation for Lemon’s dismissal. During the discussion which ultimately led to his departure alongside co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins about the ages of politicians, he said that Haley was not ‘in her prime.’ A woman, he said, was considered in her prime ‘in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s.’ Harlow challenged Lemon, trying to clarify what he was referencing: ‘I think we need to qualify. Are you talking about prime for childbearing or are you talking about prime for being president?’ ‘Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying what the facts are,’ Lemon responded.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOusted CNN anchor Don Lemon is urging pop superstar Taylor Swift to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, urgently requests action from Taylor Swift before the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/don-lemon-former-cnn-anchor-urgently-requests-action-from-taylor-swift-before-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Ousted-CNN-anchor-Don-Lemon-issues-urgent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:36:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.302},{"id":255834898,"title":"Is there a ’60-day rule’ in the US elections? What to know in 500 words","text":"Former President Donald Trump has said the Department of Justine has a “60-day rule” that prevents it from taking certain law enforcement actions against candidates in the run-up to a United States election. If Trump’s statement were correct, it would have wide-ranging implications as he stares down two federal indictments: one in Washington, DC, for efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and another in Florida for allegedly hoarding classified documents. Friday marks 60 days until the presidential election on November 5. So what are the facts behind the claim? What did Trump say? Trump invoked the “60-day rule” while responding to an updated indictment filed last month in the federal election case in Washington, DC. “It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election – but they just have taken such action,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Others have since echoed that criticism. Last week, Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, questioned federal prosecutors in the Florida case about whether holding a trial before the election would violate the rule. Legal experts, however, have rejected that position. And Jay Bratt, a federal prosecutor in the Florida case, told Cannon that, since Trump had already been charged, no rule or norm would be violated. So what was Trump talking about? Trump was referring to an unwritten — and admittedly vague — guideline that Justice Department officials have adopted over the years. A 2018 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general clearly states: “No Department policy contains a specific prohibition on overt investigative steps within a particular period before an election.” Still, it noted that many officials have adhered to “a longstanding unwritten practice to avoid overt law enforcement and prosecutorial activities close to an election, typically within 60 or 90 days of Election Day”. The report probed the decision by former FBI director James Comey to reopen an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails just 11 days before the 2016 election. Comey later said avoiding actions that could impact the election was a “very important norm”. Does Trump have any recourse? No. Because the guideline is unwritten, it is a best practice rather than a legal requirement. When and how the guideline applies is up to department officials. Legal scholars have further argued that Trump cannot claim he was being treated unfairly because the guideline only applies to major actions, like the filing of brand-new indictments. Because Trump had been indicted long before the 60-day window, the guideline would theoretically not apply to the ongoing federal proceedings in Washington, DC, and Florida. The guideline is also not valid for Trump’s upcoming sentencing in New York or the pending trial in Georgia: Both of which are state-level proceedings, whereas the guideline is strictly federal. Finally, Trump may need to check his math. Even if he were correct about the rule, Special Counsel Jack Smith filed the updated indictment on August 27. That is 70 days out from the November 5 vote.","summary":"Trump falsely claims the Justice Department is hamstrung in the lead-up to vote as he stares down two federal cases.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/6/is-there-a-60-day-rule-in-the-us-elections-what-to-know-in-500-words?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24250625149572-1725653328.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:36:36","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":255834332,"title":"High-Profile Influencers Were Working For Moscow Without Knowing It","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Social media influencers have been on the paycheck of the Kremlin getty Several high-profile political influencers, each with millions of followers, were collecting a paycheck from the Kremlin but apparently were none the wiser.

RT, formerly Russia Today, paid the money to Tennessee-based Tenet Media, which managed a network of commentators who focused on Western political and cultural issues. The indictment identified Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva as the RT staffers, the BBC reported. Tenet Media was not directly named in the indictment, and it did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. influencers claim they were victims of the alleged plot and have insisted that they maintained full editorial control of their respective content. The Old Russian Playbook In all likelihood, the influencers may have produced the same content even without a paycheck coming from Moscow, but the money allowed their voices to be amplified on social media. \"We should absolutely be concerned about Moscow supporting influencers on social media. Even now that we know about it, our knowledge is not going to cure the problem, and these pieces of information are already out there. The damage is likely larger and more persistent than people realize, as these biased views have already spread widely,\" warned Dr. Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University.

Here’s What To Know As Truth Social Hits New Lows Spreading misinformation has long been a tool of the Kremlin, and from the same Russian playbook that has been used for centuries. \"The concern with Moscow is its goals. For the last one hundred years, Russia has used the same set of tactics to discredit, sow division and chaos, introduce mistrust, and seek to undermine democratic institutions. Only the tools have changed—social media,\" explained Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. Loss Of Influence A question that also needs to be asked is whether Moscow was supporting influencers to use them to spread misinformation or if it was seeking to discredit them once a link was established to Russian money. \"History is filled with similar attempts by many nations, including the U.S.A's 'spoiling operation,' approved by the 40 Committee, which sought to alter elections in Chile and prevent the spread of communism,\" said Wright. \"Tactics and tools are more accessible to discern than goals. It's still not proven what the actual Russian goals were, and that could be one of the goals.\" For now, the influencers are claiming they were victims—and it is possible that their supporters may see them as such. It isn't clear if any disclosure that Russia was funding will cost them followers. \"Even when we're aware that someone is biased or has been paid for their opinion, we still tend to trust them more than we should,\" said Ariely. \"While we might take their views with a grain of salt, we don't discount them enough. This means that even if we know certain influencers are being paid to promote specific viewpoints, we'll likely still give their opinions more weight than they deserve. We end up entertaining ideas from sources with agendas very different from our own more seriously than we should, even when we know we shouldn't fully trust them.\" Can It Be Countered? There is the old standby that knowing is half the battle, but in the era of social media where people believe what they want it could take much more to successfully counter such misinformation campaigns. \"We need to demand influencers to be transparent about the source of their influence in its entirety—from their funding sources to their paid sponsorships,\" suggested Ariely. Transparency may not solve the problem entirely, but influencers should still prominently disclose sponsorships. \"It would make influencers more cautious about accepting certain deals and allow their audiences to better evaluate the content,\" added Ariely. \"Ultimately, we need to make our information systems more worthy of the trust we're evolutionarily inclined to give them. Simply teaching distrust isn't viable; instead, we need to foster environments that deserve our trust.\" The greatest challenge may be in handling trust in digital spaces, especially with influencers in the political space, where election results could be impacted. \"Simply teaching people not to trust isn't viable or desirable, as trust is a fundamental and positive aspect of human nature,\" Ariely continued. \"Instead, we need to build information systems that are worthy of our trust. Rather than changing human nature, we should adapt our online environments to deserve the trust we're predisposed to give.\" Follow me on Twitter.

That measure passed in 2020 with 85% of the vote. Kate has consistently and tirelessly worked to ensure that the police have the tools they need to protect public safety. At the same time, she is a champion of social justice and insists on fiscal efficiency and transparency in policing.

Thursday‘s front page featured side-by-side articles, one about the effect of fires on the climate crisis and the other about the big travel weekend expected for Labor Day. How ironic. What was not mentioned was the effect of so much travel on climate. Should we be celebrating the increase in travel that spews carbon? A suggestion for the future: rather than traveling all over the world, let’s try discovering the amazing things that are within a short or even a longish drive from our homes. Enjoy a park in another city, a museum and a restaurant you haven’t tried or even known existed — maybe even a bike ride to our destination. That offers a much smaller carbon footprint, a chance to see what a neighboring community has to offer and, oh yeah, it’s a lot less expensive.

Why would any veteran or family of a veteran ever vote for Donald Trump after he called our brave men and women in the military, some of whom gave their lives for our freedoms, “losers and suckers,” as confirmed by General John Kelly. It is just unbelievable. He is a disgrace to our country. And to blame Harris for the withdrawal of our troops in Afghanistan that was arranged by the Trump administration and began while Trump was still in office. The Biden administration just continued what was already happening. How Trump supporters ignore the facts and just blame anybody else shows their ignorance.

He can never be trusted with power again.” “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he concluded. Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, first revealed earlier in the day that her father would be voting for the Democratic ticket during remarks at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas. The former Republican congresswoman said Wednesday that she would be voting for Harris, citing “the danger that Donald Trump poses.” In her remarks Friday, Cheney unleashed a torrent of criticism against the Republican presidential ticket, calling Trump “a depraved human being” and labeling him and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, “misogynistic pigs.” “Every Republican, anybody who’s contemplating casting a vote for that ticket, you know, really needs to think about what they are enabling, what they’re embracing and the danger of electing people who will only honor election results if they agree with the outcome, and who are willing to set aside the Constitution,” she said in Austin. “And you know in the case of Donald Trump, promote, provoke, exploit violence in order to seize power.” The former congresswoman, who previously told CNN was committed to doing what was necessary to stop Trump from returning to the White House, said Friday that she expected to campaign against the former president in battleground states this fall. And she suggested that her father shared her views about Trump. “If you think about the moment that we’re in and you think about how serious this moment is, you know, my dad believes – and he said publicly – that there’s never been an individual in our country who is as grave a threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is,” she said. Dick Cheney’s support for Harris represents a stunning move for the staunch conservative who was vice president to George W. Bush and a longtime congressman from Wyoming who held several leadership roles in the House Republican Caucus. The former vice president was critical of his party and Trump in the wake of the January 6 attack. In campaign ads for his daughter’s 2022 reelection effort, he called Trump a “threat to our republic” and a “coward.” “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” Dick Cheney said of the former president in the ad. His daughter’s outspokenness against Trump and the former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election – including her vote to impeach him led to her losing her leadership position as the No. 3 House Republican. The GOP caucus ousted her as conference chair in May 2021 and replaced her with New York’s Elise Stefanik, a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6 attack. Liz Cheney went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the Capitol riot and ultimately lost her seat in Congress to a Trump-backed Republican primary challenger. She argued Friday that Trump and Vance were “doing everything they can to drive Reagan Republicans away” and that the duo “certainly do not reflect the importance of that Reagan philosophy of peace through strength and a strong national defense.” Cheney said she watched parts of the Republican National Convention in July and took away that “it isn’t just that the party is trying to whitewash what Donald Trump did … the party is embracing it.” Speaking about her decision to support Harris, Cheney said while she has “serious policy disagreements on a whole range of issues,” she feels that “those of us who believe in the defense of our democracy, in the defense of our Constitution, and the survival of our republic have a duty in this election cycle to come together to put those things above politics.” In addition to backing Harris, Cheney also endorsed Democratic Rep. Colin Allred’s effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.","summary":"“In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a statement.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/09/06/dick-cheney-says-hes-voting-for-harris-in-november-and-trump-can-never-be-trusted-with-power-again/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Liz_Cheney_says_Dick_Cheney_is_voting_for_Kamala_Harris1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:26:52","author":"Cnn Com Wire Service","authors":["Cnn Com Wire Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":255834896,"title":"5 Things to Watch in Congress in September","text":"WASHINGTON—Lawmakers are returning to Capitol Hill from a monthlong recess on Sept. 9 to work through an ambitious to-do list on a tight deadline. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government by passing new spending bills or agreeing to an extension. However, lawmakers will also have other agenda items to address, including China, defense, and agriculture. Hanging over all of this is the election, which will be 57 days away once lawmakers return and is likely to affect their actions and rhetoric. Congress is likely to miss the Sept. 30 deadline to pass its regular funding bills for Fiscal Year 2025. As a result, it will need to pass a “continuing resolution” (CR), which temporarily funds the government at levels set for the previous year without authorizing new spending. The composition of the CR is what’s dividing Congress at present, leading to fears of a shutdown. Republicans want to include in the CR a bill known as the “SAVE Act,” which Democrats oppose. The SAVE Act would require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship at the time of registration, which Republicans argue is necessary amid high levels of illegal immigration. Democrats argue the bill would disenfranchise American citizens for minor clerical errors during voter registration. The House of Representatives passed the SAVE Act on July 10, with 216 Republicans and five Democrats voting in favor. Many Senate Democrats, who control the body, have not publicly opposed the SAVE Act, though they are unlikely to accept a CR that includes it. Only five of the regular 12 appropriations bills—which allocate money to different parts of the federal government and set conditions for how it is spent—have passed the House. The Senate has advanced 11 of the bills to the floor, though none have been passed yet. Senate versions differ from the House’s, requiring further negotiations to reach compromise versions that can pass Congress. Moreover, Republican lawmakers are seeking a long CR that would run into the next president’s term. Then, if former President Donald Trump wins the election and the GOP gains control of Congress, they would be able to enact more conservative funding bills. This is likely to be another area of disagreement with Democrats, who may seek a shorter CR that ends after the election. The over 30 China-related bills to be considered cover a wide range of topics, including protecting U.S. farmland, trade secrets, critical infrastructure, and advanced technology. “From economic and academic espionage to intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices, and U.S. land grabs, the threats posed by Communist China must be confronted with strength,” said Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.) of the planned blitz of counter-CCP bills. “This week’s legislation aims to bolster our national security, protect American economic interests, defend our sovereignty, and secure our future,” he said in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times. Tiffany’s legislation, one of the China week bills, would counter a proposed pandemic treaty that critics say would give the CCP-linked World Health Organization (WHO) too much control over U.S. domestic affairs. Tiffany’s bill would require a Senate vote before the United States adopts any proposed measures under the treaty, which he said “will protect our sovereignty and ensure that the safety of our citizens remains in the hands of the U.S., not a corrupt international organization.” Several of these bills simply order studies into an issue, with some matters requiring more action—like restricting outbound investment to China and ending the de minimis privilege (which exempts shipments under $800 from tariffs) on Chinese goods—left out entirely. With the Republicans’ four-seat majority, it’s unclear how these bills will fare in the House. Partisan riders attached to the wide-ranging bill, including measures addressing abortion and gender transitioning, could fuel debates slowing the bill’s passage. The divided House and Senate will also have to reconcile their different NDAA proposals before they can send a final bill to the president’s desk. While actual funding is authorized in a separate bill, the NDAA lays out the broad policies, purchases, and initiatives that Congress wants the Pentagon to pursue. Much of the NDAA deals with vehicles, technology, and weapons procurement that will continue from one year to the next. The NDAA also addresses quality-of-life issues that affect military personnel, such as housing and childcare programs. Still, the NDAA can become a political arena, with lawmakers vying for more partisan policy riders to include or exclude in the scope of the national defense focus. The House and Senate will have to reconcile their overall spending. The legislation, passed about every five years, funds land conservation projects and sets national policy on agriculture-related issues. It was up for renewal in September 2023, but has been a significant topic of contention between the left and the right. The current House version of the bill would cut $30 billion from the SNAP program over the next 10 years, which critics say undercuts food security among low-income Americans. Nevertheless, the bill has passed committee, receiving the support of four House Democrats in a 33–21 vote. Meanwhile, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), chair of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, has sponsored competing legislation in the upper chamber. In response, House Republicans on Sept. 6 unveiled a bill to patch up at least some of the holes in the VA’s budget. The money comes with strings attached. If the bill is enacted, VA Secretary Denis McDonough will have 30 days to submit a report to the Appropriations and Veterans Affairs committees in both chambers of Congress, detailing changes to the group’s budgeting and forecasting procedures. Thirty days after that, he will have to submit a report detailing how the pension and compensation funds are being used. A similar report will have to be filed every 90 days until Sept. 30, 2026. The bill also mandates an investigation into causes of the shortfall by the VA inspector general.","summary":"After a monthlong recess, lawmakers are returning to Washington on Sept. 9 with a busy schedule—and facing a looming presidential election.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/5-things-to-watch-in-congress-in-september-5717362","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/06/id5719704-GettyImages-1813691282-2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:23:32","author":"Arjun Singh,Jackson Richman,Joseph Lord,Ryan Morgan,Stacy Robinson,Terri Wu","authors":["Arjun Singh","Jackson Richman","Joseph Lord","Ryan Morgan","Stacy Robinson","Terri Wu"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":255834246,"title":"RFK Jr. notches wins in North Carolina and Michigan in his effort to get off ballots","text":"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. scored a pair of legal victories Friday in the battleground states of North Carolina and Michigan, and a setback in Wisconsin, in his quest to get his name off of the ballots in some states after he suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump. North Carolina’s intermediate-level Court of Appeals issued an order granting Kennedy’s request to halt the mailing of ballots that included his name, upending plans in the state just as officials were about to begin sending out the nation’s first absentee ballots for the Nov. 5 presidential election. The court — a three-judge panel ruling unanimously — also told a trial judge to order the State Board of Elections to distribute ballots without Kennedy’s name on them. No legal explanation was given. In Michigan, its intermediate-level Court of Appeals ruled that Kennedy should be removed from the ballot, reversing a decision made earlier this week by a lower court judge. And in Wisconsin, a Dane County circuit court judge denied Kennedy’s request for a temporary restraining order to put on hold the state elections commission’s decision to keep him on the ballot. “A matter of such consequence deserves a full development of the record with appropriate briefing by all sides,” Judge Stephen Ehlke wrote. He set a scheduling conference for Wednesday, a week before the deadline for the printing of ballots. In separate statements, a Kennedy attorney praised the North Carolina and Michigan rulings, saying they uphold state elections laws and support ballot integrity by ensuring no one must vote for a candidate no longer running in their state. A favorable outcome for Kennedy could assist Trump’s efforts to win North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin. North Carolina law required the first absentee ballots to be mailed or transmitted to those already asking for them no later than 60 days before the general election, making Friday the deadline. The process of reprinting and assembling ballot packages likely would take more than two weeks, state attorneys have said. The State Board of Elections formally asked the state Supreme Court late Friday to reverse the Court of Appeals decision. State lawyers asked the justices to act quickly before adjustments to the ballots ordered earlier Friday is complete — likely in a few days. Kennedy, the nominee of the We The People party in North Carolina, had sued last week to get off the state’s ballots after he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. But the Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections rejected the request, saying it was too late in the process of printing ballots and coding tabulation machines. Kennedy then sued. Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt on Thursday denied Kennedy’s effort to keep his name off ballots, prompting his appeal. In the meantime, Holt had told election officials to hold back sending absentee ballots until noon Friday. More than 136,300 people — military and overseas workers and in-state civilian residents — have requested North Carolina absentee ballots so far, the State Board of Elections said late Friday. In an email, state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell told election directors in all 100 counties to preserve current ballots and coding in case rulings revert to keeping Kennedy on the ballot. More than 2.9 million absentee and in-person ballots with Kennedy’s name on them had been printed. Counties would have to pay for the cost of reprinting ballots. With Friday’s deadline not met, North Carolina election officials still are faced with meeting a federal law requiring absentee ballots go to military and overseas voters by Sept. 21. They may try to seek a waiver if new ballots can’t be produced in time. Friday’s ruling in North Carolina didn’t include the names of judges who considered Kennedy’s request — the court releases the names after 90 days. The court has 15 judges — 11 registered Republicans and four Democrats. Names usually have been withheld from such orders to discourage “judge shopping,” or purposefully seeking out a judge who’s likely to rule in your favor, the court has said. Kennedy sued Democratic Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Aug. 30 to get off the ballot. He filed suit in Wisconsin on Wednesday. Friday’s ruling from Michigan said that while Kennedy’s request was made close to the deadline to give notice to local election officials, it wasn’t so unreasonable as to deny relief to him. Benson’s office will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline Published:00:05 BST, 7 September 2024 |Updated:00:18 BST, 7 September 2024 e-mail 16 shares View comments The Strictly Come Dancing professionals have voiced their predictions for the show after it was plunged into crisis. In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals, with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour, while Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals. Bookmakers have since revealed new odds on the show being scrapped - saying the fate of the show hangs on this year's series. Yet with the new series set to air and in honour of it being the show's 20th anniversary, this year's professionals have revealed what they think the show will be like in 20 years. Aljaž Škorjanec, who returned to the show this series after a two-year hiatus, has grand plans for the programme, predicting technology will overhaul the format. The Strictly pros have revealed their predictions for scandal plague's programme's future as bookies reveal new odds on show being axed (pictured: Aljaz Skorjanec) Amy Dowden said: 'I think it will always keep its element of Ballroom and that's the beauty of this show, and what makes it so iconic but it will continue to develop' He shared: 'I can’t wait for the show to start using things like holograms and AI. It’ll be tricky to know what’s real and what’s not, but that might be the next technical step.' Yet he warned against making too many changes, adding: 'I think what makes Strictly so successful is that it’s stuck to its original format watching dances that people love and then learn to love themselves. 'Let’s be honest, most people watching Strictly haven’t been in a dance class or studio themselves, but even watching it feels the same. 'That’s why people get more invested each year. So, keep the format exactly the same, but just add even more to the production.' Amy Dowden - who is also returning after taking a year off while she battled breast cancer - shared: 'I think it's quite exciting to see how much it’s evolved. The costumes, the set, the dance, the dancers, the music and also the show keeps evolving by adding couple’s choice, Argentine Tango, Charleston. 'I think it will always keep its element of Ballroom and that's the beauty of this show, and what makes it so iconic but it will continue to develop. I think it’ll still be the nation's favourite show.' Carlos Gu brushed off any rumours of the series being axed as he predicted: 'I genuinely think the show will go on for as long as possible. 'Every year, we have different new, fresh celebrities. It’s always a new experience for people who watch the show, so you never find it cliché and it never feels like, \"Oh, I’ve seen this before.\" 'Every year is a new experience for us Professional Dancers as well as for the celebrities.' Carlos Gu brushed off any rumours of the series being axed as he predicted: 'I genuinely think the show will go on for as long as possible' He was echoed by Dianne Buswell who shared: 'I honestly think it is still the best show and will continue to be the best show on TV for many years to come' Gorka Marquez wasn't sure when he was asked about the future but said: 'I don't know but I do hope I am still here in 20 years' time. I will be 53 but hopefully I’ll still be here' Johannes Radebe predicted things will only get better, saying: 'The show has evolved so much since it started' Jowita Przystal reasoned that the nature of the show makes it hard to change, explaining: 'I never thought we could get better and better each year' He was echoed by Dianne Buswell who shared: 'I honestly think it is still the best show and will continue to be the best show on TV for many years to come. 'I hope in 20 years time they’ll look back at stuff I've done with my partners and think that was cool. I hope that they look back with fond memories just as we look back on Strictly series one so fondly.' Gorka Marquez wasn't sure when he was asked about the future but said: 'I don't know but I do hope I am still here in 20 years' time. I will be 53 but hopefully I’ll still be here.' Johannes Radebe predicted things will only get better, saying: 'The show has evolved so much since it started. But now, every year, the show keeps topping itself. How we do that, I don't know. 'Honestly, at the end of every series, I think, \"This was the best,\" and then the next year comes, and I think, \"No, this is the best one.\" So, in 20 years, who knows?' Jowita Przystal reasoned that the nature of the show makes it hard to change, explaining: 'I never thought we could get better and better each year because we use the same foundation of ballroom dancing. 'We can’t change the rules; we can’t change the steps. But if you watch Strictly, year by year, it’s just getting better and better.' Karen Haeur's view differed, as she pointed out: 'The show has been evolving over the past few years.

It’s always the same, and that’s comforting' Karen Haeur's view differed, as she pointed out: 'The show has been evolving over the past few years. We get different dancers, different choreographers. The public is so used to what we offer. 'The best thing about Strictly is that it keeps its magic. It doesn’t change too much, which is nice people like that. It's like the warm blanket you had growing up. I think that will always stay. 'Strictly is the beating heart of television; it keeps everyone coming back. It ’s a nice feeling, and I think that’s what it’ll continue to do. It’ll keep bringing joy, continue to bring exciting new ideas, but it will always stay the same in essence. 'There’s a tradition we’ve never lost, and I think that will always remain. Of course, everything else changes as the world changes, and we keep up with the times, but I don’t think it needs to change very much because it’s already a beautiful show.' Kai Widdrington said: 'I think it's going to be bigger and better, probably with more glitter, and filled with weird and wonderful things.' Katya Jones added: 'I imagine that there'll be more glitter and more glamour and more incredible dancing. 'We're going to keep bringing entertainment to the nation and give everybody an opportunity to gather around the TV in their living rooms, all of the generations together, because that's what would do best.' Lauren Oakley praised the traditional format, sharing: 'The beauty of Strictly is that we know what we’re getting. It’s always the same, and that’s comforting. You know what you’re getting on a Saturday night, but it gets bigger and better every year. 'It’s always about watching someone fall in love with dance and have their life transformed, and I think that’s what people love about it. Even in 20 years, I hope it stays the same, with new music and new fashions.' Luba Mushtuk had few words, stating: 'I think there will be more sparkles, more glamour and more wonderful people coming into the show. Michelle Tsiakkas mused: 'I’ve got great hopes for the show because, honestly, I just feel like it keeps getting better and better' Nadiya Bychkova revealed she hoped her seven-year-old daughter, Mila would be able to follow in her footsteps in 20 years time Luba Mushtuk had few words, stating: 'I think there will be more sparkles, more glamour and more wonderful people coming into the show.' Michelle Tsiakkas mused: 'I’ve got great hopes for the show because, honestly, I just feel like it keeps getting better and better. 'Every year, we keep topping what we did the previous year. And that’s obviously thanks to the amazing team we have: the choreographers, people behind the scenes, cameras, costumes, dancers just everybody. 'I think we’re all at the top of our game, which makes it such an amazing show. So, I’m quite certain that the show will just keep getting better and better every year.' Nadiya Bychkova revealed she hoped her seven-year-old daughter, Mila would be able to follow in her footsteps in 20 years time. She shared: 'I think the show is just growing in so many ways. With the way our lives and industry are developing, it's more accessible to more people. We can probably reach an even bigger audience because of social media. 'I think all of us are working on ourselves, and people are working to make sure the whole show is better and really accessible to anyone. So, I think it will just keep on going , keep on growing. 'Who knows, maybe in 20 years, my daughter will be on the show dancing with another celeb! Maybe the next generation will take over.' Nancy Xu predicted big change, saying: 'It might be completely different from what we’re doing now. The show is based on Latin and Ballroom dance at the moment' Neil Jones had high ambitions, saying: 'I can't imagine myself still dancing on the show in 20 years' time. That would make me 62, you never know! Maybe I’ll be a judge by then' Nikita Kuzmin mused: 'I hope it always preserves its core essence and stays true to what it means to people. The show is joyful, it’s family. It’s the people’s show' Vito Coppola did not provide an answer to the question Nancy Xu predicted big change, saying: 'It might be completely different from what we’re doing now. The show is based on Latin and Ballroom dance at the moment. 'This is my sixth year, and when I look back at what I’ve seen in terms of video aspects, group dances, and wardrobe, everything has gone up a level and taken different directions. 'Who knows what the future holds, but I’m very excited.' Neil Jones had high ambitions, saying: 'I honestly think it's still going to be here. It's going to keep growing and developing. 'I can't imagine myself still dancing on the show in 20 years' time, as much as I would love to, I don't know if my body will handle that. That would make me 62, you never know! 'Maybe I’ll be a judge by then....' Nikita Kuzmin mused: 'I hope it always preserves its core essence and stays true to what it means to people. The show is joyful, it’s family. It’s the people’s show. 'In my mind, Strictly is like a warm blanket, or a comforting hug. I hope it remains that way for everyone. Our job is to distract people or cheer them up I think and I hope that feeling will still be there in 20 years.' Vito Coppola did not provide an answer to the question. In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals , with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals The remarks come as Betfred released fresh odds on the show's future. Analysis shows odds of Strictly being axed entirely after this year is 33.3 percent probability, whereas, odds for Strictly to be cancelled next year and for the show to take a break is 55.6 percent probability. Speaking on behalf of Betfred, Showbiz Specialist Kayley Cornelius said: 'This year’s series of Strictly Come Dancing will be crucial in determining the show’s future. 'After a year of ongoing scandals, the BBC will undoubtedly be feeling the pressure to ensure everything runs smoothly, as the series may not survive another significant blow. 'While the current odds of 4/2 suggest it's unlikely that Strictly will be fully axed, the odds of the show taking a break next year are a more convincing 4/5. 'These odds could shorten in the coming weeks as more details emerge regarding the investigation into former pro-dancer Giovanni Pernice’s case.' Strictly's launch show airs Saturday 14 September at 7.20pm on BBC One and iPlayer.

However, once we’d saw the final result, we couldn’t help but wonder how Trump’s running partner would look with another makeover. This time, we were curious to see how the vice presidential hopeful would look sans beard. Once again, Static Media’s photo editors were on hand to give us an exclusive look … but we kinda wish they hadn’t. Fans of Vance may remember that when he first became a public figure as the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” he was actually beard-free. In fact, he made a ton of appearances without facial hair, with stubble being the most we saw on him. At the time, it was endearing. After all, he was much younger. Of course, Vance is older now, and as such, the baby face look is a little incongruous with that. More than his age, though, when Vance first emerged on the scene, he wasn’t involved in politics. That’s since changed, too, and unfortunately for the bestselling author, that particular pivot hasn’t exactly been met with enthusiasm from many who used to admire him. With that in mind, seeing Vance without the beard has us remembering him pre-politics — and it’s a little sad.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Static Media/Getty Images Not too long ago, we wanted to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: We removed JD Vance&#8217;s iconic beard and now regret it first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/we-removed-jd-vances-iconic-beard-and-now-regret-it/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-We-Got-Rid-Of-JD-Vances-Signature.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:17:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.55},{"id":255835430,"title":"Kennedy wins appeal to remove name from North Carolina ballots","text":"(The Center Square) – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has won his judicial appeal, resulting in the North Carolina State Board of Elections needing to remove his name from ballots, including those already printed. The board, in a Friday evening release, said it would appeal the North Carolina Supreme Court decision. Pending that decision, the board said it would work through the weekend to recode the 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election. Absentee by mail ballots were statutorily scheduled to be mailed out on Friday by the 100 county boards of elections. More than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed, the release said. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director for the board, asked counties to try and have ballots into the mail by Sept. 21. None are to be mailed, she instructed, until a date is determined for all counties, the release said. More than 136,300 voters have requested absentee by mail ballots. That includes about 12,700 military and overseas voters. Kennedy was to be on the ballot as representative of the We The People Party. The Democratic Party, on July 26, filed the second of what so far is six lawsuits over 43 days to reverse the state board’s decision to allow him onto the ballot. On Aug. 23, Kennedy suspended his campaign and began to request his name be taken off ballots in the battleground states. He subsequently endorsed Republican former President Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. North Carolina is among the seven battleground states representing 93 electoral college votes. Pennsylvania has 19, North Carolina and Georgia 16 each, Michigan 15, Arizona 11, Wisconsin 10 and Nevada six.","summary":"(The Center Square) – Robert F.

While Department of Defense data shows there was an 18-month stretch in which no U.S. service members were killed in combat in Afghanistan, Trump was not in office for all of this time. The Republican presidential candidate originally made this claim years ago, but has recently repeated the assertion multiple times as the U.S. marked three years since the August 2021 Abbey Gate suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport. A lone ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. service members and roughly 170 Afghans during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan months after President Biden took office.\"When I left office, we had not lost a single service member in combat in Afghanistan in more than 18 months,\" Trump said at a rally in North Carolina on Aug. 23.\"We didn't lose one person in 18 months, and then they took over that disaster,\" Trump said in a campaign video posted to TikTok on Aug. 28. Trump's voice-over played over footage of him interacting with Gold Star families during his recent controversial trip to Arlington National Cemetery, which garnered a rare rebuke from the U.S Army. The video has since garnered around 11.8 million views. The original sound on the video, which sampled a song by Bon Iver and St. Vincent, has since been removed.According to government data from the Defense Casualty Analysis System, there was no 18-month period that occurred entirely under Trump's presidency in which there were no deaths in combat, or \"hostile\" deaths, in Afghanistan.The last service members killed in combat in Afghanistan during Trump's tenure were Sgt. 1st Class Javier Jaguar Gutierrez and Sgt. 1st Class Antonio Rey Rodriguez, who died on Feb. 8, 2020. Later that month, Trump and the Taliban reached a deal which excluded the Afghan government that called for U.S. forces to leave the country by May 1, 2021. Afterwards, there was a roughly 18-month stretch from March 2020 to late August 2021 during which no U.S. service members died in Afghanistan. Trump was in office for roughly 11 months of this time period, and Mr. Biden was in office for the final seven months. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the discrepancy. From the time Mr. Biden took office on Jan. 20, 2021, there were no combat deaths reported until after U.S. forces began their withdrawal from America's longest war, a plan set in motion by Trump before leaving office. In the last full 18 months of Trump's presidency, starting in July 2019, there were 12 combat deaths reported in Afghanistan.

I think that even the judge figured out that it would be enormously disruptive to the country and reflect badly on the judiciary if he attempted to insert himself into the middle of the final stages of a presidential campaign.\"Rove continued, \"And I also agree with the notion...that if he [Merchan] had gone forward with this, it would have, ironically enough, served the interest of Donald Trump.\"Rove also said that Trump has risen in the polls \"the more the people have reacted negatively to his treatment in the courtroom. And if the judge had gone ahead with this, it could have easily been the October surprise. That is to say, [Merchan] would have, potentially gone after Donald Trump in his verdict and the reaction of the American people might have been wholly negative on it and helped advance the cause of Donald Trump in the election.\"Rove also called the ruling a \"wise decision\" and \"good for the country.\"Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Rove's remarks.Meanwhile, after the decision was announced, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to praise the decision, saying in part, \"The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG!\"Trump also said he appreciated Merchan's wording in the decision that says the sentencing \"if necessary\" will be pushed to November 26 at 10 a.m. Trump was previously scheduled to be sentenced on September 18.Political analyst and Dillard University professor Robert Collins told Newsweek on Friday, \"I don't agree with Karl Rove because up to this point, trials and convictions have not changed poll numbers.

As noted above, the only text messages quoted in the Affidavit of Probable Cause in Godlewski I are those in which Godlewski acknowledged and described oral sex with Ms. DuBorgel, the presence of her hair in his \"crotch area,\" and his sexual activity with her in 2010 when she was 15 years of age. Those text messages served as the factual predicate for the single count of Corruption of Minors, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6301(a)(1), contained in the Criminal Information charging that Godlewski \"did repeatedly have inappropriate text [m]essages and contact with a minor\" in 2010. Docket Entry No. 6. Indeed, Godlewski's counsel conceded at the time of oral argument that \"[t]he corruption of minors count in the complaint was consistent with the information in the affidavit.\" In his guilty plea colloquy in Godlewski I, Godlewski admitted that his executed colloquy was a \"signed statement,\" that he \"kn[e]w exactly what you are charged with and what you are pleading to,\" that he understood \"that by pleading guilty you are admitting that you did the things you are charged with,\" that he understood \"the elements of the crime charged that you are pleading to,\" and that he \"admit[ted] that you did the above stated act\" constituting corruption of a minor. The following clause appears directly above his signature on his guilty plea colloquy: I affirm that I have read the above document in its entirety and have reviewed it with my attorney. I affirm that I am aware of the full implications of pleading guilty and nevertheless wish to plead to the specified offense(s). I further affirm that my signature on this Guilty Plea Colloquy and initials on each page of this document are true and correct. Based upon the truthfulness of Godlewski's attestation, Judge Geroulo accepted Godlewski's guilty plea and sentenced him to three months to 23 months house arrest. It is \"well settled that a guilty plea constitutes an admission to all of the facts averred in the indictment,\" and that a trial court may grant summary judgment based upon such an admission…. Godlewski claims that Kelly falsely reported that he \"pleaded guilty to corruption of minors and admitted to having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.\" Based upon the content of Godlewski's text messages which served as the factual basis for the corruption of a minor charge set forth in the Criminal Information, and Godlewski's sworn plea to that specific crime in a court of law, both of the foregoing statements made by Kelly in his article are true. As a result of Godlewski's guilty plea to \"inappropriate text [m]essages\" and \"contact\" with Ms. DuBorgel, as set forth in the Affidavit of Probable Cause quoting the offending text messages admitting and memorializing a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old minor, Godlewski is collaterally estopped from denying his participation in a sexual relationship with Ms. DuBorgel in 2010. Thus, Godlewski has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact concerning the claimed falsity of Kelly's statement that Godlewski \"pleaded guilty to corruption of minors and admitted to having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.\" … Godlewski alternatively alleges that Kelly made false factual statements by indicating that Godlewski was \"selling rabbit holes\" and by displaying an image of an \"Unreal-tor\" sign in the accompanying cartoon, thereby suggesting \"unreality\" on Godlewski's part and questioning his fitness as a realtor in the process. Kelly testified that he viewed Godlewski's QAnon videos before he authored \"an opinion column\" about Godlewski. Kelly stated that his article did not \"raise an inference that Mr. Godlewski is not fit to be a realtor\" because of his QAnon activities, but agreed that he utilized a \"rabbit hole figuratively\" to reference \"the QAnon movement and the rabbit holes people go down believing all this nonsensical stuff.\" Kelly considers the illustration prepared by The Scranton Times' John Cole depicting a rabbit hole and \"Unreal-tor\" sign to be \"a very clever parody on [Godlewski's] job as a realtor and what he was doing\" in broadcasting baseless QAnon conspiracies. It is noteworthy that the phrase \"rabbit hole\" has been used in other court proceedings and legal publications to describe the effect of the QAnon movement on its adherents. Other legal journals have similarly noted the detachment from reality of QAnon's conspiracy theories. Hence, Kelly and The Scranton Times are not alone in using the word \"unreal\" and the phrase \"rabbit holes\" in describing the QAnon movement and its activities. Prior to the publication of the article at issue, Godlewski had publicly broadcasted on social media that United Airlines Flight 93 never crashed in Somerset County on September 11, 2001, that Stephen Paddock did not shoot and kill 60 people and wound another 413 individuals in a mass shooting from the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, that former President Donald Trump had authorized and presided over the executions of President Biden, Hillary Clinton, and other public figures by military tribunals, that the late President George H. W. Bush was also executed by a military tribunal due to the Bush family's involvement with children sex-trafficking, that various Democratic officials were molesting children and drinking their blood to ingest adrenochrome in the basement of a Washington pizzeria, and other equally absurd representations. Such public pronouncements reflect a declarant who is untethered from reality, and Kelly has testified that he viewed those videos prior to preparing his article. Even when the summary judgment record is viewed in a light most favorable to Godlewski as the nonmoving party, it demonstrates that the \"sells rabbits holes\" reference in the title and the \"UNREAL-TOR\" sign and rabbit hole appearing in the cartoon illustration are mere parody rather than actionable statements of fact…. Godlewski's final claimed statements of fact concern Kelly's representation that Godlewski \"happily calls out the cadence\" of the QAnon movement and is \"a purveyor of a poison,\" which Godlewski asserts conveys that he bears some responsibility for the \"criminal acts\" committed during the Capitol riot. Kelly testified that the words \"happily calls out the cadence\" constituted \"figurative language\" that referenced Godlewski's broadcasts on January 6, 2021, when he \"said that [Vice President Mike] Pence had been arrested,\" which statement \"got [Godlewski] in U.S.A. Today,\" and Godlewski's \"rallying cry\" that the Democratic legislators should be \"arrested\" and \"get executed at top levels.\" As for the phrase \"purveyor of a poison,\" Kelly indicated that he was referring to \"the lies and nonsense and disinformation and misinformation that [Godlewski] was spreading on the Internet,\" such as representing as true that \"the real Joe Biden has been executed and the guy who's in the White House is a body double … in a studio out in Arizona,\" and \"that [Godlewski] had traveled in time and talked to Nikola Tesla.\" The role of the QAnon movement and its followers in the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, has been widely reported in legal literature. However, Kelly \"never said [Godlewski] was at the rally\" in his article. To the contrary, Kelly's article expressly states that \"Godlewski told me he wasn't at the Capitol on January 6, but he showed up in USA Today's coverage of riot\" after \"Godlewski posted on Facebook that Vice President Mike Pence had been arrested.\" Once again, Godlewski has not identified sufficient evidence indicating that Kelly made false factual statements \"tying Mr. Godlewski to the criminal insurrection at the Capitol on January 6.\" Kelly's reference to Godlewski happily \"calling out the cadence\" of the QAnon movement is supported by the plethora of QAnon conspiracies broadcasted by Godlewski on social media and viewed by Kelly prior to authoring his article. The other description of Godlewski as a \"purveyor of poison\" constitutes satirical commentary by Kelly based upon Godlewski's above-quoted QAnon broadcasts, rather than an actionable false statement of fact. Therefore, Kelly and The Scranton Times are entitled to summary judgment due to the absence of sufficient evidence in the record that Kelly or The Scranton Times made a false statement of fact regarding Godlewski in the article published on February 14, 2021.","summary":"But he loses: \"As a result of Godlewski's guilty plea to 'inappropriate text [m]essages' and 'contact' ..., as set forth in the Affidavit of Probable Cause quoting the offending text messages admitting and memorializing a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old minor, Godlewski is collaterally estopped from denying his participation in [the] sexual relationship ....\"","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2024/09/06/qanon-patriot-reporter-claims-newspaper-libeled-him-by-saying-he-had-admitted-to-sexual-relationship-with-15-year-old/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:04:25","author":"Emma Camp,Eugene Volokh","authors":["Emma Camp","Eugene Volokh"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":255833676,"title":"Dick Cheney Says He’s Voting For Kamala Harris: ‘Country Above Partisanship’","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former Vice President Dick Cheney said in a statement he will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in this year’s presidential election, with the lifelong Republican pledging his support for Harris just two days after his daughter, former Rep.

Now, it’s got a new angle: paying Americans to do the work. This week’s indictment of two Russian state media employees on charges that they paid a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content has renewed concerns about foreign meddling in the November election and revealed the Kremlin’s latest tactic in a growing information war. If the allegations prove correct, they represent a significant escalation, analysts say, and likely capture only a small piece of a larger Russian effort to sway the election. “We have seen the smoke for years. Now, here’s the fire,” said Jim Ludes, a former national defense analyst who now leads the Pell Center for International Relations at Salve Regina University. “I don’t wonder if they’re doing more of this. I have no doubt.” According to prosecutors, the two employees of RT, a Russian outlet formerly known as Russia Today, funneled $10 million to the U.S. media company, which then paid several popular right-wing influencers for their content — in one case $400,000 a month. Two of those influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. Intelligence officials and private analysts say Russia’s disinformation campaigns are designed to cut off American assistance to Ukraine, clearing the way for a rapid Russian victory after more than two years of bitter conflict. In the presidential race, Russia supports Donald Trump as the candidate perceived as the least supportive of Ukraine, intelligence officials say. Trump has openly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized NATO. On Thursday, Putin wryly claimed he was pulling for Vice President Kamala Harris. During a briefing with reporters on Friday, intelligence officials noted that Putin’s public comments often do not reflect Russia’s actual intentions. The RT campaign was part of Moscow’s efforts “to influence voter preferences in favor of the former president” and hinder Harris’ chances, said an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity under rules set by the agency. A secondary goal of Russian disinformation, officials have said, is to increase political polarization and distrust as a way of eroding American confidence in democracy. This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by adapting it to fit existing social debates within the U.S. Instead of creating new conflicts, Russia has found success by identifying and exaggerating existing divides, tailoring disinformation accordingly. When successful, Russia can get Americans to spread its talking points for free, without them even knowing their source. When an Ohio train derailment caused massive environmental damage last year, Russian voices tried to steer the debate with anti-government posts that were quickly reposted by Americans. Some U.S. websites picked up the Russian propaganda and reposted it without attribution. This year, Russian state media and networks of fake accounts began to amplify claims about immigration on platforms used by Americans. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Russian state media claimed without evidence that the virus was the product of American bioweapons experiments and that the U.S. maintained biological laboratories in Ukraine. English-language posts soon started showing up on American social media sites. Four years later, the conspiracy theory still reverberates on far-right message boards. “What if Covid was created in a Ukraine biolab, and the War has been to keep that a secret?” a poster wrote last week on the social platform X. The company hired by RT was identified as Tenet Media by two of the right-wing content creators it paid — Tim Pool and Benny Johnson. Both men said on social media Wednesday that they had no knowledge of Tenet’s relationship with RT and that if the allegations are true, they are victims. Pool posted that no one told him what to say in his podcast and condemned Russia: “Putin is a scumbag.” Pool has a long history, however, of espousing pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian views as well as conspiracy theories about Democrats and American democracy. On one podcast, he said “criminal elements” within the U.S. government were directing the war against Russia and that Ukraine was the real enemy. “Ukraine is our enemy, being funded by the Democrats,” Pool said. “Ukraine is the greatest threat to this nation and to the world. We should rescind all funding and financing, pull out all military support, and we should apologize to Russia.” Trump said on Truth Social that the case amounted to “election interference” by federal prosecutors, who he said were “resurrecting the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and trying to say that Russia is trying to help me, which is absolutely FALSE.” His comments referred to concerns about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, when groups linked to the Kremlin used social media networks and paid ads on Facebook and other platforms to support Trump. Russia also sought to help Trump in the 2020 election. China and Iran have mounted their own campaigns to use social media to shape American views. Iran covertly supported protests over the war in Gaza and was recently accused of trying to hack into the campaign systems of both Trump and Harris. Russia, however, remains the chief threat, intelligence officials say. Russian officials have repeatedly bragged about their ability to shape American views. RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, who has been sanctioned over her ties to the Russian government, detailed how Moscow tries to hide its fingerprints from U.S. intelligence. “We create many sources of information that are not tied to us,” Simonyan said recently on a Russian talk show. “While the CIA tries to figure out that they’re tied to us, they already have an enormous audience. This is how we chase each other. It’s actually fun.” AP writer Alan Suderman contributed from Richmond, Virginia.","summary":"The company hired by RT was identified as Tenet Media by two of the right-wing content creators it paid — Tim Pool and Benny Johnson.

Khelif’s image is practically everywhere, featured in advertisements at airports, on highway billboards and in boxing gyms. The 25-year-old welterweight’s success in Paris has vaulted her to national hero status, especially after Algerians rallied behind her in the face of uninformed speculation about her gender and eligibility to compete. Amateur boxer Zougar Amina, a medical student who’s been practising for a year, called Khelif an idol and role model. “Since I’ve been boxing, my personality has changed: I’m more confident, less stressed,” she said, describing the sport as “therapy to fight shyness, to learn to defend myself, to gain self-confidence”. In Ain Taya, the seaside town east of Algiers where Amina boxes, what local media have termed “Khelifmania” is on full display. Behind a door wallpapered with a large photograph of the gold medallist, punching bags hang from the ceiling of the local gym, and young girls warm up near a boxing ring surrounded by shelves of masks, gloves and mouth guards. The 23 young women and girls who train at the gym – an old converted church – all dream of becoming the next Khelif, their coach Malika Abassi said. Abassi said the women imitate Khelif’s post-win celebrations, hopping around the boxing ring and saluting fans. She’s worried that the interest in boxing will grow so rapidly that her gym won’t be able to handle it. “We’re getting calls from parents wanting to sign up their daughters,” she said. “I’m the only coach and our gym is small.” Algerians from all walks of life flocked to squares in the country’s major cities to watch Khelif’s matches broadcast on projectors. Khelif’s story endeared her to the majority of the conservative country’s population. Still, Amina Abassi, another amateur boxer at the same gym unrelated to her coach, said she believes the deep well of support for Khelif will overwhelm any criticism. “I’m convinced that even conservative families will allow their daughters to take up boxing,” she said. A former amateur boxer and sports journalist Noureddine Bouteldja said Khelif has transcended boxing and become a “social phenomenon” throughout Algeria thanks to her personal story and the scrutiny she faced from famous people around the world who – unlike Algerians – saw her advancing in the Olympics as part of the culture war over gender and sport. Algerians rallied behind Khelif in the face of criticism from Donald Trump, Elon Musk, JK Rowling and others who falsely claimed she was transgender. They largely interpreted attacks on her as attacks on their nation itself. “It’s the victory of a woman who has shown extraordinary resilience and phenomenal strength of character in the face of the campaign to denigrate her gender,” Bouteldja said. Boxing coaches and administrators said Khelif’s rise from a poor child in rural central Algeria to worldwide fame has made her an inspirational figure. Head of the Algerian Boxing League Mourad Meziane expects a huge spike in registration among young women at the start of this school year in mid September. Algeria currently has 30 regional boxing leagues and 10,000 athletes participating nationwide, he said. “The impact is inevitable and will only be very positive for women’s boxing in Algeria,” Meziane said. Civil society figures and activists said the impact is also sure to reverberate far beyond the boxing ring. Attorney Aouicha Bakhti said Khelif’s story will have a lasting impact on Algerian culture and be a counterweight to strands of society that discourage women’s participation in sports. “This kind of epic helps society, ours in this case, which is in the process of retreating in the face of fundamentalist ideals,” said Bakhti, a prominent feminist and political activist.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/golden-inspirations/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PAGE-16-B_07092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 23:01:47","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.418},{"id":255833994,"title":"US giving $250 million in military aid to Ukraine","text":"The U.S. is keeping in place a restriction on Ukraine firing American-made long-range missiles into Russia. “This announcement demonstrates the United States’ enduring commitment to Ukraine’s self-defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,” a State Department statement said. “This assistance will be deployed as quickly as possible to bolster Ukraine’s defense of its territory and its people. As President Biden has made clear, the United States and the international coalition we have assembled will continue to stand with Ukraine.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had pressed for the long-range missile restriction to be lifted in a meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday. “We need to have this long-range capability, not only on the divided territory of Ukraine but also on the Russian territory so that Russia is motivated to seek peace,” Zelensky said in the meeting. “We need to make Russian cities and even Russian soldiers think about what they need: peace or Putin.” Specifically, the aid will include air-defense missiles, rockets and artillery, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons, all coming from Pentagon stockpiles and paid for by the $60 billion supplemental funding bill Congress passed in April.

Allies worry about Trump family’s ventures into digital currency","text":"Months after Donald Trump and his eldest sons were found liable for civil fraud associated with a family business, the Trumps have sparked new concerns with a growing family venture — cryptocurrency. The Republican presidential candidate has embraced a newfound love for cryptocurrency — he owns more than $1 million in digital currency — and sons, Don Jr and Eric, are considering forming a crypto startup called World Liberty Financial. But that plan has concerned Trump’s allies in the crypto sphere. The X accounts of Trump’s youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, and Lara Trump, Eric’s wife who co-chairs the Republican National Committee, were hacked earlier this week, with posts directing users to fake links for the project, according to World Liberty Financial. World Liberty Financial then warned X users to avoid clicking on links shared from those profiles. The two women are not involved in the crypto project. Not long after the incident, Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and general partner at cryptoasset firm Castle Island Ventures, advised the startup to stop in its tracks. “Is there something that we, as crypto twitter, can collectively do to stop the launch of world liberty coin? I think it genuinely damages trump’s electoral prospects, especially if it gets hacked…it’s also an obvious target for the SEC,” Carter wrote on X. “At best it’s an unnecessary distraction, at worst it’s a huge embarrassment and source of (additional) legal trouble.” Carter then bluntly told Politico that the startup was a “huge mistake”. “It looks like Trump’s inner circle is just cashing in on his recent embrace of crypto in a kind of naive way, and frankly it looks like they’re burning a lot of the good will that’s been built with the industry so far,” he said. The hacks took place days after the Trump family started promoting the new project. The former president posted a video to his X account, stating his ambition for the US to become “the crypto capital of the planet.” Despite joining X just two months ago, World Liberty Financial has more than 50,000 followers so far. But some experts warned that such significant promotion pre-launch could cause issues down the line. Austin Campbell, blockchain expert and adjunct professor at NYU Stern School of Business, also shared concerns about World Liberty Financial’s rollout. “It’s a very typical playbook of smaller operators or more amateur operations in the crypto space to try to generate a lot of hype before revealing the details,” he told Politico. “That makes them susceptible to all sorts of nonsense.” Another source in the cryptocurrency insider, who remained anonymous, told Politico about having “a laundry list of concerns” about how the project could imperil the industry’s reputation. Trump has made a U-turn on cryptocurrency in recent years. After leaving the White House in 2021, Trump called Bitcoin a “scam.” He explained: “I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar... I want the dollar to be the currency of the world.” But in recent months, the former president has become a staunch supporter. In May, his campaign announced it would accept cryptocurrency contributions as part of a wider effort to build a so-called “crypto army” before the November election. Although the official plans about the startup haven’t been announced, CoinDesk obtained portions of a white paper for the project. The document called World Liberty Financial “a borrowing and lending service strikingly similar to Dough Finance”, a blockchain app that was hacked for $2m in July. Four people who built Dough Finance are named as World Liberty Financial team members, and all of Trump’s sons — even NYU college freshman Barron, who the white paper calls “DeFi visionary”, CoinDesk reported. The startup will also offer non-transferable governance token. Although World touted itself as a “decentralized” platform, the white paper revealed that 70 percent of its tokens will be “held by the founders, team, and service providers.” Despite the recent hacks, a World Liberty Financial spokesperson told Politico: “We take security very seriously and put it first and foremost, above anything.”","summary":"The X accounts of Lara Trump and Tiffany Trump were hacked earlier this week","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial-b2608580.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/06/22/SEI220426882.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:57:32","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":255833076,"title":"Donald Trump Praises Two Words in Judge Merchan's Decision","text":"Donald Trump said he appreciates two words included in Judge Juan Merchan's decision on Friday to postpone the former president's sentencing for his hush money conviction until after the 2024 election.Merchan said in the four-page decision that the sentencing, which was scheduled to take place later this month, will be postponed until November 26—three weeks after voters cast their ballots for the next president of the United States.The judge, who Trump has accused of being impartial to prosecutors, wrote that the former president's guilty verdict in Manhattan this past spring \"is one that stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation's history,\" and added that he delayed Trump's sentencing \"to avoid any appearance—however unwarranted—that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election.\"Friday's decision also set a date for November 12 for the judge to rule on how the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling this summer impacts Trump's conviction. The former president's team has motioned to dismiss the guilty verdict entirely after justices found that presidents are immune from facing criminal charges for actions they took within their official duties.Merchan wrote on Friday that if Trump's motion to dismiss is denied on November 12, \"the law requires the imposition of sentencing following a guilty verdict without unreasonable delay.\"\"The public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion,\" the judge continued, highlighting the rising distrust in America's court systems in recent years.In the same vein, Merchan added that \"if one is necessary, the Defendant has the right to a sentencing hearing that respects and protects his constitutional rights.\"Trump reacted to Merchan's decision in a post to his Truth Social account Friday afternoon, writing, \"The Manhattan D.A. Witch Hunt has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was NO CASE, I DID NOTHING WRONG!\" The former pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts against him in the case and has repeatedly accused Manhattan prosecutors of attempting to interfere with his reelection campaign.\"It is a political attack against me by Comrade Kamala Harris and other Radical Left Opponents for purposes of Election Interference, and is a case that should have never been brought,\" Trump wrote in his post. \"Nothing like this has ever happened in the United States of America – IT IS STRICTLY THIRD WORLD, BANANA REPUBLIC 'STUFF.'\"The former president noted, however, that he \"greatly\" appreciated the words \"if necessary\" being used by Merchan in the decision when discussing the sentencing date.\"I greatly appreciate the words 'if necessary' being utilized in the Decision, because there should be no 'if necessary,'\" Trump wrote to Truth Social. \"This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country.\"Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in May in connection to a $130,000 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign.

He also opined on the nature of September, saying it is usually a rough time for the market. \"This is just a rather unforgiving moment until stocks go low enough to attract real buyers, not traders, and we get close to the end of September,\" he said. \"Until then, you can try your hand at being nimble on any rip up and do some selling. Or you raise a little cash, stand pat and then wait for lower prices to do some buying.\" Cramer said he is optimistic about the Monday release of the new iPhone 16. Oracle will report after the market close that day, and Cramer said the company has done well to incorporate artificial intelligence into its products. He said positive earnings from Oracle and the new Apple product together could \"staunch the tech blood flow,\" but noted that the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Alphabet also begins that day. GameStop will report on Tuesday, and Cramer said there is usually hype in the runup to its earnings but the company needs to show a long-lasting business plan or the quarter will \"land with a thud.\" He also noted that Vice President Kamala Harris will debate former President Donald Trump on Tuesday night. Cramer said he is not sure how much of a role the economy will play in the debate, but doubts that anything specifically market moving will come out of the event. On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release August's consumer price index, an important inflation metric. According to Cramer, as long as inflation stays consistent or decreases, the Federal Reserve has \"plenty of leeway\" to cut rates and prevent the recession that many investors fear. Thursday brings earnings from Signet Jewelers, Kroger and Adobe. Cramer said the diamond retailer was posting solid quarters until the last one, suggesting that the stock is relatively inexpensive but \"not for the squeamish.\" Kroger will likely continue to discuss its ongoing effort to merge with Albertsons, which has been hampered by the Federal Trade Commission, he said. Even though investors have soured on tech as of late, Cramer pointed out that analysts seem to be bullish about Adobe.","summary":"CNBC's Jim Cramer said he is optimistic about the Monday release of the new iPhone 16.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/cramers-week-ahead-apples-iphone-16-cpi-and-oracle-earnings.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103263583-IMG_9972rr.jpg?v=1509385091","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:51:36","author":"Julie Coleman","authors":["Julie Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":255832624,"title":"Harris raised $361 million in August from nearly 3 million donors, campaign says","text":"WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris raised well more than double what former President Donald Trump took in from donors in August, her campaign announced Friday, saying it raised $361 million from nearly 3 million donors in her first full month as a candidate.

(AP) — Donald Trump accepted a key endorsement from one of the nation’s most influential law enforcement lobbies on Friday by offering a sweeping indictment of the U.S. legal system that has convicted him of almost three dozen felony counts and indicted him in three other pending cases. The Fraternal Order of Police convention in the battleground state of North Carolina was billed as a way for Trump to pitch himself as a law-and-order figure and cast his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, as weak. But in between remarks about crime and law enforcement, the former president and Republican nominee celebrated a New York judge’s decision earlier in the day to postpone his sentencing on 34 felony counts in a business fraud case until after Election Day. He repeated his false assertions that the U.S. election system is rife with massive voter fraud and that his 2020 defeat was rigged — arguments rejected in dozens of state and federal courts. He promised to crack down on “Marxist prosecutors,” and he seemed to suggest that domestic police forces could more actively prevent voter fraud because people are scared of them. Trump’s latest broadsides and untruths also underscored the unusual circumstances of a national law enforcement group embracing a political leader who has repeatedly denigrated U.S. institutions and championed a mob of his supporters who assaulted law enforcement officers at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — a siege at the core of Trump’s continuing legal peril as he attempts a comeback bid. But on Friday, top of mind was the New York case, which he mentioned early on in his remarks. “Big news today is the Manhattan D.A. witch hunt against me has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case — because I did nothing wrong,” Trump said. Patrick Yoes, the FOP’s national president, said Trump had tamped down the “defund the police” movement and supported law enforcement in the summer of 2020 during nationwide protests against police brutality after the murder of George Floyd. “During his time in the White House, we had a partner and a leader,” Yoes said. “We have your back.” Despite Trump’s status as the only U.S. president in history to be charged or convicted with a felony, the former president used the room of law enforcement officers as a backdrop to attack Harris over crime. “American cities, suburbs and towns are totally under siege. Kamala Harris and the communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon their land,” Trump said, adding that police are “not allowed to do your jobs.” Trump pledged unyielding support for police, including expanded use of force: “We have to get back to power and respect.” And he seemingly encouraged police to use their power in the upcoming election to “watch for voter fraud,” which is rare in the United States despite his insistence to the contrary. “I hope you as the greatest people … watch for voter fraud,” he said. “I hope you can watch and you’re all over the place. Watch for the voter fraud. Because we win. Without voter fraud, we win so easily. Hopefully, we’re going to win anyway. But we want to keep it down. You can keep it down just by watching. Because believe it or not, they’re afraid of that badge. They’re afraid of you people.” For her part, Harris has showcased her status as a one-time top prosecutor in her home state, regularly saying “I know Donald Trump’s type” after she talks about the “perpetrators of all kinds” in her former roles. She’s had some help with that messaging from two officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and have become surrogates for the Democratic ticket. “Donald Trump is still that threat,” former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told a group of voters in Arizona this summer. “His deranged, self-centered, obsessive quest for power is the reason violent insurrectionists assaulted my coworkers and I.” Ahead of Trump’s North Carolina trip, the Harris campaign organized a press call with current and former law enforcement officials, including Dunn, who said Trump only supports police when they’re loyal to him. “He put my life and the lives of my fellow Capitol Police officers in danger,” he said. The Harris campaign also issued a letter signed by more than 100 law enforcement officials across the country, lauding Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as “the only candidates we trust to keep our communities safe” and arguing that Trump “will sow chaos, defund critical law enforcement agencies, and put all Americans at risk.” The FOP joins other police groups that have already lined up behind Trump, including the National Association of Police Organizations and International Union of Police Associations. Trump’s support from law officers also butts up against sympathies he has shown for those who have defied the orders of police, including his pledge to pardon those charged with beating officers during the Capitol siege. Judges and juries considering those cases have heard police officers describe being savagely attacked while defending the building. All told, about 140 officers were injured that day, making it “likely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement” in American history, Matthew Graves, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, has said. Over 900 people have pleaded guilty to Jan. 6 crimes, and approximately 200 others have been convicted at trial. More than 950 people have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds getting time behind bars — terms ranging from a few days to 22 years. Trump has long expressed support for Jan. 6 defendants. “Those J6 warriors, they were warriors, but … they’re victims of what happened,” Trump said at a rally in Nevada this summer. He falsely claimed that police welcomed rioters into the Capitol by saying, “Go in, go in, go in, go in.” Trump’s misrepresentation of what happened did not concern his ardent supporters gathered in Charlotte. “I wish they could let them all out of jail,” said Janice Moody, a retired fingerprint technician with the Las Vegas Police Department and spouse of a retired Las Vegas officer. “I don’t think they did it on purpose,” she added.

What I can tell you now is that the gangs are not in control of either complex,\" the Aurora mayor said.Coffman, who served as a representative in the U.S. Congress for ten years, initially believed that the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua was in control and taking rent from residents.Instead, the property managers had vanished and tenants simply were not paying anybody, Coffman explained.The two complexes on Dallas Street and Helena Street are both facing maintenance issues and a lack of management, but the mayor said this has been the case for some time.Property managers have been offered two full-time police officers for the next two weeks, should they return and regain control of the properties.A complex situation centered on an apartment complexAurora is a small town close to Denver, a sanctuary city that has welcomed migrants who have crossed the southwest border into the United States. Coffman said several new arrivals had been \"crammed\" into apartment buildings in his town, which then caused problems.The mayor said the town had a long-standing Venezuelan population, many who have been there for years, but that unrest in the South American country had pushed more migrants toward the U.S.—both those with criminal histories and their victims.\"There is inadequate vetting of people at the border,\" Coffman said.\"So, it's my understanding that when you do have a concentration of Venezuelan migrants sometimes, sadly, that criminal element follows and exploits them within their own immigrant communities.\"Coffman said that this, and corruption within Venezuela, had made it difficult for his police department to secure cooperation with authorities there to secure criminal histories of suspected members of the gang.The Aurora Police Department has issued multiple updates in the past week, saying that it arrested six suspected Tren de Aragua members and increased its presence around the apartment complexes.GOP outsiders tied issue to electionOn Thursday, Republicans, including Colorado Representatives Lauren Boebert and Greg Lopez and Texas Representative Chip Roy, held a press conference nearby and blamed the Biden administration for the situation in Aurora.Lopez called the migrants \"wild dogs\" and said it was time to shut the borders down.\"Look at what they do. They go around, they create havoc, and if we allow them to take over a certain area, they're going to breed, and they're going to spread,\" he said.Boebert, who said she was raised in Aurora, said there was clear evidence that gang violence was rampant in the town and was not \"a feature of your imagination.\"Coffman took issue with the group holding the event because they were not all representatives of Aurora.\"They came in from the outside, and their goal as Republicans—I'm a Republican, and I get it—their goal is to tie it into the presidential election,\" Coffman said.Mayor of Aurora says both parties to blameCoffman did voice frustration with the current immigration system, saying those housed in complexes like those in his town were unable to work for months after arriving, leaving them open to exploitation by gangs.He said that he felt that current immigration policy needed to change due to \"such negligence\" at the federal level.\"Both sides have their fingerprints on this problem,\" Coffman added, saying that former President Barack Obama did not do enough to get a bipartisan solution and neither did former President Donald Trump.The mayor said that the only real immigration policy changes had come through executive action, but this was not sustainable.\"I just hope that Congress comes together and fixes this broken system,\" he told Newsweek. \"It's way too easy to come into this country illegally, and it's so hard to come in legally.\"I just think that the situation we are facing right now is the product of a broken immigration system.\"Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) announced earlier in the day that it was choosing Trump as its favored candidate in the 2024 contest, support the 78-year-old said he was “deeply honored” to accept as he stood alongside union president Patrick Yoes at a gathering in Charlotte. “We know all about you and the great job that you do and the people of this country respect you greatly for it,” Trump said. “So I just want to thank you on behalf of everybody because I see it.” “Unfortunately, we were talking a little while ago,” he added, “it’s probably also a profession that’s under more danger and threat than ever before, which we hate to see.” As of July 31, the FOP reported, 223 officers have been shot in the line of duty, a slight dip of 2% from the same point in 2023, and 31 officers have been killed by gunfire. A record-high 378 men and women in blue were shot in 2023, and 46 were killed. “I visit a lot of families of police officers who are no longer with us, and we have to get back the power and respect that they deserve more than anybody,” Trump recounted. “And we’re gonna do that.” The former president also claimed to have been endorsed by “New York’s finest,” despite no public announcement to that effect by any NYPD union. “They’re not supposed to. They said we don’t care — we’re endorsing you anyway,” he bragged. Trump contrasted his plans to “launch a war on crime in America” — including promises to protect qualified immunity to protect officers from lawsuits, a pledge to back the death penalty for cop killers and a wide-scale crackdown on drug gangs and their leaders — with what he called “Kamala’s crime wave.” “As we gather today, American cities, suburbs and towns are totally under siege,” Trump told FOP members. “Kamala Harris and the communist left have unleashed a brutal plague of bloodshed, crime, chaos, misery and death upon our land.” “Other than that,” he joked, “they’re doing actually quite well.” Trump went on to recount cases of cops being shot on the job just the night before in Milwaukee, before describing the “filth,” “graffiti” and rampant retail theft that the “law-abiding citizen is forced to live” with. “The new thing in New York, you go to a pharmacy to buy aspirin, to buy a toothbrush and it takes you 45 minutes to get a clerk to open up the glass because people are walking in and just taking it as much as they want,” he recounted, before pivoting to attack Harris for her record as a San Francisco district attorney who lightened penalties for thieves. “She destroyed San Francisco,” he said, referring to Harris in front of the officers as “our opponent.” “But she came up with a great idea. You can steal as much as you want up to $950 and nothing happens to you after that,” he went on. “So guys are walking in with calculators,” Trump joked again. In a swipe at House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), he also pointed out the “big wall wrapped around her house … didn’t help with the problems that she had,” apparently referencing her husband Paul Pelosi being bludgeoned by a madman at their San Francisco residence in fall 2022. On a press call earlier Friday, Michigan Police Officers Association President James Tignanelli noted that his state’s attorney general, a Democrat who has endorsed Harris, had indicted “between 10 and 15 police officers” while in office. “That doesn’t help attract your candidates,” Tignanelli told reporters. Dr. John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, also shared startling statistics about the rise in unreported violent crimes during President Biden and Harris’ tenure. “If you look at total violent crime during the Trump administration, it fell by 17% and it’s increased by 43% under the Biden administration,” Lott said, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. “There’s no time in our history where we’ve had recorded data for total violent crime that we’ve seen such a large increase,” he added, pointing to the last report on criminal victimization released by the DOJ bureau in 2022. Before 2020, Lott explained, both the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the FBI “generally moved along together” in the numbers that were reported, but have since “moved in opposite directions each year, often by very large amounts.” “While the FBI showed a 2% drop in reported violent crime, the national crime victimization data showed a 42% increase in violent crime,” he said citing 2022 figures. Trump was nevertheless in a celebratory mood Friday after Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan pushed the sentencing date for his “hush money” conviction until Nov. 26, meaning he won’t face potential imprisonment before Election Day. The case “has been postponed because everyone realizes that there was no case because I did nothing wrong,” he crowed. “It’s an attack by my political opponents in Washington, DC and Comrade Kamala Harris and radical left opponents for purposes of election interference.” “We will restore public safety to our streets. We will bring back law and order to our nation,” he vowed to the FOP attendees. “You’re gonna have the backup like you never had it before when you had it four years ago.”","summary":"The former president also claimed to have been endorsed by \"New York's finest,\" despite no public announcement to that effect by any NYPD union.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/trump-says-cops-in-more-danger-than-ever-from-kamalas-crime-wave-as-he-touts-union-endorsement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89095533.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hHrB5Na9-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:40:31","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":255832952,"title":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican, will vote for Kamala Harris for president, he announced Friday.

Like his daughter, Dick Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, notably during Liz Cheney’s ill-fated reelection campaign in 2022.

That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Asked for comment, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “Who is Liz Cheney?” The campaign confirmed Cheung was being sarcastic by also pointing to a comment Liz Cheney posted online four years ago in which she called Harris a “radical liberal.” Dick Cheney, 83, has made few if any public appearances over the past year or more. He has dealt with heart issues since his 40s and underwent a heart transplant in 2012. Dick Cheney’s statement Friday was similar to a 2022 campaign ad for Liz Cheney as she sought a fourth term as Wyoming’s lone congressperson. In it, he called Trump a “coward” for trying to “steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” The ad did little good for his daughter in a deep-red state that once held the Cheney family dear but is now thoroughly in Trump’s corner.

Just remember that. If they win, Israel is gone,” Trump told the crowd via live video feed on Thursday. “You can forget about Israel, that’s what’s going to happen. So they have to get out on Nov. 5 and they have to vote for Trump. If they don’t, I think it’s going to be a very terrible situation.” He also claimed Jews who vote for Democrats need to have their “head examined” and wondered: “How do they exist?” He also claimed if Harris becomes president, “you’re not going to have an Israel...Israel will no longer exist.” During the speech, the former president appeared to initially misstate the last name of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israel-American hostage killed by Hamas, as “Goldman.” Goldberg-Polin was one of six hostages found dead in Gaza last week, which prompted widespread protests across Israel as residents demand faster progress on returning the remaining Hamas captives, and ending the war nearly a year after the militant group’s initial October 7 invasion. The Republican presidential candidate’s remarks to the group in Vegas were met with a mix of praise and criticism. A longtime member of the RJC told The Dispatch that the room largely viewed Trump as the superior candidate to Harris. “People may have lingering concerns or they wish maybe their preferred primary candidate would have prevailed,” the member said. “But everybody here I think is—not everybody, but the vast majority of people are—practical, living in the real world, and they understand that it’s a binary choice and most people think that’s a very easy choice.” Caroline Glick, an Israel-based policy expert and political commentator, said on X after the speech Trump was “on fire” at the RJC event. Others argued that Trump’s remarks, which echo claims he has made on the campaign trail, were both inaccurate and antisemitic. The Harris campaign says it will strongly support Israel if the Vice President wins the White House in November, while also pushing for a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of hostages. The Democrat’s campaign accused Trump of being an insincere ally to Jewish people. “Donald Trump openly demeans Jewish Americans, proudly dined with a neo-Nazi, and reportedly thinks Adolf Hitler ‘did some good things,’” Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein said in a statement to Politico. “He has said the only people he wants counting his money are ‘short guys wearing yarmulkes,’ and praised neo-Nazis who chanted ‘Jews will not replace us’ as ‘very fine people.’” Others echoed that criticism. “For centuries antisemites have depicted Jews as existential threats lurking inside the countries they inhabit,” Rob Eshman wrote in the Forward, a Jewish news publication. “Trump makes the same charges, not against all Jews, just against the ones who refuse to vote for him — which is most Jews.” He added: “There’s a word for hatred directed at Jews you disagree with. The word is: antisemitism.” Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, had a similar view, tellingThe Washington Post, “This is antisemitism, plain and simple, and if any other elected official or candidate said these things even once — let alone on a nearly daily basis — they would be condemned as antisemitic.” In office, Trump’s actions on Israel won praise from the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, but did not earn him the support of most U.S. Jews, nearly three-quarters of whom identify as Democrats. Many young Jewish people have also been at the forefront of pro-Palestinian activism across the U.S. since October 7, and are unlikely to side with Trump on Israel issues. During the Trump administration, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli capital; formally recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights; and pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration also helped usher in the Abraham Accords, through which the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain became the first Gulf states to formally normalize relations with Israel.","summary":"Trump claimed Jews who vote for Democrats need to have their ‘head examined’ and wondered: ‘How do they exist?’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-israel-jewish-republicans-harris-b2608537.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/06/20/AP24249705873122.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YAvzsJTJ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:22:02","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":255831542,"title":"New York Fashion Week Opens With Call To Vote From Jill Biden","text":"US First Lady Jill Biden called for the protection of \"freedoms\" Friday during a \"get out the vote\" demonstration that opened New York Fashion Week with a decisively political tone two months ahead of the US presidential election.Biden was joined by a number of high-profile US fashion designers, including Thom Browne, Michael Kors and Tory Burch, in front of a crowd of roughly one thousand fashion industry insiders.The \"Fashion for our Future\" march was organized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for the first day of the weeklong fashion event showcasing looks for the upcoming Spring/Summer 2025 season.Held in front of the windows of the Macy's flagship department store in the heart of Manhattan, the march was intended to be nonpartisan.However, the surprise presence of the Democratic first lady -- whose appearance had not been announced -- sent a clear message.\"I know that you care about the freedom to make your own choices, be who you are, love who you love... your freedom of creative expression,\" Biden said to applause from the crowd.\"These freedoms are at risk because of court decisions, book bans, shrugs of apathy when people forget the power of the vote,\" she said.The US presidential election, set for November 5, pits Democrat Kamala Harris against Republican nominee Donald Trump.Jill Biden's husband, US President Joe Biden, had been set to be the Democratic nominee until he dropped out of the race on July 21 and threw his support behind his vice president.\"So let's remember this: the next president, your next president, will likely appoint new Supreme Court justices,\" the first lady said. \"Your next senators will confirm them and our children and our grandchildren will have to live with those consequences.\"Prior to the march, Jill Biden attended the Ralph Lauren fashion show on Thursday evening and paid tribute to Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine and high priestess of the US fashion industry.Wintour featured Jill Biden on the cover of the magazine's August issue and has organized several fundraisers for the Democratic Party.While marketing themselves on open-mindedness, major brands typically stay away from political squabbles in the United States, out of fear of being targeted by one camp or the other.One counterexample was in February 2017, shortly after former US president Donald Trump was elected.

Disney continues to evolve the Aspire program to meet the needs of its business and cast members, according to a Disney spokesperson.

Disneyland employees currently enrolled in masters and trades programs can continue with their studies — but new students won’t be able to enroll in the programs. The IRS lets employers deduct $5,250 annually per employee as a business expense for educational assistance programs without owing any federal payroll taxes. Any employee assistance above that is taxable as wages. ALSO SEE: Will Disneyland replace Winnie the Pooh ride in Bayou Country? The funding cuts mean employees will need to manage their course loads to match the funding caps, cut back on the number of classes per semester or pay for uncovered tuition.

Disneyland has used the promise of fully paid associate, bachelor’s and master’s degrees as a hiring incentive for new cast members, Disney parlance for employees.

In the “world according to Mark Zuckerberg,” if you are an anti-Trumper or pro-Palestinian, you’ve got a friend in Facebook (“One-way free speech,” Sept. 6). First, Meta CEO Zuckerberg admitted to Facebook censorship — which likely influenced the 2020 election against former President Donald Trump. Now, his arbiters of free speech have determined that the slogan “from the river to the sea” isn’t hate speech, because it does not specifically mention violence against Jews. Unless these “brain trusts” at Facebook think that the Israelis will voluntarily cede their homeland to Hamas, the only way “from the river to the sea” becomes a reality is to promote and commit violence against Israelis. Jack Kaufman Naples, Fla. I’m quitting Facebook and Instagram. Any entity that allows calls for the destruction of Israel and the annihilation of Jews should not exist. And I don’t want to hear Zuckerberg making a hollow apology about hate speech, as he did with censorship just a few weeks ago. JJ Levine Miami Beach, Fla. Meta’s oversight board should call it like it is. The vile phrase “from the river to the sea” is simply hate speech. Thomas Birnbaum Manhattan It is inconceivable that Meta has an actual oversight board. That they have concluded that this phrase is not antisemitic, when it does in fact call for the destruction of Israel, defies rational explanation — other than that the board sympathizes with the aims of Hamas. I frankly cannot understand how Zuckerberg, a brilliant businessman, could have intentionally appointed this group of buffoons. Mitchell Schwefel Barnegat, NJ The Palestinian Liberation Organization first used the phrase to mean the elimination of Israel, to be replaced with a secular state. I bet most people chanting “from the river to the sea” have no knowledge of its origin. To them, it likely means eliminate Jews. Although ambiguous to Facebook, it is indeed an expression of hate.

Hochul, meanwhile, should send the Chinese government a message that the espionage was a waste of time. She should visit Taiwan and support freedom and democracy in the region.

The Hollywood couple spent months trailed by feverish speculation that their marriage was on the verge of collapse, culminating in Jennifer finally filing for divorce on their second wedding anniversary, August 20. The Argo director, 52, has been repeatedly spotted in public since the news broke, often with a radiant smile on his face. His latest sighting Friday was no exception, as he was seen sharing a laugh with another gentleman as they strode through a parking lot. Ben was dressed in snappy business attire, including a well-fitted navy suit and a lighter blue dress shirt, worn without a tie in a nod to California chic.

She wowed in the risque number as she promoted the film Ben produced and she stars in - while Ben remained in LA. George Lopez claimed Ben looked 'miserable' during his marriage and slammed Jennifer for posting risque snaps in the wake of her divorce. In the days after she filed to dissolve her marriage, Jennifer posted a sizzling Instagram snap in a high-cut swimsuit that hinted at her derriere. Comedian Lopez, 63, said in Thursday’s episode of iHeartRadio’s Politickin' podcast: 'You look at Ben Affleck — you never seen one dude more miserable and being married. 'And Jennifer Lopez posting a tweet … a selfie with her a**, it’s almost like, next!' He added that he believes Jennifer 'can't survive' the backlash she received over the selfie while still married to the actor. He said: 'The minute their divorce isn’t even final, they’re already taking pictures of their a**. Like, next!' He also likened Ben and Jen's marriage to Amazon mogul Jeff Bezos' romance with fiancee Lauren Sanchez - saying they are both 'Latinas who have been married twice.' He said: 'You can find anything on Amazon. You could probably find a Latina with no kids, you know?

The last thing any smart Latina wants to be is a stepfather.' Jennifer flashed her toned backside in a sexy mirror selfie last week, slipping into stunning white strappy swimwear. JLo appeared to take a sly dig at Ben within her slew of summer pictures she shared with fans - over a week after she filed for divorce from him. Within her album of snaps, JLo modelled a string of stylish outfits perfectly fitted to emphasise her knockout physique. JLo was surrounded by loved ones in the pictures, including her 16-year-old twins Max and Emme and her younger sister Lynda, 53. But it was the memes sprinkled throughout the album that appeared to deliver a blow at Ben - combined with a mischievous message in her caption. 'Everything is unfolding in divine order,' read one meme, while another showed the words: 'she's in bloom and unbothered out of reach and at peace' on a t-shirt. JLo, who listed her date of separation from Ben at the end of spring on April 26, also suggestively captioned the album: 'Oh, it was a summer.' Amid the news of his divorce Ben has reportedly been spotted hanging out with RFK Jr.'s daughter Kick in recent weeks. He previously enjoyed a brief fling with Kick, before he rekindled his relationship with now-estranged wife Lopez, sources have revealed. Insiders have revealed to DailyMail.com that Kick and Ben are 'enjoying spending time' together but the writer is remaining 'tight-lipped' about their connection because she doesn't want to be seen as a 'mistress'. 'Ben and Kick had a fling before he got back together with JLo,' the source began. 'They met because Ben is from Boston and when you live in Boston, the Kennedy family is royalty.' Meanwhile Lopez is 'doing as well as she can' even though she 'didn't want a divorce' from the actor, a source told People on Monday. 'It's been incredibly difficult for her that Ben chose to pull away from their marriage and move on with his life, leaving her behind,' the insider shared. 'She didn't want a divorce. She wanted to figure things out. They love each other. Jennifer is not the type to just give up. It's been almost torture for her to wait around.' Jennifer and Ben were married in an intimate ceremony on July 16, 2022, but they later tied the knot a second time for family and friend at Ben's estate in South Carolina on August 20, 2022 — two years to the day before she filed for divorce 'After filing for divorce, she seems relieved,' the source shared. 'Her family and friends agree that it was the right decision. She's surrounded by a lot of love and support. She'll be fine. She's strong and always comes out on top.' Notably, Jennifer filed the divorce paperwork herself, and she did not have an attorney listed as representing her, though she may have an attorney listed in the future. She cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the divorce filing. Although she was the one to file, and Ben appears to have opted not to do so, Us Weekly reported on Friday that he was allegedly well aware of her plans. According to an insider, the estranged couple had 'already agreed to these terms before she filed.' They said the two had 'had gone through all the details' of the filing in advance, describe it as a 'planned' event, rather than a filing designed to take Ben by surprise. 'JLo finally pulled the trigger because that was their agreement that she would file, and she was the one who ultimately made the decision,' the source added. The reporting is largely in line with the couple's decision to fake a healthy marriage for months with occasional public outings together, despite having already split behind the scenes. The source noted that both parties 'came in with significant assets of their own,' so they allegedly don't plan to fight over their wealth, leaving their massive Beverly Hills mansion as their only significant shared property that needs to be sold off. Ben and Jennifer first got engaged at the end of 2002 but broke it off a year later before calling quits on their relationship for good in 2004 Accordingly, Jennifer requested no spousal support from her ex, and she asked the court to deny it for Ben. She listed the date of their separation as April 26. Jennifer and Ben were married in an intimate ceremony on July 16, 2022, but they later tied the knot a second time for family and friend at Ben's estate in South Carolina on August 20, 2022 — two years to the day before she filed for divorce.

In a decision Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan delayed Trump’s sentencing until Nov. 26, three weeks after the final votes are cast in the U.S. presidential election. The sentencing had been scheduled for Sept. 18, about seven weeks before Election Day. The delay is the latest bit of good fortune for Trump in an election season that has been laden with legal perils for him. The new date means voters will choose their next president without knowing whether the Republican nominee is going to jail, nor whether he will even be sentenced at all. Merchan now plans to rule Nov. 12 on Trump’s request to overturn the verdict and toss out the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity ruling. Merchan explained that he was postponing the sentencing “to avoid any appearance – however unwarranted – that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.” “The Court is a fair, impartial and apolitical institution,” he added, writing that his decision “should dispel any suggestion” otherwise. Trump – fresh from watching appellate arguments in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him in a nearby federal court – heralded the hush money sentencing delay. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he called the case a “witch hunt” and a “political attack” and reiterated that he’d done nothing wrong. “This case should be rightfully terminated, as we prepare for the Most Important Election in the History of our Country,” he wrote. Prosecutors said they stood ready for sentencing on the new date. “A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,” said Danielle Filson, a spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He is a Democrat. Trump’s lawyers pushed for the delay on multiple fronts, petitioning the judge and asking a federal court to intervene. They argued that punishing the former president in the thick of his campaign to retake the White House would amount to election interference. Prosecutors didn’t take a position on Trump’s delay request, deferring to Merchan. A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Trump’s request to have the U.S. District Court in Manhattan seize the case from Merchan’s state court. Trump is appealing the federal court decision and has asked appeals judges to halt postconviction proceedings. Trump entered this election year facing the possibility of multiple criminal trials after he was indicted four times since March 2023. But a string of decisions in the last two months, culminating with Friday’s sentencing delay, has largely cleared his legal calendar. The hush money case is the only one to have gone to trial. In July, a judge dismissed a federal case in Florida charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents. The Supreme Court’s immunity decision has ensured significant delays in a separate federal case in Washington, D.C., in which Trump is accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. A Georgia election case also remains idled. The immunity ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were illegal. Election Day is Nov. 5, but many states allow voters to cast ballots early, with some set to start the process just a few days before or after Sept. 18. Trump is the first ex-president convicted of a crime. A jury in May found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels claims she and Trump had a sexual encounter a decade earlier after they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Prosecutors cast the payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep voters from hearing salacious stories about him during his first presidential campaign. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels and was later reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as legal expenses. Trump maintains that the stories were false and that the reimbursements were for legal work and logged correctly. He has pledged to appeal the verdict, but that cannot happen until he is sentenced. Democrats backing their party’s presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, have made his conviction a focus of their messaging. In speeches at the party’s convention in Chicago last month, President Biden called Trump a “convicted felon” running against a former prosecutor. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, labeled Trump a “career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star to prove it.” Trump’s 2016 Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, inspired chants of “lock him up” from the convention crowd when she quipped that Trump “fell asleep at his own trial, and when he woke up, he made his own kind of history: the first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.” Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind bars. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge, which would require Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment. Trump’s case “stands alone, in a unique place in this Nation’s history,” Merchan wrote. The public’s confidence “in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion,” he wrote. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed reporting.","summary":"The delay is the latest bit of good fortune for Trump in an election season that has been laden with legal perils for him.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/06/judge-delays-donald-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-until-after-november-election/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Trump_Columnist_Lawsuit_13813_8a8d4b.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:14:41","author":"Michael R.

Event host and lawyer Jon Bunge said the money would go to creating campaign offices in swing states. Emhoff, a lawyer himself who met Harris through a client in 2013, spoke to a crowd of about 200 in the Cultural Center’s ornate Tiffany Dome Friday afternoon, taking swings at Trump and his vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. “Democracy literally is the client here — our way of life, our existence,” Emhoff said. “Treat this like the trial of your life.” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Sen. Dick Durbin opened up the event ahead of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder — who helped vet Harris’ vice presidential picks — and former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., also attended. The tab for attendees ran between $1,500 to $100,000, according to an invite obtained by the Sun-Times. Emhoff said the Trump-Vance campaign is running on “authoritarianism and misogyny,” centering his attacks on Trump’s legal issues and his role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as well as several of Vance’s remarks regarding women and child care. He also touted Liz Cheney’s recent endorsement of Harris and called Project 2025 “900 pages of things that will destroy our country.” Drafted by the Heritage Foundation thinktank, Project 2025 is a set of conservative policy proposals, some of which were crafted by former advisers to Trump during his presidency. “As my new best friend Tim Walz says, ‘Stay the hell out of there,’” Emhoff said to laughs. The fundraiser came just days ahead of Tuesday’s debate between Trump and Harris. Emhoff said Harris is preparing for the showdown with Trump while continuing to work with President Joe Biden and Durbin on a plan to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. “She’s been working on this issue even while she’s preparing for the debate,” he said. “They’re working tirelessly to bring the hostages out and get this deal done.” Emhoff also said the Harris campaign’s legal staff has been focusing on fighting disenfranchisement efforts and anticipating Republican challenges to the Nov. 5 election results. “There’s no more important fraud cases than standing up to these bogus election challenges we know are coming,” said Emhoff, who also encouraged those in the crowd to campaign in other states. Quoting Michelle Obama’s speech during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Emhoff said, “We need to vote in numbers to get rid of any doubt.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/09/06/doug-emhoff-chicago-fundraiser-kamala-harris-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/468a604/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6093x3478+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7e%2F61%2Fb5b5fb274875adc0df36e33cfcdf%2Fdnctu-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-06 22:11:04","author":"Violet Miller","authors":["Violet Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019}]}
