Ambassador Belinsky graduated from Moscow State Linguistic University and has served in several posts at Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notably in the Latin America Department.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss the conversations between the Russian Federation and the United States regarding the Special Military Operation in Ukraine and potential paths to end the conflict; we ask about Russia’s international priorities—especially the role of BRICS and expectations for the next UN Secretary‑General; and we explore areas of cooperation between Russia and Latin America in general, as well as the outlook for relations between the Russian Federation and Chile in particular.\n\nJavier Pineda: Ambassador Belinsky, thank you for speaking with El Ciudadano. One topic we wanted to address is Russia’s view of a possible peace process following the conversations in Alaska between President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, which raised expectations a few weeks ago. However, more than a month has passed and those announced talks appear stalled. What is Russia’s perspective on the progress of the special military operation and the chances of launching a peace process?\n\nVladímir Belinsky: Russia has never refused to negotiate; we have always kept the door open. In fact, we have repeatedly put forward concrete proposals to end the conflict. These range from the Minsk agreements—under which Donbas would remain within Ukraine—to the Istanbul proposals, initialed by the parties on the same principle. Later, in June 2024, President Putin presented updated proposals tailored to the realities on the ground.\n\nOur position remains unchanged: to resolve this—or any—conflict, the root causes must be addressed. That requires guaranteeing our country’s security and the rights of the Russian‑speaking population in Donbas, whose rights were violated and who, in our view, faced a Nazi‑style policy of annihilation. This began in 2014 after a bloody coup that broke Ukraine’s constitutional order.\n\nJP: Regarding the situation of Russian speakers, officials such as Minister Lavrov and President Putin have said Ukraine is one of the few countries that prohibits a language. What is the current situation of this population in Ukraine, and how could this phenomenon extend to other regions, such as Moldova?\n\nVB: It was not only a prohibition on the Russian language, but a war against everything Russian: the traditional Orthodox faith and the entire cultural heritage. Upon taking power after the coup, they launched a campaign against the east of their own country, thereby destroying territorial integrity.\n\nUnder international law, territorial integrity is respected only if the central government represents all the peoples of the nation. When that government wages war against one of its peoples—as occurred during eight years of shelling in Donbas (2014–2022) that, we estimate, caused about 14,000 civilian deaths, including hundreds of children—that representativeness is broken. President Zelensky’s policy was summed up as «suitcase, railway, Russia», a clear expression of ethnic cleansing.\n\nJP: Authorities of the Russian Federation have characterized this conflict as one against NATO and Western countries led by the United States.\n\nVB: The danger was not only the attempt to deploy NATO infrastructure on our borders, a long‑standing project to encircle and confront Russia. Much of that infrastructure has been neutralized during the Special Military Operation. At the front, we are advancing steadily, dismantling the war machine that the West has supplied—an enormous waste for them.\n\nA NATO shell costs between $5,000 and $10,000; a Russian one, $500. This U.S. administration seems to have realized that it is a dead end that brings no benefit, especially for the American people, and that it is leading to economic degradation in the West. Europe, for its part, is experiencing a significant industrial breakdown. A French political scientist, Emmanuel Todd, put it clearly: without the United States, Europe cannot sustain this effort, which goes against the interests of its own peoples.\n\nThis situation will end sooner or later. Peace will prevail, and we are preparing for that day. We keep the door open both to Western countries willing to pursue a constructive policy and to the rest of the international community.\n\nJP: In recent years, Russia has actively worked with other global actors under a multipolar vision—such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Eurasian Economic Union. What is the Russian Federation’s current perspective on this multipolar world, and where do you think action is headed toward a polycentric order?\n\nVB: We consider the multipolar world a reality, not a formation in progress. Some actors are trying to maintain their hegemony through wishful thinking that no longer works, seeking to impose themselves by force on an order that has changed.\n\nIn this new landscape, we must be prepared. As our president noted at the Valdai Forum, it will not be an easier world. We had grown accustomed to unipolarity, with a single decision‑making center. That is over. Today, each country must defend its interests in a more complex and less coordinated environment, but also one that is more democratic, stable, and fair.\n\nIt is a world in which every nation can make its voice heard and defend its interests through dialogue and classical diplomacy: present your positions, talk, and seek consensus that balances everyone’s interests. That is what we coordinate with the countries promoting this idea, who represent the majority of the world’s population. Even in the United States, this concept is being analyzed. The crucial thing is to adapt to this world, not to try to annihilate these poles of growth, as that only leads to a confrontation with no way out.\n\nJP: Ambassador, what is the Russian Federation’s view of Latin America as a region? There is physical distance, but also historical proximity—especially with the ties some Latin American countries forged with the former Soviet Union. What is the general perspective, considering as well that Venezuela’s National Assembly has just approved a strategic treaty with Russia, previously discussed by Presidents Maduro and Putin?\n\nVB: For Russia, Latin America has always been a pole of growth. We envision open cooperation with strong economic and cultural foundations, working with key countries that have a long integrationist tradition—in which Chile has played and continues to play a very important role in forums such as the Rio Group, CELAC, and as an Associated State of MERCOSUR.\n\nWe support the exchange of experiences and integration, especially in infrastructure such as energy and transport, areas where Russia has significant development and expertise to contribute.\n\nOur relations with Latin America have always been positive and without conflicts. We develop our cooperation based on the openness of each sovereign country. There are concrete projects, such as a vaccine factory in Nicaragua that produced 19 million doses of flu vaccine for Central America and the Caribbean, or a nuclear center in El Alto, Bolivia, which is already operating and producing medical inputs to fight cancer.\n\nCooperation extends to strategic spheres such as public health, education, and security, including the fight against drug trafficking—a crucial issue for us, since the volume of cocaine entering Russia today exceeds the total that reaches Europe. We are very willing to cooperate on this practical and important issue.\n\nJP: A few weeks ago, President Putin or Minister Lavrov indicated that, by a tacit rule, Latin America should hold the next UN Secretary‑Generalship. Are any names being floated, or is there an open field? What criteria would guide Russia’s position?\n\nVB: There are several names. We keep the door open to discuss each candidacy, with full respect. We are aware of President Boric’s presentation of former President Michelle Bachelet’s candidacy. I understand this is a process in development in which the Chilean side will carry out the pertinent consultations at the appropriate time.\n\nJP: Finally, Ambassador, what are the prospects for expanding cooperation between the Russian embassy and Chile? In which areas are there ties today?\n\nVB: On December 4 we will relaunch the Chamber of Commerce, Culture, and Sport, which already exists as a legal entity. The idea is to present it and invite business leaders and representatives from the cultural and sports worlds to a mini‑forum to gather ideas and contacts. The plan is to follow up by organizing bilateral business missions, because the potential of the relationship is enormous.\n\nIn 2018, bilateral trade was nearly $1 billion, with a balance very favorable to Chile. I am sure this potential can multiply in areas such as infrastructure, transport, and banking connectivity, since our economies are almost 100% complementary and tariffs are very low. What is needed is to restore existing cooperation mechanisms—such as the joint commission—to resolve obstacles.\n\nCulturally, we have enormous potential. Chilean audiences are very well educated and have a very good perception of Russian culture, and vice versa. There are many points of connection, including gastronomy, with projects such as «Pacific Cuisine». We are open to cooperation in all areas.\n\nJavier Pineda: Ambassador, thank you for the interview.\n\nVladímir Belinsky: Thank you, Javier, for the questions.

Crimea is among areas that have been hit by fuel shortages and rationing as Russia has lost refining capacity in Ukrainian attacks.\n\nRussian forces attacked Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with guided bombs on Monday, knocking out power to 30,000 customers, local officials said.

He said he also would seek further US assistance to protect Ukraine’s electricity and gas networks amid Russian bombardment. Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian delegation already in the US led by Yulia Svyrydenko, the prime minister.\n\nKallas said on Monday that the EU had started funding a special tribunal to prosecute the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and other senior Russian officials for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. “We are also calling on other member states, countries, participants to fund it so that the work can really start full-scale because without accountability there is no just and lasting peace.”\n\nRussia’s defence ministry on Monday said its forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine: one in the Donetsk region and the other near Kupiansk in the north-east, a largely destroyed city under attack for months.

Maybe you will.’\n\nBut despite the humiliation, Sir Keir later praised the US President for his work at securing a peace deal and said the UK can play a role in decommissioning Hamas’s weaponry as well as monitoring the ceasefire.\n\nSpeaking after the summit, the Prime Minister said: ‘Today is a really historic day, so we do need to start there, and real credit to President Trump and the other leaders who got us to this place.\n\n‘But you’re absolutely right. The challenge now is tomorrow and implementation. And therefore yesterday is historic, but what happens tomorrow really matters.\n\n‘And that’s why what I’ve been discussing with leaders all day is what part can we play, and we, the United Kingdom in particular can play a part in monitoring the ceasefire, but also decommissioning the capability of Hamas and their weaponry, drawing on our experience in Northern Ireland.\n\n‘So the question today has already moved to how do we implement, how do we make sure this moves forward, and it’s really important that we keep that focus. We mustn’t have any missteps now.’\n\nThe PM has been accused of piggybacking on Mr Trump’s Gaza breakthrough.\n\nHe hailed the ‘tireless diplomatic efforts’ of Mr Trump on Monday morning, crediting him with securing the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nBut Sir Keir was accused of only travelling to Egypt for a ‘photo op’ after risking derailing the process by recognising Palestine as a state last month.\n\nTories compared the PM to former Chelsea footballer John Terry, who changed into full kit to lift the Champions League trophy despite not playing in the final. \n\nThe Trump administration’s Middle East envoy earlier tried to cool tensions after the US ambassador to Israel branded a Cabinet minister ‘delusional’ for suggesting the UK played a ‘key role’.\n\nStarmer was also challenged on Tony Blair’s role on the Gaza peace board, stating it’s ‘for others to decide’ if he forms part of Gaza’s new governing.\n\nA peace plan floated by the White House last month listed Sir Tony as a member of the proposed board.\n\nStarmer today said: ‘I think the makeup of the peace board is still being discussed. For my part, I have to say, I’m much more interested in the practical steps.’\n\nPushed on the question about whether Blair should be involved, Starmer replied: ‘That’s for others to decide. Tony Blair was a great leader of our country, and would make a huge contribution.\n\n‘But I’m not focused on which particular people sit on which particular board. I’m focused on what do we need to do tomorrow, and I mean tomorrow, to make sure this is implemented.’\n\nThe PM added that there are ‘discussions going on’ about who will be on the board – but he said he has not put himself forward.\n\nSteve Witkoff praised Britain’s ‘vital role’ – singling out under-fire national security adviser Jonathan Powell for his ‘incredible input’.\n\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh summit, co-hosted by Mr Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, comes as part of efforts to secure the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has been holding since Friday.\n\nIsrael said just after 6am that Hamas had released the first seven hostages into the custody of the Red Cross.\n\nIn a statement, Sir Keir said: ‘I share the deep feeling of relief as Avinatan Or and other hostages are released today. But this is also a stark reminder of the treatment that he has been subject to at the hands of Hamas, and the atrocities that shook the world two years ago.\n\n‘Having met his family, I know that no one can truly understand the torture and agony they suffered for two drawn out years and my thoughts are with them. My thoughts are also with the family of Yossi Sharabi, who are still waiting for news.\n\n‘I reiterate my thanks for the tireless diplomatic efforts of the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Türkiye. It is now crucial that we work together to implement President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, and that will be my focus in Egypt today.\n\n‘Commitment to this plan from all parties will be essential to ending the war and building the foundations for a sustainable path to a long-term peace. The UK will support the crucial next stage of talks to ensure the implementation of the peace plan.’\n\nIn TV interviews yesterday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK played a ‘key role’ in securing the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHowever, the US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said she was ‘delusional’, and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, bluntly rejected the claim.\n\nMr Witkoff posted on X this morning: ‘I would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel.\n\n‘In particular, I want to recognize the incredible input and tireless efforts of National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell.’\n\nIt is understood Mr Powell has been speaking to Mr Witkoff almost daily. \n\nSir Keir is understood to want to draw on the Northern Ireland peace process – which Mr Powell worked on as chief of staff to Sir Tony Blair in No10 – in talks on ‘decommissioning’ Hamas.\n\nAhead of the Egyptian summit, Mr Trump travelled to Israel to meet with hostage families and address the parliament there.\n\nHe said before his departure that many in both Israel and Arab countries were ‘cheering’ the agreement and that ‘everybody’s amazed and they’re thrilled and we’re going to have an amazing time’.\n\nSpeaking to reporters while in the air, Mr Trump deemed the conflict ‘over’, adding: ‘I think people are tired of it.’\n\nHe also said he hoped to one day visit Gaza, telling travelling reporters: ‘I’d like to put my feet on it, at least.’\n\nSir Keir was due to urge those at the Sharm El Sheikh summit to build on the momentum to bring about the second phase of plans to end the conflict.\n\nHe was expected to heap praise on Mr Trump and the diplomatic efforts of the other negotiators, as well as commit the UK to playing a key role in rebuilding Gaza.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSir Keir Starmer was left red-faced at the Gaza peace summit as he awkwardly thought&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: When Starmer Mistakenly Believed Trump Was Asking Him to Speak at Gaza Summit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/when-starmer-mistakenly-believed-trump-was-asking-him-to-speak-at-gaza-summit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Moment-Starmer-thought-Trump-was-inviting-him-to-speak-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 00:20:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.101},{"id":368967118,"title":"Democrats who condemned Israel’s Gaza campaign silent after Trump-brokered ceasefire takes effect ","text":"Yet progressive Democrats who once dominated headlines with calls to “end the genocide” have offered no new public statements acknowledging the development. Among those who have not commented are Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Summer Lee (D-PA) — members of the so-called Squad who have been some of Israel’s fiercest critics.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) is the only member of the group to issue a new statement since the ceasefire took effect. In a post on X, Pressley said she was “deeply relieved that surviving Israeli hostages and detained Palestinians are finally being reunited with their families,” while expressing heartbreak for those who did not make it home. She called the moment “a critical step” and said she hopes it leads to “a just and lasting peace in the region,” as well as “an end to the horrific genocide perpetrated by the Israeli government,” the rebuilding of Gaza, and “a shared future of self-determination and humanity for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”\n\nTheir silence comes after months of highly charged rhetoric. Tlaib has repeatedly called Israel’s campaign “a genocide funded by U.S. taxpayers.” Omar accused the Israeli government of “indiscriminate bombing,” while Ocasio-Cortez said earlier this year that “Gaza has become a graveyard for children.”\n\nTlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, last posted on Oct. 10, reposting a message from Oversight Democrats urging federal workers to call a whistleblower tip line. She has not spoken out since the deal was announced. She was also one of the earliest lawmakers to demand a ceasefire, calling for one just 10 days after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that left roughly 1,200 people dead and more than 250 taken hostage. Israel’s campaign in the two years that followed left over 67,000 Palestinians dead, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, though its count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nFor the sake of humanity, let’s hope this will be a lasting and permanent ceasefire. While this is a hopeful step, we must demand accountability for every war crime committed during this genocide and continue to call for an end to the occupation. https://t.co/V7nh0Z9wEH— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 9, 2025\n\nOmar posted on X on Oct. 9, writing, “For the sake of humanity, let’s hope this will be a lasting and permanent ceasefire. While this is a hopeful step, we must demand accountability for every war crime committed during this genocide and continue to call for an end to the occupation.” She has not issued any further comment since.\n\nLee posted on Oct. 10 that the ceasefire was “a critical step to ending the genocide, surging aid, and reuniting Palestinian and Israeli families” and said it must hold. She has not posted any updates since the deal took effect.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, on the House floor in March 2024, accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people. In a September press release, she said, “The children of Gaza are starving to death because Donald Trump will also not stand up to Benjamin Netanyahu. It is time for us to fight for a free Palestine, the release of the hostages, and a diplomatic solution to end the cycle of violence.”\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), among the most vocal critics of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the release of hostages and prisoners while again denouncing Israel’s military campaign. Together with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), he attempted to advance legislation seeking to restrict U.S. transfers of offensive weapons to Israel.\n\n“Today, we welcome the long-overdue release of the 20 remaining Israelis held by Hamas and the freeing of almost 2,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons,” Sanders wrote. “Hopefully, the ceasefire will hold, and the people of the region will find a lasting peace.” He also called on the United States to end its “blanket military support” for Israel, saying the destruction of Gaza “must never happen again.”\n\nSanders has been among the most forceful voices in Congress criticizing Israel’s campaign. In September, he became the first U.S. senator to accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, calling that conclusion “inescapable.” “Over the last two years, Israel has not simply defended itself against Hamas,” he wrote. “Instead, it has waged an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people.” \n\nDemocratic strategist Jon Reinish said progressive Democrats’ silence raises new questions for the party as it prepares toward the next election cycle.\n\n“What’s been very interesting is that the whole ceasefire, progressive cohort who has been clamoring and shouting and calling for a ceasefire since practically Oct. 8 of 2023, now that there is one, I haven’t heard boo from them,” Reinish told the Washington Examiner. “It makes me wonder if it was really about a ceasefire all along.”\n\nReinish added that Democrats may soon have to grapple with the political fallout. “So many Jews feel so abandoned by our natural political home for most of our lives,” he said. “Is that going to rejigger elections here in America in a lasting way, or even in the upcoming election? That’s the question I’m thinking about.”\n\nHe said many Democrats also appear reluctant to credit Trump for securing the ceasefire. “It’s been interesting to see how hesitant some people are to acknowledge that the deal freeing hostages and setting the region, hopefully, on a path to peace came from Trump and his team,” Reinish said. “I’ve heard people say, ‘I want this to happen, but did it have to be Trump who got us there?’ My answer is, ‘Who cares who got us there? It needed to happen.’”\n\nWhile the progressive flank has stayed largely quiet, other Democrats have been more measured in their responses. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) praised Trump for “getting a lot of credit” for the deal, calling it “a hopeful step toward ending this terrible war.” Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) also welcomed the ceasefire and the release of hostages, calling it a long-awaited moment of relief and a possible turning point for diplomacy.\n\nDEMOCRATS CREDIT TRUMP FOR ENDING ISRAEL’S WAR IN GAZA: ‘THIS WAS HIS DEAL’\n\nCoons said it was “a day long overdue,” adding that he was “overjoyed that the remaining living hostages have been released and are finally being reunited with their loved ones.” Rosen described it as “an important day” after “over 700 days of torture and torment,” expressing relief that “the nightmare is over for the families so they can begin the healing process.” Shaheen said in a statement that the moment “offers hope amid immense suffering” and thanked the Trump administration and regional partners “for their mediation efforts that made this progress possible,” urging all parties “to press forward on diplomatic efforts so Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace, security, and dignity.”\n\nDemocratic leaders also praised the agreement. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called it “a wonderful day,” thanking Trump, his administration, and the families of the hostages for their advocacy. He urged all parties to seize the “enormous opportunity ahead for a lasting peace,” reaffirming his support for a two-state solution ensuring “security, prosperity, and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) struck a similar tone, saying he was “thankful that all 20 living Israeli hostages are home with their loved ones” and that humanitarian aid is now reaching civilians in Gaza. “We must now recommit to achieving a just and lasting peace in the region,” he said. “Nothing less than that is acceptable.”","summary":"Some of the Democratic Party’s most outspoken critics of Israel’s war in Gaza, lawmakers who for months have accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, have remained strikingly silent in the days since President Donald Trump’s brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect.

You don’t own it!” he shouted.\n\n“You don’t own patriotism! You don’t own Christianity!\n\n“You sure as hell don’t own respect for the bravery and sacrifice of military, police and firefighters!” he continued, his enraged tone betraying no small amount of unrighteous indignation.\n\nHe was this close to getting it.\n\nStewart’s anger was unrighteous because Republicans have never claimed to “own” any of these things.\n\nIt’s just that, by and large, they’re now the only ones who champion them.\n\nAnd while there surely remain many patriotic, faithful, America-loving Democrats to be found across the country, their party has, institutionally, left them behind.\n\nThis was true when Stewart first delivered his silly lecture in 2016, and it’s even more obvious now — which is why his old clip hit such a nerve.\n\nBack in 2008, amid her husband’s rise in the polls, Michelle Obama declared, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.”\n\nA month and change later, the future president himself mused that the inhabitants of “small towns” in the heartland with a dearth of job opportunities “get bitter” and cling to, among other supposed crutches, “religion.”\n\nUpon taking the oath of office, Obama doubled down on these insults.\n\nHe quickly embarked upon his infamous Middle Eastern apology tour, decrying the United States’ “arrogance.”\n\nObamacare, his signature legislative achievement, compelled Catholics and others of faith to violate their conscience by providing contraceptives to employees.\n\nAnd of course, he repeatedly stoked racial tension and anti-police animus, such as after the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri and Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nThe post-Obama era has been even more unkind to Stewart’s thesis.\n\nIn recent years, the left has launched wars on America’s Founding Fathers and greatest heroes.\n\nGeorge Floyd’s tragic death in 2020 inspired a hatred for all things red, white, and blue that elected Democrats dutifully supported with iconoclastic fervor.\n\nRecall, for example, how the city of Boston tore down a 140-year old monument celebrating Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation — because it supposedly represented “white saviorism.”\n\n“Residents and visitors to Boston have been uncomfortable with this statue, and its reductive representation of the black man’s role in the abolitionist movement,” declared then-Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nNot even the hero who paid for liberty with his life could escape Team Blue’s embrace of overt anti-Americanism.\n\nThe Floyd riots also launched an outbreak of vile smears and physical attacks against law enforcement officers, who paid a heavy price when Democrats endorsed the lies leveled against them.\n\nThe Defund the Police movement deprived departments across the country of both resources and morale, pushing working cops off the force and persuading prospective ones to pursue less demonized vocations.\n\nUltimately, that hurt not just the police, but the citizens they were sworn to protect.\n\nMoreover, while President Joe Biden touted his Catholic faith when politically convenient, his administration went all-out to push radical gender theory and other un-Christian practices — so much so that his Justice Department made a point of harassing pro-life activists and monitoring rank-and-file Catholics who attended the traditional Latin Mass.\n\nIn the face of this recent history, now is the time for Democratic soul-searching.\n\nAfter conceding two of the last three presidential elections to Donald Trump, they’re seeing their activist wing lash out with violence, rioting against ICE agents and assassinating conservative speaker Charlie Kirk.\n\nAnd when their candidate for attorney general in Virginia was caught gleefully fantasizing about the deaths of his political opponents’ children, their party leaders shrugged it off.\n\nAt the root of all this is contempt for this country as it exists, for the Judeo-Christian values on which it was built, and for the flawed but honorable institutions conservatives still cherish.\n\nThe Stewart clip, and his performative outrage, held up a mirror to that ugliness.\n\nIf Democrats want to reverse their political fortunes and moral decline, they’ll need a leader with more self-awareness than the oblivious, self-pitying Stewart to rise to the occasion.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a senior editor

Done a Fantastic Job'","text":"Standing just feet away from Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the Gaza peace summit in Egypt, US President Donald Trump on Monday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and called India \"a great country with a very good friend of mine at the top.\" Speaking at a summit of world leaders in Egypt following a ceasefire deal in Gaza that ended the Israel-Hamas war, Trump said he believed India and Pakistan would \"live very nicely together.\" \"India is a great country with a very good friend of mine at the top and he's just done a fantastic job,\" Trump said from the podium. \"I think Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together,\" he added, glancing at Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who stood behind him and responded with a chuckle. Trump's remarks came days after a phone conversation with Prime Minister Modi, during which the Indian PM congratulated him on the Gaza peace deal and discussed ongoing trade negotiations. \"Spoke to my friend, President Trump, and congratulated him on the success of the historic Gaza peace plan,\" Modi said in a post on X. \"Also reviewed the good progress achieved in trade negotiations. Agreed to stay in close touch over the coming weeks.\" It was the second call between the two leaders in a month. Also Read: Shehbaz Sharif Repeats Trump's India-Pak Claim, Calls for Nobel Peace Honour Earlier at the summit, Trump had also praised Sharif and his \"favourite field marshal,\" Pakistan's army chief General Asim Munir, inviting the Pakistani leader to address the gathering. Taking the podium, Sharif credited Trump for achieving peace in the Middle East, describing it as the outcome of his \"untiring and relentless efforts.\" \"Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team,\" Sharif said. He added that he would nominate Trump again for the Nobel Peace Prize for \"saving millions of lives not only in South Asia but also in the Middle East.\" Trump, who missed out on the Nobel Peace Prize, has repeatedly claimed to have resolved multiple global conflicts. He has now raised that number from seven to eight, adding the Israel-Gaza war to his list. Since May 10, when Trump announced that India and Pakistan had agreed to a \"full and immediate\" ceasefire after what he called a \"long night\" of talks mediated by Washington, he has maintained that he \"helped settle\" the long-standing conflict between the two neighbours. India, however, has consistently rejected Trump's claim, stating that the understanding to cease hostilities with Pakistan was reached directly between the Directors General of Military Operations of both countries. The ceasefire followed Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. After four days of cross-border drone and missile strikes, the two sides reached an understanding to end hostilities on May 10.","summary":"Trump’s remarks came days after a phone conversation with Prime Minister Modi, during which the Indian PM congratulated him on the Gaza peace deal","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/middle-east/us-president-donald-trump-praises-india-pm-narendra-modi-shehbaz-sharif-article-152996122","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-152996125,thumbsize-48860,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/152996125.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 00:15:26","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":368964336,"title":"India News | Durgapur Gang Rape Case: Police Arrest Two More Accused, Produced Them in Court","text":"Durgapur (West Bengal) [India], October 14 (ANI): West Bengal Police arrested two more accused in connection with the alleged Durgapur gang rape incident and produced them in a court on Monday.

This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal.\"\nAlso Read | Gaza Peace Summit: Donald Trump, Arab Leaders Seal Landmark Peace Agreement to End Israel-Hamas War (Watch Video).\nAccording to the release, in the WHO South-East Asia Region, the challenge of mother-to-child transmission remains a significant concern. Provisional estimates for 2024 indicate that more than 23,000 pregnant women had syphilis, and over 8,000 infants were born with congenital syphilis. Approximately 25,000 HIV-positive pregnant women require treatment to prevent transmission to their babies, while hepatitis B continues to affect over 42 million people in the Region.\nDr Catharina Boehme, Officer-in-Charge at the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office, called the achievement a powerful testament to the Maldives' commitment to universal health coverage and equity. She noted that the country's ability to deliver quality care across its widely dispersed islands, including services for migrants, made the milestone particularly significant.\n\"Maldives' achievement is a testament to its unwavering commitment towards universal health coverage, to provide quality and equitable care across its dispersed islands to all, including migrants... This landmark feat is an important step towards 'Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures', for improving maternal and newborn health by ending preventable deaths and prioritising long-term well-being. I congratulate Maldives and look forward to the country pioneering progress in many other areas while sustaining these gains,\" she stated.\nThe Maldives' public health system has long prioritised integrated and comprehensive maternal and child care. More than 95 per cent of pregnant women receive antenatal care, with nearly universal screening for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. The national immunisation programme ensures that over 95 per cent of newborns receive the timely hepatitis B birth dose, along with full vaccine coverage. These measures have led to zero reported cases of babies born with HIV or syphilis in both 2022 and 2023. A national survey conducted in 2023 confirmed zero prevalence of hepatitis B among young children entering the first grade of school, surpassing global elimination targets.\nThe Maldives offers free antenatal care, diagnostic services and vaccinations to all residents, including migrants, under its universal health coverage programme. The government allocates over 10 per cent of its GDP to health, underlining its commitment to public well-being.\nThe country's Health Minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim hailed the triple elimination validation as a moment of immense national pride.\n\"This historic validation is a moment of immense pride for the Maldives and a reflection of our nation's steadfast commitment to protecting mothers, children and future generations... Achieving triple elimination is not only a milestone for our health sector, but also a pledge by the Government to our people that we will continue to invest in resilient, equitable and high-quality health services that leave no one behind,\" he said.\nThe achievement has been made possible through sustained collaboration between the government, private healthcare providers, civil society and international partners. These efforts focused on expanding access to screening, care services, outreach, and health system strengthening with WHO technical support throughout the process.\nWHO Representative to the Maldives, Payden, said the achievement demonstrates how health investments, innovation, and community care can transform public health outcomes. \"The Maldives' triple elimination stands as a powerful example of how sustained investment in health systems, innovation, and community-based care can change the trajectory of public health. WHO is proud to have partnered with the Government of Maldives and will continue to provide technical support to sustain this achievement and ensure that every child across all the islands has a healthy future,\" she said.\nThe Maldives will continue to strengthen its health system by integrating digital health solutions, expanding targeted outreach to key and migrant populations, enhancing private sector involvement, improving laboratory quality, and reinforcing surveillance and reporting. WHO will support these efforts to ensure sustained elimination and continued progress towards broader maternal, child and adolescent health goals.

Our latest Hollywood leftist du jour is a familiar face when it comes to parroting communist talking points, as Mark Ruffalo hopped on Rainn Wilson's podcast, Soul Boom, and started whining about capitalism. This video is just more proof these people are truly mentally deranged, because even the most surface-level Marvel fan can identify that Ruffalo is literally playing his Bruce Banner character in this clip while trying to sound intelligent. Hey, Mark! Just because you played a scientist in a comic book movie doesn't mean you are one in real life, but I digress. Isn't it funny how all of these phony Hollywood leftists are always bitching about billionaires? It's never millionaires or even hundred-millionaires, and you know why? Because that would require them to come after their own. \"Oh, it's not my fault America is a capitalist hellhole, it's those dirty billionaires who fund all my movies and establish the studios I film in.\" Speaking of capitalism, doesn't this guy realize capitalism is the very system he got insanely wealthy off of? I hate to break it to him, but they aren't giving out eight-figure paychecks to movie stars in communist regimes, and even if they do, I doubt Ruffalo would make the cut. I love Wilson coming off the top rope with his e. pluribis unum comment. Dwight, my friend, that motto refers to the 13 colonies joining together to form our nation, not a bunch of billionaires handing their property over to the government. The only thing evil about capitalism is the fact that it allows slop fests like Wilson's podcast to make him more money than a lot of us will see in our entire lifetime. Perhaps these two would like to donate the earnings from their next projects to some affordable housing, but even that is better than socialism, because they aren't being forced to do so through government coercion. It's all so tiresome. Wake me up when a celebrity says something positive about America, capitalism or Donald Trump.

Alec Baldwin's Brother Involved in Hamptons Car Crash","text":"Stephen Baldwin, the youngest member of the Baldwin acting dynasty, was involved in a car crash on Monday alongside his older brother, Emmy-winning actor Alec Baldwin. The incident occurred in the Hamptons, New York, where Alec owns a summer home. According to photos obtained by The New York Post and TMZ, the Baldwins' white Range Rover smashed head-on into a tree along Montauk Highway. The SUV’s front end was completely destroyed, and Alec Baldwin, 67, was seen at the scene looking disheveled and visibly frustrated as he made a phone call in the rain. Police arrived quickly and helped both men take shelter from the downpour. It remains unclear who was driving at the time of the crash. A garbage truck was visible near the scene, but the waste management company later clarified that their driver was not at fault. Alec Baldwin was reportedly in the area for the Hamptons International Film Festival, which ran from October 5 to 13. A source told Page Six that he had “been out there all week,” attending screenings and moderating panels as co-chair of the festival’s Board Executive Committee. The extent of any injuries in the crash has not yet been confirmed, and local authorities have not released an official statement at this time. Who Is Stephen Baldwin? Stephen Baldwin, 58, is best known for his roles in The Usual Suspects and Bio-Dome, and has made headlines in recent years for his outspoken views on religion and politics. He is one of four Baldwin brothers in the entertainment industry, alongside Alec, Daniel, and William. Baldwin resides in the village of Nyack, New York, with his wife, Brazilian graphic designer Kennya Baldwin (née Deodato), whom he met in 1987 and married in 1990. They have two daughters, Alaia Baldwin and Hailey Bieber, both successful models. His father-in-law is Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato, and Canadian singer Justin Bieber is his son-in-law through marriage to Hailey. Politically, Baldwin was among the first Hollywood celebrities to endorse Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and he has continued to support Trump in both 2020 and 2024.","summary":"Stephen Baldwin and his brother Alec Baldwin were involved in a car crash in the Hamptons on Monday, reportedly hitting a tree head-on.

The world needs more Trumps,” Ohana added of the U.S. president who has sicced the military on his own citizens and has turned Customs and Border Patrol agents into masked goons who violently arrest anyone they think looks Hispanic.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, gifted Trump a golden statue of a dove—another hideously ostentatious trinket Trump can add to the White House he’s defiled with tacky gold ornaments. \n\nAnd later, Netanyahu bragged in a speech before the Israeli parliament that he nominated Trump for the Nobel and said it's \"only a matter of time\" before Trump gets it.\n\nThen in Egypt, where Trump traveled for a \"Peace Summit,\" Trump whined about not winning the prize—which was awarded on Friday to a Venezuelan woman fighting for democracy who dedicated the prize to Trump anyway for his “decisive support.”\n\n“We have Norway. Oh, Norway, aye aye aye! Norway, what happened? Norway, what happened?” Trump said in a speech at the summit, referring to the country that awards the annual award.\n\nIn the same speech, Trump also made Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif go up to the podium to \"say what you said to me the other day\"—which evidently was a boatload of over-the-top praise about how Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding extraordinary contributions to first, stop war between India and Pakistan, and then achieve ceasefire along with his very wonderful team,\" Sharif said. \"And today again I would like to nominate this great president for Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\nBefore his whining that he did not win the Nobel Peace Prize, he gave a speech in Israel in which he bragged about the weapons he sent to Israel that were used in their war against Hamas.\n\n\"Bibi Netanyahu would call me so many times asking for weapons I never even heard of, but we got them here didn’t we?

On Monday, Trump even took time to praise Orban, who he called “fantastic” and a “great leader.”\n\nIndeed, when giving out this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, the award committee described why Trump will never win the award.\n\n\"When authoritarians seize power, it is crucial to recognise courageous defenders of freedom who rise and resist. Democracy depends on people who refuse to stay silent, who dare to step forward despite grave risk, and who remind us that freedom must never be taken for granted, but must always be defended—with words, with courage, and with determination,\" the committee wrote.\n\nA man who is trying to silence dissent, imprison his enemies, and ignore laws to remain in power will never win the Nobel.","summary":"President Donald Trump traveled to the Middle East on Monday to mark the first phase of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in which Hamas agreed to release the final hostages held captive in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing detained Palestinian prisoners.\n\n\n\nAnd true to form, Trump made the day all about himself, basking in the praise of Israel’s far-right leaders, who lamented the fact that Trump did not win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nKnesset Speaker Amir Ohana, a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party, said Trump should have won the Nobel Peace Prize, declaring in a speech that Trump is a “colossus who will be enshrined in the pantheon of history.” \n\n\n\n“What the world needs now are more leaders who are brave, resolute, strong, and bold.

Trump stormed onto the American political stage in 2016, some section of the world believed his no-nonsense rhetoric could never win hearts in a country long accustomed to political restraint.\n\nYet, against all odds, Trump’s unapologetic bluntness resonated with millions of Americans who were tired of “business as usual” in Washington.\n\nIn Ghana, a similar figure stands at a comparable crossroads, Kennedy Ohene Agyapong, the outspoken former Member of Parliament and flagbearer hopeful of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP). \n\nWhenever the name Kennedy Agyapong is mentioned, it resonates in the ears of some Ghanaians as “a harsh man,” “an arrogant man,” or “a disrespectful man”, labels often linked to his outspoken and confrontational style of addressing issues.\n\nLike Trump, he divides opinion sharply. so, to some, he is too harsh, too abrasive, too unpredictable. To others, he is refreshingly bold, brutally honest, and exactly what a weary democracy needs.\n\nWell, somewhere in 2023, Ken asked Ghanaians not to equate him to Trump, but Mr. Ken, permit me to do this last one before January 31.\n\nThe parallels ,of personality and politics\n\nThe two gentlemen built their reputations not from bureaucratic polish but from raw authenticity, I observed.\n\nTrump was a businessman-turned-politician who traded political correctness for candour. Kennedy Agyapong, too, rose from entrepreneurial success before entering politics, wielding an unfiltered tongue that has both inspired and alarmed Ghanaians.\n\nPresident Trump is known for making statements that often stir controversy, yet resonate positively with some segments of the public.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Agyapong does the same. Recently he warned that “any vision for Ghana that starts with the IMF has already failed” opponents branded him unrealistic, meanwhile some section of the public interpret it as a bold declaration of economic sovereignty, a refusal to let Ghana’s destiny be dictated by external lenders.\n\nSome of President Trump’s method are confrontation over conciliation. Did you remember his comment describing certain nations as “shithole countries” during immigration talks as reported by the Washington Post?\n\nIn last two weeks, he blasted the United Nations in his speech to the General Assembly, suggesting that the organization was either ignoring or exacerbating problems around the world that were being left to him to fix. \n\nThat is something world leaders would hardly say at such events, isn’t it?\n\nMr. Agyapong mirrors this spirit, isn’t he? when he chastised his fellow NPP figures and scolded what he calls “talkers in suits”, insisting that Ghana needs “doers, not dreamers”\n\nIn this world, some have rich ideas and nothing to show for it. Others turn ideas into results and wealth. Ghana needs more doers, not dreamers in suits giving speeches.#DoersOverTalkers— Ken O. Agyapong (@realKenAgyapong) June 23, 2025\n\nJust after the 2024 elections, he rebuked poor performance of his own party in public, saying “you can’t lose over two million votes and be given another opportunity”, that is uncommon right?\n\nThese two men’s bluntness, though jarring, is deliberate. Their outspokenness feeds a larger populist narrative: that political correctness has paralysed leadership. \n\nFor disillusioned voters, such candour feels like truth-telling; for the establishment, it borders on heresy.\n\nTo me, despite all these actions of Donald Trump, his victory in the 2024 election underscored an enduring truth: voters often reward authenticity over decorum, that is the case in recent politics, I observed.\n\nThe more some people condemned his tone, the more his base rallied. His defiance became his badge of strength.\n\nIf Kennedy Agyapong secures the NPP’s flagbearer slot in January 2026, the 2028 general election could test whether Ghanaians are ready for a “Trumpian” political disruption, one led not by rhetorical diplomacy, but by blunt practicality.\n\nThe balance between fire and finesse\n\nIt is telling that Kennedy Agyapong himself recently promised a shift from rhetoric to results:\n\n“The old Ken fought for you. The new Ken will build with you,” he said on his X.\n\nYou know me. You’ve heard me speak my mind for years. I’ve always spoken from the heart, sometimes with fire, because I love this country.But I’ve also listened. And I’ve come to understand that the skills needed to expose a problem are different from the skills needed to solve…— Ken O. Agyapong (@realKenAgyapong) September 14, 2025 \n\nPresident Trump’s words energised millions yet alienated millions more. Agyapong’s candour wins applause at the grassroots but unsettles moderates and elites alike. \n\nBoth must navigate the same paradox: that leadership in modern politics demands not just audacity, but agility.\n\nA crossroads of leadership style\n\nKennedy Agyapong’s political future may thus become a litmus test for whether Ghana’s maturing democracy can embrace unvarnished speech without fear of volatility.\n\nLike Trump, he personifies disruption, but perhaps in a distinctly Ghanaian idiom: a businessman who speaks his mind, unafraid of sacred cows, confident that honesty, however harsh, is a form of patriotism.\n\nWhether that frankness propels him to the Jubilee House or pushes him to the political margins will depend on one thing, whether Ghanaians see in him the courage to build, not merely the boldness to speak.\n\nIn the end, both Donald Trump and Kennedy Agyapong remind us of an enduring truth in democratic politics.\n\nAlbert Kuzor, the author of this article, is a journalist with the Multimedia Group.

One is a provision stating that journalists could be deemed a “security risk” based on several considerations, including whether they disclose classified or even unclassified information without the Pentagon’s authorization. Media lawyers worry that the stricture could expose reporters to punishment for engaging in routine reporting.\n\nThe document replaces a simpler, one-page form that outlined access limitations for journalists, according to the Pentagon Press Association.\n\nImplementation of the new policy is on a fast track: Journalists have until Tuesday at 5 p.m. to decide whether or not to sign the form. Those who do not must turn in their credentials a day later.\n\nOther news outlets, including The Guardian and CNN, have also said they would reject the policy. The announcements reflect the news media’s wide-ranging frustration with efforts by Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, to curtail the physical movement of reporters in the building and impose fresh limits on their activities.\n\n“CNN’s mission to report fairly and fully on the Department of War, the U.S. military and the Trump administration will continue regardless of physical access to the Pentagon. We will not be deflected from our duty to hold all three fairly and fully to account, and we will continue to report on the actions and decision-making processes of the U.S. government without fear or favor,” CNN said in a statement last week.\n\nThe press association that lobbies for Pentagon reporters issued a statement today saying, “This Wednesday, most Pentagon Press Association members seem likely to hand over their badges rather than acknowledge a policy that gags Pentagon employees and threatens retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been preapproved for release.”\n\nThe association urged Pentagon officials to reconsider its policy.\n\nOne America News Network, a conservative news channel known for commentary supporting President Donald Trump, has signed the policy, according to the network’s president, Charles Herring.\n\nThe backlash over the Pentagon restrictions will have an immediate effect on coverage of the military. More than 100 members of the press association have credentials to cover the building, though only a fraction of that total show up each day to report there. The contingent of journalists working from the Pentagon is almost certain to shrink in the coming weeks.\n\nFrom the start of his tenure, Hegseth has adopted an adversarial approach to the Pentagon news corps, first removing several outlets from their slots in a shared work space and later curbing where reporters could roam within the complex.\n\nIn a sequence of posts today on the social media platform X, Hegseth responded to the announcements from the Times, The Washington Post and The Atlantic with the hand-wave emoji, which suggested he was saying farewell.\n\nThe Pentagon didn’t immediately respond to a question about whether it would reconsider the restrictions.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, Newsmax and NPR, have announced that their journalists will not sign a new set of Pentagon restrictions affecting news gathering in the massive military complex.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/13/breaking-news/several-news-outlets-reject-pentagons-reporting-restrictions/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/web1_20251013_brk_pnt01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 23:55:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":368958630,"title":"Prisoner is allowed to walk out of jail to pick up tomatoes for the canteen in 'unbelievable' security breach","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Oct 14th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate and Wills' fresh start at their 'forever home': Why they have fast-tracked their move to house they will never leave - even when he becomes King\n\nSir Keir Starmer is mocked after humiliating moment with Trump on the world stage in Egypt - where British PM 'thought he was being invited to speak'\n\nFurious Speaker hits out at ministers over China spying scandal and warns parliament is not getting protection\n\n'Who does this?'

The inmate was put into segregation before being transferred to another prison.\nVanessa Frake-Harris MBE, former Head of Security at Wormwood Scrubs, called the incident on Saturday, October 4 'unbelievable'.\n\nThe farcical yet deeply concerning incident unfolded on Sunday at HMP Downview, a closed women's prison on the outskirts of Banstead in Surrey\n'Unfortunately this is a sad reflection on our beleaguered prison service,' she told the Mail. \n'A closed prison is exactly that - a highly secure facility for prisoners considered too high-risk of escaping or harming others to be in an open prison setting.\n'The correct procedure would have been to risk assess the prisoner and if suitable grant them accompanied temporary release.\n'Thankfully on this occasion the prisoner did not escape.'\nIn a recent inspection, Downview's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) specifically warned about poor security at the prison gate. \nA Prison Service spokesman said: 'We are taking extremely seriously a brief security breach at HMP Downview which lasted less than 10 minutes. In line with our processes, two members of staff have been suspended pending an investigation.\n'Swift action was taken by other staff to correct the breach and ensure it never happens again.'\nWhile the kitchen worker would have carried keys, he would have needed to hand these in at the inner gatehouse. \nHe would have then had to pass through the final gatehouse checks to be let out by the guards. \nThe prisoner would have then stood alongside him in full view of the guards as they were both let out of the prison.\nIt is not clear what the inmate had been imprisoned for, but the fact she was allowed to work in the kitchen suggests she was considered to be relatively trustworthy.\nNonetheless, the decision to let her out of the prison - and the fact guards at the gate did nothing to intervene - was an astonishing breach of security protocol.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Jail bosses investigate video showing 'prison governor walking out of city centre brothel' \nIn its latest annual report, the Downview IMB found there was 'no routine enhanced security on the gate for visitors or staff'.\nThe organisation said none of its members had ever been searched while entering the prison - despite many of them being in their roles for more than seven years. \nThe board is made up of members of the public volunteering their time. \nIts report also noted that friends and family members of prisoners had commented on the 'relaxed' searching process during their visits - despite bosses raising concerns that some of them could be bringing in drugs. \nThe IMB said there had been an increase in the amount of drugs being brought into the prison, including spice, heroin and cannabis. \nDangerous synthetic opioids were also intercepted at the jail in early 2025 for the first time. \nDownview has an operational capacity of 356, consisting of sentenced women and young offenders over 18. \nThe prison also houses Britain's only wing for high-risk transgender inmates. \nMany assumed it would be axed after April's Supreme Court ruling that the definition of women is based on biological sex, but the IMB said its status 'has not been formally clarified' - suggesting ministers are sitting on their hands about its future. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPrisoner is allowed to walk out of jail to pick up tomatoes for the canteen in 'unbelievable' security breach\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nAverage transaction prices for new vehicles hit $50,080 in September, the report released Monday found, rising 2.1% from August and 3.6% year-over-year.\n\nNew vehicles’ average price sat around the $40,000 mark five years ago, not long before prices began skyrocketing amid a semiconductor chip shortage.\n\nAverage new-vehicle manufacturer’s suggested retail prices (MSRPs) also hit an all-time high last month, reaching $52,183, up 4.2% from the same period last year.\n\nAverage transaction prices were “likely” pushed up by a “rich mix of luxury vehicles and expensive EV models,” the report said, estimating that electric vehicles’ share of the U.S. market reached a record high of 11.6% in September.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

That is how many electric vehicles were sold in the third quarter of this year, something the report attributed to expiring government sales incentives for electric vehicles, which caused buyers to quickly finalize deals.\n\nKey Background\n\nKeating called the arrival of the all-time high prices “a matter of time, especially when you consider the best-selling vehicle in America is a pickup truck from Ford that routinely costs north of $65,000.” Keating noted tariffs have “introduced new cost pressure” to the automotive industry. Auto tariffs are increasing costs and uncertainty, creating risk for production stalls and increased consumer costs that could drive down sales, according to S&P Global. President Donald Trump imposed a 25% base tariff on vehicles built outside the U.S. earlier this year, raising car prices by up to $6,000 for vehicles under $40,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNew-Vehicle Average Transaction Price Hits Record High in September, Surges Past $50,000 for the First Time Ever (Kelley Blue Book)\n\nTrump Says U.S. Will Impose 100% Tariffs Against China Following Mineral Trade Dispute (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

We are right now here at Bilimora Station, which is the starting station for the first section. The first section will be Surat to Bilimora, 50 kms, and it will be opened in 2027.\"The minister explained that the civil construction work for this section has already been completed, and track-laying is now underway. The Surat-Bilimora stretch is part of the larger Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, a flagship infrastructure project being developed in collaboration with Japan.Vaishnaw highlighted that the design of the station and the rail system follows Japanese engineering standards to ensure safety and efficiency. \"The station is designed in a very unique way because when the train passes at 320 kmph, a huge pressure builds up around the train. This is a Japanese design; there is an open space kept so that the pressure doesn't get built up around the station. Many special precautions have been taken,\" he said.He also pointed out that structural reinforcements and sound barriers have been put in place to reduce disturbance to nearby residents. \"The sheet has extra thickness compared to all other stations. Sound barriers have been installed to prevent disturbance to people residing in nearby areas,\" the minister noted.The bullet train, once fully operational, will significantly reduce travel time between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. \"When this project gets fully commissioned in 2027, we'll have the first section between Surat and Bilimora. By 2028, we will have completed the entire Gujarat section. The Maharashtra section is expected to be completed by 2029. Once this project is completed, the Mumbai to Ahmedabad journey, which is today about 7-8 hours by car, will be just two hours and seven minutes,\" Vaishnaw said.The project is expected to set the foundation for similar high-speed rail corridors across the country in the coming years.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JUSTIN ENRIQUEZ, US ASSISTANT SHOWBIZ EDITOR and DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:23:56 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:00:48 BST, 14 October 2025 \n\nJustin Baldoni's former agent accused Blake Lively of 'extortion' as the never ending legal war centered around the film It Ends With Us intensifies even more.\nAccording to a deposition transcript obtained by Daily Mail, the 41-year-old filmmaker's former agent Danny Greenberg had claimed that 38-year-old Lively's behavior on set and in post-production was increasingly volatile and even went as far as describing it as 'extortion' in July 2024 communications with Baldoni.\nGreenberg helped Baldoni draft emails to Sony referencing Lively's alleged 'continued extortion and effort to gain control of the film'.\nGreenberg went on to clarify his use of the word 'extortion,' as he said he was referring to the cumulative behavior and mounting pressure from both Wayfarer and Sony Studios and not literal criminal extortion.\nDaily Mail has reached out to Lively's representatives for comment and have yet to hear back. Baldoni's reps have refused comment. \nIn December 2024, the actress sued Baldoni for allegedly sexually harassing her on set — claims he denied - before he and Wayfarer Studios fired back with a defamation suit against Lively, her publicist Leslie Sloane and husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\nJustin Baldoni's former agent accused Blake Lively of 'extortion' as the never ending legal war centered around the film It Ends With Us intensifies even more.\nBaldoni also waged war with The New York Times, filing a $400million defamation lawsuit against the publication over its bombshell tell-all on Lively's sexual harassment claims against her former co-star on December 31, 2024.\nThe New York Times contested the claim and the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed in June 2025, however, earlier this month the publication filed a complaint 'to recover costs, fees and expenses incurred.'\nIn the new legal documents obtained by Daily Mail, Lively's make-up artist Vivian Baker said the incidents characterized as 'inappropriate' had all occurred during the first phase of filming and that things 'seemed to be going well'.\n\n Blake Lively bombshell as unsigned draft contract reveals salary and surprising bonus for Oscar nod \nMeanwhile, Blake's talent agent Warren Zavala seemed to reiterate those claims as he said he was not aware of any incidents that had made Lively uncomfortable during the second phase of filming. \nHe did, however, say that he did become aware of his client's complaints during the 'post process' while testing a cut of the film.\nLively's representative told People: 'The court already dismissed their so-called taking over a movie claim, and this cherry-picked deposition quote from Baldoni’s prior agent before he was dropped from WME adds nothing new.\n'The court’s dismissal even assumed their allegations were true for the sake of argument — and still held that they don’t amount to a valid claim under the law. This is a legal process, not a click-bait one. This is just a recycled distraction that has nothing to do with the actual sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit Baldoni and the Wayfarer Defendants are facing.'\nThis comes just days after details from Lively's alleged unsigned draft contract for It Ends Like Us were revealed amid the ongoing Baldoni lawsuit. \nThe actress - who was not mentioned by husband Ryan Reynolds during a recent speaking engagement - was to be paid over $1.7million in addition to several potential bonuses according to Us Weekly on Friday\nOn Thursday, Baldoni - who was hit with fresh harassment claims last month - and his team unsealed court documents they had filed in their ongoing legal battle with Lively over the 2024 film.\nThe copy of the contract -dated May 5, 2023 - was not signed by Lively as it was said that the actress was to be paid $1.75million in 'fixed' compensation to star in the film.\n\nAccording to legal documents obtained by Daily Mail, the 41-year-old filmmaker's (pictured in New York August 2024) agent Danny Greenberg had testified that Lively's, 38, behavior on set and in post-production was increasingly volatile and went as far as describing it as 'extortion'\n\nIn the new legal documents obtained by Daily Mail, Lively's (pictured in New York in April) make-up artist Vivian Baker said the incidents characterized as 'inappropriate' had all occurred during the first phase of filming and that things 'seemed to be going well'\nDaily Mail has reached out to reps for Lively for comment and have yet to hear back. \nIt also said that the mother-of-four would be paid 10% of It Ends With Us' gross proceeds in addition to being paid millions based off the box office performance and if it was nominated for awards.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Ryan Reynolds avoids all mention of wife Blake Lively after backlash over insult story \nAccording to Us Weekly, the bonuses included her being paid $250,000 once the movie's gross theatrical receipts reached an amount equal to three times the 'direct cost' of the film. \nIn addition she would also received another $250,000 if it reached another milestone on top of another $250,000 if It Ends With Us made five times the 'direct cost of the film.\nIf that already wasn't enough, she would also be paid $100,000 if she was nominated for an Academy Award and $200,000 total if she took home the Oscar.\nAwards season had potential to be a big money making time for her as she could have earned $75,000 for a Golden Globe Nomination and $100,000 if she earned a win in addition to $50,000 for a SAG Award nomination and $75,000 for a win, however, she was not nominated for any awards.\nThe alleged contract also provided Lively have approval of the driver who would be taking her to and from work and she was also to have exclusive use of a single pop-out, star trailer (including customary amenities) for her use in New Jersey.\nWhen the shoot would take place in Las Vegas, it was stated that Lively would be given a private jet that would fit her in addition to her four children, her assistant, two nannies, and her security team. She also wanted $1,500 to cover assistant fees.\n\nThis comes just days after details from Lively's alleged unsigned draft contract for It Ends Like Us were revealed by Us Weekly amid the ongoing Justin Baldoni lawsuit as it was claimed that she was to be paid over $1.7million in addition to several potential bonuses\n\nAmong the many bonuses outlined in the unsigned contract included that she (pictured in New York last month) would also be paid $100,000 if she was nominated for an Academy Award and $200,000 total if she took home the Oscar\n\nLast month it was revealed that Baldoni is facing further scrutiny as another individual has come forward with claims of harassment , according to court documents obtained by The Daily Mail at the time; seen in 2017\nLively would have also received $1,000 per week for training a meal allowance in addition to provisions that all parties take any issues to arbitration and not file them in public court.\nLast month it was revealed that Baldoni is facing further scrutiny as another individual has come forward with claims of harassment, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Mail at the time.\n\n Blake Lively DROPS investigation after sparking free speech outcry amid Justin Baldoni lawsuit \nIn a sworn declaration, filed by Lively’s lawyer, the individual, whose name has been redacted, alleged they endured 'repeated, negative interactions with Mr. Baldoni and his associates, including verbal abuse by Mr. Baldoni.' \nThe unnamed person further claimed that Baldoni was 'not permitted on set during the majority of production as a result of those experiences.'\nThe individual also said they requested that Baldoni 'not be involved in marketing or public relations efforts.'\nA source told TMZ that the individual is 'likely to testify against Justin in Lively's trial.'\nAlthough the declaration does not concern It Ends with Us, the accuser stated they previously collaborated with Baldoni on a different project connected to his company, Wayfarer Studios.\nThe filing also references Baldoni's business partner, Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, noting that the accuser had been contacted by Sarowitz's assistant to arrange a meeting, though no specific topic for the discussion was identified.\n\nAccording to court documents filed last month, the individual, whose name has been redacted, alleges they experienced 'repeated, negative interactions with Mr. Baldoni'\nThe documents, filed September 4, 2025, were submitted under penalty of perjury.\nThe allegations surfaced just as Lively filed a sweeping new motion seeking attorney's fees, treble damages, and punitive damages against Baldoni's company Wayfarer Studios and its executives.\nIn the 30-page filing in federal court, Lively's lawyers argue that Wayfarer's defamation lawsuit against her was 'baseless from the start' and amounted to a retaliatory attack after she reported harassment and retaliation. \nThe motion accuses the company of attempting to 'damage her credibility and conceal their own unlawful acts' by flooding the public docket with redacted exhibits and character attacks.\nLively's team argues the conduct fits squarely into what California Civil Code Section 47.1 was designed to prevent — retaliatory lawsuits against those who come forward with harassment complaints.\nUnder that statute, Lively is asking the court to impose severe penalties, including treble damages and punitive damages, and to recognize her as the 'prevailing defendant' entitled to recover legal fees.\nThe motion also cites alleged threats made by Sarowitz, who was described as vowing to spend $100 million to ruin the lives of Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds.\nAccording to the filing, Sarowitz allegedly declared at one point: 'I will protect the studio like Israel protected itself from Hamas. There were 39,000 dead bodies. There will be two dead bodies when I'm done. Minimum. Not dead, but \"you’re dead to me.\" So that kind of dead. But dead to a lot of people'/\nSarowitz has yet to publicly respond to the allegations. \n\nA source also claimed to the outlet that the person is 'likely to testify against Justin in Lively's trial; Lively and Baldoni pictured in their 2024 film It Ends with Us \nBaldoni and Lively has been embroiled in a legal battle for months.\nIn December 2024, the actress sued Justin for allegedly sexually harassing her on set — claims he denied - before he and Wayfarer Studios fired back with a defamation suit against Blake, her publicist Leslie Sloane and husband Ryan Reynolds.\nJustin also waged war with The New York Times, filing a $250million lawsuit against the publication over its bombshell tell-all on Lively's sexual harassment claims against her former co-star on December 31, 2024.\nThe New York Times denied the allegations. \nOn June 9, however, it was learned that a judge dismissed Baldoni's lawsuit in a major setback for the actor's hopes for a blockbuster win over the millionaire actress.\nJudge Lewis J Liman dismissed Baldoni's suit alleging defamation and extortion on the basis that all Lively's allegations were made within privileged court papers.\nThe judge said in the order obtained by DailyMail.com: 'The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged.\n\nIn December 2024, the actress sued Justin for allegedly sexually harassing her on set — claims he denied; seen in April 2025\n\n'The Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign.\n'But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.\n'The Wayfarer Parties' additional claims also fail. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.'\nThe judge ruled: 'The Times reviewed the available evidence and reported, perhaps in a dramatized manner, what it believed to have happened. The Times had no obvious motive to favor Lively's version of events.'\nAs mentioned earlier, he dismissed the lawsuit against The New York Times as well. \nBlake LivelyNew York TimesRyan Reynolds\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Baldoni's ex-agent made blistering Blake Lively 'extortion' jab in bombshell deposition transcript\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 15\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ALEX DOYLE - SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:24 BST, 14 October 2025 |Updated:00:47 BST, 14 October 2025 \n\nThe BBC has hit back at Gregg Wallace's £10,000 damages claim after he was sacked from MasterChef earlier this year.\nLast month it was revealed how the presenter was said to have lodged his lawsuit at London's High Court and vowed to 'not go quietly'. \nGregg, 60, was seeking the release of hundreds of pages of secret documents which he believes will help clear his name and earn back millions in lost earnings. \nHowever, the BBC has now hit back at his claim for up to £10,000, as he alleges the broadcaster caused him 'distress and harassment' by not releasing the documents.\nLawyers for the BBC have now filed their defence, claiming their former star presenter is 'entitled to any damages'.\nIn the documents, seen by The Sun, the corporation says Gregg pursed his claim without giving them prior notice.\n\nThe BBC has hit back at Gregg Wallace 's £10,000 damages claim after he was sacked from MasterChef earlier this year\n\nLast month it was revealed how he was said to have lodged his lawsuit at London's High Court and vowed to 'not go quietly'\n\nThe BBC has now it back at his claim for up to £10,000 as he alleges the broadcaster caused him 'distress and harassment' by not releasing the documents\nThe BBC are quoted as saying: 'That voluntary disclosure demonstrates the claimant has no basis to claim damages for distress in respect of the withholding of such information.' \nThe Sun report Gregg's data was finally handed over on October 7, after he initially requested the documents in March.\nMeanwhile, the publication also adds that a source close to the chef says he is preparing to launch a disability claim for damages relating to his undiagnosed autism while working on MasterChef. \nHe previously said nothing was done to investigate his 'neurodiversity' while he was working on MasterChef. \n'My neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef,' he said in a statement. \n'Yet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years. That failure is now being quietly buried.'\nGregg stepped down from the hit BBC cooking show after complaints were made about his behaviour and 45 of those 83 complaints were upheld following a report into his conduct. In total, 41 people complained. \nThe review concluded that the 'majority of the substantiated allegations against Wallace related to inappropriate sexual language and humour'.\n\nThe Sun report Gregg's data was finally handed over on October 7, after he initially requested the documents in March\n\nAustralian-born chef John Torode also lost his job on the show after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he maintains he has 'no recollection' of saying\n\n Disgraced Gregg Wallace is seeking £10,000 from the BBC for 'distress and harassment' \nIt added that 'a smaller number of allegations of other inappropriate language and being in a state of undress were also substantiated', with 'one incident of unwelcome physical contact' also substantiated.\nThe former Eat Well for Less? presenter told The Sun that while he didn't deny being guilty of some of the claims, he believed things had been 'perceived incorrectly'.\nGregg claimed that he had worked with around 4,000 people, meaning that just 0.5 per cent of those he has worked with 'found fault with me'.\nHe said his actions were the result of learned behaviour and workplace culture and claimed that his recent autism diagnosis also played a role.\nAustralian-born chef John Torode also lost his job on the show after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he maintains he has 'no recollection' of saying.\nBBCLondonGregg Wallace\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBBC 'hits back at Gregg Wallace's £10k damages claim' after his sacking from MasterChef following misconduct allegations\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:30 BST, 14 October 2025 |Updated:00:46 BST, 14 October 2025 \n\nSelma Blair revealed she's going to 'live longer than she thought' after her multiple sclerosis went into remission following years of having symptoms dismissed by doctors.\nThe American actress, 53, opened up about her MS as she posed for Flow Space, as she took to the stage at the Women’s Health Summit in Los Angeles.\nSelma has faced decades-long struggle with getting a diagnosis and was finally told she had MS, which is a lifelong condition that affects the brain and nerves, in August 2018 after she finally was told to have a MRI scan of her brain.\nThe Legally Blonde star has now said she is 'going to live longer' after resting and recovering. \nOn finding strength, Selma said: 'I'm going to live longer than I ever thought. Rest and recovery are essential. I find tricks, because I'll show up—no matter what.' \nNow she is in remission, the actress hopes to compete on her horse Mr. Nibbles again, she added: 'My dream is to ride again — even if it's just backyard shows'.\n\nSelma Blair revealed she's going to 'live longer than she thought' after her multiple sclerosis went into remission following years of having symptoms dismissed by doctors\n\nThe American actress, 53, opened up about her diagnosis as she posed for Flow Space, as she took to the stage at the Women’s Health Summit in Los Angeles \nElsewhere the star said her son Arthur, 14, helps her manage her symptoms and keeps her grounded by telling her she is 'embarrassing'. \nDuring the photo shoot, Selma showed off her sensational figure in a plunging strapless green dress before slipping into a figure hugging pink mini dress. \nLast month, Selma opened up about being diagnosed with MS during an appearance on This Morning. \nSpeaking of her early symptoms, Selma said: 'I had symptoms since as young as I can remember, with my eye sight and we just never really diagnosed it.\n'It could be painful in the eye, pressure in the eye, the eye nerve gets quite inflamed, but with relapsing MS it can also go away, so it can be tricky for doctors especially when you're young and quite capable.\n'I'd do neurological tests at the doctors, and I could do all that - so there were things that were missed, but I had chronic headache, chronic fever, I had a dropped leg, I developed tics sometimes, which was when I would actually be in a flare as a child.\n'I did spend my entire life with doctors really trying to figure out why I was so tired, but it was just misdiagnosed as depression, because extreme fatigue can seem like depression.\n'I kind of went that way and figured, \"I guess it's all in my head\", it was confusing.'\n\nSelma has faced decades-long struggle with getting a diagnosis and was finally told she had MS, which is a lifelong condition that affects the brain and nerves, in August 2018 after she finally was told to have a MRI scan of her brain\n\nThe Legally Blonde star has now said she is 'going to live longer' after resting and recovering\n\nOn finding strength, Selma said: 'I'm going to live longer than I ever thought. Rest and recovery are essential. I find tricks, because I'll show up—no matter what'\nShe went on to explain how things got progressively worse: 'My skin had fallen apart, my body and the fatigue. I'd be riding my horse and get whiplash because I wasn't strong enough to carry myself.\n'I'd go to the doctor quite often and say, \"I can't stay awake\" and they'd say, \"Well, what mother can?\"'\nWhile pregnant, Selma revealed that her symptoms had subsided before she then welcomed her son Arthur in 2011, which saw things take a turn for the worse.\nShe continued: 'I felt great, and I didn't know, I wasn't diagnosed with MS yet and I didn't know that often there are times it can go into remission.\n'I felt amazing - until I gave birth and then it was, everything hit the fan and I didn't know what it was, I couldn't walk it was just too painful.\n'The doctor said, \"This happens to a lot of women\"... so it was missed and just described as extreme postpartum because I had trouble staying awake.'\nIt wasn't until Selma took to social media with a scan of her spine that she finally started to get answers, when she was referred to a specialist by a friend.\nSelma explained: 'I was searching on social media asking if anyone had a doctor - and I put a plea out on my social media.\n'I did for the first time see a spinal neurologists and he looked at my MRI and he said, \"Yes, you're getting older but it shouldn't be this severe that your leg is dragging\".\n'He said that something was wrong... I got an MRI for the first time that night even though I'd begged for one my whole life. I had CAT scans and other things, but never an MRI.\n\nNow she is in remission, the actress hopes to compete on her horse Mr. Nibbles again, she added: 'My dream is to ride again — even if it's just backyard shows'\n\nDuring the photo shoot, Selma showed off her sensational figure in a plunging strapless green dress before slipping into a trendy black blouse and white mini skirt\n\n Doctors told me I was depressed and my symptoms were in my head - the truth was far more devastating \n'It immediately showed and he said, \"You must've had this for 20 years\". It was amazing to get it, a bit in shock, but really amazed.'\nLuckily for Selma, she hasn't seen a flare up of her symptoms in some time.\nShe added of her recovery: 'I am really lucky, I'm relapse-free now for a couple of years, and I've made so many gains.'\nIt comes after the actress was honoured with the CineHealth Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating her enduring contributions to film, television, fashion and disability advocacy, all while navigating her battle with MS.\nThe honor, presented at this year's CineHealth Festival in Philadelphia, recognizes individuals who create media that educates, empowers and inspires those facing health challenges.\nThe Cruel Intentions star arrived to the event by helicopter with her loyal service dog, Scout, at her side, before heading straight to the stage.\nBest known for her roles in Legally Blonde, The Sweetest Thing and Hellboy, Blair has also become a trailblazer for disability representation since publicly sharing her MS diagnosis in 2018.\n\nWHAT IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS?\n\nMultiple sclerosis (known as MS) is a condition in which the immune system attacks the body and causes nerve damage to the brain and spinal cord.\nIt is an incurable, lifelong condition. Symptoms can be mild in some, and in others more extreme causing severe disability.\nMS affects 2.3 million people worldwide - including around one million in the US, and 100,000 in the UK.\nIt is more than twice as common in women as it is in men. A person is usually diagnosed in their 20s and 30s.\nThe condition is more commonly diagnosed in people of European ancestry. \nThe cause isn't clear. There may be genes associated with it, but it is not directly hereditary. Smoking and low vitamin D levels are also linked to MS. \nSymptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and problems with thinking, learning and planning.\nThe majority of sufferers will have episodes of symptoms which go away and come back, while some have ones which get gradually worse over time.\nSymptoms can be managed with medication and therapy.\nThe condition shortens the average life expectancy by around five to 10 years. \nThis MorningLos AngelesSelma Blair\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSelma Blair admits she's going to 'live longer than she thought' after her MS went into remission following years of having symptoms dismissed by doctors as she poses for stunning shoot with Flow Space\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Trump just invited Keir Starmer to the stage, letting him think he was inviting him to speak, only to spurn him and send him to the back! I love it!' \n\nAnother added: 'It was epic how Trump embarrassed Keir Starmer on the world stage... Trump never forgets... EPIC!' \n\nA third penned: 'Trump embarrassed you on stage Keir.' \n\nIn the video, Trump finishes his list of countries, before asking: 'Where is United Kingdom, where is my friend, Starmer?'\n\nThe Prime Minister replied: 'I am right behind you as usual.'\n\nThe President then invited Sir Keir to the stage, saying: 'Come up here, is everything going good?' Starmer awkwardly replied, 'very good' as he turned toward the microphone. \n\nThe US leader then stepped in front of Starmer and continued his speech. He said: 'It is very nice that you are here. These people all came on like 20-minute notice and I think it is fantastic.' \n\nSir Keir looked around awkwardly before slowly scuttling back to his place on the stage, sharing a faint smile with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe embarrassing move came just moments after the US President admonished leaders, saying: 'I have known so many of you for so long. You're friends of mine, you great people. \n\n'I have a couple I don't like in particular but I won't tell you who. I have a few actually I don't like at all but you will never find out who they are. Maybe you will.'\n\nBut despite the humiliation, Sir Keir later praised the US President for his work at securing a peace deal and said the UK can play a role in decommissioning Hamas's weaponry as well as monitoring the ceasefire.\n\nSpeaking after the summit, the Prime Minister said: 'Today is a really historic day, so we do need to start there, and real credit to President Trump and the other leaders who got us to this place.\n\n'But you're absolutely right. The challenge now is tomorrow and implementation. And therefore yesterday is historic, but what happens tomorrow really matters.\n\n'And that's why what I've been discussing with leaders all day is what part can we play, and we, the United Kingdom in particular can play a part in monitoring the ceasefire, but also decommissioning the capability of Hamas and their weaponry, drawing on our experience in Northern Ireland.\n\n'So the question today has already moved to how do we implement, how do we make sure this moves forward, and it's really important that we keep that focus. We mustn't have any missteps now.'\n\nThe PM has been accused of piggybacking on Mr Trump's Gaza breakthrough.\n\nHe hailed the 'tireless diplomatic efforts' of Mr Trump on Monday morning, crediting him with securing the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nBut Sir Keir was accused of only travelling to Egypt for a 'photo op' after risking derailing the process by recognising Palestine as a state last month.\n\nTories compared the PM to former Chelsea footballer John Terry, who changed into full kit to lift the Champions League trophy despite not playing in the final. \n\nThe Trump administration's Middle East envoy earlier tried to cool tensions after the US ambassador to Israel branded a Cabinet minister 'delusional' for suggesting the UK played a 'key role'.\n\nStarmer was also challenged on Tony Blair's role on the Gaza peace board, stating it's 'for others to decide' if he forms part of Gaza's new governing.\n\nA peace plan floated by the White House last month listed Sir Tony as a member of the proposed board.\n\nStarmer said: 'I think the makeup of the peace board is still being discussed. For my part, I have to say, I'm much more interested in the practical steps.'\n\nPushed on the question about whether Blair should be involved, Starmer replied: 'That's for others to decide. Tony Blair was a great leader of our country, and would make a huge contribution.\n\n'But I'm not focused on which particular people sit on which particular board. I'm focused on what do we need to do tomorrow, and I mean tomorrow, to make sure this is implemented.'\n\nThe PM added that there are 'discussions going on' about who will be on the board - but he said he has not put himself forward.\n\nSteve Witkoff praised Britain's 'vital role' - singling out under-fire national security adviser Jonathan Powell for his 'incredible input'.\n\nThe Sharm el-Sheikh summit, co-hosted by Mr Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, comes as part of efforts to secure the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has been holding since Friday.\n\nIsrael said just after 6am that Hamas had released the first seven hostages into the custody of the Red Cross.\n\nIn a statement, Sir Keir said: 'I share the deep feeling of relief as Avinatan Or and other hostages are released today. But this is also a stark reminder of the treatment that he has been subject to at the hands of Hamas, and the atrocities that shook the world two years ago.\n\n'Having met his family, I know that no one can truly understand the torture and agony they suffered for two drawn out years and my thoughts are with them. My thoughts are also with the family of Yossi Sharabi, who are still waiting for news.\n\n'I reiterate my thanks for the tireless diplomatic efforts of the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Türkiye. It is now crucial that we work together to implement President Trump's peace plan for Gaza, and that will be my focus in Egypt today.\n\n'Commitment to this plan from all parties will be essential to ending the war and building the foundations for a sustainable path to a long-term peace. The UK will support the crucial next stage of talks to ensure the implementation of the peace plan.'\n\nIn TV interviews yesterday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the UK played a 'key role' in securing the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHowever, the US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said she was 'delusional', and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, bluntly rejected the claim.\n\nMr Witkoff posted on X this morning: 'I would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel.\n\n'In particular, I want to recognize the incredible input and tireless efforts of National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell.'\n\nIt is understood Mr Powell has been speaking to Mr Witkoff almost daily. \n\nSir Keir is understood to want to draw on the Northern Ireland peace process - which Mr Powell worked on as chief of staff to Sir Tony Blair in No10 - in talks on 'decommissioning' Hamas.\n\nAhead of the Egyptian summit, Mr Trump travelled to Israel to meet with hostage families and address the parliament there.\n\nHe said before his departure that many in both Israel and Arab countries were 'cheering' the agreement and that 'everybody's amazed and they're thrilled and we're going to have an amazing time'.\n\nSpeaking to reporters while in the air, Mr Trump deemed the conflict 'over', adding: 'I think people are tired of it.'\n\nHe also said he hoped to one day visit Gaza, telling travelling reporters: 'I'd like to put my feet on it, at least.'\n\nSir Keir was due to urge those at the Sharm El Sheikh summit to build on the momentum to bring about the second phase of plans to end the conflict.\n\nHe was expected to heap praise on Mr Trump and the diplomatic efforts of the other negotiators, as well as commit the UK to playing a key role in rebuilding Gaza.","summary":"The UK Prime Minister was lined up behind the US President as he spoke to the world's media in Egypt, taking time to praise leaders for their involvement in peace deals.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15189285/Sir-Keir-Starmer-mocked-Trump-world-stage-Egypt-thought-invited-speak.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/13/20/102953003-0-image-m-18_1760384251277.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/13/2612121956757228710/1024x576_MP4_2612121956757228710.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-13 23:46:04","author":"Editor,Katherine Lawton,Tom Lawrence","authors":["Editor","Katherine Lawton","Tom Lawrence"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.051},{"id":368967120,"title":"Witkoff family to host fundraiser for Nate Morris, Ramaswamy to speak","text":"The event comes as the three Republican candidates running to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in 2026 have ostensibly vied for a coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump since the launch of their respective campaigns. The three candidates — front-runner and former Kentucky Attorney General David Cameron, Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) and Morris — each have ties to McConnell but have distanced themselves from the retiring Kentucky GOP titan, who has frequently been in Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nMorris, a former intern of McConnell, said he is running for Senate to ensure Kentuckians “don’t have another Mitch McConnell puppet sabotaging the Trump agenda,” according to his website. In distancing himself from the second-longest serving senator and campaigning as a political outsider, Morris earned the endorsements of Ramaswamy, the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and Sens. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) and Jim Banks (R-IN).\n\nMorris, who first announced his run on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast, now has the support of the Witkoff name behind him with this event. The fundraiser will be held at the Witkoff Family Farm in Lexington at around 6 p.m. on Thursday. Tickets cost $500 per person, $250 for young professionals, and between $2,500-$3,500 to be listed as a host.\n\nThe flyer lists Ramaswamy as a special guest and lists over 60 people as co-hosts. The hosts include several national conservative advocates, businesspeople, and former Bush administration officials, according to the Lexington-Herald Leader. Republican Chris LaCivita Jr., the son of Trump’s former presidential campaign adviser, is also a host of the event.\n\nMorris has consistently polled far behind the other two main Republican candidates in the race, Cameron and Barr. The limited polling at this point in the race has shown Cameron typically leading by double digits, with Barr slightly behind and Morris trailing in the single digits.\n\nA September poll tied to the pro-Barr Keep America Great PAC listed Cameron in the lead with support from 37% of likely Kentucky Republican voters, Barr at 29%, and Morris at 8%. An October poll commissioned by the Cameron campaign showed Cameron at 39%, Barr at 22%, and Morris at 8%.\n\nTrump hasn’t made any moves to endorse any candidates in the race to fill McConnell’s seat, though he has weighed in on other 2026 primary races, swiftly backing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) in the Florida gubernatorial election. \n\nRamaswamy is running as the Trump-backed candidate in Ohio’s 2026 governor race. Ramaswamy has also stumped for Virginia’s GOP gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has yet to receive a full-fledged Trump endorsement in her 2025 contest against former Rep.

Around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel as well.\n\nWhat To Know \n\nIn statements on X, the New York City mayoral candidates shared their views on the historic moment.\n\nMamdani said, “Today’s scenes of Israelis and Palestinians are profoundly moving: Israeli hostages being freed and families reunited after years of fear, uncertainty, and torture; the first days in Gaza without relentless Israeli bombardment of Palestinians as families return to rubble and loved ones freed from detention. There is finally a glimmer of hope that this ceasefire will hold and the long difficult work of reconstruction can begin. I also know this news brings solace to millions of New Yorkers, who’ve felt the pain of the past few years.”\n\nThe New York state assemblyman continued: “We have watched as our tax dollars have funded a genocide. The moral and human cost will be a lasting stain and requires accountability and real examination of our collective conscience and our government’s policies. The responsibility now lies with those of us who believe in peace to make sure it endures, and that it is just. Once aid is delivered, the wounded are cared for, and a lasting agreement secured, we cannot look away. We must work towards a future built upon justice, one without occupation and apartheid, and for a world where every person can live with safety and dignity.”\n\nMamdani has seemingly defended the phrase “globalize Intifada” in the past as “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.” He has also called antisemitism a “real issue” in New York City and said Hamas’ attack in Israel on October 7, 2023, was a “war crime.”\n\nNew York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks with the press as he walks toward a news conference on October 8 in the city.

Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nCuomo also reacted to the hostage releases on Monday, saying on X, “For 2 long years, families have lived through unimaginable pain, sleepless nights, and endless heartache. Today, their prayers have been answered, as the remaining hostages are finally home in the arms of their loved ones, where they belong.”\n\n“This is more than a diplomatic success; it is a moral moment, a reminder of our shared humanity and the sacred value of every life. We must never forget the terrorist act that brought us here, and we must stand together to say, with one voice: never forget and never again,” New York’s former governor continued. “Terrorism has no place in Gaza, in the Middle East, or anywhere in the world. Elie Wiesel once said, ‘The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.’ Today, we reject indifference & choose remembrance. And we choose hope: hope that peace is possible.”\n\nIn a recent poll by Quinnipiac University, Cuomo’s strongest support comes from Jewish voters in New York City.\n\nSliwa also reacted on X, saying on Monday, “After two long years, all the living hostages are now safely home! A massive weight has been lifted from their families’ shoulders. Peace is always the ultimate goal, and finally, an end to the war is something we all should celebrate. The 20 surviving hostages are reunited by families and loved ones after 738 agonizing days in captivity. 7+3+8 = 18, which means Chai, which means “life” in Judaism. A number that embodies life, hope, and blessing. We pray that these hostages coming home can recover, and live peacefully again. We are proud of President Trump and all involved for making this peace deal happen.”\n\nThe New York City mayoral race is commanding national attention, with major policy, demographic and ideological shifts at stake for America’s most populous city. Mamdani’s campaign, if successful, would make him the city’s first Muslim mayor—a historic milestone discussed in the context of broader debates over policing, affordability and response to Trump’s policies.\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nVice President JD Vance, on X Monday: “Today marks a truly historic achievement in President Trump’s mission for peace.

The letter, which was sent in the days following the Sept. 10 slaying of Charlie Kirk, another conservative media personality and friend of Johnson’s, alluded to various violent and deadly acts its author would “love to see,” though the letter’s author did not threaten to personally carry out those acts.\n\n“Don’t worry-won’t be me-I’m not giving up my freedoms for worm (expletive) like you,” the author wrote.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called Isbell a “coward hiding behind a keyboard” in a statement and said his arrest “will serve as a reminder to many — do not do this, we will find you and bring you to justice.”\n\nIn a search warrant affidavit for Isbell’s San Diego home, an FBI agent wrote that a federal criminal complaint was filed against him on Oct. 3 in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and a judge issued a warrant for his arrest that same day.\n\nAfter FBI agents spent two days surveilling Isbell at his home, a San Diego police officer arrested him on the warrant during an Oct. 7 traffic stop. He allegedly admitted in a post-arrest interview with the FBI that he mailed the letter to Johnson. He also allegedly gave investigators permission to enter his home and seize a .357 Magnum handgun that he said he kept for protection, but which he said did not have bullets.\n\nIsbell is expected to be charged with one count of mailing threatening communications, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. As of Monday, the Florida case referenced in the warrant remained sealed.\n\nAccording to that same search warrant, the FBI is also investigating Isbell for potentially threatening emails he allegedly sent in February 2021 to Republican state lawmakers in Louisiana after they censured one of their state’s Republican senators for voting to convict President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial.\n\nAccording to the warrant, Louisiana State Police launched an investigation in 2021 that identified Isbell as the sender of the email. In a footnote of the warrant, the FBI agent wrote that investigators are now working to determine if Isbell “sent any other threatening email communications that may qualify as a ‘true threat’” under federal law.","summary":"The letter sent to Benny Johnson referenced Charlie Kirk's killing, according to a search warrant.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/10/13/san-diego-man-arrested-on-allegation-of-sending-threatening-letter-to-conservative-influencer/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sut-l-mail-threats.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 23:40:59","author":"Alex Riggins","authors":["Alex Riggins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.185}]}
