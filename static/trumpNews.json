He made the statement while speaking to reporters on Air Force One during the journey to Japan on Monday, October 27, 2025.Trump said, \"I’d love to meet with him if he’d like to meet. I got along great with Kim Jong Un. I liked him. He liked me,\" as reported by The Hill.Trump added that he is willing to extend his travel time to make the meeting happen. According to the Korea JoongAng Daily, Trump said, \"I haven’t mentioned it, I haven’t said anything, but I’d love to meet with him if he’d like to meet.\"Longstanding US-North Korea RelationshipTrump's statement came after a similar expression he made last Friday. At that time, he said he was open to meeting Kim if he received prior contact.\"The last time I met him, I put it out over the internet that I’m coming to South Korea and if he’d like to meet, I’m open to it. I’d do it,\" said Trump.He then joked, \"They don’t have a lot of telephone service. They have a lot of nuclear weapons but not a lot of telephone service. I’m open to it.\" Trump also implied that Kim may have known his travel schedule.\"He probably knows I’m coming, right? Yeah, I’d be open to it, 100 percent. I got along very well with Kim Jong Un,\" he added.The last meeting between Trump and Kim took place in 2019, during the early period of Trump's presidency. At that time, he sought to persuade Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear program. However, since that meeting, North Korea has resumed a series of intercontinental ballistic missile tests.Discussion on North Korea SanctionsTrump also mentioned the possibility of discussing sanctions against North Korea to encourage dialogue. \"We have sanctions, and they are big enough to start,\" he said.As for the United States' sanctions against North Korea, they consist of a series of economic, financial, and diplomatic restrictions aimed at pressuring the Pyongyang regime to stop its nuclear and missile programs.These sanctions have been in place since the Korean War (1950s) and have been expanded over time.Trump began his Asia tour in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Sunday to Monday to attend the ASEAN Summit. He then departed for Japan and South Korea. In Korea, Trump is scheduled to attend the APEC Summit in Gyeongju and hold bilateral meetings with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Editor's Choice: Trump Meets Families of Japanese Victims of North Korean AbductionsClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"President of the United States Donald Trump expressed his willingness to meet with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to Asia this week.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2061168/trump-says-he-wants-to-meet-kim-jong-un-during-asia-tour","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/10/26/id_1437179/1437179_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 00:42:28","author":"Adinda Jasmine","authors":["Adinda Jasmine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":373534476,"title":"Israel strikes Gaza after accusing Hamas of violating U.S.-brokered ceasefire","text":"JERUSALEM/CAIRO - Israeli planes launched strikes in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after Israel accused the militant group Hamas of violating a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, the latest test of a fragile deal brokered earlier this month by U.S. President Donald Trump.Local health authorities said the strikes killed at least 26 people, including five in a house hit in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, four in a building in Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood, and five in a car in Khan Younis.

Yet, Malaysian politicians like Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim cling to a fading “China Dreams” vision, overlooking Beijing’s decline.Hassan and MCA, it’s time to support US-led efforts as the China Dream is over! Malaysia must align with this for peace, stability, and prosperity. It’s time to wake up to this new reality.Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul KarimHassan’s alleged “RM1 trillion surrender” is also misleading and ignores reality. It’s not a surrender but a 15-year phased procurement (about RM66 billion per year) for Boeing, LNG, tech, matching Malaysia’s own needs, and securing tariff cuts.This isn’t surrender, it’s smart leverage. It’s a matter of time before the whole of Asean will pivot towards the US.RedFalcon7124: US President Donald Trump’s policies on trade are based on “Make America Great Again” (MAGA).All trading nations are facing tough negotiations with Trump. Either you accept his terms or be prepared for punishing tariffs.The US is using its economic might to force its terms on other nations, even their allies in Europe, the Far East, Canada, and the Middle East.The US is on a mission to correct unfair terms that have resulted in massive debts. Even Israel is affected.US President Donald TrumpGoks: Well, for starters, these folks can read the previously mentioned details: Purchasing Boeing planes – not new, already part of Malaysia Airlines’ plans.We are growing into having one of the biggest data centre capacities in the region. Which country supplies servers and chips for data centres? Well, the US, so nothing new.Maybe our politicians need to read more.Malayan Boey @ Goks: Why are we buying Boeing instead of the more modern and cheaper Comac C919?Data centre equipment may be sourced from many countries. Why US-made ones with likely embedded backdoor access?Kunta kinte: Americans term this kind of person a “Monday morning quarterback”. Love to criticise after the fact.Didn’t hear any suggestions before the deal was signed.Oh, I forgot. Machang MP Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal, you are busy trying to dethrone your boss.BlueCougar1744: Since when does Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim need to seek advice from PKR and MCA leaders before making trade deals with other nations?The economy is fluid, and it always has a tendency to flow from one level to another.On the surface, it looks like Malaysia gave a lot in exchange for “peanuts”. I doubt this is the case. Let’s see how all these translate into a win-win situation for both.MS: As Trump (who’s angling for an unprecedented third term) would say, nothing is cast in stone – nothing is sacred... not rules, not commandments, and certainly not treaties or trade agreements.We must remember that things may change in the US.Forecasts for the midterms already indicate a pushback given rising costs hitting average Americans – a fact which explains the unexpected rise of Zohran Mamdani in New York and the seven million plus people who took to the streets the other day.So even if it seems unlikely right now, the Democrats may stage a comeback if they get their act together or if the excesses of Trump and his mob prove to be simply too much for even the Republicans.Which really means that whatever has been “committed” for the next 15 years may really not materialise after a regime change and a purge of everything Trump represents.Milshah: To ensure that this is not a one-sided agreement that benefits only the US, and that we are not bullied in any way by the US, I agree to have this issue debated in Parliament.The government should not see this as being critical just for the sake of being critical, but rather use the debate to defend its position on why this agreement is beneficial to Malaysia, and will not be detrimental to its economy, and to Malaysian ties with countries like China, Russia, India, and others.Always ensure that we are not “colonised” again by the major powers and that Malaysia is independent, acting based on its best interests.TheSaint: Anwar must present a comprehensive explanation on the trade deal, especially on those articles which are raising eyebrows.Obviously, in any deal, there will be trade-offs, but as a developing nation, the net benefits must be in our favour.Tall Story: The financial obligations of these trade agreements go into over a trillion and with huge implications to the economic functioning of the country for years to come.It must not be just a one-man or cabinet decision! The speaker must allow it to be debated so that the people to hear it out for themselves what this government is getting our country into.The above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.

This is the instrument used for maintaining the orientation and direction of aircraft and other moving objects.\n\nThe Americans have a saying for describing this. They say he (or she) doesn’t know if he/she is coming or going. This is a very precise way of describing economic management these days, including that of America.\n\nThis is the first time in modern history that this has happened when several countries have not been at war with each other, like they were during the two world wars in the early and middle twentieth century.\n\nThe most damaging consequence of the absent gyro is the blurring of the difference between risk and uncertainty. In a word, risk can be managed but uncertainty by definition can’t.\n\nFor example, there is risk when you drive and you can manage that risk by driving slowly and following all the rules but what do you do if someone suddenly runs across your car? That’s what uncertainty is, and it can’t be managed.\n\nThe problem, be it agriculture where weather is the inducer of uncertainty or finance where arbitrary regulation is the problem or whatever else, it’s exogeneity that causes uncertainty. Donald Trump is exactly that.\n\nThe Indian policy experience of the last 80 years should have left an enormous amount of institutional memory of how to handle exogenous uncertainty. A central feature of this is slowing down everything, which is what the Modi government has been doing.\n\nThe bigger problem\n\nHowever, our experience also shows that once the political pressure on the bureaucracy to perform eases, it slows things down way more than is necessary and even halts things. Its logic is that if you stop or go at just 10 kilometres an hour, uncertainty and risk become irrelevant.\n\nI think this is what has happened since April. Indian policy making is taking a break, which is fine. But how long will the break be? This is where the record is so worrying.\n\nWe have had several exogenous shocks since 1947. The majority of these happened in the 1960s which saw a disastrous war with China in 1962, one small and one big war with Pakistan in 1965, two back to back droughts in 1965 and 1966 and the Congress party split in 1969. That’s five in ten years.\n\nThis was followed by the breakup of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 when the fixed exchange rate system was abandoned by America, the first oil shock of 1973 and the second of 1979. That’s three in ten years.\n\nThe 1980s were blissfully free of exogenous shocks but the 1990s opened with one in 1991 when India nearly ran out of foreign currency to pay for imports. But that was the last big one till Trump came along. However, there were two small ones towards the end of the 1990s: the Asian crisis of 1997-99 and the post-Pokhran 2 sanctions imposed on us in 1998. That’s also three in ten years.\n\nSo adding up, we have had 11 exogenous shocks in 78 years. On average that’s one every seven years. No other comparable country has had this problem.\n\nThe response\n\nSo how have the governments responded? On each and every occasion, the first — and long lasting — response has been to slow the economy down as a way of tackling uncertainty. You can look up the post shock growth rates of the past.\n\nThis is completely understandable. What is not understandable is the length of time that the policy minders have persisted with the slow driving. I know for a fact that the political leadership has chafed and complained, to no avail. The bureaucrats, having increased their control, have resisted the political class.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that it’s going to be different this time. The Trump shocks have caused so much uncertainty that the bureaucracy will play up the risks in a way that leaves the political leadership with no choice but to go along with policies that postpone reforms that cut into its importance and power.\n\nIn other words, the exogenous shock has always been followed by an endogenous one from the senior bureaucracy. It’s like the aftershocks after an earthquake.\n\nThe challenge before the Modi government is to overrule the civil servants after consulting others. The only prime minister to do so was Rajiv Gandhi when he decided to go for growth despite the bureaucracy’s efforts to stick to plodding along.\n\nThe popular myth is that Rajiv’s policies caused the balance of payments crisis of 1991. They might have contributed but the role of the bureaucracy in what happened mustn’t be airbrushed away. Economic historians need to look into this.\n\nPublished on October 29, 2025","summary":"In the wake of the Trump shocks, the bureaucracy will typically play up the risks and persuade the political leadership to shelve reforms","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/strange-way-of-dealing-with-uncertainty/article70213738.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9xq3tw/article70213732.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/BL29_Think_volatility_2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 00:30:00","author":"Tca Srinivasa Raghavan","authors":["Tca Srinivasa Raghavan"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":373533742,"title":"Married At First Sight viewers brand Grace a 'red flag' as her relationship with Ashley continues down a toxic path: 'He needs to run ASAP!'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nStrictly Come Dancing\n\nBig Brother\n\nGreat British Bake Off\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarried At First Sight viewers brand Grace a 'red flag' as her relationship with Ashley continues down a toxic path: 'He needs to run ASAP!'\n\nHave YOU got a story?

On Tuesday, he spent the day with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with defense and economic security featuring heavily in their talks. Trump is scheduled to fly on to South Korea on Wednesday, where he is likely to sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the APEC forum.\n\nFollow Trump's stay in Japan with Nikkei Asia.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nHere are the latest updates (Tokyo time):\n\nWednesday, October 29\n\n9:00 a.m. Footage shows Air Force One on the tarmac, waiting to whisk Trump to South Korea. He's due to leave a little later this morning.\n\nTuesday, October 28\n\n9:30 p.m. On the menu for Trump's dinner at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence: black tiger shrimp, fresh crab and shrimp salad, and Japanese wagyu beef.\n\n9:00 p.m. Earlier, Trump met with Akie Abe, widow of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She said in an X post in Japanese that the president \"still holds my husband in high regard and offered me warm words as well.\" She also thanked Trump \"for taking the time despite your busy schedule.\"\n\nDuring this visit, Shinzo Abe's has come up repeatedly from both Trump and Takaichi. Coincidentally, the man indicted for shooting Abe dead in 2022 admitted guilt as his trial opened on Tuesday.\n\n8:00 p.m. Trump spends the evening with Japanese and American business leaders, from SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son and Hitachi CEO Toshiaki Tokunaga to Apple chief Tim Cook. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other officials are also on hand. Numerous deals of various types and varying degrees of specificity have been signed, such as one between the Commerce Department and Hitachi, which seeks to \"advance energy security, resilience and technological leadership.\"\n\n6:00 p.m. Among the documents signed by the U.S. and Japan during Trump's visit is a memorandum of cooperation on technology. A document released by the White House resolves to \"strengthen collaboration towards joint opportunities of mutual interest in strategic science and technology disciplines.\" It lays out priority areas such as AI, advanced mobile networks, biotechnology, fusion energy and space exploration.\n\nAs his full day of events with Takaichi winds down, Trump is due to attend a dinner with business leaders.\n\n4:47 p.m. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told new Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama that \"sound monetary policy formulation\" is crucial for controlling inflation and preventing exchange rate volatility, according to a newly released readout of their meeting on Monday. Bessent said conditions today are different than they were during the era of Abenomics, amid Washington's concerns about the yen's weakness against the dollar.\n\n4:24 p.m. Military personnel, who have been on their feet for quite a while, raise their phones to capture the moment as Trump enters the hangar to speak to them. He's wearing a white hat with a blue \"USA\" on the front. Flanked by fighter jets and against a large backdrop that reads \"Peace through strength,\" Trump tells the audience that they are \"winners.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be here among thousands of American patriots,\" Trump says. Touting his administration's performance in its first 10 months, he says, \"Now we're the most respected country in the world.\"\n\nHe vows not to be \"politically correct\" and to \"defend our country any way we have to.\" He also gives a shout-out to America's \"incredible Japanese partners\" and Takaichi, who joins him at the podium. He says the two of them have become good friends. As he has several times, he praises her for becoming the country's first female prime minister.\n\n\"Thank you Mr. President, and thank you all,\" Takaichi says in English, before switching to Japanese. She calls the USS George Washington a symbol of protecting peace.\n\n\"Now, as the two commanders in chief of Japan and the United States stand together once again, I have renewed my determination to carry forward that resolve and to make the Indo-Pacific free and open, so that it will serve as the foundation of peace and prosperity for the entire region,\" she says.\n\nAfter her speech, Trump applauds Takaichi while mentioning that she can be a \"tough\" negotiator.\n\n3:50 p.m. Trump and Takaichi arrive at Yokosuka by helicopter, touching down before a crowd of waiting photographers on the deck of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, where fighter jets including state-of-the-art F-35s are parked. The president salutes U.S. military personnel as the beaming Japanese prime minister walks alongside him.\n\n3:15 p.m. Japan's new Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is in Yokosuka, awaiting the arrival of Trump and Takaichi. Television footage showed the two leaders en route on Marine One, the president's helicopter.\n\n2:45 p.m. Trump and Takaichi's working lunch featured American beef and rice, \"deliciously made with Japanese ingredients,\" according to a White House readout. A menu photo shared by U.S. Ambassador to Japan George Glass shows ingredients from Takaichi's home prefecture of Nara, with vanilla ice cream -- a known Trump favorite.\n\nThe rice is particularly symbolic, as it has been a key issue in bilateral trade talks this year.\n\nOver the meal, Takaichi showed Trump a map of major Japanese investments in the U.S. Other topics of discussion included ending the Russia-Ukraine war, the White House says.\n\n\"The president signed the lunch menus for the prime minister and the entire Japanese delegation, much to their delight!\" the statement says.\n\n2:25 p.m. Aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, American military personnel have gathered in anticipation of Trump's arrival. The president is due to fly to the vessel, at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, by helicopter with Takaichi.\n\n1:50 p.m. Sakie Yokota, 89, whose daughter Megumi was abducted by North Korea in 1977 at the age of 13, expressed thanks to Trump after meeting him with other families involved in similar cases.\n\nHer remarks: \"We gathered today here with a heartfelt prayer that Mr. Trump would speak so well that Kim Jong Un himself would be convinced and respond with a sense of acceptance. I truly believe something positive will happen.\"\n\n1:20 p.m. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has arrived in Japan, according to the Pentagon. The defense chief, or secretary of war as the administration now calls his role, is due to meet newly appointed Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi on Wednesday.\n\n12:30 p.m. Earlier this morning, Takaichi said she and Trump had \"really enjoyed\" watching the start of the World Series game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays. Despite their packed schedule, they might be tempted to sneak another peek: The game was knotted at 5 heading into the ninth inning, after Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani tied it up with his second home run of the night.\n\n12:10 p.m. Trump has met with families of Japanese victims abducted by North Korea, alongside Takaichi. The president assured them that he \"has not forgotten\" the issue and promised to do what he can to solve it. This would appear to be a win for Takaichi, as there had been word that Trump would not meet the families, having Secretary of State Marco Rubio do so in his stead.\n\nThe Japanese government officially lists 17 citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Although some returned, others remain missing.\n\nTrump has expressed a desire to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, potentially when he visits South Korea later this week. The two met three times during Trump's first presidency.\n\n12:00 p.m. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says Takaichi will nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. This adds a major endorsement to the list of countries that have backed the U.S. president for the honor, including Pakistan and Cambodia. This year's prize, announced earlier this month, went to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\n11:25 a.m. On X, the White House posts a photo from the summit showing signed hats emblazoned with the words \"Japan is back.\"\n\nMargo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications adviser, also posts a video of Takaichi presenting Trump with gifts. She says the president received a golf bag signed by Japanese star Hideki Matsuyama as well as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's putter. Trump and Abe had famously bonded on the links during the president's first term.\n\n11:10 a.m. Trump and Takaichi have signed a pact to cooperate on securing rare-earth minerals. A release from the White House says the partners \"are intensifying their cooperative efforts to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals and rare earths necessary to support domestic industries,\" by leveraging \"policy tools\" such as financial support mechanisms, trade measures and stockpiling.\n\nRare earths are used in a wide range of advanced technologies, from electric cars to weapons. The supply chain is dominated by China, and Beijing recently sent a shock through global industries by announcing broad new export controls on the minerals and related items.\n\nThe Japan-U.S. pact calls for mobilizing government and private sector support for investments in mining and processing, among other initiatives.\n\nThe two leaders also signed a document saying they have instructed \"relevant ministers and secretaries to take further steps for a NEW GOLDEN AGE of the ever-growing U.S.-Japan Alliance.\"\n\n10:20 a.m. Trump tells Takaichi that her late predecessor, Shinzo Abe, was a \"great friend\" and that he was shocked by his assassination in 2022. He says Abe \"spoke so well\" of Takaichi and congratulates her on becoming prime minister.\n\nTurning to business, Trump refers to Takaichi's drive to increase Japan's defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product this fiscal year.\n\n\"I know that you are increasing your military capacity, very substantially, and we've received your orders for a very large amount of new military equipment, and you know that we make the best military equipment in the world -- the jets, the missiles, and everything else,\" he says. \"Hopefully we don't have to use them very much, if at all, but we appreciate that order and we very much appreciate the trade.\"\n\nHe says Japan and the U.S. will have a \"very fair deal.\"\n\nTrump pledges to be there for Japan \"any time you have any question, any doubt, anything you want, any favors you need, anything I can do to help.\"\n\nHe adds that he thinks Takaichi \"will be one of the great prime ministers\" and emphasizes that she is the first woman in the role. \"That's a big deal,\" he says. \"I want to congratulate you on that.\"\n\n10:15 a.m. Upon sitting down with Trump, Takaichi thanks him for his \"enduring friendship\" with late former Prime Minister Abe.\n\nShe says Abe had told her about Trump's \"dynamic diplomacy.\" She goes on to note Trump's role as a peacemaker between Thailand and Cambodia, and in the Middle East. \"I highly value your unwavering commitment to world peace and stability. I myself was so impressed and inspired by you, Mr. President,\" she says.\n\n\"Now, both Japan and the United States have developed the greatest alliance in the world. And together with you, Japan is ready to contribute to the world's peace and stability,\" Takaichi says.\n\n9:35 a.m. Trump meets Takaichi at the State Guest House in central Tokyo. They shake hands and chat for a moment, before heading for the customary photo in front of American and Japanese flags. A short ceremony follows to welcome the U.S. president.\n\n9:00 a.m. The president has a busy schedule ahead on the second day of his visit to Japan. According to the provided details, he will be welcomed with an honor guard ceremony before a morning summit with Takaichi. They will also have a working lunch. In the afternoon, the two of them are expected to take a flight on the Marine One helicopter to the U.S. military base in Yokosuka, visiting the aircraft carrier George Washington. Later, Trump is due to attend a dinner with Japanese business leaders.\n\n8:45 a.m. During Trump's meeting with the emperor last night, the two discussed the success of Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani, currently playing in the World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Trump, referring to Ohtani's teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto, also praised Japanese pitchers, according to a Nikkei report.\n\nTrump said he was \"hoping for a very good meeting\" with Takaichi, while the emperor expressed his hopes that the president's visit will \"further strengthen\" friendly ties between their countries.\n\n3:00 a.m. At a meeting earlier with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, new Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama exchanged views on Japan's energy imports from Russia, she says.\n\nIt was their first face-to-face talks. The Trump administration has called on countries to stop buying Russian oil and gas, a vital revenue source for Moscow.\n\n12:15 a.m. Trump's trip to Japan hasn't been without protest. Demonstrators took to the streets in Tokyo on Tuesday as the U.S. president's visit began.\n\nMonday, October 27\n\n8:10 p.m. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who is also visiting Japan, tells Nikkei in an exclusive interview that a $550 billion investment framework agreed between Japan and the U.S. will focus on \"power, pipelines ... things that are fundamental to national security and have virtually no risk.\"\n\n8:00 p.m. Earlier this evening, Takaichi posted a welcome message for Trump, saying she looks forward to a \"fruitful discussion\" on strengthening the alliance. She notes the buildings illuminated in his honor.\n\n7:30 p.m. Trump has left the Imperial Palace. He stayed for about 35 minutes and departed shortly after 7 p.m. Emperor Naruhito shook hands with the president once more and waved as his limo drove away.\n\n7:00 p.m. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Japanese counterpart, the newly appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, will meet on Wednesday morning, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Japan will be looking to emphasize its contribution to the bilateral defense alliance, which Trump once called \"unfair\" and \"one-sided.\"\n\nTakaichi last Friday said that her government will devote the equivalent of 2% of the nation's gross domestic product to defense in the current fiscal year through March, achieving the spending target two years ahead of schedule.\n\n6:40 p.m. Trump meets Emperor Naruhito. The president gets out of his limo and the emperor is there to greet him. The two men share a long handshake and exchange pleasantries, before posing for a brief photo opportunity and heading inside.\n\n6:30 p.m. Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree -- two of the city's best-known landmarks -- are lit up in the red, white and blue of the American flag.\n\n6:25 p.m. A tidbit from Trump's flight: The 79-year-old president told reporters aboard Air Force One that he recently underwent an MRI exam, Reuters reports. \"It was perfect,\" he said.\n\n6:05 p.m. Trump arrives at the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo, his long motorcade of black vehicles weaving over the paths of the grounds.\n\n5:50 p.m. After landing at a helipad, Trump moves to his presidential limousine, known as \"The Beast,\" which will take him to the Imperial Palace to meet the emperor.\n\nEmperor Naruhito has reigned since 2019, after his father, Akihito, stepped down due to his advancing age -- the first abdication in more than 200 years. The emperor does not wield political power but is defined as the symbol of the nation and unity of the Japanese people in the constitution.\n\n5:30 p.m. Outside the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, where Trump is due to meet Emperor Naruhito, a crowd of onlookers has gathered ahead of the president's arrival. Footage on public broadcaster NHK shows his Marines helicopter streaking across the city.\n\n\"Looking forward to seeing the Emperor!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social just before landing in Japan.\n\n5:11 p.m. Dressed in a navy suit and yellow tie, Trump emerges from his aircraft and makes his way down the stairs. He is greeted on the tarmac by Japanese and American officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass. The president then heads immediately to his waiting helicopter.\n\n5:02 p.m. Media footage shows Trump's blue-and-white plane, Air Force One, touching down at Tokyo's Haneda Airport as dusk rapidly descends on the Japanese capital.\n\n3:45 p.m. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has deployed up to around 18,000 personnel to ensure security during Trump's visit. Measures have been tightened near the U.S. Embassy, and units responsible for handling explosives and countering drones are poised to respond swiftly to any urgent incidents.\n\n3:30 p.m. The first Trump-Takaichi meeting is part of a U.S. effort to strengthen ties with allies and partners in the region, as Washington faces a protracted rivalry with Beijing despite the announcement of a framework for a trade deal on Sunday.\n\nGiven the importance of the U.S. to Japan as its security guarantor and second-largest trading partner, and considering Trump's top-down management style, many observers consider it essential for Takaichi to build a good rapport with the president.\n\nIn the meeting, defense is expected to top the agenda, amid heightened concerns over Russia's and China's territorial ambitions, coupled with unease over Trump's \"America First\" policy. Economic security is another important topic, as the U.S. struggles to address vulnerabilities such as its dependence on China for rare-earth minerals and on Taiwan for semiconductors.\n\n3:25 p.m. Aboard Air Force One, Trump tells reporters that he is eager to meet Takaichi. \"I'm looking forward to meeting with the new prime minister,\" he says, according to Reuters. \"I hear phenomenal things.\"\n\nHe also says that he would \"love\" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again, after three meetings during his first presidency. He suggests he would be willing to extend his upcoming stay on the Korean Peninsula to make that happen. \"It is our last stop so it's pretty easy to do. I would meet with him.\"\n\n3:00 p.m. Trump is still en route to Japan from Malaysia. He is expected to arrive in Tokyo after 5 p.m.\n\nTrump last visited Japan during his first presidency in June 2019, when he attended the Group of 20 summit in Osaka. He came to Japan three times during that term, when he developed a close relationship with late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThis time, Trump is expected to head straight to the Imperial Palace for a meeting with Emperor Naruhito. The president and first lady Melania had been state guests of the emperor in May 2019, shortly after his accession to the throne.\n\nAs he departed from Malaysia, Trump wrote on his Truth Social Network: \"Just leaving Malaysia, a great and very vibrant Country. Signed major Trade and Rare Earth Deals, and yesterday, most importantly, signed the Peace Treaty between Thailand and Cambodia. NO WAR! Millions of lives saved. Such an honor to have gotten this done. Now, off to Japan!!!\"\n\nCorrection: An entry at 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday, October 28, was deleted. It wrongly stated that Trump would skip a meeting with the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.","url":"https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/international-relations/trump-in-japan-live-us-president-set-to-depart-for-south-korea","image":"https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-productionv3-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F8%2F5%2F6%2F2%2F11622658-2-eng-GB%2F28ed6c5a7324-2025-10-28T091618Z_858360639_RC2XKHA6V6WZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-JA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 00:18:35","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.238},{"id":373532042,"title":"The US and Japan in the post-postwar era: Gerald Curtis (29)","text":"Donald Trump came back to the White House on Jan. 20 promising to replace the postwar rules-based international order with a transactional America First strategy.

The agency claimed that the weapons would contribute to expanding the operational sphere of the country’s nuclear-armed military. The North Korean report came hours before an expected summit between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju, where South Korea is hosting this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings and US president is also scheduled to hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, AP news reported.KCNA said the tests were attended by senior military official Pak Jong Chon, who also inspected training for sailors aboard North Korea’s newly developed destroyers Choe Hyon and Kang Kon, which leader Kim Jong Un has described as key assets in his efforts to strengthen the navy. Trump expressed interest in meeting with Kim during his stay in South Korea, however, South Korean officials said a Trump–Kim meeting was unlikely. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American President’s first term. Kim’s top foreign policy priority is now Russia. In recent months, he sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to help fuel President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, while embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and positioning his country as part of a united front against the US-led West. Last month, Kim reiterated he would not return to talks with the United States unless Washington dropped its demand for North Korea’s denuclearisation, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.","summary":"North Korea launched sea-to-surface cruise missiles into western waters, a move that could bolster its nuclear-armed military.

The coalition also plans to file a temporary restraining order on Tuesday to “immediately turn benefits back on,” Campbell’s office said.\n\nRollins blasted the lawsuit in an interview on CNN.\n\n“I find it extremely rich that the elected Democrats of California, and New York, and Washington, and Oregon — and by the way, all governors that I work with in USDA on a lot of these different programs, you know the SNAP waivers and getting healthier food into SNAP, et cetera — but I find it very rich that they are suing the Trump administration because their friends on the Hill won’t vote yes to keep the government open,” she said.\n\nThe secretary added, “I believe that they have been very clear up on the Hill, the Democrats have, that they want to use this and they want to use those who are the poorest among us as leverage points to expand their policy agenda. And there’s no doubt about that.”\n\nAdvocates crowded the State House steps and sidewalk along Beacon Street Tuesday afternoon as finger-pointing continued surrounding the fate of SNAP benefits and the fear that young children, families and persons with disabilities could soon go hungry. They held signs with messages including, “Hunger is a choice we don’t have to make,” “Every Child Deserves Dinner,” “You Can’t Eat Bargaining Chips Feed People Not Bureaucracy,” SNAP to it! Feed the hungry!” and “Hey DC. Snap Out of It!!!”\n\nSome advocates booed and yelled “shame” as speakers decried President Donald Trump’s decision to not use contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits.\n\nCampbell’s office contends the USDA “appears to have as much as $6 billion in SNAP contingency reserve funds” that it could dip into for emergencies like the shutdown. But Rollins said SNAP benefits in November alone will cost $9.2 billion.\n\n“We don’t have the legal authority as of today to distribute anything less than that through the formulas, et cetera,” Rollins said. “We’re obviously looking at all of this as we move forward, but as of today, that $9.2 billion, we don’t even have close to that in contingency funding. We’ve got to get this government open.”\n\nThe shutdown impasse comes as Senate Democrats have repeatedly rejected GOP-backed stopgap spending measures as they look to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that are slated to expire at the end of the year under a pandemic-era law. The expiration of subsidies could drive up health insurance premiums.\n\n“But SNAP, the food stamp program, 42 million Americans, 22 million families are being held hostage by Katherine Clark,” Rollins said. “One of the leaders of the Democrat Party, her own words that they can use these poor families and these benefits for the leverage.”\n\nIn a tweet Monday, the House minority whip from Massachusetts said, “The Trump administration has money to fund SNAP, they just don’t want to.”\n\nOn the Senate floor Monday, Majority Leader John Thune lamented that Democrats “once passionately opposed shutdowns, or so they said, in large part because of the impact they would have on American citizens and American workers.”\n\n“More than 40 million Americans could lose access to food stamps if the shutdown continues — 40 million,” Thune said. “And yet none of it seems to matter to Senate Democrats, the party that once decried the impact of shutdowns on Americans in need and now apparently content to see 40 million Americans go without food.”","summary":"Attorney General Andrea Campbell and 22 of her counterparts filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleging the agency is using the ongoing federal government shutdown to unlawfully suspend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that delivers food aid to 40 million Americans.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/28/lawsuit-aims-to-block-snap-suspension/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mpbellnl05.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 00:15:56","author":"State House News Service","authors":["State House News Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":373533744,"title":"The Great British Bake Off fans left raging after 'ridiculous' technical challenge as even judges Paul and Prue deem cakes a 'disaster'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nStrictly Come Dancing\n\nBig Brother\n\nGreat British Bake Off\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great British Bake Off fans left raging after 'ridiculous' technical challenge as even judges Paul and Prue deem cakes a 'disaster'\n\n Have YOU got a story?

Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly in a statement said: “Organizers always planned to use live munitions, as is typical in training exercises.”\n\nThe episode is the latest example of the Trump administration turning the military toward the president’s wishes in ways large and small — from summoning generals from around the world to Washington for a day of speeches to his lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. \n\nThe Navy and other military branches typically use dummy, or inert, bombs for training and demonstrations. Dummies are cheaper than live bombs because they do not contain expensive explosives, fuses and other components. They're also safer.\n\nHowever, military officials often argue that the use of live ammunition for events like the 250th birthday celebration also fulfills a training purpose and that the ordnance would have been expended anyway at a later date. The Navy declined to comment.\n\nThe switch required Navy officials to change up detailed plans for the Norfolk military demonstration to ensure safety protocols were met, according to the three people familiar with the planning.\n\nThe White House pushed forward with the event despite a U.S. government shutdown, which has led nonessential federal workers to be sent home without pay and reduced operation of many non-critical government services.\n\n A celebration for the Marines also used live artillery \n\nConfirmation that the Navy decided to use live bombs instead of dummies at the Naval Base Norfolk event comes as the administration faces scrutiny over an Oct. 18 live fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, in which a misfire of a live artillery round led to shrapnel spraying onto Interstate 5 in Southern California. \n\nNo one was injured when shrapnel struck two California Highway Patrol vehicles. That Camp Pendleton event marking the Marines 250th anniversary was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nLast week, 27 members of the California congressional delegation and the state’s two senators sent a letter to Hegseth asking whose decision it was to shoot live artillery over the busy freeway and how authorities planned for the safety risks. \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who says he’ll weigh a 2028 White House run after the midterm elections next year, criticized the decision and closed a section of the roadway connecting San Diego to Los Angeles for hours during the Oct. 18 Marine showcase. The White House criticized him for closing the highway and said the Marines said there were no safety concerns.\n\n Trump is a fan of military pomp \n\nTrump hasn't been shy about his fondness for pomp and pageantry that celebrates military might. \n\nIn his second term, he has pushed the U.S. services to hold big parades and demonstrations, an idea inspired by a Bastille Day parade he attended in France early in his first term. He was a guest of honor at the 2017 event, which commemorated the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I. \n\nThe Army included tanks in a June parade in the nation's capital, requested by Trump, to mark its 250 years despite concerns from city officials that the heavy vehicles would damage the city's streets. And he appeared to relish the massive military welcome he received last month during his second state visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the Navy celebration this month in Norfolk, the president and first lady Melania Trump watched the military demonstration from the deck of an aircraft carrier before Trump delivered a speech in which he criticized his political opponents and attacked Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAt sea, the Navy had seven Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers fire a variety of their guns, including a large 5-inch gun. Four destroyers also launched the Navy's Standard Missile 2 (SM-2). Each missile costs approximately $2 million.\n\nMeanwhile, aircraft from USS Truman's air wing fired missiles and general-purpose bombs and performed a strafing run with their gatling guns. The Navy's MH-60S Seahawk helicopters also fired hydra rockets and guns.\n\nTrump then spoke on a pier between two towering Navy vessels, an aircraft carrier and an amphibious assault ship. The carrier displayed a Navy fighter jet that had the words “President Donald J. Trump ‘45-47’” printed on the fuselage, right under the cockpit window.\n\nA Navy spokesperson told the AP shortly after the event that sailors put the president's name on the aircraft for the visit and this was “customary for visits of this type.”\n\nIn addition to the live bomb demonstration, Navy destroyers launched missiles and fired shells into the Atlantic Ocean, and Navy SEALs descended from helicopters and fighter jets catapulted off vessels. \n\nThe shift to live bombs also required further spreading out of the guided missile destroyers in the waters off Norfolk for the military demonstration.","summary":"The White House pressed Navy officials to launch 2,000-pound live bombs instead of dummy explosives during a recent military demonstration for the service’s 250th anniversary celebration that President Donald Trump attended","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/navy-white-house-gavin-newsom-washington-pete-hegseth-b2854187.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/29/00/TRUMP-MARINA_22040.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 00:05:54","author":"Aamer Madhani,Konstantin Toropin and Lisa Mascaro","authors":["Aamer Madhani","Konstantin Toropin and Lisa Mascaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":373537440,"title":"Pakistan says peace talks with Afghanistan’s Taliban government in Istanbul failed after four days","text":"By SUZAN FRASER and MUNIR AHMED\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan have failed in Istanbul after four days of negotiations, Pakistan’s information minister said before dawn Wednesday, accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of refusing to act against militants blamed for deadly cross-border attacks.\n\nThe talks followed an earlier round in Doha that produced a ceasefire on Oct. 19 after deadly border clashes between the two sides left dozens dead, including soldiers, civilians and militants.\n\nPakistan accuses the Taliban of harboring militants linked to a surge in attacks, while Kabul denies its territory is being used against Pakistan.\n\nBefore dawn Wednesday, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar took to social media platform X, saying the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” despite mediation by Qatar and Turkey.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Kabul about Tarar’s remarks.\n\nThe latest development came hours after the state media in both countries said there was an impasse in the talks, with the state media from the both sides blaming each other for the failure to reach a deal.\n\nTarar said Pakistan at the request of brotherly countries Qatar and Turkey gave peace a chance and engaged with the Afghan Taliban government first in Doha and then in Istanbul.\n\nHe accused the Taliban of being “indifferent to Pakistan’s losses” even though “Pakistan has always desired, advocated and immensely sacrificed for peace and prosperity for the people of Afghanistan.”\n\nTarar said Pakistan is thankful to Qatar and Turkey for facilitating this dialogue, which was part of a broader diplomatic push to ease months of heightened tension between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border attacks and militant safe havens — issues that have strained relations since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan four years ago.\n\nHe said that “since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war.”\n\nTarar said “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” and warned that Islamabad would “continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism.”\n\nEarlier, on Tuesday, three Pakistani security officials who had direct knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press that there was a deadlock in the talks in Istanbul over the reluctance of Kabul in accepting demands about assurances that Afghan soil not be used against Pakistan.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The ballroom will be constructed “long before the end of President Trump’s term,” according to the White House, and will be funded by Trump and donors including billionaire Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and oil executive Harold G. Hamm. The National Capital Planning Commission will oversee approval of the new building, which has received backlash amid an ongoing government shutdown that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of workers being furloughed. Trump’s “Independence Arch” is expected to be built to mark the United States’ 250th anniversary next summer. When asked who the project is for, the president said, “Me. It’s going to be beautiful.” A model of the arch shows a large stone arch, topped with a golden winged angel and two eagles.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Confirms Plans For Massive ‘Independence Arch’ Near Lincoln Memorial (Forbes)\n\nWhite House East Wing Demolition Nearly Complete For Trump’s Ballroom (Photos) (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

In a post on X, Pete Hegseth stated that the four vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and carrying narcotics. The strikes are part of President Donald Trump’s intensified campaign against suspected drug-smuggling networks operating in international waters.According to Hegseth, Mexican authorities have taken over the search and rescue operation for the sole survivor. The latest operation marked the first time that several strikes were conducted on the same day under the new campaign.“The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics. Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed,” Pete Hegseth said in a post on X. Regarding the survivor, USSOUTHCOM immediately initiated Search and Rescue (SAR) standard protocols; Mexican SAR authorities accepted the case and assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue,” he added. The strikes have brought the total number of U.S. military operations targeting drug-smuggling boats to 13 since early September. In total, 14 vessels have been destroyed and 57 people killed, with three survivors reported so far, CNN reported.The Trump administration last week expanded the scope of its campaign to the eastern Pacific, after earlier strikes targeted vessels in the Caribbean Sea. Earlier this month, two survivors of a similar strike in the Caribbean were detained by the U.S. Navy before being repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing that her government had been informed of Monday’s operation and the potential survivor. “These events occurred in international waters,” she said, adding that she had directed Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente to coordinate with U.S. Ambassador Ron Johnson and Mexico’s Navy Secretariat for further details, as reported by CNN.CNN earlier reported that the Trump administration had produced a classified legal opinion justifying the use of lethal force against drug traffickers by categorising them as enemy combatants, allowing such strikes without judicial review.

Email kylie.stevens@dailymail.com.au \nBy KYLIE STEVENS, SENIOR BREAKING NEWS REPORTER, AUSTRALIA \n Published:23:34 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:23:49 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nSunrise host Nat Barr has questioned how an elderly woman could have allegedly been left behind by a cruise ship before she was found dead on a tourist island. \nAuthorities have launched an investigation into the death of the Coral Expeditions passenger, 80, at Lizard Island off the Far North Queensland coast on Saturday.\nThe solo traveller, who was on an $80,000 trip, was hiking up to the Cook's Look summit with fellow passengers when she needed to stop and became lost while making her back to the ship.\nShe was reported missing after she failed to return to the Coral Adventurer anchored offshore, sparking a land and sea search that continued well into the night and early hours of the morning.\nHer body was located 50m off the walking track and retrieved from the mountain the following day, sparking many questions about safety protocols.\nBoaties anchored near the island on Saturday claimed that the woman was left behind by the ship before the vessel returned hours later to search for her by torchlight.\nThey also claimed that a headcount was conducted by crew when snorkelling passengers returned to the boat, but not those who had gone to the island. \nBarr asked the question on everyone's mind when a cruising expert appeared on the program on Wednesday.\n\nNat Barr has asked the question on everyone's mind after the tragic death of a cruise ship passenger on Lizard Island on Saturday\n\nThe woman's body was found 50m off the walking track on Lizard Island's Cook's Look summit Pictured is the search on Sunday\n'How does something like this happen?' she asked.\nCruising expert Adrian Tassone admitted he had no idea how it could have occurred.\n'That's something I'm really struggling to understand myself,' he said.\n'Cruise lines in normal operation will always know who is on the ship and who isn't.\n'If the reports are to be believed and this woman was left on the island, I really can't understand how that occurred.\n'It's something that most people are questioning and are trying to come to grips with.'\nMr Tassone said that many cruise companies have strict systems in place, such as headcounts, to ensure all passengers are accounted for at all times.\nThe Coral Adventurer, which has capacity for 120 guests, is currently on a 60-night circumnavigation of Australia, having departed Cairns last week.\n'It's unusual for numbers to not be known and checked, but I think what's important in this instance is that it's an expedition cruise,' Mr Tassone said.\n\nAdrian Tassone, also known as The Cruise and Travel Guy, says the tragic death of a cruise ship passenger on Lizard Island has left many unanswered questions\n\nBoaties have claimed that cruise ship crew did a headcount of snorkelling passengers returning to the vessel but not those who explored Lizard Island (pictured)\n'It's atypical from the regular cruise environment.\n'This ship held a maximum of 120 passengers, so I struggle to understand how a headcount wasn't conducted. \n'Typically, you get on a cruise ship and you scan a card that is your key card, which indicates when you're on and off the ship. Those manifests I understand are across all cruise lines. \n'I don't know if Coral Expeditions operates in a different manner to that, but I am really surprised something more robust isn't in place that should have prevented this from happening.'\nA Coral Expeditions spokesman told Daily Mail he was unable to comment further while investigations are underway.\n'While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,' chief executive Mark Fifield said in a statement on Tuesday.\n'The Coral team has been in contact with the woman's family, and we will continue to offer support to them through this difficult process.\n'We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is underway.'\n\nThe woman was reported missing hours after she failed to return to the Coral Adventurer (vessel pictured)\nThe woman was on her first stop of a 60-day, $80,000-a-ticket trip around Australia when she died.\nTraci Ayris and her partner were anchored off the island on Saturday when they began listening to radio transmissions sent from the Coral Expeditions' vessel. \n'They did headcounts for snorkellers (which we heard) but not for other guests on the island it would seem,' she told the Cairns Post.\n'The last people came down from the track and got into tender then the (ship) left very soon after that.\n'We even commented, \"Wow they left fast\".'\nShe claimed the vessel didn't return to search for the missing passenger until later that night.\nPolice are treating the woman's death as non-suspicious and will prepare a report for the Coroner.\nPopular with divers, snorkellers and hikers, Lizard Island is one of the most remote tourism destinations on the Great Barrier Reef.\nCook's Look is the highest point on the island and follows the footsteps of British explorer Captain James Cook, who is believed to be the first European to have trekked up the mountain in 1770 after his ship Endeavour struck a reef.\nLaunched in 2019, the Coral Adventurer cruise ship has a capacity of up to 120 passengers and 46 crew.\nThe ship is currently en route to Darwin, where it will be met by Australian Maritime Safety Authority officials investigating the tragedy.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNat Barr asks the question everyone wants answered after woman was allegedly left behind by a cruise ship and died on Lizard Island in Australia\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The 14th Amendment, however, says that “the whole number of persons in each state” are to be counted, and the Census Bureau has interpreted that to mean anybody residing in the U.S., regardless of legal status. Federal courts have repeatedly supported that interpretation.\n\nConcerns that the Republican administration wouldn’t vigorously defend the 2020 count were raised by census and redistricting experts when the young Republican groups sued in federal court in Tampa in September.\n\n“The Commerce Department, you know, might just throw up their hands and say, ‘We agree with the plaintiffs,’” said Jeffrey Wice, a New York Law School professor.\n\nThe lawsuit by the University of South Florida College Republicans and the Pinellas County Young Republicans challenges two methods used during the 2020 census — “differential privacy” and “imputation” for group quarters, which include college dorms, nursing homes and other places where people live together under one roof.\n\nDifferential privacy adds intentional errors to the data to obscure the identity of any given participant in the 2020 census while still providing statistically valid information. Imputation is a process of using other information to fill in data about people when census-takers can’t reach anyone at a particular address.\n\nAlthough the 2020 census numbers were released during the first months of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, the execution and final planning for the head count, including the decision to use the statistical methods, took place during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe 2020 census faced unprecedented obstacles from the COVID-19 pandemic, hurricanes and wildfires, social unrest and efforts by the Trump administration to end the count early. Group quarters such as college dorms and nursing homes were especially challenging because campuses were closed and care facilities restricted access in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn the Florida lawsuit, three federal judges have been designated to hear arguments in the case. Two of the judges were nominated by Republican presidents, George H.W. Bush and Trump, and the third was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky: @mikeysid.bsky.social","summary":"The students and retirees say they are concerned the Trump administration won't defend the census.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/10/28/2020-census-challenges/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2020_Census_94925.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:49:16","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":373527654,"title":"US Senate passes bill to end Trump tariffs against Brazil","text":"The Republican-led US Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would overturn President Donald Trump’s tariffs against Brazil by terminating the national emergency he declared in July in retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for an alleged coup attempt.\nIn the first of three tariff bills expected in the Senate this week, lawmakers approved the Brazil measure 52-48, with five Republicans crossing partisan lines to back the measure.\nLegislative measures to terminate Trump’s tariffs on Canada and his tariffs against other countries around the globe are expected to come up for votes later this week.\nThe vote sent the Brazil measure on to the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives, where it is expected to be shelved.

In the op-ed, Pfaff asserts that ICE has “lowered” its hiring standards, but is still struggling to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new agents before the end of 2025. \n\nIn August, DHS announced it would “waive age limits” for ICE applicants, but added that recruits still would be required to undergo “medical screening, drug screening, and complete a physical fitness test.” \n\nWhile ICE has extended “tentative offers” to 18,000 individuals, according to DHS, Pfaff asserts that many applicants are “not up to the task” physically of being a field agent. \n\nThe assistant secretary says ICE is maintaining its fitness standards while continuing to hire more agents, adding that candidates “must meet the Physical Ability Assessment standards as a condition of employment.” \n\n“We are moving fitness checks earlier in the training sequence to improve efficiency and accountability—not to lower standards,” she added. \n\nThe majority of new ICE hires “are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy,” McLaughlin told The Daily Signal. “This population is expected to account for greater than 85% of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation, but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.” \n\nStill, Pfaff argues ICE has only made around “1,000 successful hires, just 10% of the goal.” \n\nIn response, McLaughlin says ICE is “deploying new officers on a rolling basis and will continue onboarding through December to hire 10,000 deportation officers.” \n\nFunding to hire the new agents is included in Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill, which was signed into law in July.\n\nDHS continues to conduct an aggressive recruitment campaign as it seeks to arrest and remove illegal aliens—specifically, those with a criminal history—who are living in the U.S. \n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has resulted in a 1,000% increase in attacks against immigration enforcement officials, according to DHS.","summary":"The Department of Homeland Security says it is working “at turbo speed” to deport criminal illegal aliens after MSNBC ran a commentary piece outlining the...

But a police report on the encounter doesn’t mention the shooting, an omission that the man’s attorneys point to as evidence of a cover-up attempt.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the shooting by a Homeland Security Investigations agent, who was with police officers and other federal agents when they stopped a car driven by Phillip M. Brown on Oct. 17.\n\nBrown, 33, of Hyattsville, Maryland, wasn’t injured in the shooting. He was jailed for three days on a charge that he fled from law enforcement, but a judge has already dismissed the case.\n\nBrown’s lawyers claim the police department tried to cover up the shooting by leaving it out of the police report and refusing to provide them with video from police body cameras. At a court hearing for Brown’s criminal case, a police officer testified that he was instructed not to include the shooting in the police report, according to civil rights attorneys Bernadette Armand and E. Paige White. They said police also failed to disclose the shooting to a prosecutor assigned to the case.\n\nThe judge who dismissed the case against Brown ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he was fleeing, according to Brown’s attorneys. The gunshots struck Brown’s driver-side window and front passenger seat at chest level, the lawyers said.\n\n“We are lucky that our client is alive. He could very well be dead,” White said.\n\nThe officer’s police report says Brown revved his sport utility vehicle’s engine and began driving toward law-enforcement officers before he rear-ended another vehicle. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson says the agent who fired his gun feared for his life “and the lives of others” when he fired “defensive shots” into the vehicle.\n\n“This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of vehicles being used as weapons against DHS law enforcement,” the DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Our officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them including vehicle rammings, terrorist attacks, and even bounties for their murders. The violence must end.”\n\nArmand said it is “outrageous” for DHS to claim that the shooting was justified when there is no mention of the shooting in the police report.\n\n“Of course they’re going to say it was justified. What are they going to say? ‘We shot at an unarmed Black man in his car in a routine traffic stop for nothing?’ They’re not going to say that. They’re going to say whatever they have to say to justify their actions,” Armand said.\n\nA police report that doesn’t mention the shooting was filed in D.C. Superior Court for Brown’s criminal case. Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Tom Lynch provided The Associated Press with a copy of a separate report for the internal affairs division’s parallel investigation of the shooting.\n\n“We are the agency investigating the officer-involved shooting, and we have been continuously since Oct. 17th,” Lynch said. He declined to comment on the officer’s testimony about the omission of the shooting from the report on Brown’s arrest.\n\nIn August, Trump, a Republican, issued an executive order declaring a crime emergency in Washington. For nearly three months, the White House has deployed hundreds of federal agents and over 2,000 National Guard members to help police patrol the city’s neighborhoods.\n\nAgents from the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Marshals Service also were patrolling with two MPD officers and the HSI agent who shot at Brown, according to the police report. They stopped Brown for having heavily tinted windows and no front plate on his sport utility vehicle, the report says.\n\nBrown’s attorneys say his traffic stop demonstrates the risky nature of patrols by federal agents who aren’t adequately trained for police work.\n\n“It’s not OK to have agents and officers on the streets who are engaged in shooting at unarmed people and then covering it up after the fact,” Armand said. “There’s no trust there. There’s no accountability there. And there’s no credibility there.”\n\nA magistrate judge in D.C. Superior Court ordered Brown’s release on Oct. 21. He was traumatized by his arrest and experiences in jail, his lawyers said. They’re weighing a possible lawsuit over his arrest.","summary":"The Oct. 17 shooting by a Homeland Security Investigations agent is under investigation.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/10/28/dc-shooting-federal-agent/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DC_Shooting_Federal_Agent_76340-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:43:51","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.807},{"id":373533262,"title":"Remap retreat? Illinois Democrats won’t vote on redistricting effort by end of veto session","text":"SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Democrats will regroup to consider joining the escalating, nationwide redistricting fight with Republican-led states that are moving to gerrymander congressional districts at the request of President Donald Trump, legislative leaders said Tuesday.\n\nIllinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and state Senate President Don Harmon told their respective Democratic supermajority caucuses that the controversial remap effort championed by U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries won’t get a vote in Springfield this week as state legislators wrap up their fall veto session.\n\nThat means Gov. JB Pritzker would have to call lawmakers back to the state Capitol later this year or wait until their usual session early next year for Democrats to potentially change an already heavily gerrymandered Illinois congressional map that currently has them outnumbering Republicans 14-3. A proposed map hasn’t been released, but Dems think they can redraw the lines to create a 15th favorable district.\n\nJeffries traveled to Illinois Monday to nudge state lawmakers toward a remap, which is usually only done at the turn of a decade. Because Dems control all statewide levers in Springfield, national party leaders view Illinois as one of their best bets to wring another blue district away from Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nRepublican-controlled legislatures in Texas, North Caroline and Missouri have altered their maps to favor the GOP, which holds a slim majority to advance Trump’s agenda in the U.S. House. Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun announced his state would pursue it in a special session next week — which top Illinois Democrats have said would trigger them to act. \n\nJeffries said any potential Illinois redistricting wouldn’t necessarily need to be approved this week, but the clock is ticking. Candidates started filing petition signatures this week to appear on the ballot for Illinois’ March 17, 2026, primary election. It’s not clear how Democrats would solve the procedural riddle of changing districts once ballots are finalized, but it would have to clear the General Assembly.\n\nPritzker, Welch and Harmon have signaled they’re open to joining the remap fray, but some Black state lawmakers have said they’d be dead-set against any map that would dilute Black representation in the congressional delegation.\n\n“What Donald Trump is trying to do is call state Republican governors and Republican legislators and get them to cheat on his behalf for the ‘26 elections,” Pritzker said. “If Donald Trump continues to do what he’s doing across the country in Republican states, it is very hard for Democrats to just sit back and watch him cheat and make it near impossible in 2026 for the voters to actually have their say in terms of picking the Congress that they want, so we have to consider all options if he continues to do what he’s doing.”\n\nIllinois Republicans have slammed the idea. State Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, said Democrats would be trying to “change the rules of the game after the game.”\n\n“For three months we’ve had an opportunity for people to sign petitions for a known and set geography — again, a geography that was designed and perfected by Democrats to maximize their political grip on power in the state of Illinois,” Spain said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2025/10/28/illinois-redistricting-hakeem-jeffries-springfield-vote","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd3e4eb/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6311x4209+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F0b%2F9acc6158450c9d2b1bed9d84d583%2Fhakee","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:42:26","author":"Mitchell Armentrout","authors":["Mitchell Armentrout"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":373527108,"title":"Fighting Trump is the only play in Dems' playbook","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle October 28, 2025 07:18 \n\n Fighting Trump is the only play in Dems' playbook \n Sen.

Sign up for it here.\n\nEvery two years, politicians declare the most important election of our lifetimes, and becoming inured to that is easy. But as I reported on how the 2026 election could be in danger for my recent story, I started to wonder if maybe the assertion was true this time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has spent the first nine months of his term bulldozing limits on his power, abetted by a supine Congress. What might be left of checks and balances after four years of unified Republican control in Washington is unclear. Trump sees winning a majority in the midterms as crucial to his agenda, and he is also worried about them, as demonstrated by his cajoling and badgering of GOP-led states to gerrymander House districts to aid Republican candidates.\n\nThe good news is that experts I interviewed all told me there will be elections in 2026. The bad news is that Trump and his allies have many tools at their disposal to try to steal them. Modern authoritarians seldom cancel elections, because they prefer the veneer of democratic choice that voting provides, and because they can tilt the playing field toward themselves. “No one likes an election better than Vladimir Putin,” the Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias told me.\n\nMy article on those threats, and how they might succeed or fail, was published today, along with an essay by the former federal judge J. Michael Luttig on Trump’s ambitions to stay in office past his second term. Those stories are also on the cover of the December issue of The Atlantic. In my report, I try to lay out all of the ways that subversion might happen—and some of the ways it already has.\n\nAttempts to rig an election don’t happen in just the run-up to Election Day. If you’re going to subvert an election, first you take early actions to disadvantage your opponents, including changing the rules and laws under which elections are held. When voting starts, you work to suppress the votes of people who might support your rivals. If you’ve lost once the election is over, then you claim fraud and try to get votes for your opponents thrown out. We don’t have to imagine what this looks like, because it’s already happened in North Carolina.\n\nThe Old North State has been a testing ground and an early-warning system for election shenanigans over the past dozen years. The first step to rigging North Carolina’s elections was writing favorable rules. In the 2010 elections, Republicans swept the state legislature for the first time in generations and set out to make sure they’d keep it. They drew districts that helped GOP candidates so effectively that although Democrats won a majority of the votes for both the state House and Senate in 2024, Republicans took roughly 60 percent of the seats in both chambers. That also gives the GOP control over maps for North Carolina’s seats in the U.S. House. Before the 2024 election, the state adopted new maps that gave Republicans a 10-to-4 advantage in House races. Last week, following Trump’s urging, the state legislature drew new districts openly designed to make that 11 to 3.\n\nState Republicans have also moved to take partisan control of some of the bodies that oversee elections. Legislators changed state court elections from nonpartisan to partisan in a successful bid to increase GOP presence on the bench. This year, the North Carolina legislature stripped control of the State Board of Elections from the governor, a Democrat, and gave it to the state auditor, a Republican. The board’s new GOP majority fired its executive director, a longtime elections professional, and hired a GOP lawyer to replace her, as well as a former state party official to oversee “election integrity.”\n\nWith the groundwork laid, the next step was suppressing votes. In 2013, right after the Supreme Court threw out part of the Voting Rights Act, the North Carolina state legislature moved forward with a major overhaul of state voting laws, which included newly requiring voters to show photo ID and eliminating same-day voter registration, some early voting, and other provisions. A federal judge struck that law down, saying it targeted “African Americans with almost surgical precision,” but some of its key provisions have since been passed once again. (One big issue that came up in my reporting but hasn’t occurred in North Carolina is how Trump could try to use federal law enforcement or the military to interfere with elections, using the Insurrection Act or other emergency powers, despite laws specifically designed to prevent that.)\n\nMore opportunities for interference came after the votes were cast. In the 2016 race for governor, the incumbent Republican claimed fraud in several predominantly Democratic counties, without offering proof, and demanded a recount. He ultimately lost the election, but these tactics foreshadowed Trump’s attempts at holding on to power after the 2020 election. North Carolina was also a key test for the “independent state legislature” theory that Trump tried to use in 2020, but the Supreme Court knocked it down in 2023.\n\nWorse was to come. In a 2024 race for state supreme court, which was narrowly won by the Democratic incumbent, the Republican challenger attempted to change the rules of the election after the fact in order to throw out thousands of votes (once again, mostly in Democratic jurisdictions)—even while acknowledging that the voters had followed the rules. GOP-dominated state courts seemed open to the possibility, and it was only after a federal court shut the effort down that the election was certified.\n\nThis quick trip through recent North Carolina history shows a few important dynamics for thinking about 2026 and beyond. First, a government that seeks to meddle with elections has many different paths by which it can work. Second, election meddlers learn from their mistakes. Anyone who watched the bumbling work of Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis after the 2020 election should not expect such amateurism from Trump’s allies next time. And third, preserving democracy isn’t a one-off: Its defenders have to be ready to stand up in every election. Saving the system in 2026 will offer America a chance to fight for it again in 2028.\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Innovation That’s Killing Restaurant Culture\n\nBy Ellen Cushing\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nExplore.

That reform was meant to restore fairness and ensure that all Californians — regardless of political affiliation — had a meaningful voice in representation.\n\nToday, Proposition 50 threatens to undo that progress. If passed, it would allow California’s Democratic supermajority to tighten its control even further, reducing Republican representation in Congress from an already disproportionate 17% to just 8%, despite conservatives about 28% of likely voters. \n\nGov.

(It’s probably illegal, as noted in the article.) That’s true whether it involves military salaries or a new wing on the White House.\n\nCongress controls how much the government spends and on what. If the people don’t approve of the way Congress appropriates tax dollars, they can complain to their representatives or vote them out of office. Acknowledging that Congress isn’t functioning particularly well right now, if ultra-wealthy individuals fund government and the people don’t approve, what recourse do we have?

A few days later, they were buried in unmarked graves. The soldiers who took part in the massacre were awarded Medals of Honor. The myth was that Wounded Knee was a battle when, in reality, it was a massacre.\n\nThere was an attempt by Joe Biden’s Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, to revoke the medals from the soldiers by ordering a review. However, the current Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, stopped the review, saying that the soldiers should keep their medals. For his action, Hegseth, along with his boss, President Trump, are celebrating the massacre of American Indians.\n\nBilly Trice\n\nCongress must save\nfood programs\n\nRe: “No federal food aid will go out Nov. 1, Trump administration warns” (Oct. 27).\n\nRepublicans claim they cannot provide SNAP benefits on Nov. 1 if the government remains shut down. That’s not true. SNAP has a $5 billion-$6 billion contingency fund. Republicans are shamefully using the more than 40 million Americans who rely on SNAP as pawns, creating a hunger crisis to pressure Democrats to submit to Donald Trump’s will.\n\nHowever, Democrats should not give up their fight to save our health care. Congress only has two weeks left to extend the ACA premium tax credits. Once open enrollment ends, the dramatic increases in health insurance premiums will be locked in — even if Congress acts later.\n\nMeanwhile, this shutdown is really expensive. According to White House’s Council of Economic Advisors, this shutdown could cost the U.S. economy $15 billion a week.\n\nWhat are we doing? Trump and Congress need to start negotiating on a bipartisan basis in good faith to reopen the government and extend ACA premium tax credits.\n\nJennifer Huber\nEl Sobrante\n\nIn fact, GOP isn’t\nso tough on crime\n\nThe Trump administration is now using the National Guard for law enforcement in cities with shrinking crime statistics, in direct conflict with local officials and likely even federal law.\n\nAll this while firing many senior officials in the Department of Justice, reducing federal funds for local law enforcement and prosecuting political enemies.\n\nThat is under the leadership of a draft-dodger, adjudicated sex offender and convicted fraudster. Don’t forget the never-completed efforts to prosecute him for election fraud and classified document cases.\n\nYet, the president has faced no resistance or objection from a Republican-controlled Congress. Are they strong on crime? I don’t think so.\n\nWe should make health\ncare a human right\n\nHealth care access and affordability has been an ongoing ethical issue. Millions of people are having a difficult time affording medical care, insurance and medication, and it is affecting their overall health and quality of life.\n\nA couple of factors that are limiting their access to health care are income and location. I strongly believe that to prevent suffering, health care should be a human right and not a business for profit.\n\nHealth care access, affordable medication, health programs and insurance should be prioritized for our well-being, as well as protecting everyone, promoting public health and building strength in our communities.\n\nMikaela Clarete","summary":"Also: Private donors &#124; Celebrating slaughter &#124; Food programs &#124; Tough on crime? &#124; Health care.

Lindsey Graham’s bill to place sanctions on Russia seems like it would have no difficulty at all passing the Senate—but it has languished for months without action.\n\nThe inaction is not due to a lack of support, since Graham’s Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 has 84 co-sponsors in the Senate, making it immune to a Senate filibuster or a presidential veto.\n\n“There is bipartisan support… in the Senate to be much firmer and come down harder on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. And I think we should be taking that step,” Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a co-sponsor, told reporters Monday.\n\nWhat’s more, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said he looks at the bill favorably as “a tool in the president’s tool chest that you can use against the Russians to get them to the table.” He is monitoring the administration’s negotiations to see when could be the right time to bring it to the Senate floor.\n\nBut with a bill that appears so easy to pass, why has there been no movement?\n\nWhat’s in the Bill?\n\nGraham’s legislation would require that the president make a determination every 90 days on whether Russia is still invading or planning to invade Ukraine.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then harsh sanctions would kick in, including revoking visas and blocking transactions of Russian government-connected individuals.\n\nAdditionally, Russia would be hit with “not less than” a 500% rate of duties on its imports into the United States.\n\nBut perhaps the most drastic measure is that any country that knowingly imports uranium, natural gas, or petroleum products from Russia would be hit with its own “not less than” 500% rate of duties on its exports to the United States.\n\nThat would mean severe sanctions on large economies such as China and India, which import uranium and gas from Russia. The president would be able to waive those duties once for up to 180 days if he determines it is in the interest of national security.\n\nThroughout his second term, the highest tariff rate President Donald Trump has imposed on China has been 145% and the highest he has imposed on India has been 50%. The administration has since backed off of the 145% tariffs on China and is negotiating trade deals with both countries.\n\nWaiting for White House Signals?\n\nMany Senate Republicans say they’re waiting on the White House’s thumbs-up and also monitoring Trump’s negotiations in the conflict.\n\n“Who’s running foreign policy and who’s out there every day is [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio and the president,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a supporter of the bill, told The Daily Signal. “We don’t want to get ahead of them. We’re ready to go. When they say, ‘go,’ we’ll go.”\n\nBut that’s not to say there’s no impatience among some Senate Republicans to get moving on the sanctions.\n\n“I hope so,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told The Daily Signal when asked if he wanted the bill to move quickly. “I’m 100% behind [Graham] trying to get it done. I think it ups the ante. If the president wants to have it held in the House, that’s a decision I trust him to make. But it doesn’t make sense to me to not have either of the two chambers act on it.”\n\nIt remains unclear what the bill’s future would be in the House if it passed in the Senate. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., has a companion bill in the House that has 113 co-sponsors—57 Democrats and 56 Republicans.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., has expressed openness to the idea of advancing congressional sanctions. \n\nShortly before the most recent sanctions on natural gas companies implemented unilaterally by the executive branch, Johnson told reporters, “There is a big appetite among Republicans in the House and Senate … for tough sanctions on Russia” and that “Republicans in Congress are ready to provide support” for Trump’s negotiations “and any leverage that we can, including sanctions.”\n\nNot Everyone in Senate Wants It\n\nDespite the overwhelming number of Senate co-sponsors, the bill does have a handful of detractors in the Senate—including Republicans who say Trump can handle the Russia situation on his own.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for example, reacting to new, unilateral executive branch sanctions on Russian gas companies, told The Daily Signal that the Graham bill might not be necessary.\n\n“I’ll defer to the leader on that when he wants to bring it to the floor. The president has put new sanctions on Russia, so I’m not sure it’s needed at this point,” Hawley said.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., says he does not want to step on the president’s toes as he negotiates through the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“My feeling is that we ought to give President Trump every opportunity to find peace, and that’s what he’s working on,” Schmitt told The Daily Signal. “So, if there is a time we need to move forward, I think all options are on the table, but my perspective has been that President Trump’s the guy who can deliver peace, and we ought to give him a chance to do it.”\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., also told The Daily Signal that he was delegating the sanctions decision to the president.\n\n“I’ll let that [be] up to the administration in terms of how they want to handle it with their negotiations,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of up to the president to decide when he wants Congress to signal their support for sanctioning Russia.”\n\nIs Delay Due to Trade Deals?\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., is a supporter of tough sanctions on Russia to encourage the country to negotiate and is a cosponsor of Graham’s bill, but he doubts it will become law.\n\nWhy? Because he does not think the Trump administration would support legislation that interferes with its trade negotiations with China.\n\n“I don’t think the president’s going to go with the Russian sanctions bill,” Kennedy told The Daily Signal. “I’ve offered an alternative to try to release $300 billion in seized [Russian] assets to Ukraine at a rate of $10 billion a month. I think that’s the best chance of getting the president on the board.”\n\nHe explained, “I don’t believe the president is ever going to agree to the sanctions, and I say that because they’re busy hammering out a trade agreement with China right now, and that’s in a delicate balance, and once they get that done, I don’t think they’re going to want to do anything to upset China.”\n\nKennedy added, “Is the President going to blow [the deal] up by supporting a sanction on the Chinese purchase of Russian oil? … I just don’t think that he will do that.”\n\nNevertheless, Kennedy made clear that he is a supporter of sanctions.\n\n“I will vote for the sanctions bill in a heartbeat, but I don’t think Sen. Thune wants to move the bill until the executive branch is comfortable, and I don’t believe the executive branch will ever be comfortable.”\n\nUnder Kennedy’s alternative proposal to hand Russian money to Ukraine, “You give that money to Ukraine at $10 billion a month, and just say, ‘Buy whatever missiles you want. If the president won’t sell you Tomahawks, they’re not the only missiles God ever made. Go buy other missiles and take out every weapons production plant and every oil refinery in Russia.’ That will bring them to be tamed because it will stop his cash flow, and that involves no American money. It doesn’t interfere with any trade deals.”\n\nKennedy added that he had presented his proposal to the White House.\n\n“I’ve talked to the president about this. He seemed OK with it, but he didn’t categorically say ‘yes,’” Kennedy told The Daily Signal.\n\nWhite House Wants Flexibility\n\nWhen it comes to negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, it appears the White House wants maximum flexibility, while remaining open to legislation that assists it in its goals.\n\nA White House official told The Daily Signal in a statement, “The White House is working with Congress to ensure introduced bills advance the president’s foreign policy objectives and authorities. The Constitution vests the president with the authority to conduct diplomacy with foreign nations. Any sanction package must provide complete flexibility for the president to continue to pursue his desired foreign policy.”","summary":"South Carolina Republican Sen.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., sought to terminate the national emergency declarations Trump used to justify imposing 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods including oil, coffee and orange juice. Though the resolution passed the Senate with support from five Republicans — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — it is expected to stall in the Republican-controlled House, where leadership can prevent it from ever coming to a vote. Trump is also expected to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, join a lunch hosted by President Donald Trump, on the Rose Garden patio at the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\n“This vote is about more than tariffs,” Kaine said. “It’s about how much we will let a president get away with. Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not?” He argued that Trump’s trade wars have hurt American consumers and businesses alike, calling the tariffs “economic destruction.”\n\nThe administration says the tariffs are a necessary tool to secure better trade deals and punish Brazil for its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Vice President JD Vance met privately with GOP senators earlier Tuesday to warn that opposing Trump’s tariffs would weaken the president’s leverage in negotiations. \n\n“To vote against that is to strip that incredible leverage from the president of the United States,” Vance told reporters afterward.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the tariffs as a hidden tax on everyday Americans. \n\n“Every American who wakes up in the morning to get a cup of java is paying a price for Donald Trump’s reckless, ridiculous, and almost childish tariffs,” he said.\n\nThe debate underscored growing Republican unease with Trump’s expansive use of emergency powers to impose trade restrictions without congressional approval. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently reported that the administration’s tariff policies are contributing to higher inflation, job losses and slower economic growth.\n\nMcConnell, the former GOP leader, said in a statement that “tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,” while Paul said Trump’s use of emergency powers for trade was “an abuse” of executive authority. \n\n“Emergencies are like war, famine, tornado,” Paul said. “Not liking someone’s tariffs is not an emergency.”\n\nKaine said he plans to introduce similar resolutions targeting Trump’s emergency tariffs on Canada and other nations later this week, aiming to keep pressure on the White House and highlight divisions within the GOP over trade and presidential power.\n\nThis is a breaking news article. Updates to follow.\n\nThis article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"The measure seeks to terminate the national emergency declarations Trump used to justify imposing 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-brazil-tariffs-republicans-voted-against-full-list-10955727","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25294661176204.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:20:05","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.186},{"id":373524380,"title":"Senate narrowly passes bill to repeal Trump's tariffs on Brazil","text":"The Senate Tuesday evening narrowly passed a resolution that would repeal President Donald Trump's tariffs on Brazil. \n\nThe resolution was approved by a vote of 52-48. It needed a simple majority of votes to pass.\n\nRepublicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Thom Tillis and co-sponsor Rand Paul voted for the bill along with all Senate Democrats.\n\nThe bill would terminate the emergency declaration that Trump made in July and, as a result, lift the tariffs that were imposed on Brazilian goods as a result. \n\nThe vote was led by Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen and Ron Wyden along with Paul. It's one of several resolutions Democrats plan to force votes on this week aimed at curbing the tariffs. \n\nThough the resolution is focused specifically on Brazil, the vote comes as the administration's trade policy has been a key focus of Trump's ongoing Asia trip.\n\n\"President Trump's tariffs on Brazilian goods, which he imposed in an attempt to stop Brazil's prosecution of one of his friends, are outrageous,\" Kaine said in a statement. \"Prices for all kinds of everyday goods -- including coffee, much of which is imported from Brazil -- are climbing. We must stop Trump from starting these incompetent and chaotic trade wars that are weakening our economy. I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for the principle that our economic policy should advance Americans' best interests, not ridiculous personal grievances.\"\n\nThis sort of resolution is privileged, so there was nothing the Republican majority could do to prevent it from being brought up for a vote.\n\nOther Republicans have in the past supported efforts to curtail Trump's tariff power. \n\nMurkowski, Collins and Sen. Mitch McConnell joined Paul in an effort earlier this year to approve similar legislation that would have repealed Trump's tariffs on Canada. Their support, combined with Democrats, was enough for that legislation to clear the upper chamber in April. \n\nBut the House never took it up and it's highly unlikely that it would take up any other bill that the Senate passes aimed at curtailing Trump's tariffs. Even if the House were to take up the bill, any resolution would also have to be signed by Trump, who would certainly reject it. \n\nDuring a closed-door Republican lunch earlier Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance urged Republicans to vote against the resolution.\n\n\"If you look at what we're doing in Asia, if you look at all of the trade deals, the trade barriers that have been dropped by foreign countries on American consumers, they are happening because the president United States has been willing to use tariffs to give American workers and American farmers a better deal,\" Vance said. \"To vote against that is to strip that incredible leverage for the president United States.

The joint chiefs said South Korea and the United States were analyzing the weapons and maintaining a combined defense readiness capable of a “dominant response” against any North Korean provocation.\n\nThe North Korean report came hours before an expected summit between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju, where South Korea is hosting this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings.\n\nKCNA said the tests were attended by senior military official Pak Jong Chon, who also inspected training for sailors aboard North Korea’s newly developed destroyers Choe Hyon and Kang Kon, which leader Kim Jong Un has described as key assets in his efforts to strengthen the navy.\n\nNorth Korea’s latest launches followed short-range ballistic missile tests last week that it said involved a new hypersonic system designed to strengthen its nuclear war deterrent.\n\nTrump has expressed interest in meeting with Kim during his stay in South Korea, where he is also scheduled to hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, South Korean officials have said a Trump–Kim meeting is unlikely.\n\nNorth Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president’s first term. \n\nKim’s top foreign policy priority is now Russia. In recent months, he has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to help fuel President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, while embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and positions his country as part of a united front against the U.S.-led West.\n\nLast month, Kim reiterated he wouldn’t return to talks with the United States unless Washington drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.","summary":"North Korea says it test-fired cruise missiles ahead of Trump’s visit to South Korea  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missiles-611a288d8f6cb02f5d43bb5db70204f8","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/b40f542/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5000x3333+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F93%2F57%2F876dc37782c2c62c98dcd0a15050%2Ff71498b621b14dd9980fb2aadd425892","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:18:00","author":"Kim Tong-Hyung","authors":["Kim Tong-Hyung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":373532882,"title":"Venezuela declares Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister persona non grata","text":"Venezuela has declared Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister a persona non grata, as the two countries continue to feud over United States military activity in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nOn Tuesday, Venezuela’s National Assembly voted in favour of the sanction against Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who has been sparring with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. It designates her as unwelcome in the country and bars her from entering.\n\nAsked a day earlier about the prospect, Persad-Bissessar told the news agency AFP: “Why would they think I would want to go to Venezuela?”\n\nThe two countries – separated by a small bay just 11km (7 miles) wide at its narrowest point – have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over the US military activity in the region.\n\nPersad-Bissessar is one of the few Caribbean leaders to applaud the build-up of US military forces in the Caribbean as well as its bombing campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats.\n\n“I, along with most of the country, am happy that the US naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Persad-Bissessar said shortly after the first missile strike was announced on September 2.\n\n“I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all, violently.”\n\nBut that stance has put her at odds with Maduro’s government. Just this week, Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs Yvan Gil Pinto told the United Nations General Assembly that the US strikes were an “illegal and completely immoral military threat hanging over our heads”.\n\nLegal experts have compared the bombing campaign with extrajudicial killings, citing likely violations of international law. At least 13 strikes have occurred so far against 14 maritime vessels, most of them small boats.\n\nAn estimated 57 people have been killed in the US attacks. Their identities are unknown, and no definitive evidence has been provided to the public so far to link them to drug trafficking.\n\nRelations frayed over US strikes\n\nLabelling Persad-Bissessar a persona non grata is just the latest chapter in the tit-for-tat between the two countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, AFP reported that Trinidad and Tobago was considering a “mass deportation” of undocumented migrants, most of whom are Venezuelans, from its territory.\n\nAccording to a memorandum reviewed by the news agency, Trinidad and Tobago’s homeland security minister, Roger Alexander, ordered a halt to any planned releases of “illegal immigrants” in detention.\n\n“Consideration is currently being given to the implementation of a mass deportation exercise,” the memo said.\n\nThat comes after Maduro ordered the “immediate suspension” of a major gas deal with Trinidad and Tobago on Monday, citing the island nation’s reception of a US warship.\n\nThe island is hosting one of several US warships deployed near Venezuelan waters by President Donald Trump. Venezuelan officials have accused the US president of seeking to overturn Maduro’s government.\n\nIn cancelling the gas deal, Maduro accused Persad-Bissessar of transforming the Caribbean nation “into an aircraft carrier of the American empire against Venezuela”.\n\nThe Pentagon has so far deployed seven warships, a submarine, drones and fighter jets to the Caribbean, as well as another warship to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe rate of the US bombing campaign has increased in recent weeks, with six strikes announced over the last week alone.\n\nIts scope has also broadened, with strikes taking place this month in the Eastern Pacific Ocean near Colombia, as well as the Caribbean waters off Venezuela’s shores.\n\nSome observers believe the Trump administration is using the US military to pressure and destabilise Maduro, who was re-elected last year in what the US has dismissed as a fraudulent election.\n\nPersad-Bissessar, however, has been steadfast in her support of the US campaign, saying she would rather see drug traffickers “blown to pieces” than have them contribute to deaths in her country.","summary":"Tensions have grown between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago over support for US military action in the Caribbean.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/venezuela-declares-trinidad-and-tobagos-prime-minister-persona-non-grata?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-26T182701Z_622383655_RC2LJHACRXAE_RTRMADP_3_USA-MILITARY-CARIBBEAN-TRINIDAD-1761688757.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-28 23:16:26","author":"Abby Rogers,Apps Support","authors":["Abby Rogers","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.001}]}
