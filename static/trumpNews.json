The flight, expected to take over 24 hours to reach its destination, marks a significant step in the Trump administration’s renewed efforts to address illegal immigration.\nThis is the first deportation flight to India since President Donald Trump returned to office. Previous deportation flights primarily targeted nearby countries such as Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras.\nThe Trump administration has called upon the US military to assist with its immigration agenda. This includes sending additional troops to the US-Mexico border, utilizing military aircraft for deportation operations, and opening military bases to temporarily house migrants.\nRising Concerns Over Illegal Immigration from India\nPresident Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have expressed concerns over the increasing number of illegal Indian immigrants in the US. These issues were raised during discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.\nRubio specifically addressed the issue of \"irregular immigration\" with Jaishankar. The Indian External Affairs Minister stated that India firmly opposes illegal immigration and has been cooperative in accepting legitimate returns of Indian nationals.\n“Many other illegal activities get joined to it. It is not desirable, and it is not reputationally good. If there are any of our citizens who are not here legally and we are sure they are our citizens, we have been open to their legitimate return to India,” Jaishankar emphasized.\nProductive Call Between Trump and Modi\nThe White House described a recent call between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi as \"productive,\" focusing on expanding bilateral cooperation. Immigration issues were reportedly a key topic of discussion, with Trump expressing confidence that India would \"do what is right\" regarding the repatriation of illegal migrants.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has noted a steady rise in deportations of illegal Indian immigrants in recent years. Royce Murray, Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy at DHS, highlighted this trend in a statement last November.\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India described these deportations as part of a \"regular consular dialogue and arrangement\" with the US. The MEA spokesperson confirmed that India continues to engage in discussions to ensure the orderly and lawful mobility of people between the two nations.\nBroader Implications for US-India Relations\nThe deportation of illegal Indian immigrants comes at a time when US-India relations are evolving, with both countries seeking to deepen cooperation in trade, technology, and defense. The recent deportations underscore the need for both governments to address immigration issues while maintaining strong diplomatic ties.\nAs the US intensifies its efforts to manage illegal immigration, India’s cooperation will play a pivotal role in ensuring a smooth and lawful resolution to these cases. Both nations must continue dialogue to uphold their commitment to legal immigration and bilateral cooperation.\nRead More :Justin Trudeau Says US To Pause Tariffs For 'At Least 30 Days' After 'Good Call' With Trump","summary":"A US military C-17 aircraft departed on Monday carrying illegal Indian migrants back to India, according to a US official who spoke to Reuters.

From Vancouver, supplies are distributed to Calgary or Edmonton and then to Saskatchewan.”\n\nAnd, said Fintrac, suspicious transaction reports are finding China as “the primary country used by actors based in Canada for sourcing precursor chemicals and lab equipment, such as industrial pumps and pill presses.”\n\nTrump also proposes to slap China with tariffs but only at a 10 per cent rate.\n\nFintrac does not mention fentanyl being shipped across the U.S. border, however.\n\nAnd last October, prior to Trump’s election victory, federal RCMP in B.C. announced the bust of what it called “most sophisticated drug superlab in Canada.”\n\nBut police stated the drugs being produced were destined for overseas markets and not the United States.\n\nSo how much fentanyl is seized from B.C., according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP)?\n\nA relatively infinitesimal amount.\n\nCBP reported in 2023 it seized more than 27,000 pounds of fentanyl making its way into the U.S. Of that, just two pounds was seized crossing from Canada. And of that, just one pound made its way across from B.C., or more specifically the Blaine and Spokane sectors of CBP.\n\nBy comparison, CBP seized 26,700 pounds along the southwest border of Mexico and 303 pounds in the “coastal/interior” region.\n\nIn 2024, CBP seized 21,900 pounds of fentanyl with only 43 pounds coming from the Canadian border and 24 pounds coming from the Blaine and Spokane (B.C.) sectors.\n\nOn Feb. 3, the U.S. Mission to Canada issued a fact sheet statement that again cited the Fintrac report but only acknowledged with more detail the seizures on the southern border: “Last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than four billion people. It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.”\n\nCanada is a member of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee “to address firearms trafficking associated with illicit drug production and distribution under the auspices of the North American Drug Dialogue,” according to the Privy Council Office on Feb. 9, 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, other factors appear at play for Trump in potentially imposing tariffs, such as a trade imbalance between Canada and the U.S. and Trump’s invitation for Canada to become the 51st American state, a notion roundly dismissed by the vast majority of Canadians (82 per cent according to a Leger poll).\n\nOn Feb. 1, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the country and spoke to Trump administration concerns of the Canadian border: “Our border is already safe and secure, but there’s always, always more work to do. Less than one per cent of fentanyl, less than one per cent of illegal crossings into the United States come from Canada.\n\n“But hearing concerns from both Canadians and Americans, including the American president himself, we’re taking action. We launched a $1.3-billion border plan that is already showing results, because we, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl, a drug that has torn apart communities and caused so much pain and torment for countless families across Canada, just like in the United States,” added Trudeau.","summary":"In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 21,900 pounds of fentanyl with only 43 pounds coming from the Canadian border and 24 pounds coming from the Blaine and Spokane (B.C.) sectors.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/trump-cited-bc-fentanyl-crime-before-pausing-tariff-threat-10178150","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/via/images/tourism/metro-vancouver-travel-tip-border-wait-cbsa-yvr.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 01:00:00","author":"Graeme Wood","authors":["Graeme Wood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":286788824,"title":"Monday, February 3.

Day 1,076.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Russia blasted Ukraine with a massive bombardment, launching 42 missiles and 123 drones in a coordinated assault, marking the first large-scale attack since Jan. 15. Ukrainian air defense forces intercepted 56 drones, while an additional 61 were neutralized by electronic warfare systems. In an unusual departure from protocol, the Air Force refrained from providing specifics on intercepted missiles, but did indicate that a “significant” share of the missiles failed to reach their targets. Still, some ballistic missile strikes caused significant damage.\n\nIn central Poltava oblast, or region, a missile struck an apartment building in the regional capital, collapsing a section of the building and killing 14 people, including three children, and injuring 20 others.\n\nOdesa region. On the evening of Jan. 31, Russian forces launched a missile strike on the historic center of Odesa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, damaging 19 cultural landmarks. The Norwegian foreign ministry said that its diplomats were caught up in Russia’s attack on Ukraine's largest port city, located on the Black Sea in the country’s south.\n\nDonetsk region. On Feb. 3, local authorities reported that six civilians were killed in artillery strikes across Ukraine’s eastern oblast.\n\nRussian forces seized 125 square miles of Ukrainian territory in January, the smallest gains since August 2024. Prior to December 2024, the data painted an increasingly ominous trajectory, with Russian territorial gains escalating from 140 square miles in August to a peak of 280 in November, before receding to 150 in December and 125 in January. Though the rate of expansion has tapered and Ukraine, seemingly, has managed to decelerate Moscow's advance, this period still constitutes the most rapid territorial encroachment by Russia since spring 2022.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nUSAID Controversy Live Updates: Marco Rubio Suggests Some Parts Will ‘Reorganize’—Rest ‘May Be Abolished’\n\n‘A Tidal Wave Of Fear’—Trump Tariffs Fuel Price Crash Fears For Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP And Crypto\n\nTrump Tariffs Live Updates: Proposed Tariffs On Canada And Mexico Paused For 30 Days\n\nThe final year of the Biden administration was plagued by delays in critical military aid to Ukraine amid concerns over escalating the conflict with Russia. Driven by internal debates and congressional approval delays, the holdups were most severe early in 2024, and persisted until the November reelection of Donald Trump sparked action due to fears that he might dramatically cut or halt assistance. Despite earlier setbacks, the administration fast-tracked large tranches of aid after the election, recognizing the urgency of securing continued support for Ukraine amid mounting security risks.\n\nElon Musk, who is heading the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency under President Donald Trump, announced the shutdown of USAID and closed its Washington headquarters on Feb. 3. Musk, echoing Trump's long-standing criticism of the US Agency for International Development, called it \"beyond repair,\" with the administration enacting a freeze on foreign aid that has disrupted global humanitarian programs.\n\nIn 2024, USAID funding for Ukraine shrank by two thirds compared to 2023 ($5.4 billion versus $16 billion), with aid focused primarily on the nation's economic development. Since the onset of the war, Ukraine has received more than $30 billion in aid from the agency, solidifying its current position as the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission has documented an alarming rise in the execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces, with 79 executions recorded in 24 separate incidents since August 2024. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha decried the killings as proof of Russia's barbarity and called for the international community to urgently bolster the legal framework for ensuring accountability.\n\nThe UN mission corroborated its findings with video and photographic evidence from both Ukrainian and Russian sources, underscoring disturbing findings that some Russian officials have openly incited the execution and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners. Ukraine’s Prosecutor General's Office is investigating 49 cases involving the execution of 124 prisoners of war, with executions rising sharply in late 2023 and reaching unprecedented levels in 2024. The largest extrajudicial execution occurred in October 2024, when the Russian army executed 16 Ukrainian POWs who had surrendered near the frontline city of Pokrovsk in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nFor January 2025, Ukraine reduced its electricity imports by half from the previous month, dropping to below 0.2 GWh, with one-third of the supply sourced from Poland. This reduction was driven by milder winter temperatures, which eased the demand for heating. However, imports were still 50% higher than the previous January. For 2024, Ukraine's annual electricity imports surged to a decade-high of 4.4 GWh, while exports plummeted to a historic low of 0.35 GWh.\n\nCulture Front. Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov won the Sundance Film Festival’s Directing Award in the World Cinema Documentary category for “2000 Meters to Andriivka,” a gripping account of Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive to liberate Ukrainian territory from Russian occupation. The documentary follows a platoon from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade as they fight to reclaim the strategically vital village of Andriivka in Donetsk, navigating treacherous minefields and dense forests over a brutal three-month campaign.\n\nThe film's haunting score, composed by two-time Grammy winner Sam Slater (“Chernobyl” and “Joker”), amplifies its raw intensity. Chernov, who is known for his Oscar-winning documentary “20 Days in Mariupol” and who in 2024 was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, describes the film as a deeply personal exploration of modern warfare and its profound human toll.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has devastated the nation's cultural heritage, with over 1,330 monuments and 2,185 cultural infrastructure sites damaged, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Culture. In January 2025 alone, 78 additional sites were hit, primarily in Ukraine's south. The destruction spans 18 regions, with the Russia-bordering Kharkiv region suffering the most losses (324 sites). More than 400 cultural sites (nearly 20% of the total) have been completely destroyed, including 1,050 community centers, 780 libraries, 165 art education institutions, 120 museums, and 39 theaters. The full extent of destruction in Russian-occupied areas remains unclear due to restricted access for international and Ukrainian observers.","summary":"Dispatches from Ukraine.

While these two serve different purposes, of course (gold as a store of value and oil as an energy source), it’s reasonable to wonder whether their prices influence each other. Understanding the relationship can provide insights for managing a trading account or building a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe role of gold and oil in global economics\n\nGold and oil are two of the most traded commodities worldwide, but they have distinct roles in the global economy. Gold has long been viewed as a safe haven asset, maintaining its value during economic uncertainty. Investors often turn to it when inflation rises, currencies weaken, or geopolitical tensions escalate.\n\nOil, meanwhile, plays a huge, active role in modern industry. Its price reflects global economic activity, as demand for oil increases when economies expand. Supply factors, such as geopolitical conflicts in oil-producing regions or changes in production levels, also play a significant role in determining prices.\n\nThese differing functions mean that the factors driving gold and oil prices often differ.\n\nHistorical patterns and correlations\n\nWhen observing the relationship between gold and oil prices, it’s noticeable that their movements are not consistently linked. Over certain periods, there may be a positive correlation, meaning that when oil prices rise, gold prices increase too. At other times, the relationship weakens or even reverses.\n\nFor example, during times of inflation, both gold and oil prices may rise simultaneously. Oil price increases can contribute to inflation by raising production and transportation costs, while gold often attracts investors as a hedge against inflation. This dynamic can create a temporary link between the two assets.\n\nOn the other hand, periods of economic instability can reduce the correlation. If oil prices fall due to oversupply, it doesn’t necessarily mean gold prices will follow. Gold’s price may respond more to interest rates or currency fluctuations.\n\nThe US dollar’s impact\n\nThe US dollar plays a key role in the relationship between gold and oil. Both commodities are priced in dollars on international markets, meaning their value often inversely correlates with the dollar’s strength. When the dollar weakens, gold and oil prices tend to rise because they become cheaper for holders of other currencies.\n\nThis relationship with the dollar can sometimes make it appear as though gold and oil are directly related. In reality, the dollar’s movements often act as an intermediary force that influences both commodities.\n\nGeopolitics and market sentiment\n\nGeopolitical events often affect both gold and oil markets, further complicating their relationship. For example, conflicts in oil-producing regions can lead to supply disruptions, driving oil prices higher. At the same time, heightened geopolitical risks may mean investors turn to gold as a safe haven asset.\n\nMarket sentiment also plays a role. During financial crises or periods of economic uncertainty, both gold and oil may see price increases due to shifts in investor behavior. An investor may use their trading account to allocate funds toward these commodities as part of a strategy to manage risk or capitalize on market volatility.\n\nDifferences in demand drivers\n\nThere are some overlaps, but the fundamental demand drivers for gold and oil differ substantially. Gold’s demand comes from jewelry, central bank reserves, and investment.\n\nOil is primarily driven by industrial use and transportation needs. So macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, industrial production, and consumer demand tend to have a more direct impact on oil prices.\n\nGold prices, in contrast, are more sensitive to monetary policy, inflation expectations, and shifts in investor sentiment.\n\nInvestment strategies\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between gold and oil can offer insight for traders and investors. Historical patterns can serve as a guide, but market dynamics often change due to evolving economic conditions or unexpected events.\n\nSome investors may use the perceived relationship as part of a hedging strategy. For example, during inflationary periods, holding both gold and oil could provide protection against rising prices. Others may look for opportunities in diverging trends, such as when one commodity rises sharply while the other remains relatively stable.\n\nInvestors often follow news on both gold and oil prices. In mid-January, Yahoo Finance reported that the price of gold rose more than 30% over the past year, and asked their readers whether they thought the “gold price would reach fresh highs this year”. 62% of voters believed gold could reach new records, with 22% disagreeing and 16% undecided.\n\nAfter Donald Trump won the US election, it was predicted that oil prices would rise in 2025 after three-year lows. \n\nWhile gold and oil prices can sometimes move in tandem, their relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors. Understanding the distinct roles of these commodities, their demand drivers and the external forces affecting prices can help traders make more informed decisions.","summary":"The financial markets are a web of interconnected elements, but is there a notable relationship between gold and oil prices?

They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.\n\n“The scale of this is quite stunning,” O’Hara said.\n\nResearchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.\n\n“We are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,” O’Hara said.\n\nOn Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was “unavailable due to maintenance.”\n\nThe CDC’s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: “CDC’s website is being modified to comply with President Trump’s Executive Orders.” The agency’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.\n\nCDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome researchers took steps to make sure federal information stays available. On Monday, the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association posted federal STD data and treatment guidelines that were hastily downloaded from the CDC website Thursday night.\n\n“Taxpayers paid to collect those data, to analyze those data, and to make them public for people to use,” explained Abigail Norris Turner, an Ohio State University medical researcher who is the association’s president.\n\n“Executive orders don’t change who has STIs or who needs evidence-based care for them,” she added. “We wanted to make sure that rigorous information continued to be available to people to provide the best possible care.”\n\nThe U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.\n\n“This sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don’t like,” said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. “Regardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.”\n\nIn a joint statement, the presidents of the Population Association of America and the Association of Population Centers called the takedowns “unacceptable” and called on Congress and the Trump administration to restore the datasets.\n\nPaul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, said people looking for data may have to resort to suing for access or submitting Freedom of Information Act requests for the datasets.\n\n“The removal of several public datasets from agency websites goes against everything the statistical agencies stand for and were intended for,” Schroeder said Monday. “Public data users are being left in the dark about what is going on.”\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Florida.

It would seem that in Trump’s mind, women and people of color are not qualified for challenging safety tasks. All this while responders were pulling bodies out of the Potomac River a few miles away — “heartbreaking work,” according to the D.C. fire chief.\n\nI am old enough to remember President Reagan’s words after the Challenger disaster.

Dr. Atul Gawande, former assistant administrator for Global Health at USAID, recently said pausing the work of USAID is like “pausing” an airplane in flight. Despite assurances to exempt life-saving programs, the administration’s ignorance, ineptitude, and refusal to follow law and honor agreements and contracts has already caused loss of life.\n\nNational security is sometimes likened to a stool supported by these three legs: defense, diplomacy and development. The administration’s pause of previously ongoing programs around the world is destroying U.S. development expertise, credibility, respect and trust. If the Republican-led federal legislative and judicial branches don’t exert their independence and check the Trump administration’s destruction of our national security stool’s leg of development, the fault is on us citizens for allowing that destruction.\n\nJim Driggers\n\nMusk’s team should be\nregulating drug prices\n\nRe: “Elon Musk’s team gains access to the Treasury Department’s payments system” (Page A5, Feb. 2).\n\nTrump’s new Department of Government Efficiency headed by Elon Musk could make Medicare less costly by regulating (not deregulating) the prices of prescription drugs, thus preventing big pharmaceutical companies from enriching themselves on the backs of the working class and gouging the American taxpayer.\n\nOne wonders if Musk and his team of billionaires own Big Pharma stocks, clearly a conflict of interests.\n\nJeanne Kinkella\nSan Leandro\n\nCowardice in Congress\nhasn’t changed much\n\nShirley Chisolm, the first Black woman elected to Congress in 1969, made the following observation: “It is incomprehensible to me, the fear that can affect men in political offices. It is shocking the way they submit to forces they know are wrong and fail to stand up for what they believe. Can their jobs be so important to them, their prestige, their power, their privileges so important that they will cooperate in the degradation of our society just to hang on to those jobs?”\n\nMaybe we haven’t come so far after all.\n\nRichard Ackerman\nCastro Valley\n\nIn the wake of tragedy,\nTrump seeks to divide\n\nAmericans have traditionally come together to support each other in times of disaster.\n\nUnfortunately, President Trump and his administration are taking a different path.\n\nIn the face of the catastrophic Los Angeles fires, Trump erroneously blamed California’s Bay-Delta water policies and has threatened to make Federal disaster aid contingent on political concessions from California.\n\nFollowing the horrific mid-air collision over the Potomac, Trump and his newly installed Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, made the specious claim that DEI initiatives were somehow linked to the accident, justifying their recent orders banning such programs.\n\nThis pattern of spreading disinformation and lies to exploit tragedies for political leverage is contemptible.\n\nAs Americans, we need to reject such divisive politics.\n\nDouglas Medlin","summary":"Also: USAID pause &#124; Musk's team &#124; Congressional cowardice &#124; Trump divides.

Those still in the system received emails saying that “at the direction of Agency leadership” the headquarters building “will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.” USAID's website and its account on the X platform have also been taken down.Trump told reporters on Monday that shutting down USAID \"should have been done a long time ago\", although he conceded that \"loved the concept of it\" during his first term in office.Asked whether he needs Congress to approve such a measure, the president said he did not think so.\"I don't know, I don't think so. No, we've, not when it comes to fraud, if there's fraud, these people are lunatics. And if if it comes to fraud, you wouldn't have an act of Congress. And I'm not sure that you would anyway. But we just want to do the right thing. That's, it's something that should have been done a long time ago, went crazy during the Biden administration,\" Trump said.Meanwhile, Musk is leading a civilian review of the federal government with Trump's agreement, announcing on a live session of X Spaces that he had spoken with Trump at length about the agency and “he agreed we should shut it down.”“It became apparent that it's not an apple with a worm it in,” Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early on Monday. “What we have is just a ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s beyond repair.”Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk’s government-inspection teams, a current and a former US official said.Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. US media reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk’s team accessing sensitive information.The closure of USAID is part of a Trump administration crackdown that’s hitting across the federal government and its programmes.The US is the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid, and the moves have upended decades of US policy that put humanitarian, development and security assistance in the centre of efforts to build alliances and counter adversaries such as China and Russia. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have made the US foreign assistance program a special target, accusing it of waste and advancing liberal social programs.The US spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other countries. Trump accused the Biden administration of fraud, without giving any evidence and only promising a report later on.Democrats push backThe fast-moving developments at USAID have emerged as a particularly controversial flashpoint with Democrats who argue it symbolises the massive power Musk is wielding over Washington.Lawmakers sought to enter USAID offices in Washington, saying they wanted to speak to any staffers remaining about the dismantling of the agency. Department of Homeland Security officers and men identifying themselves as USAID employees blocked them. “Elon Musk's not here,” one told the lawmakers.Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called it an “illegal power grab” and said it was “a corrupt abuse of power that is going on.”“It’s not only a gift to our adversaries, but trying to shut down the Agency for International Development by executive order is plain illegal,” he said.Democrats said court challenges already were in the works and pledged to try to block approval of Trump’s State Department nominations until the shutdown is reversed. Democrats are in the minority in the House and Senate after last November’s elections, leaving them with reduced leverage.What is USAID?Kennedy created USAID at the height of the United States’ Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union. He wanted a more efficient way to counter Soviet influence abroad through foreign assistance and saw the State Department as frustratingly bureaucratic at doing that.Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act and Kennedy set up USAID as an independent agency in 1961.USAID has outlived the Soviet Union, which fell in 1991. Today, supporters of USAID argue that US assistance in countries counters Russian and Chinese influence. China has its own “belt and road” foreign aid program worldwide operating in many countries that the US also wants as partners.","summary":"Thousands of USAID employees have been laid off and programmes shut down around the world in the two weeks since Trump became president and imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/04/donald-trump-and-elon-musk-work-to-shut-down-us-humanitarian-aid-agency","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/02/74/56/1440x810_cmsv2_94e71c65-1be5-5328-8cf8-d3e1236eff6c-9027456.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:29:36","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":286784686,"title":"‘Stay of execution’: Albertans take in 30-day Trump tariff pause with trepidation","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again threat to impose damaging tariffs on Canada are off again — at least, for the next 30 days.\n\nFollowing a phone conversation Monday afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Trump is pausing the threatened 25 per cent tariffs on most Canadian goods that was set to take effect Tuesday.\n\nTrudeau said he and Trump discussed Canada’s $1.3 billion border plan, which includes helicopter patrols, and announced $200 million in new initiatives to address fentanyl trafficking.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was “greatly heartened” to see the two sides find common ground.\n\n“The appointment of a Canadian fentanyl czar with authority to coordinate a massive joint effort with the United Stated to target fentanyl traffickers is something Alberta has been calling for since it became clear in our discussions with U.S. elected representatives and administration officials that this would be a critical part of reaching a deal to avoid tariffs,” Smith said in a statement online Monday afternoon.\n\n“Diplomacy has won the day.

When speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump repeated that he wants to see Canada become the 51st state.\n\nWith the reason for the tariffs seeming to change almost daily — Trump has cited everything from fentanyl and illegal border crossings to trade imbalances and more recently, American bank and business access to Canada’s finance sector — political analysts say it’s hard to pin his motivation.\n\n“It’s difficult to know what the actual reason for the for the tariffs is,” said Mount Royal University political scientist Lori Williams.\n\nAlberta businesses that rely on trade with America, such as those in the oil and gas industry, are cautiously optimistic about the deadline being kicked down the road.\n\n“It shows, I think, that the U.S. relies on us and that maybe there’s a path of avoiding this altogether,” said Richard Masson, a energy expert at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy.\n\n“But I don’t think it provides a level of certainty everybody needs to say, ‘Okay, it’s business as usual.'” \n\n Tweet This\n Click to share quote on Twitter: \"But I don't think it provides a level of certainty everybody needs to say, 'Okay, it's business as usual.'\"\n\nThat uncertainty is a challenge for Alberta’s oil patch, which ships 95 to 97 per cent of Canada’s oil south of the border – making up about 60 per cent of U.S. crude oil imports.\n\nTrump had said while he was applying a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian products, energy goods like oil and gas would receive a lower 10 per cent tax.\n\n“That does suggest that there is room for maneuvering, but the success on energy probably owes at least as much to the fact that the United States needs that energy,” Williams said, explaining Americans would see a jump at the gas pump.\n\n“There would be direct consequences and fairly immediate consequences.” \n\n Tweet This\n Click to share quote on Twitter: \"There would be direct consequences and fairly immediate consequences.\"\n\nMasson said until the tariff issue is settled for good, oil executives are going to be hesitant to make significant decisions.\n\n“It’s going to make it harder for boardrooms to approve capital spending,” he said.\n\nOthers in Alberta say this isn’t a bullet dodged.\n\n“I fear this is a temporary stay of execution,” said Adam Legge, president of the Business Council of Alberta, a non-partisan and non-profit think tank based in Calgary.\n\nExperts remain concerned about tariffs stripping away at Alberta’s economic growth and how that could impact the province’s job market, Legge said.\n\n“That could be somewhere between 60,000 and 90,000 jobs lost in Alberta, if this is prolonged,” Legge said.\n\nFor others, the tariff situation is a wake-up call to explore more manufacturing on the Canadian side of the border, as talks continue on the Prairie Economic Gateway — an industrial partnership to build an inland port in Calgary.\n\n“If we’re trying to create that stability of having our own supply of goods, that bodes well for our entire country,” said Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek.\n\nSeveral provinces were scrambling late Monday to reverse plans to implement non-tariff measures.\n\nMany provinces were poised to remove products like American liquor from store shelves — some had already done so by Monday – but news of the reprieve put those retaliatory efforts on pause.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said American alcohol products will not be removed from LCBO shelves, now that the threat has been paused for 30 days.\n\nThe premier said if the tariffs are imposed, he will not hesitate to launch retaliatory action, including prohibiting American companies from provincial procurement contracts and taking the booze back off the shelves.\n\nThe Manitoba government is also pausing plans to remove U.S. alcohol products from liquor stores and cut off American companies from provincial government contracts.\n\nManitoba Premier Wab Kinew says it shows that Canadians are effective when they stand up for themselves.\n\nQuebec Premier François Legault welcomed the “good news” but laments that “uncertainty remains.” American products will also return to Quebec liquor stores shelves.\n\nThe Ontario government has also paused plans to cancel a $100 million contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink to improve rural broadband.\n\nEdmonton’s mayor says there’s no logical reason for Trump to keep mulling tariffs. On Monday, he urged residents to keep their money in the community.\n\n“I would encourage Edmontonians to buy local.

Monday's event also came on the heels of street protests Sunday in California and elsewhere.\n\nNoel Xavier, organizing director for the North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters, said that while it’s important to remind the country of the value migrant workers bring to the communities they toil in, many workers couldn't afford to take a day off.\n\n“If I don’t go to work today, that’s one day less that I have, you know, to be able to pay for my next rent,” Xavier said of the prevailing sentiment among the workers he organizes. “I didn’t see this big rallying around being able to do that, or having the luxury to be able to do that.”\n\nJaime di Paulo, president of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, noted that small restaurants and retailers in Chicago’s biggest Latino neighborhoods closed, but most major employers as well as those in construction and other industries were operating normally.\n\n“This is only hurting our own community,” he said. \n\nAndrea Toro decided to close her hair salon in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. She added that many of her clients are teachers and have seen children missing school since Trump took office last month because they fear it may not be safe to go. In Chicago, as in San Diego, school districts said some students and families were participating in Monday’s protest.\n\n“If we don’t have immigrants, we don’t have anything work around here,” said Toro, who is from Puerto Rico. \"If we’re mute, we’re in silence, then they’re going to do whatever they want.\"\n\nEl Burrito Mercado, which boomed from a small Latino market in the 1970s to one of the most widely recognized restaurant, catering and grocery businesses in St. Paul, Minnesota, shut for the whole day in 2017 — when the latest major such event was held at the beginning of the first Trump administration. \n\nBut on Monday, it stayed open for a few hours with a skeleton crew, said co-owner Milissa Silva.\n\nHer parents emigrated from Mexico, and most of the 90 employees have Mexican roots. But many staffers expressed concern about losing a work day and about depriving people in the neighborhood of access to groceries.\n\nSimilarly, the Spanish-immersion day care provider Tierra Encantada kept its 14 locations open. But many parents decided to keep their children home Monday in solidarity with the mostly first and second-generation immigrant workforce, said CEO Kristen Denzer. \n\nFamilies — most of them not immigrants — pulled some 450 children from day care and preschool, about 70% of those enrolled in Minnesota alone, where most of the organization's centers are, Denzer said. Several staffers who had been on the fence decided to take the day after the show of support.\n\nIn Utah, several Latino-owned stores, restaurants and supermarkets closed their doors.\n\n“The movement today, it’s more about being compassionate,” said state Sen. Luz Escamilla, a Democrat and Senate minority leader. “A lot of companies and communities are coming together in the state just to raise awareness of how much this has created a fear.”\n\nAsked about the day of protest at his Monday media availability, Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, a Republican, defended Trump’s immigration policies and said law-abiding immigrants should have nothing to worry about.\n\n“The only people that are being talked about being deported (are) those that are criminals, those that are on probation, those bad people who have committed difficult crimes,” Adams said.\n\nWhile immigration enforcement officers continue to target for deportation migrants considered public safety and national security threats, a big change from the Biden administration is that officers can now arrest people without legal status if they run across them during operations. \n\nDell'Orto reported from Minneapolis and Perez Winder from Chicago.

Rollins was passed favorably out of committee on a unanimous vote. Rollins, who served as a White House aide during Trump's first administration and then as the president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, is widely viewed as an uncontroversial nominee. TRUMP TAPS TEXAN BROOKE ROLLINS AS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY Her nomination earned the backing of a coalition of more than 415 farmers, agricultural, and growers groups earlier this month. Signatories urged the Senate to swiftly confirm Rollins, praising what they described as her foundational knowledge of agriculture, as well as her policy and business bona fides that they said made her uniquely qualified for the role of U.S. agriculture secretary.

The lawsuit primarily alleges that the disclosure of hundreds of millions of personal financial records that are part of the system is unlawful and must be stopped.\n\nAs discussed earlier, Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) handles more than 1 billion financial transactions annually for the U.S. government, both outgoing grants and payments and incoming tax receipts. While serving as the largest cash management operation in the world, BFS collects personal and financial information about the people and businesses on the other side of the transactions, including “names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, birth places, home addresses and telephone numbers, email addresses, and bank account information.” This is all kept inside government databases governed by federal privacy laws, both the Privacy Act of 1974 and, in the case of taxpayer information, statutory IRS rules governing disclosure.\n\nThe Alliance of Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the Service Employees International Union filed the suit in D.C. District Court. Every member of these organizations likely has personal information in the hands of the BFS.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Scott Bessent, the new Treasury Secretary, violated the law by pushing out David Lebryk, the senior civil servant in charge of the payment system, and giving DOGE access to data and computer networks. Any change of this type requires Treasury to give a “system of records notice” (SORN) in the Federal Register for 30 days, while allowing public comment.\n\nUnder the Privacy Act, no disclosure of any record can be given unless “the individual to whom a record pertains” (in this case, practically every American) consents, or an exception applies. The exceptions would be if officers and employees of the agency “have a need for the record in the performance of their duties,” or if there’s a “routine use” stipulated in the SORN. For IRS records, only statutory authorization allows disclosure of returns to those who are not involved in tax administration.\n\nBy not making any public announcement or going through any process justifying the change, Bessent violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the complaint alleges. There has clearly been no consent to record disclosure on the part of the public. And it’s completely unclear who now has access to the BFS data records, and whether they are employees of the BFS, the Treasury Department, or even the federal government.\n\nTom Krause, the current CEO of Cloud Software Group, is allegedly a Treasury Department official and a “liaison” to DOGE who is leading the team with access to the payment system. Few other details on the plan have been released. Even if everyone with access is a Treasury employee, which is unknown, they may not be directly involved with tax administration, or may not need the records in the performance of their duties or for routine use. If so, that would violate the Privacy Act and IRS statutes.\n\nMusk has been boasting that his team is “rapidly shutting down… illegal payments,” which the plaintiffs cite in the lawsuit. Even if they have no ability to manipulate payments yet, having access to individual personal information could violate privacy statutes.\n\n“Retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies, and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords,” the complaint reads. Because no fine would likely serve as a remedy, the plaintiffs ask for an injunction to separate DOGE from the payment system.\n\nIt’s interesting that the plaintiffs decided to go with privacy violations as the primary rationale for the lawsuit. There are any number of ways that Musk and DOGE could violate the law by commandeering the payment system, but until they actually stop a payment, many of them are theoretical. By contrast, the privacy breach is immediate and continuous.\n\nThat could help them show immediate injury from the action. “I think it is a strong argument. My only concern is whether they can show they are injured and have standing to sue for this,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC-Berkeley Law School. Whether the courts agree that the privacy laws have been breached will settle the standing argument.\n\n“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has allowed unelected billionaires and their lackeys unfettered access to the personal and financial information of Americans,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, in a statement. “Together, we can stop this violation of American citizens’ privacy.”\n\nThere’s also an extreme irony with the lawsuit. One of the claims is that DOGE violated strict rules around release of taxpayer information. The last person to be convicted of that crime was Charles Littlejohn, who released the tax returns of Elon Musk and Donald Trump, among others, to make the point that mega-billionaires paid little or nothing in taxes.","summary":"Giving DOGE access to the Treasury Department’s payment system violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and IRS statutes, three plaintiffs allege.","url":"https://prospect.org/justice/2025-02-03-lawsuit-takes-on-musk-payment-system-takeover-on-privacy-grounds/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22457/download/AP20122781004904.jpg?cb=def0af3f3da1175a5ec6a3ab8bc49e25&w=6240","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:20:00","author":"David Dayen","authors":["David Dayen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":286785164,"title":"Trump must remember ‘The Art of the Deal’ in tariff battle — playing the heavy is high-risk","text":"As Donald Trump’s tariff play against Mexico and Canada continues to unfold, it’s important for the president to remember his own most famous concept — “The Art of the Deal.”\n\nThat is, he needs to have some clear, strategic end state in view.

Our efforts are fundamental in trying to attract the best possible talent into the National Football League both on and off the field.\"\n\nThe league has made multiple updates to the rule since 2003 based on feedback from clubs and candidates. \"There's no requirement to hire a particular individual on the basis of race or gender,\" Goodell said. \"It's simply on the basis of looking at a canvas of candidates that reflect our communities and to look at the kind of talent that exists there, and then you make the best decision on who is hired.\n\n\"There are no quotas in our system. This is about opening that funnel and bringing the best talent into the NFL.\"\n\nIn 2021, the rule was updated to require clubs to interview two external minority candidates in person, for head coach and general manager jobs. This hiring cycle, the rule came under scrutiny because several clubs -- the Chicago Bears, New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars -- had head coaching jobs open that were publicly linked to a white candidate before completing their two external minority in-person interviews. As a result, the in-person external minority interview requirement turned into a way for fans to track whether their team was compliant with the Rooney Rule and therefore determine when they were able to hire the leading candidate.\n\nWhen asked if he was concerned about the validity of the interviews extended to minority candidates, Goodell said no.\n\n\"We follow up with the candidates,\" he said. \"We speak about the sincerity and the thoroughness of an interview to make sure that we're doing that in a proper fashion.\"\n\nGoodell said there have been minority candidates he has spoken to who thought otherwise.\n\n\"There have been candidates going back a ways where they didn't feel what was authentic or what they thought was thorough enough,\" Goodell said. \"And so we go back to the clubs and we talk about that, and I think we've made changes to our policy to make sure we deal with that.\"\n\nWhen asked about what the league will do about corporate sponsors that are participating in DEI rollbacks, Goodell said the league doesn't make policies for sponsors or corporations or networks of partners.\n\n\"We have a lot of conversations about the importance of it to us,\" he said. \"There's a lot of conversations that go on about that.\"","summary":"NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he doesn't believe the NFL's policies to promote diversity are in conflict with the Trump administration's efforts to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.","url":"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43682448/roger-goodell-says-nfl-better-diversity-efforts","image":"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0203/r1447179_1296x729_16-9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:18:06","author":"Kalyn Kahler","authors":["Kalyn Kahler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.088},{"id":286785934,"title":"Trump Says Newly Created US Sovereign Wealth Fund Could Buy TikTok","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok.TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19.Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in February.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-newly-created-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-could-buy-tiktok-7628477","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/4sivso_tiktok_625x300_17_May_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:17:38","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":286785892,"title":"'Corrupt' FBI must become 'pristine,' Trump says, asserting Patel will 'straighten it out'","text":"President Donald Trump on Monday slammed the FBI as \"corrupt\" and praised his nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, as the man to \"straighten it out\" as he declined to answer questions over whether his administration will remove bureau employees involved in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. Asked Monday by Fox News whether he believed anyone involved in the Jan. 6 investigation should be fired, Trump did not answer outright. Instead, he criticized the actions of a bureau he has repeatedly decried as \"corrupt,\" and one he insists has targeted him specifically. \"I think the FBI was a very corrupt institution, and I'm a victim of it in the true sense,\" Trump told Fox News while addressing reporters Monday at the Oval Office. He also added that he believes the bureau's reputation has been \"damaged badly, as has the DOJ's.\" \"But you know what? We have to have pristine, beautiful, perfect law enforcement,\" Trump said.

The Trump administration has not yet said if it will move to take action against the individuals involved. But new concerns were raised after Bove sent a 12-page questionnaire to FBI personnel across the country asking them to detail their involvement in the Jan. 6 investigations, noting that the department would begin a \"review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.\" TRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED' The remarks come after Trump, in his second term as president, moved to immediately issue a blanket pardon and sentence commutation for all 1,600 criminal defendants in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, who he has repeatedly referred to as \"hostages.\" Since taking office, Trump has also fired the inspectors general of 17 separate federal agencies, fired more than a dozen prosecutors involved in the special counsel investigations led by Jack Smith and ordered more than half a dozen FBI officials to either resign or retire from their posts or be fired. Combined, the actions have sparked new fears that the FBI could see the ousting of decades of expertise from within the bureau's ranks, including employees well-versed in detecting and responding to counterterrorism threats, organized and violent crime, drug trafficking and more.

Todd Young of Indiana.Newsweek reached out to Gabbard and Young's office via email on Monday evening.Why It MattersPresident Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees have succeeded so far in being confirmed by the full Senate.Secretary of State Marco Rubio was unanimously confirmed, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was confirmed and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth squeaked by after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote to get him confirmed.Gabbard has faced an uphill battle since being tapped for DNI and was grilled last week by senators on both sides of the aisle about her views on Russia and Syria and whether she believed the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden was a \"traitor.\"The Senate Intelligence Committee, which consists of 17 senators, will meet Tuesday to vote on whether to advance Gabbard's nomination to the full Senate.What To KnowRepublican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a key swing vote, announced her support for Gabbard on Monday.\"After extensive consideration of her nomination, I will support Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence,\" Collins said in an emailed statement to Newsweek. \"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, however, has become far larger than it was designed to be, and Ms. Gabbard shares my vision of returning the agency to its intended size.\"Collins added: \"I look forward to working with Ms. Gabbard to strengthen our national security.\"Oklahoma Senator James Lankford was also viewed as a possible no vote but said last month that he would back Gabbard.\"I'm glad to support @TulsiGabbard in her nomination for DNI,\" Lankford wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"702 authority is used to ensure the safety and security of Americans and to track terrorists before they are able to enter the United States. We are stopping attacks before they happen. I am pleased that Tulsi agrees with this position.\"Lankford was referring to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which gives the U.S. authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. citizens located abroad.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also threw his support behind Gabbard on Sunday, saying, \"She demonstrated that she understands the importance of tools we need to protect our national security.\"Young of Indiana is now in the spotlight as a final swing vote on the Senate Intelligence Committee.Politico's Jordain Carney said on X that Young weighed in on Gabbard's nomination, saying, \"You'll hear more from me tomorrow\" and adding that he took part in \"a lot of great conversations\" over the weekend.Young was one of the senators who quizzed Gabbard about her views on Snowden during her confirmation hearing last week.Senate Majority Leader John Thune later told The Hill that Young appeared displeased with Gabbard's answers about Snowden.What People Are SayingCNN's Manu Raju said on X Monday: \"GOP Sen. James Lankford tells us he's a YES on Tulsi Gabbard and spoke to her over the weekend. With Susan Collins backing her now too, it could come down to Sen. Todd Young on whether she has the votes to be approved by Senate Intel tomorrow.\"Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on X: \"Tulsi Gabbard has the experience, the integrity, and the judgment to keep America safe. She will make an outstanding DNI director.\"Elon Musk called Young a \"deep state puppet\" in a since-deleted X post but later wrote: \"Just had an excellent conversation with @SenToddYoung. I stand corrected. Senator Young will be a great ally in restoring power to the people from the vast, unelected bureaucracy.\"In an opinion piece for Newsweek on Monday, Gabbard wrote: \"There were many questions during my confirmation hearing last week about Edward Snowden, who broke the law in 2013 by releasing a massive amount of highly sensitive classified information to the media, which included information that harmed our national security and revealed illegal and unconstitutional government programs that conducted mass surveillance of millions of Americans' data.\"She added: \"Given the interest by committee members about whether Edward Snowden should be called a 'traitor,' here's what I shared with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the closed session about why I do not casually throw around that term: Treason is a capital offense, punishable by death, yet politicians like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former US Senator Mitt Romney have slandered me, Donald Trump Jr. and others with baseless accusations of treason. It is essential to focus on the facts, not the label.

Beattie confirmed his appointment, first reported by Semafor, in a letter on his website, Revolver News. “I have been given the great honor of serving once again in Trump’s administration, this time in the Department of State,” Beattie wrote, adding he was halting his involvement with his website for the time being. “Helping Secretary Rubio and my esteemed colleagues in the State Department fulfill President Trump’s agenda will require every ounce of my focus and energy, and accordingly, I will for the time being suspend my direct editorial involvement in Revolver News,” he said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Revolver News celebrated his appointment in a post sharing his announcement and called it “a real blow to the same smug hacks who love slapping the ‘conspiracy theorist’ label on anyone who challenges their narrative.” Follow live politics updates here Beattie has a history of making inflammatory remarks, including a post on X in October that said: \"Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.

A former professor at Duke University, Beattie was fired from the Trump White House in 2018 after it emerged that he'd appeared at a conference with white nationalists in 2016. He told The Washington Post he'd \"said nothing objectionable and stand by my remarks completely.” In 2019, now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz hired Beattie as a senior adviser. A year later, in the final months of the Trump administration, the White House appointed him to a three-year term with the Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad.

Don Beyer (D-VA).\n\nAaron Fritschner, Congressman Beyer’s deputy chief of staff, posted a photo (below) of their attempt to enter and wrote: “USAID is one of the most cost-effective agencies we have. Their money goes 10-20 times as far as DOD money to project US influence, including vs China. They fight terrorism, hunger, and diseases like Ebola and bird flu. Rich guys are playing us for suckers.”\n\n“Hollywood could not have written a crueler script,” commented Brett Bruen, former Obama White House Director of Global Engagement. “The world’s richest man cuts off lifesaving food & medicine to the world’s poorest.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Check Out Schoolhouse Rock’: JD Vance Schooled on How Government Works\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ) explained that his first job in government was at USAID. “Now seeing the security guards there, instructed to ban and bar USAID employees from getting in today, is absolutely shameful.”\n\nU.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) passionately defended USAID, declaring that it “fights terrorist groups all across this world, making sure that we address the underlying causes for a retreat to terrorism. USAID chases China all around the world, making sure that China doesn’t monopolize contracts for critical minerals and port infrastructure all around the world. It supports freedom fighters everywhere in this world, up until yesterday, delivering firewood, for instance, to the brave Ukrainian defenders on the eastern front.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) vowed to fight “every way we can.”\n\nUSAID “is the lead development agency in the world and no one elected Elon Musk to dismantle it,” Congressman Connolly declared. “We are gonna fight in every way we can. In the courts, in public opinion with the bully pulpit in the halls of Congress and here at USAID itself, we are not going to let this injustice happen.”\n\n“It’s a matter for Congress to deal with not an unelected billionaire oligarch than Elon Musk. And Elon, if you wanna run AD, get nominated by Trump and go to the Senate and good luck in getting confirmed.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), a former constitutional law professor, blasted Musk.\n\n“Elon Musk, you didn’t create USAID, the United States Congress did for the American people. And just like Elon Musk did not create USAID, he doesn’t have the power to destroy it,” Raskin loudly declared, vowing Congress will “stop him.”\n\n“Elon Musk, you may have illegally seized power over the financial payment systems of the United States Department of Treasury, but you don’t control the money of the American people, the United States Congress does that, under Article One of the Constitution. And just like the president who is elected to something, cannot impound the money of the people, we don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk, and that’s gonna become real clear.”\n\n“This is real life, this is serious, and this is dangerous,” warned Rep. John Olszewski (D-MD). He told supporters that Democrats in Congress will do all they can, but they need Americans to act.\n\nWatch the videos above or at this link.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Trump Surgeon General Sounds Alarm on President’s Actions Amid Disease Outbreaks","summary":"Democratic members of the U.S. House and Senate were reportedly blocked on Monday from entering the Washington, D.C. offices of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), an independent agency of the U.S. government, which Congress established by law in 1961.\n\nElon Musk and his associates from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have reportedly been trying to shut the agency down, at one point even declaring, “USAID is a criminal organization.

But investors should be prepared if that relief is only temporary.\n\nTrump’s weekend announcement that 25% tariffs would be imposed on all goods important from Canada and Mexico and imports from China would be taxed at 10% rattled markets, with the S&P 500 index opening the day down 2%. But when Mexico agreed Monday morning to send 10,000 troops to the border to stop illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., Trump agreed to at least a 30-day pause on tariffs for their imports, and stocks recovered most of their losses. The S&P 500 finished the day down 0.8% and erased those losses after hours when Canada’s Justin Trudeau announced a $900 million plan to strengthen its border with additional personnel and helicopters as well.\n\nMission accomplished for now, but the tariffs on China are still taking effect on Tuesday, and those apparent successes may embolden Trump to continue using the threat as an intimidation tactic, and he said over the weekend he expects to impose tariffs on the European Union “soon.”\n\n“What's happened with Colombia and Canada and Mexico primarily have reinforced to President Trump that this is an effective negotiating tool,” says Adrian Helfert, CIO of alternative and mutli-asset portfolios at Westwood, a Dallas-based firm managing $17.7 billion. “None of us should be surprised.”\n\nTo prepare, Helfert recommends finding protection in small and mid-sized businesses that have a more domestic focus, which are still broadly undervalued relative to large caps. He has his eye on U.S. defense stocks like Kratos (KTOS), a manufacturer of military electronics and drones, anticipating that defense spending will be mostly spared from Trump’s threatened cuts to the federal budget. Another area of the market he’s bullish on is regional banks like Texas-based Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR), which will benefit from decreased regulatory costs and more M&A activity and don’t have a large international presence.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, says investors still have reason for optimism across the market, citing the “January barometer” that stocks typically have strong calendar years when they rise in January. The S&P 500 was up 2.7% in the first month of 2025.\n\n“I think that even President Trump does not believe that a trade war is in the U.S.'s best interest,” Stovall says. “He will probably take advantage of any acquiescence on the side of our trading partners and claim victory with that to save face.”\n\nHe recommends following the momentum in sectors like communication services, financials, health care and materials. That means companies like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), which gained 1.7% Monday despite having some facilities in Mexico and Canada, or pharmaceutical firms such as Boston Scientific (BSX) and Quest Diagnostics (DGX). Prologis (PLD), an industrial-focused real estate investment trust, is also likely to do well in the event of a prolonged trade dispute considering its domestic focus, Stovall predicts.\n\nAutomotive stocks were among the most negatively affected at the beginning of the day Monday, but Canada and Mexico are both important trading partners for car manufacturing. David Whiston, an equities strategist at Morningstar covering the automotive industry, says it’s not a question of who is impacted but who is the least impacted, and if investors’ fears are overstated in some stocks, there could be a buying opportunity.\n\nGentex Corp. (GNTX), which manufactures automatic dimming rearview mirrors and other electronic equipment for cars, dropped 2.9%, but Whiston says it is less reliant than many peers on other imports. “They don't have a ton of direct Canada and Mexico exposure, just some wire harness work out of Mexico,” says Whiston, though he adds that it’s still at risk of overall demand for cars dropping if prices rise.\n\nOne of Trump’s tariff goals in addition to stemming drug trafficking is to pressure other American businesses to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and trade more with American peers, which will help smaller companies who already have most of their footprints close to home. Nicholas Galluccio, who manages the Teton Westwood Small-Cap Equity Fund, points out that companies comprising the Morningstar small-cap value index already generate 70% of their revenue domestically and are trading at a 20% discount to large caps, while historically they’ve fetched a premium. “The threat of tariffs should be a catalyst for multinationals to restore their supply chains back to domestic soil, a boon to smaller companies,” he says.\n\nFor investors more inclined to invest in passive index funds instead trying their hand at more risky stock-picking, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (VBR) could be an appropriate option for shelter from a potential trade war.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\nForbesThe Billion-Dollar Private Prison Companies Capitalizing On Trump’s Immigration CrackdownBy Thomas BrewsterForbesIt’s ‘Never Going To Happen,’ But A Distracted Musk Should Hand Over CEO Reins At TeslaBy Alan OhnsmanForbesTrumpiverse: Ranking Trump’s Inner CircleBy Joe WalshForbesWith NIH In Chaos, Scientists Fear Trump Will Hamstring Critical Medical ResearchBy Amy FeldmanForbesTrump’s Crypto Assets Are Nonsense.

The decision averts, at least for now, a potential trade war with two of America’s closest trading partners that could have driven up prices for U.S. consumers and stalled the countries’ economies. As part of the deal, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his country would be spending $1.3 billion on a plan to reinforce its border with new helicopters, technology and personnel, as well as additional resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. (Canada had announced its $1.3 billion border and immigration investment at the end of last year.) And earlier in the day, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that her country will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of its National Guard to address drug trafficking from Mexico into the U.S., particularly fentanyl. Trump’s 10% tariff on all Chinese imports is still set to go into effect Tuesday. USAID under fire: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has empowered Pete Marocco, a top official at the State Department, to run the U.S. Agency for International Development and review all the work done by the agency targeted for dismantling by Trump and Elon Musk, Vaughn Hillyard, Abigail Williams, Rebecca Shabad and Ryan Nobles report. Rubio warned that certain projects or programs may be suspended or eliminated, marking the Trump administration’s latest attack on the federal bureaucracy. USAID employees based out of Washington were ordered not to come into the office Monday and to work from home. Democratic lawmakers and legal experts have argued that dismantling USAID would violate a law adopted by Congress establishing the agency. Sen. Brian Schatz responded by saying he would place a hold on Trump’s State Department nominees. But Republicans have not expressed many qualms with Trump’s flurry of unilateral moves. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump’s efforts to cut federal spending and make other moves without congressional approval have been “appropriate.” Musk’s role: While Musk has been leading the effort to slash the federal government through the “Department of Government Efficiency,” his comments about potentially shutting down USAID sparked a new round of questions over what exactly the tech billionaire’s role is in the administration. A White House official attempted to offer some clarity: Musk is a “special government employee,” Katherine Doyle reports. It’s a designation that means Musk is working neither as a volunteer nor a full-time employee. Special government employees are asked to abide by conflict of interest requirements and ethics policies that are typically less onerous than federal employees. As a temporary position, it bypasses some of the disclosure obligations required of full-time roles. The big picture: As Jonathan Allen and Allan Smith write, Trump is waging war against his own government, creating a deep sense of fear in the federal workforce — and recipients of federal aid — as he tests the limits of his power to alter the scope, function and nature of government without Congress. Trump is signing executive orders at a historic rate By Joe Murphy If the pace at which President Trump is signing executive orders feels faster than normal, you’re not imagining things. In fact, Trump has issued more executive orders in the first 10 days of his term than any president did in their first 100 days since Dwight Eisenhower, according to an NBC News analysis of Federal Register data. Looking at recent presidents, you can see a pattern: Most signed fewer than 20 executive orders in their first 100 days in office, up until Trump was sworn in the first time. He signed 33 executive orders at the start of his tenure in 2017; President Joe Biden signed 42 in 2021. Through the first week-and-a-half of his second term, Trump was already up to 45, with more on the way. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Kennedy’s candidacy for Secretary of Health and Human Services, according to former Trump advisor and talk show host Roger Stone.\n\nPence is using pro-life ideology “as a smokescreen to protect Big Pharma and Big Ag,” and in fact, “founded Advancing American Freedom for the purposes of torpedoing RFK Jr’s nomination to the HHS,” Stone contends in an op-ed published on his website Monday.\n\nAs Stone highlights, AAF chief Tim Chapman and AAF Board Chairman Marc Short penned a letter to persuade Republican senators to shut down Kennedy’s nomination, claiming Kennedy is indifferent to protecting the unborn.\n\n“There are hundreds of decisions made every day at HHS that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it—decisions about federal funding for Planned Parenthood, regulations on the abortion pill (currently accounting for three out of every five abortions), insurance coverage of abortion, and more,” Chapman and Short wrote. “Whatever the merits of RFK Jr’s Make America Healthy Again initiative—indeed, whatever other qualities a nominee might possess—an HHS Secretary must have a firm commitment to protect unborn children, or else bend under the pressure and pushback surrounding these daily, critical decisions.”\n\nPro-life Inc. has also notoriously coordinated to “undermine President Trump through his presidential campaign,” Stone contends.\n\n“Just last year, Pro-Life Inc. undermined President Trump throughout his presidential campaign. Lobbyist Lila Rose had the audacity to call Trump/Vance a “pro-abortion ticket” during a crucial period in the 2024 election cycle,” the longtime GOP operative notes. “In backlash to her anti-Trump rhetoric, Rose was widely ridiculed as a grifter on X by patriots who noted that her non-profit organization Live Profit was spending millions on garish dinners and salaries while giving very little to actual pro-life advocacy. She would finally endorse Trump for president shortly before the election when it was clear he would defeat Harris.”\n\nOn day one of taking office, Trump pardoned pro-life activists who were imprisoned by Joe Biden’s weaponized Justice Department for protesting at abortion clinics.\n\nThe DOJ exploited the FACE Act, legislation enacted in the 1990s to increase penalties for individuals who obstructed access to abortion clinics, to bring charges against more than 30 people who partook in pro-life demonstrations. The lengthiest sentence of the pro-life defendants was handed to Lauren Handy, who was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison for protesting at an abortion clinic in Washington, DC.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: President Donald J. Trump grants pardons to peaceful pro-life protesters prosecuted by the Biden administration over exercising their First Amendment rights. pic.twitter.com/XwzU4dEJt8— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) January 23, 2025\n\n“If President Trump had listened to these voices, he may not have been in office to pardon 23 anti-abortion activists who were thrown in prison for exercising their conscience,” Stone argues. “The Republicans would be a permanent minority party, unable to legislate or change the laws of the nation, and that is perhaps the preferred outcome for Pro-Life Inc. Trump’s tangible victories, including the repeal of Roe v. Wade, have jeopardized the Pro-Life Inc. grift, which depends on their followers believing that reform is just out of grasp.”\n\nLast week, Pence posted a compilation of clips of Trump disparaging RFK Jr. on the campaign trail, when RFK was seeking the Democrat nomination.\n\n“President Trump was right the first time… Senators, Vote No on RFK.

Joe Neguse of Lafayette said in a statement, “and I believe we must utilize every legislative tool available to investigate, prevent and oppose these efforts.”\n\nBut U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican and longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, praised Musk’s work to hobble the United States Agency for International Development. Created by President John F. Kennedy and later reaffirmed as an agency and funded by Congress, it has now been placed under the authority of the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe agency, colloquially known as USAID, has been targeted by Musk and a small group of allies from Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump created via an executive order to cut government spending.\n\nUSAID, which accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget, provides aid overseas to fund education and fight starvation and disease. Staff members — as well as federal lawmakers — have been barred from entering the agency’s building, programs have been shut down and thousands more employees have been laid off.\n\nTrump has accused the agency of fraud, without providing any evidence. \n\n“President Trump campaigned on aggressively cutting wasteful government spending that doesn’t benefit Americans, and we’re seeing that play out now with President Trump directing Elon Musk and the DOGE initiative to investigate federal spending in a safe, legal manner that also respects the privacy of Americans,” Boebert, who represents the Eastern Plains and Douglas County, said in statement to The Denver Post.\n\n“I’ve worked for years to convince members of Congress to take a closer look at where our taxpayer dollars are going, as well as whether we truly need the gargantuan federal workforce we currently have,” she said, “so I’m glad we are finally seeing some progress when it comes to finding out how our money is being spent.”\n\nDemocrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have been less enthusiastic about Musk’s seemingly unchecked gutting of a federal agency.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jason Crow, who represents Aurora and several southern Denver suburbs in Congress, told reporters at a local event Monday that Trump didn’t have the authority to shutter USAID.\n\n“(Congress) created it, we mandated it,” he said. “We have funded it. So a president has the authority to change policies within congressionally created agencies, but the president does not have the authority to destroy or dismantle agencies that have been created by Congress. That would be a violation of the law and usurping congressional power. So that goes into the category of things that we’re going to be pushing very hard on when I go to Washington.”\n\nNeguse, who represents northern Colorado and is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, echoed Crow. In a statement, he said that Trump “does not have the authority to eliminate statutorily authorized agencies, impound funds lawfully appropriated by the Congress, or to give unfettered access to core government financial payment and personnel systems to his billionaire campaign donors.” He was referring to the access that Musk and his staff have gained to sensitive U.S. Treasury information.\n\nU.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, who represents Denver, told its City Council during a meeting Monday morning that Musk’s efforts regarding USAID and the U.S. Treasury Department — where the billionaire has reportedly gained access to Social Security and Medicare customer information — should “be blocked by legal action.”\n\n“I can’t sugarcoat how bad the situation really is,” DeGette told Denver councilmembers. Later, in a statement issued by her office, she said Trump was “letting Elon Musk run rampant.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who represents central Colorado’s 7th Congressional District, wrote on X that Musk was acting as “an unelected billionaire.\n\n“This is an unprecedented abuse of power by a dangerous, unelected and unhinged person,” she said in a follow-up statement sent by her office. “Nobody voted for Elon Musk, and neither he nor anyone he deputizes have any business anywhere near sensitive personal information about Americans or federal workers.”\n\nPettersen noted that the U.S. Constitution “gives spending authority to the people’s representatives in the U.S. House.” She added: “I’ll do everything I can in Congress to fight back against this illegal, unprecedented, and reckless abuse of power he has neither earned nor been authorized to have.”\n\nMusk’s team, whose involvement similarly has not received congressional approval, has sought to access secure areas and information within federal agencies, prompting a senior Treasury Department official to resign in recent days, according to the Washington Post.\n\nCrow said Musk and his staff’s efforts pose “very real national security concerns.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, wrote on X that the reported “meddling in important Treasury payment systems is incredibly dangerous and risks severe damage to our country and economy.” He said he would seek answers “alongside my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee.”\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a freshman Republican who represents the Western Slope and Pueblo, said Trump “is within his constitutional prerogative to ask an individual or individuals to assist in recommending policy and personnel changes to the government.”\n\nThe office’s statement added: “Congressman Hurd is looking forward to engaging with the President and his team to cut through the government’s red tape and unleash American innovation.”\n\nThe office of U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the offices of Republican freshmen U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton.\n\nStaff writers Elliott Wenzler and John Aguilar contributed to this story.\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"Colorado's congressional Democrats criticized Elon Musk's efforts to gut the U.S. government's foreign aid agency and access sensitive federal data in recent days.

That includes the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n\n“Via the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress has created a comprehensive statutory system allowing noncitizens fleeing persecution or torture to seek protection in the United States,” the lawsuit reads.\n\n“Under the Proclamation, the government is doing just what Congress by statute decreed that the United States must not do. It is returning asylum seekers — not just single adults, but families too — to countries where they face persecution or torture.”\n\nA day-one proclamation\n\nMonday’s complaint takes direct aim at one of the proclamations Trump signed on the first day of his second term.\n\nShortly after his inauguration on January 20, Trump unveiled a document entitled, “Guaranteeing the States Protection Against Invasion”.\n\nIn it, he declared that undocumented immigrants “are restricted from invoking provisions of the INA that would permit their continued presence in the United States”.\n\nThe Republican leader cited risks to “national security” as well as the possibility of “communicable disease” as his rationale. He also argued that the southern border of the US had been “overwhelmed” with entries.\n\n“I therefore direct that entry into the United States of such aliens be suspended until I issue a finding that the invasion at the southern border has ceased,” Trump wrote.\n\nThe Republican leader had long campaigned on a hardline approach to immigration, including the idea of sealing the border to asylum seekers.\n\nHis 2024 re-election bid was defined by the same firebrand rhetoric, including nativist assertions that the US was being overrun by a migrant “invasion”.\n\nTrump repeatedly blamed undocumented people for the country’s woes, from violent crime to unemployment.\n\nBut groups like the ACLU have sought to push back against Trump’s policies, using the court system to question their legal merits.\n\nIn Monday’s case, the lawsuit argues that Trump’s proclamation not only contradicts US law but also its obligations under international treaties.\n\nThe US, for example, ratified the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, a treaty that establishes protections for refugees.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Jennifer Babaie, the director of advocacy and legal services at the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in Texas, said the lawsuit shows that she and others “will not stand idly by as our immigration laws are manipulated”.\n\n“Regardless of any person’s individual beliefs on immigration, any government attempt to blatantly violate our laws is a serious issue impacting all communities across the country,” Babaie said.\n\nThe Texas-based group is one of four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with the Texas Civil Rights Project, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service (RAICES) and the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.\n\nWave of legal challenges\n\nBut the immigration actions Trump has taken in the first weeks of his second term extend beyond seeking asylum.\n\nEven in the first hours of his presidency, Trump signed several executive actions designed to limit immigration and expel undocumented people already in the US.\n\nTrump increased immigration enforcement activities, surged troops to the US border, suspended the US refugee programme for 90 days, and cancelled an online application used by asylum seekers to schedule US immigration appointments.\n\nSome asylum seekers had been waiting for months for the appointments they booked on the app, known as CBP One. The app’s removal nullified their scheduled meetings, leaving them in limbo.\n\nIn the aftermath, rights groups launched a legal challenge questioning the dissolution of CBP One.\n\nOther legal challenges seek to oppose Trump’s expansion of “expedited removal” processes, which would quickly expel undocumented individuals from the country.\n\nAnd others have sought to overturn a stop-work order that halted funding for legal services for immigrants being held in detention.\n\nMeanwhile, advocacy groups and various state governments have lodged at least five lawsuits against Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in the US.\n\nA federal judge in January quickly blocked Trump’s order, calling it “blatantly unconstitutional”.","summary":"The move is the latest challenge to Trump&#039;s hardline immigration policies, arguing that barring asylum violates US law.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/4/we-will-not-stand-idly-rights-groups-file-suit-against-trump-asylum-ban?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25021554592542-1738621144.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:03:15","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":286779906,"title":"EU leaders avoid controversial options as they discuss defence spending boost","text":"EU leaders on Monday didn't appear to have coalesced around key options to boost common spending in defence, calling for the European Commission to first explore ways they could increase their own national investments in the sector. Leaders urged the Commission to look into the flexibilities the Stability and Growth Pact could offer to allow for national boosts in defence spending, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after an informal retreat in Brussels. Under the Stability and Growth Pact, member states are obligated to implement a fiscal policy that aims to keep government deficit under 3% of GDP and debt under 60% of GDP. Failing to do so can result in an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) from the Commission and penalties including fines. Eight member states - Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia - are currently targeted by such a procedure. Several EU countries including Poland, Italy, Greece and the Baltics, have been asking for such a review of the Pact, citing the precedent made during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Commission suspended fiscal rules to enable governments to assist companies and citizens with their pandemic-induced bills. On the common financing side, the two other options leaders asked the Commission to explore in more detail in its White Paper on Defence to be released on March 19 are a change to the European Investment Bank's (EIB) lending rules and for private European banks.The EIB’s mandate was already updated in 2024 to allow it to pour money into more dual-use projects, and it boosted its investments in security and defence to €1 billion last year. It expects to double that in 2025. A change to the EIB's mandate, von der Leyen said, would \"make it easier for the private banking sector to follow suit\".European households' savings reach almost €1.4 trillion, well above the €800 billion in the United States, yet little of that money is invested in defence as the sector is not seen as sustainable under the bloc's taxonomy rules. European Council President Antonio Costa flagged during the same press conference that \"other ideas were mentioned today, including additional common options and more innovative ones\" as \"it is clear to everyone that we need to act faster than that\". But neither he, nor von der Leyen or Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, also present to answer journalists' questions, dared to name the elephant in the room: the issue of joint borrowing.Some frugal countries, such as the Netherlands, continue to vehemently oppose the proposal championed by France, Spain, Italy, Poland and the Baltics. But others, such as Denmark, have warmed up to this possible instrument, another COVID-era invention. But innovative solutions will be necessary to plug the massive financing gap in defence the EU faces. Little money (around €10 billion) was earmarked for the defence sector in the current eight-year budgetary cycle that runs to 2027 and negotiations for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) will start only in the summer. But the Commission estimates that the EU needs to invest €500 billion in the sector over the coming decade so that it can continue to support Ukraine but also ensure it is in a position to defend itself following decades of under-investments. Spending 2% of GDP on defence - the minimum target set by the NATO military alliance in 2014 - would inject an additional €60 billion annually into the sector but several European allies still have yet to reach that threshold. The alliance is meanwhile expected to \"significantly\" up that target at a summit of leaders in late June, its Secretary General, Mark Rutte, told journalists earlier on Monday as he joined EU leaders at their retreat. Another area leaders have tasked the Commission to explore in order to boost the European defence industrial base is a simplification of EU rules on procurement, von der Leyen said.\"Our coordination in defence must be strengthened, for instance, from joint procurement, ensuring interoperability. That brings down costs and gives us scaling opportunities and advantages,\" she said. Leaders also discussed the military capabilities the EU should spend cash on as a matter of priority with Costa saying the emphasis has to be placed on \"areas where there is a clear European Union added value.\"\"In the discussion today there was a clear focus on air and missile defence, for example, but also to mention just a few, missiles and ammunition, military mobility and strategic enablers,\" he said.But the issue of rolling out a so-called European preference for common spending was not addressed at the press conference, suggesting it remains a subject of division between capitals.France's Emmanuel Macron reiterated upon arrival that such a preference was necessary to boost strategic autonomy and plug dependencies but other leaders, such as Lithuania's Gitanas Nausėda argued that procuring \"military equipment from the United States would be a matter which creates a constructive, and not a destructive economic agenda\" with Washington following threats from Donald Trump of US tariffs on EU goods.Von der Leyen did however say that \"if we spend billions and billions of taxpayers’ money, we need return in increase know-how and good jobs in Europe\".Partnerships with like-minded partners on security and defence were also addressed by leaders, in particular with NATO, the US and the UK, whose Prime Minister Keir Starmer, attended the gathering over dinner. Brussels and London will continue the discussion at a summit in the UK on May 19, Costa announced.","summary":"The Commission estimates that the EU needs to invest €500 billion in the sector over the coming decade so that it can continue to support Ukraine but also ensure it is in a position to defend itself following decades of under-investments.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/04/eu-leaders-avoid-controversial-options-as-they-discuss-defence-spending-boost","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/02/74/78/1440x810_cmsv2_2a8d2e0d-faf4-54c3-a8b4-de9d2fc171af-9027478.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 00:01:21","author":"Alice Tidey","authors":["Alice Tidey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.093},{"id":286782560,"title":"Seeing Keir Starmer glad-handing EU chiefs has Remainers as giddy as toddlers on Christmas Eve","text":"Keir as mud\n\nSEEING Keir Starmer glad-handing EU chiefs has the diehard Remainers as giddy as toddlers on Christmas Eve.\n\nIt is hard to make sense of the gibber as they plead with him to destroy Brexit.\n\nThey claim it has wrecked Britain economically.

New York lawmakers in the state Senate and Assembly met last week to discuss a rules change that could keep Stefanik’s seat empty until at least June, according to the New York Post. Stefanik was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and is expected to easily pass a Senate confirmation vote. She and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz’s departure from Congress leave the House with a razor-thin GOP majority, leaving no room for Republican dissent to pass any legislation without Democrat support. The letter noted that Stefanik could be confirmed \"as early as this week,\" which would leave residents of New York’s 21st Congressional District without representation in the House until the seat is filled. The deep-red district is almost certainly going to stay in Republican control, as is the case with Waltz’s former Florida seat. While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acted quickly to set special elections for April, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has been silent. Under current state law, Hochul has 10 days after Stefanik’s resignation to call a special election within a further 70 to 80 days. But the rule change would reportedly consolidate the special elections date with the June primary race, allegedly in the name of saving resources and time. GOP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARING OVER DC PLANE CRASH \"Your claims that you’re doing this to be cost-effective or to promote equity are laughable and will do nothing more than leave every New Yorker in the 21st district with no representation in the House for additional months,\" the GOP lawmakers wrote. \"Your scheme to alter the schedule for the special election is a serious abuse of power that is more alike to election processes in authoritarian countries than anything we see in the United States.\" They argued that any delay would run afoul of the Constitution’s clauses on filling House vacancies as well as Supreme Court precedent. \"Any delay or postponement in calling a special election to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives is not just undemocratic, but it is unconstitutional as well,\" they wrote. \"It would be reminiscent of other failed efforts regarding New York’s elections in recent years, such as the unconstitutional attempts to gerrymander New York’s congressional districts.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The letter also cited a 2009 New York State Court of Appeals ruling that special elections to fill a vacancy should occur in the \"shortest space of time reasonably possible.\" \"The citizens of New York’s 21st Congressional District are constitutionally entitled to representation in the House and it is our hope that these reports have little basis in reality. If not, we strongly urge you to abandon this absurd, shameful scheme to deny representation for more than 750,000 New Yorkers and maintain current state election laws,\" the lawmakers wrote. Fox News Digital reached out to Hochul’s office as well as the offices of New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins.","summary":"New York Republicans are pressing the state&apos;s Democratic leaders on reports they are working to delay the election for Rep.

Christianity and nationalism are fundamentally at odds, making “Christian nationalism” a contradiction. Christianity is a faith that calls for love, humility and care for all people, regardless of nationality. It transcends borders and emphasizes unity, compassion and justice.\n\nNationalism, by contrast, prioritizes loyalty to a particular nation, often at the expense of others. It can foster division, exclusion and a sense of superiority. While patriotism — a love for one’s country — can be positive, nationalism distorts Christian values when it merges faith with political identity.\n\nWhen Christianity is tied to nationalism, it risks becoming a tool for power rather than a force for good. It undermines the core message of love and service, replacing it with exclusion and self-interest. Faith should unite, not divide, and no nation has a divine claim to superiority.\n\nDismantling of federal\ngovernment underway\n\nIn 2017 Steve Bannon, strategic political advisor to President Trump, said that their goal was “the destruction of the administrative state,” aka our federal government.\n\nWell, it’s happening.\n\nWe are in the middle of a coup of our federal government.\n\nFirst, Trump is appointing Cabinet directors that are unfamiliar with, or adversarial to, the mission of those agencies, crippling many of them.\n\nSecond, he is destroying the civil service, the system that ensures that all federal employees are loyal to the Constitution, not an individual.\n\nFinally, he has eliminated the inspectors general of these Cabinet agencies. Their job is to ensure that the agencies follow the law and are politically neutral.\n\nThe resulting chaos in these agencies will paralyze them, and all power will fall to Trump, who already controls Congress, the Supreme Court and many major “news” agencies.\n\nDon Eggleston\n\nTrump’s plan may be\nto hollow out economy\n\nRe: “Trump imposes steep tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China” (Page A4, Feb. 2).\n\nI do not understand the reasoning that President Trump is using to implement an additional 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% from China.\n\nBut, in an obvious handout to benefit his big oil buddies, the additional tariff on oil from Canada will be “only” 10%. Yippee.\n\nThe only reason I can come up with for creating havoc for the U.S. economy is that Trump wants to crash the economy and thus permit his billionaire buddies to have the ability to buy assets at rock-bottom prices at the bottom of the crashed economy. No other reason makes sense.\n\nAs for lowering grocery and gasoline prices, ordinary Americans, forget it.\n\nThe only consoling feature is that the crashed economy will negatively affect MAGA voters just as much as it will affect ordinary Americans.\n\nLarry Dorshkind\nRedwood City\n\nStifling free speech\nmakes nobody safer\n\nRe: “Trump executive order takes swing at campus antisemitism” (Page A3, Feb. 1).\n\nI am disappointed in the article you published from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \n\nAs an American Jew, I am well aware that the pro-Palestine protests were always well-attended and supported by other Jews like myself. The article only provides a single, anti-Palestine, Jewish voice that does not at all reflect the current reality in the Jewish community.\n\nMost Jews are more aligned with the viewpoints expressed in the article that show concern for curtailing students’ civil liberties and rights to free speech. Authoritarian crackdowns on those rights do not make anyone safe; history has proven that multiple times.\n\nDeborah Apple\nSan Francisco\n\nWhat will it take to\nwake up the public?\n\nIsn’t it a telling thing that every time Donald Trump brags about any perceived accomplishments, he has to also immediately denigrate previous administrations for not doing anything, though many of them did?\n\nThe American public elected a man who embellishes, exaggerates and out and out lies daily. It’s absolutely frightening to anticipate what kind of lie he’s going to have to tell to finally have the public wake up and wise up.\n\nLynda Martinez\n\nTrump’s policies are\nmaking America unsafe\n\nIf it wasn’t so frightening, it would be a great SNL skit. Donald Trump is condemning DEI hires because supposedly they are not competent to do their jobs while he is nominating ridiculously unqualified Cabinet members such as Pete Hegseth, Department of Defense, Kash Patel for head of the FBI, Tulsi Gabbard for director of National Intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services.\n\nHe is also purging organizations like the FBI. This is at a time when domestic terrorism threats are high and Trump has just unleashed 1,500 criminals on our streets.\n\nSharon Jackson","summary":"Also: Dismantling government &#124; Crashing economy &#124; Stifling speech &#124; Wake up &#124; America unsafe.

The fund, under the oversight of the Treasury and Commerce Departments, will manage national assets with the aim of stabilizing the economy and creating long-term value. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized the strategic importance of the fund, suggesting it will have a significant impact on the nation's future economic prosperity.\nThe new SWF will be managed by Bessent and Howard Lutnick, who has been nominated as the Commerce Secretary. The team will work on establishing the fund over the next 12 months, with the ambitious goal of monetizing the U.S.'s balance sheet. According to Bessent, the fund will consist of a combination of liquid assets and domestic investments to generate wealth for the American people.\nWhile the fund's primary purpose is economic stabilization, the prospect of using it to acquire significant assets has raised eyebrows. During the Oval Office signing, President Trump hinted that the U.S. might use the SWF to purchase the popular social media app, TikTok, which has been at the center of a geopolitical battle between the U.S. and China. Trump suggested that the fund could potentially facilitate such an acquisition, showcasing the fund’s strategic potential beyond mere economic management.\nBreaking: #Trump signs executive order creating first ever US Strategic Soverign Wealth Fund pic.twitter.com/dDUHIQNS8q\n— MartyParty (@martypartymusic) February 3, 2025\nWhat Is Sovereign Wealth Fund?\nA Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund, typically made up of assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, or other investments. SWFs are usually established from surplus revenues, often derived from resource exports or trade surpluses, with the aim of managing national savings or providing economic stability. Globally, over 90 sovereign wealth funds exist, managing assets worth over $8 trillion. Notably, Norway’s SWF is the largest in the world, managing over $1.7 trillion in assets, while China’s sovereign fund holds $1.3 trillion.\nThe creation of a U.S. SWF, however, comes at a time when the country is running a budget deficit. For the fund to be officially launched, approval from Congress is required. Despite this, the administration remains optimistic, with Bessent declaring that the goal is to launch the fund within the next year.\nThe establishment of the U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund is a bold step toward potentially reshaping America’s economic future, but its implications—especially with regard to international acquisitions like TikTok—remain to be seen. As the fund’s formation unfolds, all eyes will be on how it could impact both the U.S. economy and global markets.\nALSO READ: US Hospitals Stop Gender-Affirming Care For Transgender Youth After Trump Order","summary":"This new fund, overseen by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, could potentially be used to acquire major assets, including the popular social media platform, TikTok.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trumps-sovereign-wealth-fund-what-is-it-all-about/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/swf.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 23:59:05","author":"Sofia Babu Chacko","authors":["Sofia Babu Chacko"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.129},{"id":286779350,"title":"Rahul Gandhi Criticizes &#8216;Make in India&#8217; Amid Concerns Over China&#8217;s Border Aggression","text":"On Monday, during the Budget Session in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP, linked China's border aggression to the perceived failure of the Make in India initiative. He criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its inability to spur manufacturing and secure India's defense.\nGandhi argued that China's belligerence was a result of its larger and stronger industrial systems, emphasizing that wars are not just fought between armies but between industrial systems.\nConcerns Over National Security and Industrial Preparedness\n“The PM has denied, but the army keeps on talking to the Chinese and the Chief of Staff has said the Chinese are inside our territory,” Gandhi said. He expressed concern over India’s industrial system being unable to compete with China, which he claimed was already ten years ahead in sectors like electric motors, robotics, batteries, and optics.\n“If and when we fight a war with China, we will be fighting against Chinese batteries, optics, and robots. For the future of our children, we have to build a production line,” he added.\nWhile Gandhi acknowledged that the Prime Minister had tried with the Make in India initiative, he said, “Conceptually, it was a good idea, but it is pretty clear that he failed.” He warned that India risked losing out on the production revolution to China once again.\nForeign Policy Allegations and Heated Exchange\nGandhi further alleged that the government sent Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar to the US to secure an invitation for the Prime Minister to Donald Trump’s inauguration. This claim sparked a heated response from Jaishankar, who accused Gandhi of making false statements that could harm national interests.\nLok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanded proof for Gandhi’s statements, asking him to authenticate his claims.\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju challenged Gandhi’s statements, calling them fictitious and harmful to the nation. He urged Gandhi to approach such matters seriously.\n“How can you make fictitious allegations? Such things are not good for the country. You need to be serious,” Rijiju said.\nChina-India Border Relations Update\nGandhi’s comments came amid ongoing efforts to normalize bilateral relations between India and China. The two nations had been locked in a standoff since early 2020. Recent disengagement at friction points in Demchok and Depsang has revived mechanisms to address border disputes.\nIn January 2025, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi described the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as “stable but sensitive.” He emphasized the need for both sides to reach broader agreements to restore trust.\nThe Path Forward\nGandhi called for a strategic focus on expanding India’s manufacturing sector and involving young people in technological and energy revolutions. “We need to ensure India becomes a leader in production and innovation,” he concluded.\nAs India navigates complex geopolitical challenges, the government faces mounting pressure to strengthen its industrial and defense capabilities to counter external threats effectively.\nRead More : Jaya Bachchan Claims Mahakumbh Victims' Bodies Thrown Into River, VHP Demands Arrest","summary":"On Monday, during the Budget Session in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP, linked China&#8217;s border aggression to the perceived failure of the Make in India initiative.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/india/rahul-gandhi-criticizes-make-in-india-amid-concerns-over-chinas-border-aggression/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rahul-Gandhi-Parliament.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 23:59:05","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.278}]}
