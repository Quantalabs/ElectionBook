Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:29 BST, 25 October 2025 |Updated:01:49 BST, 25 October 2025 \n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham have upset their well-heeled neighbours with plans to build a new access road to their £12million Cotswolds home - so they no longer have to share with the crowds that flock to nearby trendy Soho Farmhouse.\nThe couple have applied for planning permission to turn an agricultural track into a tarmac-laid access route to their Maplewood Barn home - which would enable them to avoid the influencer-wannabe revellers who swarm in their hundreds to enjoy the famed members club.\nBut the move - the latest in a long line of unpopular planning applications at their residence - has not gone down well. At least one of their neighbours has claimed the bid must be stopped because it would affect ramblers who should be 'undisturbed by giant SUV's lumbering up and down'.\nCurrently the Beckham's mansion near Great Tew has a single lane cul-de-sac access, which also serves as the only way for visitors to drive to Soho Farmhouse; the nearby retreat is billed as a 'rural escape' for members who pay £250 a month to enjoy the pools, health cub and range of country pursuits on offer - including clay pigeon shooting.\nDuring the summer months in particular, minor celebrities and media-types come in their droves to relax and network - and their flashy cars are all filtered down the same - and currently only - road that serves the Beckhams' own private retreat.\nNow it seems they have finally had enough. \nThe couple have applied to West Oxfordshire District Council to change the use of part of the existing agricultural track to form a secondary residential access.\nThey want to extend the track to connect to their existing driveway and improve dropped kerb access and gates onto Ledwell Lane.\n\nView gallery\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham have angered neighbours over plans to build a new access road to their £12million Cotswolds home so they don't have to share with Soho Farmhouse revellers \n\nMalcolm in the Middle star sparks fan concern with first reunion snap\n\n3.4k viewing now\n\nThe 'hush-hush' REAL reason Claudia quit Strictly\n\n203.9k viewing now\n\nGogglebox star Sophie Sandiford is engaged!\n\n1.3k viewing now\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe couple have applied for planning permission to turn a new agricultural track into a tarmac-laid access for their Maplewood Barn home in an apparent bid for more privacy\nIn documents to support their application, the Beckhams say their existing access to Tracey Lane is problematic as it is a single use cul-de-sac with busy and 'unsafe' levels of traffic.\nBut the plans, which are under consideration by the council, have already been hit with local backlash.\nJoan Lane, who lives in Great Tew, said: 'I must strongly object to this proposal.\n'The house already has gone perfectly serviceable access road so why is another stretch of tarmac laid through the woods deemed a good idea.\n'Ramblers use the lane and they should be left undisturbed by giant SUVs lumbering up and down. Please do not allow this application.'\nIn planning documents, a representative of the Beckhams described it as a 'modest, sensitively designed conversion'.\nThey argued it would 'modestly upgrade the existing crossover and gates at Ledwell Lane for safe residential use'.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe Beckhams have applied to West Oxfordshire District Council to change part of the existing agricultural track to form a secondary residential access\n\nView gallery\n\nSoho Farmhouse, (pictured), is much loved by influencers who want to live a bit of a celebrity lifestyle on the weekend and no doubt would love to catch a glimpse of the Beckhams \n\nView gallery\n\nIn documents to support their application, the Beckhams say their existing access to Tracey Lane is problematic as it is a single use cul-de-sac with busy and 'unsafe' levels of traffic\n\nView gallery\n\nIn planning documents, a representative of the Beckhams described it as a 'modest, sensitively designed conversion' (proposed improvements are pictured)\n\nAn angry neighbour has said their bid should be thwarted as the proposal would affect ramblers who should be 'undisturbed by giant SUVs lumbering up and down'\nThe statement added: 'The works respond to operational, safety, and amenity needs, while being carefully designed to conserve the rural, heritage and landscape character of the area.'\nThe Beckhams' representative continued that that 'an agricultural, low-key character' would be retained, and any lighting, if later required, would be 'minimal'.\nDavid and Victoria have previously been accused of 'drip-feeding' development at their Cotswolds home.\nThey have submitted multiple applications for work at their Grade-II listed country house.\n\nView gallery\n\nCurrently the Beckhams' mansion near Great Tew has a single lane cul-de-sac access, which also serves as the only way for visitors to drive to the nearby Soho Farmhouse\n\nView gallery\n\nDavid and Victoria's private beach has attracted the attention of West Oxfordshire Council after it was spotted in scenes from their new Netflix documentary series (pictured)\nSince buying the three listed barns for £6,150,000 in 2016, the couple have added a new driveway and gates, an additional garage outbuilding, tennis court, treehouse, security hut, extension to the garage outbuilding and a landscaped pond.\nA decision will be made by West Oxfordshire District Council on the latest plans at a later date.\nIt's not the first time the Beckhams have ruffled feathers among their Cotswolds neighbours with work on their country home. \nTheir man-made lake and sand bank at the property has courted its fair share of controversy among locals after planning papers were initially submitted ahead of its construction in 2020. \nIt's understood that council officers have launched an investigation into the 1,000 square foot sand bank after receiving a complaint that it broke a planning agreement.\nA source said: 'Neighbours think it is totally out of character for the surrounding area and they are very twitchy around adhering to the rules.'\nBordering their enormous lake, the beach was visible between a wooden jetty and a safari tent as the couple sat tearfully discussing Victoria's ambitions and their future together. \nYet when the kidney-shaped lake was installed, the rules were extremely specific to ensure it would 'sit well in its rural context'.\nDetailed notes and diagrams at the time said the surrounding area should be landscaped like an 'organic parkland', with wildflower meadows and native trees, and scrub and other plants to provide a habitat for nesting birds, small animals and insects.\nThe council is now investigating concerns that the beach is not consistent with what was agreed. \n\nA source said: 'Neighbours think it is totally out of character for the surrounding area and they are very twitchy around adhering to the rules' \nWest Oxfordshire District Council confirmed: 'A report of a planning breach has been received and will now be investigated.'\nThe safari tent near the beach was made by a firm owned by the couple's director friend, Guy Ritchie, who was once ordered to remove similar tents himself from lake at Ashcombe House in Wiltshire, after they were spotted in a trailer for his Netflix series The Gentlemen.\nInitial plans to install their lake - a stretch of four-metre-deep water spanning 3000 square metres and surrounded by an array of wildflowers and trees - were initially blocked due to the potential impact on local protected wildlife, such as great crested newts.\n\n The private beach on David and Victoria Beckham's £12m estate that sparked row with neighbours \nAt the time, the lake was the latest in a long-line of accoutrements to be built at the Cotswolds estate after they were previously awarded permission to install a secret underground tunnel, wine cellar and 'super garage'. \nThe Heritage Impact Statement included in the submission stated that the proposed lake would be 'approached and encircled by a mown grass path which will wend its way through newly created gently sloping grass meadowland'.\nThe planning application also set out that surrounding trees would include the likes of 'Hazel, Oak, Honeysuckle, Bramble' and more.\nIn 2023, the couple won a controversial bid to turn a barn in the garden of their vast property into offices; they had asked for permission to create three separate office spaces in the building, featuring a bathroom, skylights and an external wooden staircase.\nDavid and Victoria's Cotswolds home featured heavily in the former England captain's four-part Netflix documentary where he said: 'I wanted a place where we could escape. \nAs soon as I get into the countryside, I normally get into my country get-up which I'm not in now. I've got a stick, I walk around, sit out here with a cup of coffee. My favourite view of the house. I can also see Victoria if she's naked in the top window.'\nVictoria Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavid and Victoria Beckham are at war with their neighbours AGAIN over plans for a new access road at their £12m Cotswolds pad so they don't have to share with Soho Farmhouse revellers\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nMalcolm in the Middle star sparks widespread fan concern as he poses for first reunion snap: 'Are you ok?'\n\nGogglebox star Sophie Sandiford is engaged!

Email fran.wolfisz@dailymail.co.uk \nBy FRANCINE WOLFISZ, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:01:26 BST, 25 October 2025 |Updated:01:28 BST, 25 October 2025 \n\nA pro-Palestinian supporter who repeatedly spat on a poster calling for the release of Israeli hostages while proclaiming 'F*** Israel' has been unmasked as an exotic dancer who once teased her social media fans: 'I will only kiss you if you want a free Palestine'.\nThe Daily Mail can now reveal the young woman captured in shocking footage taken in north London is a 27-year-old pole dancer and model who goes by the name 'Scarlett Ankha' on her socials.\nVideo of the disturbing incident shows the young brunette woman with blonde highlights hawking her saliva before attempting to scrape the sticker off an advertising display outside Hendon Central underground station.\nWhen she realised she was being filmed, the woman held up her middle finger towards the hostage poster featuring a yellow ribbon before telling her shocked bystanders: 'F*** Israel, f*** every dirty nasty Israeli piece of s***'.\nThe yellow ribbon is the symbol of the 'Bring Them Home' campaign for the hostages who were taken by Hamas terrorists and held captive in Gaza. \nA distinctive tattoo appearing on the woman's left hand in the video corresponds with a tattoo seen on Scarlett's left hand in a post on her Instagram account.\nMetropolitan Police confirmed it is investigating the incident, which occurred on Sunday around 11pm, as a hate crime.\nIn the full video, which has been viewed by Daily Mail, the woman turns several times on the Jewish bystanders filming the incident, one of whom has a South African accent.\n\nView gallery\n\nA pro-Palestinian supporter accused of 'pure visceral hatred' after she was filmed repeatedly spitting on a poster calling for the release of Israeli hostages has been revealed as an exotic dancer going by the name 'Scarlett Ankha' \n\nView gallery\n\nOn her social media accounts Scarlett alludes several times to her support for the Palestinian cause and refers to 'colonialists'\n\nShe says to the bystander: 'F*** every dirty coloniser, including every Israeli and all you f***ing, what are you, South African? You sound it.'\nThe pro-Palestinian supporter, who can be heard referring to herself as 'indigenous' continues to spit at the poster and make crude gestures, before telling those filming her: 'I love all Jewish people, my love [is] to real Jews, not dirty Israeli pieces of s**t.'\nOn her social media accounts, which are filled with videos of pole dancing and provocative images, Scarlett alludes several times to her support for the Palestinian cause and refers to 'colonialists'.\nIn one post from February 2024, a scantily-clad Scarlett with Palestinian flags superimposed over her face, tells her followers: 'People are being bombed in Rafah right now! Someone is dying every 30 seconds. Over 109 people have died in the past couple hours! Please don't ignore this! FREE PALESTINE.'\nA second post from around the same time shows an image of Scarlett pouting at the camera with the caption: 'I will only kiss you if you want a free Palestine'.\nScarlett has also posted a third image of herself posing for the camera with a low-cut top and the caption 'free Palestine you perv' across her chest.\nThe dancer's Instagram reel is littered with videos and memes pertaining to Israel's war on Hamas and Gaza.\nIn March 2024, Scarlett claimed to her followers that she had been 'assaulted, called dirty, had my hand smacked by a dirty coloniser' and kicked out of a shop for handing out Free Palestine leaflets.\n\nView gallery\n\nOn her social media accounts, Scarlett alludes several times to her support for the Palestinian cause and refers to 'colonialists'\n\nView gallery\n\nShocking footage from the video shows the young brunette woman hawking her saliva at the graphic on an advertising display outside Hendon Central underground station\n\nView gallery\n\nMet Police said it was investigating the incident outside Hendon Central station as a hate crime\nShe posted an image of herself sticking up her middle finger with the caption, 'p****** colonisers off is my favourite passtime (sic), what's yours?'\nScarlett revealed she is around 5ft tall in a 2022 interview for online content channel Twerkaholic TV, which ran a series chatting to UK pole dancers about their careers.\nAcross her social media, the diminutive dancer revealed she teaches 'sensuous' pole dancing in north west London and has an interest in the occult.\nThe disturbing incident, described by bystanders as 'pure visceral hatred', came just days after a ceasefire deal saw the release of the last 20 living hostages held by Hamas terrorists since October 7, 2023 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\nAs part of the deal, Hamas was supposed to release the bodies of 28 people but has only returned 15 of them to date, claiming they are unable to locate the remaining 13.\nAround 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the deadly attacks on Israel in 2023.\nSpeaking to Daily Mail, a witness who does not wish to be named, said the incident amounted to 'nothing more than hatred'.\nHe had spotted the woman scraping away at the sticker and believed initially she was trying to remove an anti-Semitic sticker - before realising what she was actually doing. \n\nView gallery\n\nAcross her social media, the diminutive dancer revealed she teaches 'sensuous' pole dancing in north west London and has an interest in the occult\nThe man said: 'In the climate we live in, as Jews in England, it was certainly not the first time something like this has happened and it's not the worst thing we've seen.\n'But it was a shock and very difficult in the moment to know what to do.\n'That's life as a Jew in London today. \n'We're lost for words. All the people in our community, regardless of where they are on the spectrum in terms of religious practice, we are all feeling the same.\n'It's pure visceral hatred, isn't it? I mean, there's no other reason for it. What other reason could there be? She certainly didn't have anything to say about the hostages - living or dead.'\nAdvocacy group Campaign Against Antisemitism said it was aware of the incident.\nA spokesperson said: 'This video is appalling. Unfortunately, it's also emblematic of deeply troubling trends among young people: almost half of British 18 to 24-year-olds are uncomfortable around supporters of Israel, 42 per cent believe Israel can 'get away with anything' because its supporters control the media, and 10 per cent have a favourable view of Hamas. \n'The authorities - from educational and cultural institutions to law enforcement need to wake up to this alarming rise in hatred and take meaningful steps to combat it.'\nMet Police said it was investigating the incident.\nA spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the video and the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.\n'Officers are carrying out enquiries and have arranged to meet with the victims.\n'There have been no arrests. Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to call 101 quoting CAD 7476/20Oct.'\n\nPalestineLondonHamasMet PoliceIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRevealed: Woman who spat on Israeli hostages poster is pole-dancing model who tells fans: 'I will only kiss you if you want a free Palestine'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nBeloved TikTok star's cause of death revealed after she moved to LA to seek fame aged 19\n\nWelcome to Hotel Hamas: 150 dangerous terrorists released by Israel under Gaza peace deal are staying at five-star luxury resort alongside unsuspecting Western ...\n\nThe 'hush-hush' REAL reason Claudia quit Strictly which BBC is trying to keep 'very quiet' KATIE HIND and ALISON BOSHOFF\n\nDonald Trump unveils shameless name for new ballroom amid outrage over East Wing demolition\n\nWill the King pay Andrew to leave Royal Lodge?

Huge thanks to the Hoover Institution for having us this week.\n\nCondoleezza Rice Breaks Down “Robust” Israel Ceasefire Deal, Future of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the Tad and Dianne Taube Director of the Hoover Institution and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy, joined The Guy Benson Show Monday to discuss a bevy of topics. The conversation started by discussing Hoover’s new Substack and reflect on the legacy of economist Thomas Sowell, emphasizing the enduring importance of freedom, limited government, and resistance to tyranny. Sec. Rice also spoke about the need to understand others’ beliefs before rushing to combat them, echoing themes from Justice Clarence Thomas’ recent speech that Rice and Benson attended on “victimhood culture” and the value of personal responsibility. Turning to current events, Rice weighed in on the Israel ceasefire deal, calling the hostage release and the Arab coalition’s cooperation “remarkable.” Rice and Benson also discussed how the Russia-Ukraine war has evolved, explaining why an end may finally be within sight and why convincing Putin the conflict must end is crucial. Rice also discussed China’s shifting posture in the context of the ongoing war and the growing realization that the U.S. under Trump is neither isolationist nor weak. Rice and Benson ended the conversation on a lighter note by discussing Rice’s thoughts on the “wild west” nature of NIL in college sports and her take on the Broncos’ massive 33-point fourth quarter last weekend.

Benson and Hanson also discussed how Donald Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy has reshaped America’s global relationships, delivering peace in the Middle East through a Teddy Roosevelt-like assertiveness. Hanson also reacted to the shocking revelation that a Louisiana man participated in the October 7th massacre, and weighed in on California’s decision to issue commercial driver’s licenses to non-English-speaking illegal immigrants that has now resulted in several deaths.

McFaul discussed how Trump can use his leverage to stop the purchase of Russian oil, use sanctions to push Russia to make a deal to end the war, and more.

Hirsi Ali explained the crucial difference between Muslims and Islamists, and reflected on the October 7th massacre and the strengthening of what she calls the “red-green alliance” to destroy the West. Hirsi Ali also discussed the alarming rise of antisemitism in the UK, where Jewish citizens increasingly face threats from violent Islamists. Ali and Benson wrapped the interview by addressing New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, arguing that the weaponization of the term “Islamophobia” has allowed his brand of radicalism to thrive.

Ferguson discussed the knighthood process, from nomination to the moment you are told you will be knighted, and reflected on the significance of the honor. Ferguson also weighed in on President Trump’s global record just a few months into his second term, saying you “cannot deny” the remarkable number of foreign and domestic policy achievements during the Trump administration, and explained why he’s come to view Trump as “the Disrupter-in-Chief.” Listen to the full interview below!\n\nListen to the full interview below:\n\n“REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS”: Lt. Gen. HR McMaster Weighs in on Trump’s Foreign Policy in His Second Term\n\nH.R. McMaster, the Fouad and Michelle Ajami Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, the Bernard and Susan Liautaud Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute, and a lecturer at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, joined The Guy Benson Show Wednesday to discuss President Trump’s continued disruption of international norms and why McMaster believes that disruption has led to historic results in his second term. McMaster highlighted Trump’s dominance on border security, U.S. energy independence, renewed pressure on Iran, and the successful return of hostages from Hamas captivity to their homes in Israel. McMaster also weighed in on the President’s decision to militarily strike cartel boats allegedly smuggling drugs, saying he supports the mission but believes there must be “more transparency” around the strategy. Finally, McMaster closed by discussing the ongoing war in Ukraine, and why now, he says, is the moment to call Putin’s bluff.

He explained why Tehran has effectively lost control over its proxy groups, including the Iraqi Shiites, and now faces “enormous” challenges at home. Milani also shared his surprise at how swiftly Hezbollah collapsed after Israel wiped out its leadership and praised Israel’s stunning success during its 12-day war with Iran. He noted that this was the very conflict Iran had been “asking for,” and yet, it ended in humiliating defeat — one that has fueled even greater hatred toward the regime among the Iranian people.

The proposition could single handedly create 5 new Democrat districts in the state in response to Texas’ redistricting efforts, but many districts will be effected by extreme “powerplay” gerrymandering to help Gov. Gavin Newsom on the national stage.

It seems to have incensed Trump, who late on Thursday denounced it as \"fake\" — abruptly cutting off trade talks and accusing Canada of interfering with an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision. \n\n“That ad worked. It was a good ad,\" said Alex Marland, a professor at Acadia University and the author of a book on political messaging. \n\nHe says the challenge for political advertising is to cut through the clutter, resonate with people and get their attention. \n\n\"In this particular case, the ad obviously was so successful that the president was upset.\"\n\nWhether Ontario achieved its goals \"is another thing,\" he said. \"But the bottom line is, the ad was getting attention.”\n\nMarland suggested Ontario run the ad for a couple more days in the hopes of getting media attention in the U.S. then “take their time” taking it down. \n\nPremier Doug Ford says Ontario will end the $75 million campaign on Monday, because it achieved its goal “having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.” By continuing over the weekend, the ad will be seen during the first two World Series games. \n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also criticized the ad, alleging it uses “selective audio and video” of the late Republican president. The foundation said it was reviewing its \"legal options.\" \n\nBut Marland says the rules regarding such material in political ads have changed.\n\n“I don’t have any concerns about it,\" he said. \"If it gets used for political purposes, the main thing that I would be concerned about is if it’s manipulated, if content is spliced and suggests something that was nonintentional.”\n\nJacob Neiheisal, associate professor of political science with the University at Buffalo, also doubts the foundation would have much success with legal action, in part because U.S. courts have historically adopted a hands-off approach when it comes to political speech.\n\n“Apart from defamation or slander or something like that, there’s really not much that can be done if something is simply misleading or even outright false,” he said.\n\nNeiheisal says Ontario’s ad is likely to get noticed in the U.S., but may not sway Republicans who support Trump and could trigger a backlash if it is perceived as outsiders telling Americans what to do.\n\n“A lot of voters recoil very negatively when somebody outside of a district or outside of the area that they live in, has thoughts about what they should be doing. That sentiment, I think, certainly does have the potential to promote some backlash.”\n\nElly Alboim, a strategic communications expert at Earnscliffe Strategies and an associate professor of journalism at Carleton University, says the effectiveness of the ad will be influenced by how many people see it. \n\n“I thought it was very clever. Whether people will understand it or whether it provides a call for action, I’m doubtful.” \n\nAlboim, who is also a former parliamentary bureau chief for CBC News, said Reagan’s speech is in the public domain and that the ad does what journalists do all the time, use clips from a speech rather than the whole speech.\n\nAlbion also questioned why the ad featuring decades-old video from a former president prompted Trump to cancel negotiations.\n\n“The real issue is what is it about this ad that set Trump off like a rocket?”","summary":"An Ontario government ad that attracted the wrath of U.S. President Donald Trump was successful — even if it didn’t produce the outcome provincial officials might have anticipated, say experts in political communication.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ontario-ad-tariffs-trump-9.6952829?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/e00e57ed-f966-4a61-982f-ab66aec1217b,1761349186161/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C87%2C1992%2C1120%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 23:47:39","author":"Elizabeth Thompson","authors":["Elizabeth Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":372331544,"title":"The night Trump's Ice Maiden erupted at his closest protectors... as knives glimmered at Joe's","text":"A month after Donald Trump was confronted by protestors at a DC restaurant, top White House staffers are still concerned over how the leftists were able to get so close to the president. \n\nThe president's 'surprise' September 9 trip to Joe's, a glamorous seafood and steak restaurant blocks from the White House, was supposed to show how safe the district had become following Trump's National Guard deployment to the city. \n\nInstead, after a group of screaming protestors got within feet of the leader of the free world, it highlighted how the commander-in-chief's personal security still has struggles securing the president. \n\nVideo of the incident shows leftist protestors from the group Code Pink screaming at the president as he sought to triumphantly celebrate a peaceful evening dinner in DC.\n\n'Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!' the activists yelled at the president's face. \n\nThe frenetic interaction later prompted a stern conversation between Trump's top officials and US Secret Service (USSS) officials, according to Axios. \n\nThese officials have warned that drop-in visits by the president are much less likely after the abrasive interaction with protestors.\n\nWhite House workers also remain suspicious about how Code Pink was able to ascertain Trump's scheduled trip before it was publicized.\n\nIn the moments after the protestors began screaming, Vice President JD Vance moved closer to the table where the activists were to prompt USSS into action, a source familiar with the matter told Axios. \n\nEventually, two White House advance staffers ushered the screaming protestors away. \n\nTrump can be seen in the videos just over an arm's-length away from the protestors, who stood on the other side of a dinner table that had cutlery and plates set out for the president and his party. \n\nThe incident reportedly infuriated Trump and 'Ice Maiden' White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. \n\nWhite House officials also raised alarm over how close the knives on the dining table were to the protestors, Axios reports. \n\nWiles later brought USSS leadership into her office and reprimanded them for allowing unvetted protestors so close to the president. A similar situation must not be allowed to happen again, she reportedly reiterated. \n\nThe USSS did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nTrump administration officials are still scratching their heads, trying to figure out how Code Pink activists were able to discover what had been a private dinner plan. \n\nSome suggested to Axios that the restaurant staff may have tipped off the anti-war activists. \n\nThey are also considering how it could be someone else with insider knowledge, perhaps even a Trump administration staffer.\n\nCode Pink officials have not been clear about how they heard about the unannounced visit. Instead, its representatives pointed to a local report highlighting how the group heard of rumors about the president's visit without sharing any additional details. \n\nJoe's did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment.","summary":"A month after Donald Trump was confronted by protestors at a D.C. restaurant, top White House staffers are still concerned over how the leftists were able to get so close to the president.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15225061/trump-code-pink-protest-joes-susie-wiles-fury.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/24/22/103299327-0-image-a-32_1761339817915.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/3808349592922965969/1024x576_MP4_3808349592922965969.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-24 23:44:27","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.118},{"id":372332132,"title":"Nicole Scherzinger breaks her silence on being branded a 'diva' and admits she is 'devastated and horrified' after keeping fans waiting an 'HOUR' at Royal Albert Hall show","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelcome to Hotel Hamas: 150 dangerous terrorists released by Israel under Gaza peace deal are staying at five-star luxury resort alongside unsuspecting Western tourists\n\nWoman, 49, fights for her life in hospital under police watch after girl, nine, died at house in Cotswolds village\n\n'A level of incompetence that beggars belief': Kemi rips into PM as manhunt continues after Epping asylum hotel sex attacker is freed by mistake\n\nInside Andrew's family summit: How Fergie wailed and 'melted down' at title loss, Beatrice and Eugenie were 'blindsided' and now daughters' assets face 'ethics check' to avoid more scandal: BARBARA DAVIES\n\nI got the body of my dreams at 51 by following 9 simple rules, says beauty guru ROSIE GREEN.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER and ALEX DOYLE - SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:38 BST, 25 October 2025 |Updated:00:42 BST, 25 October 2025 \n\nNicole Scherzinger has broken her silence on being branded a 'diva' after reportedly keeping fans waiting an hour at her Royal Albert Hall Show earlier this month. \nThe ex Pussycat Doll, 47, said she was 'devastated and horrified' by the incident but claimed to have been unaware the audience had been waiting so long in their seats. \nNicole was allegedly an hour late to the stage, despite no support acts and a 7:30pm billed start. When she did appear, she did not offer an explanation or apology to fans who had been sat waiting, some of which had forked out up to £150 for tickets.\nThe songstress reportedly sang just six songs before heading into the interval, with some fans leaving the venue early, ditching the second act.\nNow in a new interview Nicole said: 'It wasn’t until after I was done that I found out people had been sitting there for so long'.\n'I was devastated and I was horrified, 'cause I was like: \"Oh my gosh, I would be frustrated as well if I were told to sit there for so long\" I think they had to be in their seats for, like 7.15pm, or something, but I thought my show was due to start at 8pm'.\n\nNicole Scherzinger has broken her silence on being branded a 'diva' after reportedly keeping fans waiting an hour at her Royal Albert Hall Show earlier this month\n\nThe ex Pussycat Doll, 47, said she was 'devastated and horrified' by the incident but claimed to have been unaware the audience had been waiting so long in their seats (pictured on stage)\nShe told The Sun: 'I just want to thank people, thank everyone, because everybody stayed and, by the end, they were all up on their feet dancing with me'. \nWith the show being an intimate 'Evening With' format, artists often include longer speaking time into their set list compared to regular concerts, resulting in less tracks being performed.\nOne disgruntled fan told Daily Mail: 'She was more than an hour late coming on, didn’t apologise or explain the reason for being late, sang four songs then went to the interval. We didn’t stay for the second half as we were already waiting for too long.\n'There was more time without Nicole on the stage than with her there and when she was on stage she was busy bragging about her Tony and Olivier Awards.'\nOther fans flooded social media with their complaints, with one sharing a clip from the concert as they said: 'Nicole Scherzinger at the Royal Albert Hall was a disaster.'\nAnother said in a video: 'It was the worst concert I've ever been to, genuinely. And I've been to many concerts. \n'Which is sad because I was so excited.'\nThey captioned their somber clip: 'What a waste of time and money so disappointed at her.'\n\nNicole was allegedly an hour late to the stage, despite no support acts and a 7:30pm billed start. When she did appear, she did not offer an explanation or apology to fans\n\nNicole said: 'It wasn’t until after I was done that I found out people had been sitting there for so long' \n\nThe songstress reportedly sang just six songs before heading into the interval, with some fans leaving the venue early, ditching the second act \n\n The outrageous behaviour of Nicole, the Pussycat diva: Fans kept waiting for 50 minutes while she posed for £550 selfies, jealous spats on X Factor.... and demands she be filmed only on her left side! \nOne attendee swiped: 'Nicole Scherzinger was very disrespectful to her audience who paid £140 each to see her. She didn't even apologise for being an hour late starting.\n'We left at 10pm because she talked the majority of the time and sang about lot less than her audience deserved. Such a shame because she was amazing in Sunset Boulevard but it would appear she's rapidly turning into a diva. Disappointing!'\nDaily Mail has contacted a representative for Nicole and the Royal Albert Hall for comment.\nDespite her late arrival, other fans enjoyed the show, with one raving: 'Should have all stayed to the end. She was brilliant. So brilliant I forgive the lateness and we don’t even know if it was Nicola (sic) at fault.\n'It was being recorded so maybe that was the reason. The end was brilliant.'\nAnother wrote: 'Such a DIVA almost one hour late, no apology, we had to leave before the end but she is amazing.'\nIt comes after it was revealed she was faced with complaints of bad behaviour by crew working on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Sunset Boulevard.\n\nIt comes after it was revealed she was faced with complaints of bad behaviour by crew working on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Sunset Boulevard\n\nThe hit show, which closed in July of this year after a 10-month run, was based in New York and saw Nicole star as Norma Desmond.\nDaily Mail revealed how she had agreed to attend a session with a renowned make-up artist on the day of the Tony Awards, as well as a dinner co-hosted by one of the producers of the show at Casa Cipriani in New York.\nThe producer extended this invitation to the show’s other lead actors. However, the singer allegedly insisted on the exclusion of her co-stars.\nA few days before the ceremony, Scherzinger called off the dinner and the appointment with the make-up artist.\nShe then accepted paid endorsements from beauty brands Revlon and Clairol on the morning of the awards – unapproved by the producers of Sunset Blvd., which at the time was ‘bleeding money’.\nNicole used the Sunset Blvd. name and image to secure these endorsements but gave none of the profits back to the production, which she knew was struggling.\nSpokesmen for Nicole and Neptune Productions declined to comment when previously approached by the Daily Mail. \nNicole Scherzinger\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicole Scherzinger breaks her silence on being branded a 'diva' and admits she is 'devastated and horrified' after keeping fans waiting an 'HOUR' at Royal Albert Hall show\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

They will cut off the heads of British soldiers and kill left, right and centre.\n\n‘We must not let them collect together. There can be no hiding place for these people. Otherwise you are setting up a terrorist army in exile – it will be Hezbollah 2.0.’\n\nA former Israeli intelligence officer known as Guy C added: ‘There are no restrictions on their movements in these countries.\n\n‘They can walk freely, travel to Europe – even the UK – receive donations from naive supporters, and gain backing from protestors who already sympathise with them.\n\n‘The first thing these terrorists will do when they reach Turkey or Qatar is contact their associates in Gaza and the West Bank to send money and re-establish their networks. They will quickly regroup and form new terror cells.’\n\nThe release of 250 of the most dangerous terrorists serving life sentences was a key sticking point in the deal for Israel, which was strongly opposed to their release.\n\nBut it was ultimately deemed to be the only way to persuade Hamas to hand over the last 20 living Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire as one of the first stages of Mr Trump’s peace plan.\n\nAfter their release, there are now only 20 Palestinian extremists serving life sentences left in Israeli prisons.\n\nOf the most serious terrorists freed by Israel earlier this month, 154 were considered too dangerous to remain in the West Bank or Gaza.\n\nAs a result they are now being held in Egypt at the Mirage City Hotel, which has its own spa, fitness centre, restaurants, outdoor pool and even a hair salon.\n\nThose staying at the resort, where rooms start at £200 per night, include Mahmoud Issa, 57, who founded Special Unit 101 of the Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, a Hamas special forces unit in Hamas which specialises in kidnap.\n\nHis incarceration was a particular cause of complaint for Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar who was upset that Issa was not freed alongside him in 2011. Sinwar launched the October 7 atrocity in part to take enough hostages to force Israel to free the likes of Issa, who had been in jail since 1993. \n\nOthers staying at the luxury hotel include Isis member Izz a-Din al-Hamamrah, 47, who recruited suicide bombers and planned hijackings; bus bomb mastermind Samir Abu Nima, 64; ambusher Muhammad Zawahra, 52; kidnapper Ismail Hamdan, 57; and murderer Yousuf Dawud, 39.\n\nDavid Mencer, from the Prime Minister of Israel’s Office, said: ‘These men are terrorists, convicted of bombing buses, murdering students and kidnapping teenagers.\n\n‘Israel freed them not to reward evil but because we value human life above all.\n\n‘A bitter price, but one our people have paid across the ages to reclaim kin from the hands of Jew-haters.’\n\nIt is not known whether any of the hotel staff were aware of the infamy of the men staying with them.\n\nThe Marriott hotel group did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo stroll through the luxury poolside courtyard at Cairo’s Mirage City Hotel feels like a taste of paradise.\n\nEuropean tourists soak up autumn rays under the blissful North African sun, watching as children play in the crystal-clear waters. Beside them, the Sol Pool Bar beckons for afternoon beers, Egyptian wine and freshly prepared local mezze.\n\nLess than an hour from the pyramids, and just a short drive from the bustling city centre, this would appear to be the perfect spot from which families can safely explore the wonders of Egypt’s ancient capital.\n\nBut look a little closer and you will discover that all is not quite as it seems these days at Mirage City, part of the Marriott’s upmarket Renaissance chain.\n\nFor brushing shoulders with the usual guests at this opulent five-star resort are 154 convicted terrorists who last week poured out of Israeli jails, part of the extraordinary price the Jewish State was forced to pay for the release of its hostages in Gaza, held largely by Hamas.\n\nAmong those enjoying the facilities of the five-star complex, which has its own spa, fitness centre, restaurants, outdoor pool and even a hair salon, is kidnap specialist Mahmoud Issa, 57.\n\nOthers we found sampling the delights here include Isis member Izz a-Din al-Hamamrah, 47; bus bomb mastermind Samir Abu Nima, 64; ambusher Muhammad Zawahra, 52; kidnapper Ismail Hamdan, 57; and murderer Yousuf Dawud, 39.\n\nTogether they have killed dozens of people, yet remarkably the hotel – which describes itself as ‘perfect for family moments that matter’ – is still accepting bookings from the public.\n\nShould you stay here and walk around the idyllic grounds, as the Daily Mail did, you will find that hateful eyes follow every step you take.\n\nNone were more sinister than those of Issa, who sat menacingly sipping coffee on his poolside balcony, our movements never escaping his glare.\n\nWhen the Mail checked into the hotel, we found ourselves in a room just a few doors down from one of Israel’s most dangerous inmates, who founded Special Unit 101 of the Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, a Hamas special forces unit specialising in kidnap.\n\nAt breakfast unwitting tourists were seated near al-Hamamrah, who recruited suicide bombers and planned hijackings.\n\nJust behind him, enjoying the extravagant buffet of fresh fruit, local pastries, unlimited coffee and a personal chef to cook you eggs any way you wish was Jihad al-Roum, 47.\n\nHe was part of a group of terrorists who befriended a Jewish teenager, lured him to the West Bank, and then stabbed and shot him to death in a murder that shocked Israel in 2002.\n\nThese extremists were celebrated at the luxury hotel. One of them, Akram Abu Bakr – responsible for dozens of shootings and bombings – even hosting his wedding in the grounds of the resort last Saturday.\n\nHaving been deemed too much of a threat to Israel to return to Gaza or the West Bank, instead the terrorists received a hero’s welcome from pro-Palestine groups in Cairo.\n\nThey spent much of their time posing for selfies with adoring local fans, who apparently have no problem with their record of killing and kidnap.\n\nMany were seen withdrawing wads of cash from ATMs within the hotel as, after decades in prison, they are now rich. Thanks to the Palestinian Authority’s ‘Pay for Slay’ policy, under which people who commit terror attacks against Israelis receive up to £33,000 for every year they spend in jail, some have amassed six-figure fortunes, according to a report by Palestinian Media Watch.\n\nIt is not clear who has paid for their stay at the Mirage City Hotel. With rooms starting at £200 per night, the daily cost for all 154 of them will be upwards of £30,000.\n\nSome say only Turkey or Qatar would have the means and the motivation to foot such a bill – but neither provided a comment in response to our requests.\n\nNor did the Marriott come back to us when we asked them for comment.\n\nOn the terrorists’ arrival huge crowds of friends, family and fans cheered as they entered the lobby before descending the spiral staircase to a function room beneath booked for the occasion.\n\nTerrorist Mahmoud al-Arda, who killed an Israeli and masterminded the 2021 Gilboa Prison Break, was seen enjoying his first meal in a jubilant social media post that night.\n\nTucking into Middle East cheese, he said: ‘My first time with a spoon after four long years with local labneh from Arraba and thyme from the Arraba hills.’\n\nWhen the Daily Mail arrived, muscled Egyptian secret police with pistols glistening under their jackets were seen patrolling outside and we understand they must grant permission for the freed prisoners to get trips out of the grounds.\n\nBut among those allowed to leave the hotel was Basem Khandakji, 41, who helped organise the 2004 Carmel Market bomb attack that killed three and injured over 50.\n\nDespite personally driving a 16-year-old suicide bomber to the scene using his journalist ID to pass checkpoints, Khandakji is feted as a brave writer by pro-Palestine groups.\n\nLast year he won the International Prize for Arab Fiction for his novel, ‘A Mask, the Colour of the Sky’, and on a walk around Cairo he was invited to a book signing event at a local bookshop.\n\nPro-Palestine hangers-on were also seen clamouring for selfies at the hotel’s Sol Pool Bar with the notorious Jerusalem bus bomber Abu Nima.\n\nHe had languished in prison for nearly 40 years for the 1983 attacks, which killed six people including an 11-year-old child after he placed a charge near the rear of the vehicle.\n\nWhile the terrorists’ ceremony was held in an indoor function room, an unconnected Christian couple had a separate wedding outside and, in a surreal moment, Abba’s Dancing Queen drifted across the courtyard where many of the Islamists were posing for pictures.\n\nCome morning and they were reclining on sun loungers, fully clothed and glaring at western tourists lying in bikinis by the pool just metres away from them.\n\nWhile they have complained in interviews with friendly media outlets of being separated from their families in exile, the terrorists were seen passing their days with relatives who had flown to be with them.\n\nIssa spent his time pacing the pool with women and young children, as well as sipping coffee with them on his balcony.\n\nHe was handed three life sentences and an additional 49 years in 1993 for multiple terror attacks including suicide bombings and the kidnapping and murder of Nissim Toldeano.\n\nConsidered one of the most dangerous prisoners in Israel, he was held in solitary confinement for more than 12 years after attempting to escape in 1996.\n\nWhile Mossad – and the world’s other intelligence agencies – will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Issa, the sheer number of terrorists released is unparalleled.\n\nIt comes after scores of others were freed in previous ceasefires in November 2023 and January last year.\n\nWhat steps are being taken to stop these men plotting together?\n\nThroughout our time, all were constantly on the phone, or huddled together in hushed conversation trying to escape prying eyes.\n\nIn 2011 Israel felt that nearly 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one soldier was a price worth paying, but the true cost was only felt when Sinwar launched Hamas’s barbaric attack on October 7, 2023.\n\nThis time Israel has gambled that by releasing only 96 of the worst prisoners back to the West Bank and Gaza, and deporting these 154 to Egypt, they will be better protected.\n\nBut, as those hateful eyes at Mirage City are soon scattered across the world, you cannot help but question if the world will one day come to regret the price Israel was forced to pay for this peace.","summary":"Hamas terrorists released under the

caught!!!’ the US president said on social media on Friday after the Canadian province of Ontario produced an ad which showed Ronald Reagan arguing levies saying they could bring economic harm. \n\n“Ronald Reagan … LOVED TARIFFS,” Mr Trump bellowed. \n\nHowever, while the ad was edited – and Mr Reagan did indeed impose some tariffs – the ad is correct in saying the 1980s US president saw great economic harm coming from tariffs. \n\nMr Trump’s reaction is also notable as he apparently had seen the ad days before and, at that point, brushed it off.\n\nThe ad that offended Mr Trump so much was not produced by Canada’s national government in Ottawa. Rather, it was made by the office of Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario. On Friday, Mr Ford responded to the furore posting the full unedited speech to social media and saying the advert would continue to air.\n\n“Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies,” he wrote. \n\n“President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together.’\n\nIt’s not the first time Mr Trump has suspended trade negotiations with Canada in the last few months. It’s not clear how long lasting this “termination” will be. \n\nUS-Canada trade talks have stalled over the last few months. Prime Minister Mark Carney headed to Washington DC last month but while he had a cordial Oval Office chat with Mr Trump, he secured no relief from tariffs.\n\nCanadian goods headed to the US are tariffed at 35 per cent. But a pre-existing trade agreement means only around one third of products are actually levied. Canada has levelled some counter tariffs. \n\nOn Friday, on his way to a summit where he may cross paths with Mr Trump, Mr Carney said trade negotiations would continue “when the Americans are ready to have those discussions”.\n\nRaegen’s opposition to tariffs\n\nOntario, the province which included Toronto, released the advert on October 16 which has been seen in the ad break of major sports matches. It features a 1987 radio address where President Raegen talks of his opposition to tariffs.\n\n“When someone says, ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,’ it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs, and sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time,” Mr Reagan says.\n\n“But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\n\n“Then the worst happens, markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.\n\n“Throughout the world, there’s a growing realisation that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition”.\n\nInitially Mr Trump saw the ad and seemed perturbed but unfazed by it. \n\nHowever, on Thursday, US time, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, which preserves the late president’s legacy, criticised Ontario’s ad. It said it was “reviewing its legal options”. \n\n“The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks”.\n\nIt’s not clear what legal avenue the foundation was looking to pursue. Mr Reagan’s remarks were on the public record. \n\nCanada ‘cheated, got caught’\n\nDonald Trump then jumped on the foundation’s remarks late on Thursday, US time. \n\n“The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE”.\n\nHe claimed the country was trying to “interfere” in an upcoming review of the legality of Mr Trump’s tariffs by the US Supreme Court which could rule they should have been approved by Congress. \n\nThe White House has argued tariffs are vital for national security and so are therefore in purview of the president,\n\n“Based on their egregious behaviour, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated”.\n\nOn Friday morning, he double down on the advert.\n\n“CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!” he claimed. \n\n“They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.”\n\nHe said Canada had “long cheated on tariffs”.\n\nHowever, claims Ontario “cheated” and the ad was “fake” don’t appear to check out. \n\nMr Reagan’s address was edited – the ad is only one minute long and the radio address was longer. But his words are accurate, Mr Raegen was deeply troubled by the impact of tariffs. \n\nWhat was left out of the advert was that Mr Reagan also spoke about his tariffs on Japan after it was accused of dumping semiconductors on the US market. \n\n“We expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements,” he said in the same address referencing Japan. \n\nBut he added the tariff he imposed was a step he was “loathe to take” and that this was a “special case”. In a separate statement, Mr Reagan said tariffs would be eliminated “as soon as we have firm and continuing evidence that the dumping … has stopped”.\n\nMr Trump has no such qualms about the negative effects of tariffs and has not committed to removing them.\n\nOn Friday, a senior White House official declined to comment on the ad specifically but said there was “frustration” with Canada over trade negotiations. \n\nDirector of the National Economic Council Kevin Haslett said Canada had been “very difficult to negotiate with”.\n\nHe added Mr Trump “wants a great deal with Canada, just like he wants a great deal with Mexico”.\n\nCanadian PM Mark Carney spoke to reporters as he left Ottawa for the ASEAN Summit in South Korea which Mr Trump is also attending. \n\nHe didn’t demand Ontario remove the ad but focused on the challenges of a trade relationship with the US albeit describing them as “constructive”. \n\nMr Carney added that Canada “stands ready to pick up on that progress and build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions”.\n\nMr Trump also broke off trade negotiations with Canada in June when Canada proposed a digital tax that could affect US companies. Trade talks resumed after Canada axed the digital tax. However those talks have not progressed far in the meantime.","summary":"Donald Trump has said he has “terminated” all trade negotiations with a major ally after he became angry at an anti-tariff advert.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/cheated-got-caught-trumps-fury-at-ally-nation/news-story/e9599175a6e698e298aed9e3fe3f7f96?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/30538d01ce576911610292d4fff6dbee","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 23:39:34","author":"Benedict Brook","authors":["Benedict Brook"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":372332138,"title":"Victoria Beckham 'loses trademark war against Norwegian supermodel's beauty brand due to the Spice Girls' \"lack of fame\" in Scandinavia'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelcome to Hotel Hamas: 150 dangerous terrorists released by Israel under Gaza peace deal are staying at five-star luxury resort alongside unsuspecting Western tourists\n\nWoman, 49, fights for her life in hospital under police watch after girl, nine, died at house in Cotswolds village\n\n'A level of incompetence that beggars belief': Kemi rips into PM as manhunt continues after Epping asylum hotel sex attacker is freed by mistake\n\nInside Andrew's family summit: How Fergie wailed and 'melted down' at title loss, Beatrice and Eugenie were 'blindsided' and now daughters' assets face 'ethics check' to avoid more scandal: BARBARA DAVIES\n\nI got the body of my dreams at 51 by following 9 simple rules, says beauty guru ROSIE GREEN.

Speaking on The Tim Dillon Show, Sanders said, “So long as we have nation-states, you’ve got to have borders. If you don’t have any borders, then you don’t have a nation.” The Vermont independent added, “I don’t like Trump, you know, but we should have a secure border, and it ain’t that hard to do.” Sanders criticized both Biden and past administrations for failing to enforce immigration laws, saying the U.S. has “the technology and manpower” to secure the border but lacks the political will. The senator’s comments come as he promotes his new book Fight Oligarchy. During the interview, he said Biden’s border handling “was not good” and that the administration had failed to manage the surge in illegal crossings. US Customs and Border Protection reported 2.47 million migrant encounters in 2023, the highest on record, compared to about 458,000 in Trump’s final year in office. During his 2020 presidential campaign, he dismissed the idea of a border crisis and accused Trump of “demonizing immigrants.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Senator Bernie Sanders praised President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, saying Trump “did a better job” securing the border than Jo Biden.

This initiative aims to ensure that election proceedings are transparent, ballots are secure, and federal laws are adhered to, according to the department’s statement.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi emphasized the importance of transparency in maintaining public confidence in the electoral process, stating, “This Department of Justice is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” in a message to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile the Justice Department routinely engages in election monitoring, its focus on California and New Jersey is noteworthy given the high-stakes elections taking place on November 4. New Jersey is electing a new governor, attracting significant party investment, and California is conducting a special election aimed at revising its congressional boundaries in response to Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere, ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThis move by the DOJ aligns with the GOP’s ongoing emphasis on election integrity, a stance that gained momentum following former President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 election and his unsubstantiated claims of mail-in voting fraud. Democrats, on the other hand, are apprehensive that the current administration might resort to similar baseless fraud claims to sway the upcoming midterms.\n\nThe announcement followed letters from the Republican parties in both states seeking DOJ intervention, a decision that has drawn criticism from some prominent Democrats within those states.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the DOJ “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.”\n\nRusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that “No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.”\n\nCalifornia’s House districts at stake\n\nThe letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the AP, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.\n\n“In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,” wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.\n\nThe state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California’s congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.\n\nEach of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.\n\nCalifornia is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.\n\nOrange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county’s election operations and said it’s common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County’s elections as “accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.”\n\nLos Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.\n\n“Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,” he said.\n\nMost Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation’s most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks – and sometimes longer.\n\nIn 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.\n\nElection observers are nothing new\n\nLocal election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.\n\nLast year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.\n\nTrump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe DOJ’s effort will be overseen by Dhillon’s Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney’s offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said\n\nThe department also is soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.\n\nDavid Becker, a former DOJ attorney who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.\n\nBut Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors’ presence.\n\nIf the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn’t want them, “That could result in chaos,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Department of Justice is set to deploy federal election observers in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: DOJ to Deploy Election Monitors in California at GOP&#8217;s Request first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/doj-to-deploy-election-monitors-in-california-at-gops-request/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DOJ-prepares-to-send-election-monitors-to-California-following-requests.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 23:26:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":372331550,"title":"'Nazi texts' leakers UNMASKED: Alleged White House saboteurs are finally exposed... and so is their twisted motive for destroying political prodigy","text":"The Trump administration once again finds itself ensnared in internecine warfare —this time inside Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security (DHS), where bruised egos, personal rivalries and raw ambition are said to have led to a campaign of leaks that sunk a White House nomination.\n\nWhite House and DHS insiders tell the Daily Mail that Christopher Pratt, the department's under secretary for strategy, policy and plans, along with Taylor Bush, deputy to White House liaison Paul Ingrassia, helped orchestrate damaging leaks targeting their colleague.\n\nThree sources say the pair leaked both a sexual harassment tip and the so-called 'Nazi texts' that ultimately torpedoed Ingrassia's nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel, a key federal watchdog agency.\n\nIngrassia — the 30-year-old nominee hand-picked by President Donald Trump — had been set to face the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee this week.\n\nBut his confirmation collapsed after Politico published a series of text messages in which he mocked Martin Luther King Jr. Day as 'the seventh circle of hell' and described himself as having 'a Nazi streak.'\n\nThe release allegedly was no coincidence, sources insist — but rather the culmination of a months-long vendetta and a plan hatched within the walls of the DHS.\n\n'They never liked Paul. That's a fact,' one high-level DHS official told Daily Mail. \n\n'Pratt and Ingrassia didn't get along at all,' a source at the White House added, noting that the president's personnel office has long clashed with Pratt, and that Ingrassia was aligned with the faction opposed to him. \n\n'This is jealousy, pure and simple. They've been trying to move chess pieces and take him out for months,' the source added.\n\nBush, who is roughly a decade older than Ingrassia, resented working under the younger appointee, the Daily Mail has learned.\n\n'He's been knifing him for his job,' a second DHS source said. 'They've been looking to get rid of Ingrassia from the start.'\n\nThe irony is not lost on DHS insiders: Pratt, a longtime government official, had himself been tapped by the White House for a senior State Department position as the administration's liaison to the Pentagon.\n\nBut his own nomination was quietly withdrawn on September 29. \n\n'Chris Pratt is arrogant and pretentious. He always wants to get his way — hire his friends — and it's gotten the department into a lot of trouble. He gets his friends DHS contracts without going through the proper channels, the list goes on,' said the second DHS source.\n\nBefore joining public service, Pratt's career spanned advising special operations forces in Afghanistan to leading hostage-negotiation efforts. He spent nearly a decade in the private sector and served in a senior role at the Pentagon, managing interagency personnel recovery operations.\n\nOne individual involved in leaking Ingrassia's messages reportedly claimed the move stemmed from a desire for 'government to be staffed with experienced people who are taken seriously.'\n\nBut Ingrassia's attorney, Edward Paltzik, pushed back, arguing that the texts were misrepresented and stripped of context.\n\n'Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted,' Paltzik said. 'However, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters \"Nazis\".'\n\nPaltzik said the leaks were part of a broader attempt to politically and personally damage his client. \n\n'In this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages — which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context — is extremely difficult,' he said. 'What is certain, though, is that there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs. We do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.'\n\nThe controversy came on the heels of renewed scrutiny over an earlier sexual harassment probe involving Ingrassia during his DHS tenure — an investigation that ultimately cleared him of wrongdoing. \n\n'Mr. Ingrassia has never harassed any coworkers — female or otherwise, sexually or otherwise — in connection with any employment,' Paltzik said.\n\nIngrassia did not immediately respond to Daily Mail's requests for comment.\n\nBush denies the claims.

(executive order) 14059 for having engaged in, or attempted to engage in, activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a significant risk of materially contributing to, the international proliferation of illicit drugs or their means of production,\" the statement added.\n\nPetro confirmed on X that he and his family were placed on the OFAC list, adding that US Attorney Daniel Kovalik would represent him.\n\n\"Fighting drug trafficking effectively for decades brings me this measure from the government of the society that we help so much to stop cocaine consumption. It's quite a paradox, but not a step back and never on our knees,\" Petro said in a post.\n\nBenedetti denounced the US move on X as retaliation for defending Colombia's dignity and standing by Petro amid accusations by US President Donald Trump, who announced last Sunday that Washington would immediately cut aid to Colombia and unveil a new tariff rate.\n\nIn response to the US sanctions, the Colombian Foreign Ministry said that the accusation is \"an act of the utmost seriousness that goes against the dignity of the President\", slamming Washington for trying to illegally intervene in Colombian territory and thus violating the norms of international law and diplomacy.\n\nThe US military carried out two strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the eastern Pacific in the past week.\n\nUS media reported that the two strikes occurred near Colombia's Pacific coast.\n\nThe Pentagon has sunk 10 alleged drug boats since September, eight in international waters in the Caribbean.\n\nPetro has accused the United States of using its anti-drug policy as a pretext to justify the use of force in the Caribbean region to take control of oil reserves.\n\nIn September, his US visa was revoked after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration and urged US soldiers to disobey Trump's orders when attending the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Oct 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro amid deteriorating bilateral relations, accusing Petro of allowing drug cartels to \"flourish\", according to a statement from the US Department...\n\n\nThe post US sanctions Colombian President amid worsening bilateral relations appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/10/24/us-sanctions-colombian-president-amid-worsening-bilateral-relations/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/25/202510253552078.jpg?fit=1105%2C731&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1761352209","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 23:15:03","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":372332136,"title":"Alex Scott 'becomes latest star to sign up for I'm A Celeb with the \"game for anything\" sports presenter keen to take on gruelling Bushtucker Trials'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelcome to Hotel Hamas: 150 dangerous terrorists released by Israel under Gaza peace deal are staying at five-star luxury resort alongside unsuspecting Western tourists\n\nWoman, 49, fights for her life in hospital under police watch after girl, nine, died at house in Cotswolds village\n\n'A level of incompetence that beggars belief': Kemi rips into PM as manhunt continues after Epping asylum hotel sex attacker is freed by mistake\n\nInside Andrew's family summit: How Fergie wailed and 'melted down' at title loss, Beatrice and Eugenie were 'blindsided' and now daughters' assets face 'ethics check' to avoid more scandal: BARBARA DAVIES\n\nI got the body of my dreams at 51 by following 9 simple rules, says beauty guru ROSIE GREEN.

I read the editorial, and it’s hard to believe that the liberal Mercury News opposes a tax increase.\n\nI agree with the editorial. Our country is $38 trillion in debt. There will be more reductions in federal aid — and there should be. There will never be enough taxes to make up for what the Mercury News says will be a $223 million federal cut. The county politicians have done nothing to reduce expenditures, and they’ve been negligent in not telling us the truth. It’s obscene that County Executive James Williams would have asked for more in Measure A had there not been legal limits. It’s even worse that Measure A is a general tax, meaning the county can use the funds from this tax for almost anything they choose.\n\nMeasure A is an insult to our intelligence. Vote no.\n\nThomas Baker\n\nMaking homes fire\nresilient a priority\n\nRe: “One simple thing most of us fail to do to protect homes against wildfires” (Oct. 19).\n\nThank you for outlining steps homeowners can take to reduce wildfire risk. I agree with the recommendations presented, but it’s also critically important to make homes less flammable.\n\nFire-resistant roofs, noncombustible siding, double-paned windows and appropriately sized vents are crucial defenses against embers.\n\nA recent UC Berkeley study found that clearing flammable vegetation within a 5-foot perimeter around homes (Zone 0) can reduce structure losses by 17%. When combined with defensible space and structural hardening, this reduction can approach 50%. The study also emphasizes that collective action is crucial; individual household efforts have minimal impact, while communitywide participation yields the best results.\n\nIn fire-prone areas, all residents must focus on defensible space and structural resilience to ensure community safety. Since necessary home upgrades can be too expensive for some, we should urge local governments, state officials and insurance companies to both support these upgrades and make them more affordable.\n\nJennifer Normoyle\nHillsborough\n\nAWS outage exposes\ntech’s vulnerability\n\nRe: “Amazon cloud outage felt worldwide” (Page C7, Oct. 21).\n\nThis week’s AWS outage exposed a terrifying truth: America’s digital infrastructure is a house of cards. One server farm hiccups in Virginia and suddenly, hospitals, banks and public services across the nation go dark. That isn’t innovation — it’s negligence disguised as progress.\n\nFor years, Big Tech has stretched its systems to chase profit, stacking new services on aging foundations and calling it the “cloud.” Yet there are no federal standards, no audits and no agency charged with protecting the backbone of our digital life.\n\nWe regulate air travel, power grids and nuclear plants — but not the data centers running our defense networks and emergency systems. When the next collapse comes, it won’t be a cyberattack — it will be our own complacency.\n\nCongress must act now: Classify cloud providers as critical infrastructure, impose oversight and demand transparency. Until then, we’re one outage away from a national digital emergency. Except Congress is out to lunch.\n\nRaymond Grzan\nMorgan Hill\n\nDon’t count on GOP\nto save pricey ACA\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not affordable and never will be.\n\nWhile rising health care costs, insurer withdrawals, increased benefits, hospital mergers and inflation have contributed to higher premiums, the main issue is the structure of the plan. Like all health care plans, the more people who pay premiums, the less the cost. The ACA was based on younger, healthier people joining. Not enough did, and the plan was doomed from the start.\n\nIt is not fair for the taxpayers to pay the freight. It will take a Herculean effort to save it. Don’t count on the Republicans caving.\n\nFrank Nicoletti\n\nWe must resist Trump\nfor our children’s sake\n\nRe: “Judge blocks rash of layoffs” (Page A1, Oct. 20).\n\nOnce again, Donald Trump goes after the vulnerable. He is trying to dismantle the Department of Special Education during the shutdown.\n\nOf course, the children who benefit from SPED are not able to defend themselves, so this is another way that Trump can fulfill his MADA goal (Make America Dumb Again). I taught school before the 1975 special education laws were passed, and witnessed that many children were not served, did not learn to read and left school with no skills to be independent.\n\nWe cannot let this wannabe dictator take education away from our children. We must keep fighting for our children.\n\nNancy Redding","summary":"Also: Fire resilient &#124; AWS outage &#124; Touting socialism &#124; Pricey ACA &#124; Resist Trump.

Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams -- remarks he said centered on his Muslim faith with thinly veiled references to Sept. 11 and Islamic extremism.\n\nMamdani spoke about the struggles he said he and other New York Muslims have experienced dealing with discrimination.\n\n\"Growing up in the shadow of 9/11, I have known what it means to live with an undercurrent of suspicion in this city. I will always remember the disdain that I faced. The way that my name could immediately become 'Mohammed' and how I could return to my city only to be asked in a double-mirrored room in the airport if I had any plan of attacking it,\" he said.\n\nCuomo, 67, had taken a shot at the 34-year-old assemblyman during an interview that aired Thursday morning with conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg.\n\n\"God forbid, another 9/11 -- can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?\" Cuomo said.\n\n\"I could -- he'd be cheering,\" Rosenberg replied.\n\nCuomo responded, seemingly chuckling, \"Another problem.\"\n\nLater in the day, he told reporters he was referring to Hasan Piker, an influencer his campaign said supported Mamdani and had said in 2019 that \"America deserved 9/11.\" Piker later said his remarks were inappropriate and meant to be satire.\n\nMamdani appeared as a guest on Piker's show, and condemned Piker's 9/11 comments as \"reprehensible.\"\n\nAdams, who bowed out of the race this month after his federal indictment on bribery charges, also made controversial statements during his first news conference with Cuomo, whom Adams endorsed, on Thursday.\n\nAdams brought up \"Islamic extremists ... that are destroying communities in Germany, that have taken over logical thinking.\"\n\n\"New York can't be Europe, folks. I don't know what is wrong with people,\" he said.\n\nBoth Adams and Cuomo have argued Mamdani is antisemitic because of his comments opposing the Israeli government and calling its attacks against Palestine a \"genocide.\" Mamdani has also declined to support Israel’s existence as a Jewish state, although he has said he supports Israel’s right to exist as a state.\n\nMamdani has maintained he supports Jewish New Yorkers and vowed to protect them from discrimination.\n\nAt his news conference, he spoke about what he called a wider problem of racism in the campaign.\n\n\"The bigger question is whether we are willing to say goodbye to something much larger than either of these two,\" he said of Adams and Cuomo.\n\n\"It is whether we are willing to say goodbye to anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city that when we hear it, we know not whether the words were spoken by a Republican or a Democrat -- we know only that it was spoken the language and politics of the city. In the era of ever diminishing bipartisanship, it seems like Islamophobia has emerged as one of the areas of agreement,\" Mamdani said.\n\nThe assemblyman said he did not want to address his opponents' comments further but to \"use this moment to speak to the Muslims in New York City.\"\n\n\"The consequences amidst this inaction are stark. More than 1 million Muslims in this city, existing all while being made to feel as if we are guests in our own home. No more,\" he said.\n\nLater Friday, Cuomo responded to Mamdani with a news conference of his own featuring other Muslim leaders.\n\nThe former governor argued that Mamdani himself is the divisive one and has himself been targeting New Yorkers. \n\n\"Now look what he is doing is the oldest, dirtiest political trick in the book -- divide people,\" Cuomo said.\n\n\"It won't work.

China still relies heavily on them to map out policy priorities and decide on funding. Party “plenum” meetings like the one held this week also are used to rally the party rank-and-file around Xi’s leadership.\n\nThursday’s announcement signaled no major policy shifts. Despite mounting trade tensions, China intends to remain a global manufacturing power while building stronger economic growth at home.\n\nChina gains confidence in the trade war\n\nThe communique does not refer directly to the trade war between Beijing and Washington, but warns of rising “uncertainties and unforeseen factors.”\n\nHan Wenxiu, a senior party official in financial and economic policy, told reporters Friday that China is well placed to handle such risks in an era when great-power competition is becoming more complex and “the international balance of power is undergoing profound adjustments.”\n\nHe predicted China’s strength and international status would grow in the next five years. “There is always opportunity in crisis and crisis can be turned into opportunity,” Han said.\n\nChi Lo, an Asia Pacific senior market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said an emphasis in the communique on substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance likely reflects confidence that China is less vulnerable to pressure from the trade war.\n\nThe party vowed to achieve “markedly stronger” international influence by 2035 and to safeguard the multilateral trading system, portraying Beijing as a defender of free trade, noted Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics.\n\nDomestic economic challenges remain\n\nA downturn in the property sector that began while China was still in the midst of disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic has sapped consumer confidence, reducing household wealth and leading to widespread layoffs.\n\nChina’s communique emphasized the strategic need to expand domestic demand. The government has already encouraged investment to modernize factories and paid subsidies to people who replace old appliances and vehicles with new ones.\n\n“The economies of major countries are all driven by domestic demand and the market is the most scarce resource in today’s world,” said Zheng Shanjie, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, Beijing’s main planning agency.\n\nBut manufacturing capacity exceeds demand in many industries. That has caused damaging price wars and led companies to boost exports, adding to trade tensions with the U.S., the European Union and others.\n\nEven with strong government support, the economy grew 4.8% in the last quarter, the slowest pace in a year. Factory activity shrank for the sixth consecutive month in September, as domestic demand remained sluggish.\n\nChina’s leaders have stuck to their goal of attaining the status of a “mid-level developed country” and doubling the size of the economy in 2020 by 2035.\n\nThat implies an average annual growth rate of about 4-5% in the next decade, said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.\n\nChina will remain a manufacturing juggernaut\n\nChina is the world’s biggest manufacturer, accounting for roughly 30% of global production and about a quarter of its overall economy. The new 5-year plan calls for keeping manufacturing at an “appropriate level” with advanced industries as the backbone.\n\nChina’s focus on the manufacturing sector “will remain a top priority, even in the face of overcapacity (and) price wars,” said Fahy of Capital Economics.\n\nOver the years, Chinese manufacturing has progressed from labor-intensive, low-cost production to higher-value products including electric vehicles, robots and batteries. In coming years, the emphasis will be on advanced manufacturing, said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nThat includes areas such as quantum technology, biomanufacturing, hydrogen and nuclear fusion energy, artificial intelligence and next-generation mobile communications, said Zheng, the planning agency chief.\n\n“These industries are ready to take off,” he said. “It means that in the next 10 years we will build another high-tech industry in China and this will inject continued impetus to our efforts to achieve Chinese modernization.”\n\nIt’s unclear if China’s commitment to catalyzing more consumer spending and domestic investment will make much of a dent in its exports.\n\nChinese companies like BYD and CATL have become global leaders in EV battery technology and production. China plays a pivotal role in global supply chains and has shown it can control access to rare earths, materials used in many products.\n\n“The Chinese government sees manufacturing as a core issue in security and geopolitical leverage over other countries,” added Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis.\n\nXi continues to centralize power\n\nThe four-day plenum was marked by relatively low attendance.\n\nOut of 205 full members in the elite Communist Party central committee, only 168 were there, according to the communique. Many have been purged in anti-corruption campaigns that also enforce loyalty to Xi within the party.\n\nAn “unprecedented proportion of central committee members are in political trouble,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.\n\nThe meeting appointed Gen. Zhang Shengmin as China’s second highest ranking general. He replaced He Weidong, who was ousted from the party along with eight other senior officials in a recent anti-corruption drive.\n\nAs the party continues to centralize power, “the political position faced by Xi and his dominance within the party is still relatively secure” said Xin Sun, a senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King’s College London.","summary":"HONG KONG — China’s leaders are vowing to reduce its reliance on foreign advanced technology and spur stronger domestic demand as it weathers “high winds” amid elevated trade tensions with the U.S. An outline of the ruling Communist Party’s blueprint for the next five years was laid out in a 5,000-word communique released Thursday after [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post China’s next 5-year plan puts focus on tech and consumers as trade wars drag on economy first appeared on The Zimbabwe Mail.","url":"https://thezimbabwemail.com/news/world-world-3/chinas-next-5-year-plan-puts-focus-on-tech-and-consumers-as-trade-wars-drag-on-economy/","image":"https://thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TZM-67.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:54:12","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","source_country":"zw","sentiment":0.133},{"id":372337494,"title":"US senators call on Trump to show support for Jimmy Lai in meeting with Xi","text":"A bipartisan group of 38 US senators is urging President Donald Trump to use his expected summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea next week to secure the release of former Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, the latest in the US Congress’s efforts to get human rights on the agenda of the high-stakes meeting.\nIn a letter released on Friday, the lawmakers described Lai as a political prisoner and said the case for his release was “more dire than ever” due to his worsening health.\n“At 78 years old, he is in poor and deteriorating health. He is a diabetic and suffers from numerous physical ailments that are compounded by his continuing incarceration,” they wrote.\n“Mr Lai’s representatives have assured us that if he is released, he will leave Hong Kong and never return. He would have no desire to remain in public life. Should he die in prison, on the other hand, he would become a martyr; a powerful and enduring symbol of opposition.”\nThe letter sent to Trump, dated October 23, was led by two Republicans, Rick Scott of Florida, and James Risch, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nLai is currently awaiting a verdict after a marathon national security trial in Hong Kong that concluded earlier this year.\n\nThe businessman-turned-opposition activist, who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily tabloid, is the most prominent figure yet to be prosecuted under the Beijing-decreed national security law.\nUS and other Western politicians have repeatedly condemned his prosecution as an attack on press freedom and demanded his release.\nHong Kong authorities have dismissed such accusations as attempts to undermine the city’s rule of law.\nResponding to the letter on Friday, the Chinese embassy in Washington reiterated this.\n“Hong Kong upholds the rule of law.

Cryptocurrency companies have seen major benefits under the Trump administration through policies and executive orders. Trump’s family has amassed billions through cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nOther companies on the list, like Microsoft and Google, have received lucrative White House contracts for their AI and cloud tools, while firms like Palantir and Lockheed Martin have recently secured billions in new and expanded contracts with the government.\n\nIt’s unclear how much each donor contributed, though Paolo Tiramani, CEO of Las Vegas-based modular home manufacturer Boxabl, said this week that he donated $10 million in stock to the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, which is managing donations for the project.\n\nSokolov founded IJS Investments in 2006. The private equity firm focuses on investing in infrastructure, technology and finance companies. \n\nHe’s a major shareholder in one of Armenia’s largest mobile and telecommunication company, Viva. Sokolov also serves as chairman of the Northern Pillar Energy Consortium, an initiative to increase the supply of renewable energy between Africa and Europe, according to IJS Investments’s website.\n\nIJS Investments didn’t respond to requests for comment. \n\nIn April, Sokolov donated $100 million to the University of Chicago for its executive MBA program at the Booth School of Business. It was among the largest-ever donations to Booth, and the program was renamed to the Sokolov Executive MBA Program.\n\n“I am deeply honored by the school’s decision to give my name to its world-leading Executive MBA Program. Two decades after my graduation, the lessons I learned, the experiences I gained, and the friendships I forged at Booth remain the foundation of my career and my life,” Sokolov said in an April news release.\n\nHe previously donated $1.5 million to Booth, which helped fund improvements to the student lounge at Booth’s downtown campus, the Gleacher Center.\n\nSokolov received his executive MBA from Booth. He also has a master’s degree from St. Petersburg State University. He moved the U.S. in 1997, at 21, according to a University of Chicago news release. \n\nSokolovis married with two daughters and has homes in Miami, Switzerland and Malta, but he comes to Chicago about six times a year, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe White House ballroom would be approximately 90,000 square feet, with a seated capacity of 650 people. Designed by Washington, D.C.,-based McCrery Architects, construction is expected to finish before the end of Trump’s term in 2029, according to the White House. \n\nTrump estimated this week the project would cost $300 million and seat nearly 1,000 people, up from the administration’s initial estimate in July of $200 million with seating for 650. The project has drawn criticism among historic preservationists and raised questions about whether the administration has the legal authority to demolish the East Wing.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say how much money Trump has personally committed to the project at a Thursday press briefing, but said the administration would share a dollar figure at a later point.\n\nHere’s the list of individuals and companies helping to pay for the ballroom.\n\nAltria GroupAmazonAppleBooz Allen HamiltonCaterpillarCoinbaseComcast Corp.J.

However, the papers didn't get him past the immigration authorities in Russia. It has been reported that the Russians didn't fully appreciate who they had in their custody and, after he was briefly detained, they turned Zhang around and sent him back to Cuba.\n\nOn arriving back in Havana a second time, the Cuban security services were now aware of his real identity.\n\nSecurity analysts believe the authorities in Cuba held onto him for several months to interrogate him at length before sending him back to Mexico and, inevitably, onwards to the US. Mexico's Public Security Secretary, Omar Harfuch, was quick to thank Cuba for their cooperation over 'Brother Wang' – ultimately, for sparing their blushes over another escaped high-profile prisoner.\n\nAs always following the arrest of an alleged kingpin, the question becomes how far their removal will affect the global drug trade.\n\nGiven Brother Wang has spent the past year either in prison, under house arrest or on the run, the question may be moot, Mr Vigil said, as his absence has already largely been felt in Mexico's criminal underworld:\n\n\"It's really not going to have an impact as the cartels already have individuals working for them who can start to replace to Brother Wang\", says Mr Vigil. \"Even in the case of El Chapo Guzman who was a much bigger figure, it had no impact on the global drug trade\", he argues.\n\nOver his first year in office, US President Donald Trump has pressured his Mexican counterpart to do more on the issue of fentanyl trafficking and President Sheinbaum's administration has duly responded in kind. She has significantly increased seizures of the drug compared to her predecessor and her administration has sent dozens of convicted drug cartel members to the US to serve sentences there. They included several high-level drug names like Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted for the murder of a DEA agent in 1985.\n\nHer cooperation on the fentanyl issue, as well as on undocumented immigration, is considered the reason Mr Trump has refrained from imposing the same level of trade tariffs on Mexico as he has on other commercial partners.\n\nBrother Wang's extradition will bring genuine satisfaction in Washington at having taken a key figure in Mexican cartels' financial operations out of circulation. That, in turn, will please the Sheinbaum administration in Mexico and strengthen their claim to be in lockstep with their US counterparts on security.\n\nHowever, slowing or reducing the movement of pre-cursor chemicals for fentanyl from China to the Americas in any lasting way will take more than the extradition of one man.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0xd4dvzlyo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a7d1/live/a68fdf60-b11d-11f0-a417-33c18d854973.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:48:18","author":"Will Grant","authors":["Will Grant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":372323080,"title":"Comment on Trump’s Gamble by istanbul escort","text":"Qamar Bashir\n\nSince Donald Trump assumed office in January 2025, US policy toward China has been a study in contradictions. On some days, he hails China as a great country deserving normal relations with the USA. On others, he brandishes tariffs as weapons, imposing\n\ncrushing duties on Chinese imports. This oscillation between praise and punishment betrays a failure to grasp the transformation of China. It is no longer the vulnerable power of a decade ago but an ascendant nation, propelled by consistent leadership, unity of purpose, and a relentless focus on rising as a global force.\n\nChina’s achievements are undeniable. Over the past decades, it has eliminated mass poverty, built unparallelled infrastructure, and secured dominance over industries that define the modern age. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing to aerospace, electric vehicles, and cyber security, China sits at the commanding heights of technology. Central to this dominance is its control over rare earths— the essential inputs for semiconductors, batteries, aircraft, and advanced weaponry. While the USA was lulled into complacency, financing consumption with printed dollars, China quietly consolidated its grip on global mineral refining, leaving the USA exposed at the core of its supply chain.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. Confrontation risks undermining prosperity, fuelling unrest, and deepening global fractures. Cooperation offers the chance to channel competition into progress, ensuring that innovation, trade, and development serve people everywhere. In the end, the choice is stark: a spiral of tariffs and tensions that punish the many, or a diplomatic breakthrough that uplifts all. For the sake of Americans, Chinese, and citizens across the world, one hopes that reason prevails before it is too late\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trump’s decision to impose a sweeping 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods by November 2025 has alarmed economists worldwide. Their verdict is nearly unanimous: tariffs will not cripple China but will instead damage the US economy. The burden falls squarely on US consumers and industries, who must pay higher prices for imports and inputs. For companies such as Boeing, electric vehicle manufacturers, and defence contractors, which rely heavily on Chinese components, the effect will be immediate and severe. Instead of securing advantage, tariffs threaten to undercut sectors vital to US national security and global competitiveness.\n\nWhat makes this escalation more dangerous is China’s newfound willingness to retaliate. Traditionally cautious in the face of US provocations, Beijing now responds with confidence. Its counter-tariffs on US soybeans struck at the heart of US agriculture, redirecting purchases to Brazil, a BRICS partner eager to deepen trade ties. US farmers, once heavily dependent on Chinese markets, are left scrambling, while Brazil emerges as the winner. In this struggle, China adapts swiftly while the USA absorbs the blow.\n\nThe timing could not be worse. The US government shutdown, now stretching into weeks, has already eroded public confidence and economic stability. Inflation is climbing, job growth is stalling, and uncertainty hangs over financial markets. Trump’s long-term vision of rebuilding domestic refining and mining capacity may carry merit, but the reality is sobering: constructing such infrastructure will take five to ten years. Until then, the USA remains tied to China. With Beijing redirecting exports to other markets at competitive rates, Washington risks isolation and decline in sectors where it once excelled.\n\nThe domestic repercussions extend beyond economics. Trump’s reliance on executive orders to deploy National Guard units across US cities has stirred resentment. Governors, civil society groups, and ordinary citizens increasingly resist federal overreach. What began as isolated protests now carries the seeds of civil disobedience. If these tensions deepen, the USA could face a crisis of internal legitimacy alongside its external challenges.\n\nInternationally, relationships once grounded in cooperation have soured. Under Trump, ties with Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and Europe have deteriorated, shifting from cordiality to volatility. Diplomacy has been supplanted by threats, taunts, and public insults. The USA’s reputation as a partner of choice is waning, leaving it with fewer allies and diminishing influence. Soft power, once its greatest asset, has been eroded. What remains is the blunt projection of military might— a tool ill-suited for resolving economic and political disputes.\n\nAt the heart of the crisis lies the failure to pass a coherent federal budget. Without it, the machinery of government grinds to a halt. Public servants go unpaid, households lose income, consumer spending contracts, and economic growth falters. Inflation compounds the pain, creating a vicious cycle that ordinary Americans feel most acutely. Jobs vanish, prices rise, and confidence evaporates. The very people who form the backbone of the nation bear the brunt of political dysfunction.\n\nIt is this human cost that makes the current trajectory so alarming. Americans, resilient and innovative, do not deserve humiliation at home or antagonism abroad. They deserve leaders who strengthen alliances, foster diplomacy, and pursue prosperity through cooperation rather than confrontation. Instead, they are witnessing the erosion of goodwill with neighbors, partners, and global institutions, while being asked to shoulder the economic pain of tariffs and shutdowns.\n\nThe trade war with China is not an isolated clash. Its consequences ripple across the global economy. Supply chains are disrupted, investment flows redirected, and markets destabilized. For consumers worldwide, the fallout means higher prices and increased uncertainty. For businesses, it means recalibrating strategies and bearing new risks. A conflict between the world’s two largest economies cannot be contained—it reverberates in every corner of the globe.\n\nThe path forward demands wisdom, not bravado. Tariffs, coercion, and military posturing cannot secure a sustainable future. Only dialogue can. The USA and China, as the central pillars of the global economy, must find common ground. A balanced agreement that delivers tangible benefits to both peoples would not only stabilize relations but also reassure a world rattled by their rivalry. Cooperation would send a signal of stability, confidence, and hope— qualities the global economy sorely needs.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. Confrontation risks undermining prosperity, fuelling unrest, and deepening global fractures. Cooperation offers the chance to channel competition into progress, ensuring that innovation, trade, and development serve people everywhere. In the end, the choice is stark: a spiral of tariffs and tensions that punish the many, or a diplomatic breakthrough that uplifts all.

And California’s $321 billion budget establishes other limits for residents without permanent legal status.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2026, Medi-Cal will freeze new enrollment of undocumented Californian adults aged 19 and older. The 1.6 million undocumented residents currently enrolled in the program will not be ejected, but they cannot re-enroll if they lose coverage. After Jul. 1, 2027, they’ll be required to pay $30 a month to maintain full coverage.\n\nChildren under 18, and pregnant people, can continue to enroll in the program regardless of their immigration status.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2027, some Medi-Cal enrollees will need to prove they are eligible for the program every six month instead of once a year. Also, working-age able-bodied adults will need to show documentation that they worked at least 80 hours per month.\n\nCoverage renewal is a big focus for CalOptima, Hunn said. Medi-Cal recipients were not required to renew coverage during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the automatic renewal process resumed in 2023, the renewal rate for CalOptima members has steadily fallen as some struggled to produce the requisite paperwork, Hunn said.\n\nIn the last year or so, Hunn said, CalOptima’s automatic renewal rate has dropped from from 54% to 39%, adding: “Our concern is that it’ll continue to decline.”\n\nTo keep that from happening, CalOptima will be investing $2 million in a three-year program with the Orange County Social Services Agency, with SSA staff attending CalOptima-sponsored community events to enroll and renew residents in Medi-Cal, CalFresh and other public assistance programs. The Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the collaboration at its Oct. 28 meeting.\n\nAnother $5 million, Hunn said, will be doled out in grants awarded over the next 13 months to community organizations, health care providers and food banks that support residents with Medi-Cal enrollment and renewal. The grant funding can be renewed for an additional two years.\n\nHunn said losing health care coverage is a frightening prospect for many low-income residents.\n\n“We want to do a really good job at communicating to members to help them overcome confusion, understand what they’re entitled to receive in benefits and, equally important, what they’re going to do to maintain and get access to those benefits,” Hunn said.","summary":"Much of the funding will be used to implement a \"multifaceted outreach and education campaign\" to ensure the nearly 1 million Orange County residents served by the health plan are aware of the new federal rules to get health care.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/24/caloptima-launches-20-million-effort-to-help-members-keep-medi-cal-coverage/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OCR-L-UCINURSING-0606-03mr.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:44:45","author":"Claire Wang","authors":["Claire Wang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":372329308,"title":"Israel’s Version of ‘Saturday Night Live’ Flaunts Trump as a Conquering Roman Emperor | Video","text":"Israel’s version of “Saturday Night Live” portrayed President Donald Trump as a conquering Roman emperor in a new musical sketch.\n\nYair Rosenberg, a staff writer for “The Atlantic,” posted the new skit to X Friday and pointed out that even with the language barrier it was pretty clear what the new musical number was implying – Trump is calling the shots.\n\n“You don’t need to know Hebrew to get this gist of this sketch from Israel’s ‘SNL,’ about who’s really in charge in Israel today,” Rosenberg wrote.\n\nThe Israeli sketch comedy show, titled “Eretz Nehederet,” also shared the skit on social media and simply captioned it, “הללו את הקיסר דונלד” — which translates to “Praise Emperor Donald.”\n\nThe video begins with a Trump-lookalike being carried onto the screen with McDonalds-like golden arches with eagle wings behind him. Centurion-dressed background dancers then do a version of the president’s signature stilted dance moves, which have gone viral in the past. \n\nEventually, Emperor Donald sings.\n\n“Who brought all the hostages back,” he asks. “It took me less time than to cook a Big Mac. Then I said to 10,000 years of war, bye-bye!”\n\nLater on, a look-alike of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enters and Trump exclaims, “Not him again!”\n\nThe new skit comes weeks after Israel and Hamas reached a cease-fire agreement that saw all hostages released and Israel withdrawing troops from Gaza to an “agreed upon line.” \n\n“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.

About 30 wolves now roam mountainous regions of the state and its management plan envisions potentially 200 or more wolves in the long term.\n\nThe program has been unpopular in rural areas, where some wolves have attacked livestock. Now, following two winters of releases during President Joe Biden’s administration, wolf opponents appear to have found support from federal officials under President Donald Trump.\n\nColorado wolves must come from Northern Rockies states, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik told Colorado Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis in a recent letter posted by the Fence Post agricultural news publication.\n\nMost of those states — including the Yellowstone region states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, where wolves from Canada were reintroduced in the 1990s — have said they don’t want to be part of Colorado’s reintroduction.\n\nThat could leave Colorado in a bind this winter. The state plans to relocate 10 to 15 wolves under an agreement with the British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Luke Perkins said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe agreement was signed before the state got the Oct. 10 letter from Nesvik, according to Perkins.

The White House confirmed that Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. The meeting comes amid escalated tensions between the two countries on trade after Beijing announced Oct. 9 it would impose export controls on rare-earth magnets, which are used in a host of products ranging from electric cars to F-35 fighter jets. In response, Trump announced the U.S. would impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, which is slated to take effect Nov. 1. Even so, Trump sought to diffuse tensions and routinely has touted his relationship with Xi in recent weeks. Additionally, he has voiced confidence that both parties will walk away from the summit pleased and that a deal will be made. TRUMP THREATENS 'MASSIVE' CHINA TARIFFS, SEES 'NO REASON' TO MEET WITH XI \"I think we are going to come out very well and everyone’s going to be very happy,\" Trump said Thursday. The summit between Trump and Xi will be the first time they’ve met in person since Trump took office in January. The two previously met in person in June 2019 in Japan. Trump’s meeting with Xi will come on the tail end of a larger trip to the region. Trump is first headed to Malaysia to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim Sunday afternoon before participating in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) dinner in the evening. NORTH KOREA LAUNCHES BALLISTIC MISSILES DAYS BEFORE TRUMP'S VISIT TO THE PENINSULA While in Malaysia, he will also meet with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. Trump will then head to Tokyo Monday, and is slated to meet on Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who was just elected earlier in October. Takaichi is the first woman to serve as the prime minister of Japan. Trump will then close out his trip heading to South Korea, where he will meet with the South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and will deliver keynote remarks at the APEC CEO lunch. TRUMP ANNOUNCES MEETING WITH XI JINPING AT SOUTH KOREA APEC SUMMIT SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH Trump is then scheduled to return to Washington Thursday. Meanwhile, North Korea has upped its aggression in recent days, and fired off multiple short-range ballistic missiles Wednesday — the first one Pyongyang has launched since May. Meanwhile, North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un showed off a new intercontinental ballistic missile at a military parade in front of Chinese, Russian and other top officials Oct. 10. \"We are aware of the DPRK’s multiple ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely with the Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners,\" U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,\" INDOPACOM said. \"While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump&apos;s Asia summit tour includes meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other regional leaders as trade tensions with Beijing escalate.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-jet-off-asia-north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-china-trade-questions-loom","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/12/trump-xi-inauguration-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:37:36","author":"Diana Stancy","authors":["Diana Stancy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.613},{"id":372327926,"title":"US hits Colombia’s leader with drug sanctions, sparking sharp rebuke","text":"The US Treasury blacklisted Colombian President Gustavo Petro, banning him from travel to the US and freezing any US assets he holds.

Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you,\" Hegseth added.\nThe latest military action brings the death toll from the US strikes to at least 43, according to an AFP tally based on US figures, but Washington has yet to release evidence that its targets were smuggling narcotics.\nRegional tensions have flared as a result of the campaign, with Venezuela accusing the US of plotting to overthrow Maduro, who said earlier this week that his country has 5,000 Russian man-portable surface-to-air missiles to counter US forces.\n'Inflame South America'\nOn Thursday, at least one US B-1B bomber flew over the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela, flight tracking data showed, following a show of force by multiple US B-52 bombers that circled off the country's coast last week.\nColombia's Petro - who has accused Trump of murder over the strikes on the alleged drug boats - was sanctioned by the US Treasury on Friday along with his wife and son.\n\"President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.\"\nPetro was defiant, posting on social media: \"Not one step back and never on my knees.\"\nRegional powerhouse Brazil has also weighed in on US actions, with a senior foreign policy advisor telling AFP Thursday that the country views a military intervention in Venezuela as unacceptable and fears it could be damaging for the whole of South America.\n\"We cannot accept an outside intervention because it will trigger immense resentment,\" said Celso Amorim, aide to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. \"It could inflame South America and lead to radicalization of politics on the whole continent.\"\nTrump meanwhile said Thursday that he did not need a declaration of war from US lawmakers to attack Venezuela or other countries he accuses of involvement in the drug trade, warning that strikes on land are coming.\n\"The land is going to be next,\" Trump said, likening drug cartels to the brutal Islamic State jihadist group.","summary":"The American military buildup has sparked fears in Venezuela that Washington's ultimate goal is the overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/10/25/trump-sending-us-carrier-to-latin-america-as-war-fears-rise","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1069/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/9f700c6c-ap24227789138373.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:25:01","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.103},{"id":372327038,"title":"Kim Kardashian claims she will be a lawyer in 2 weeks… despite not knowing if she passed the bar","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Oct 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpping hotel sex attacker is 'at large in London', David Lammy says - as migrant offender was 'seen in the street' hours after being accidentally FREED from prison\n\nWoman, 49, fights for her life in hospital under police watch after girl, nine, died at house in Cotswolds village\n\nStarmer's leadership under fire after voters humiliate Labour in safe seat it held for 100 years\n\nInside Andrew's family summit: How Fergie wailed and 'melted down' at title loss, Beatrice and Eugenie were 'blindsided' and now daughters' assets face 'ethics check' to avoid more scandal: BARBARA DAVIES\n\nI got the body of my dreams at 51 by following 9 simple rules, says beauty guru ROSIE GREEN.

What I could control was absolutely knowing my lines, being on time and being super professional.\n'These women are the greatest at what they do, and I just watched and learned every day.'\nShe added, 'It was an honor, and I have just had the best time.

Russia has also been adept at finding loopholes in Western sanctions.\n\nMr Putin’s rigid stance has exasperated Western leaders.\n\n“He’s rejected the opportunity for talks once again, instead making ludicrous demands for Ukrainian land, which he could not and has not taken by force,” Starmer said at a news conference alongside Zelensky and several other European leaders.\n\n“Of course, that is a complete non-starter.”\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Mr Putin’s goals remain unchanged but he “is running out of money, troops and ideas.”\n\nDetails of the potential future “reassurance force” are scant, and the London meeting seeks to further develop the idea — even though any peace agreement appears at the moment to be only a distant possibility.\n\nThe force is likely to consist of air and naval support rather than Western troops deployed in Ukraine, according to officials. UK Defence Secretary John Healey says it would be “a force to help secure the skies, secure the seas, a force to help train Ukrainian forces to defend their nation”.\n\nThe war has shown no sign of subsiding, as a front-line war of attrition kills thousands of soldiers on both sides while drone and missile barrages cause damage in rear areas.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry claimed Friday that over the past week, its forces have captured 10 Ukrainian villages.\n\nThe Defence Ministry also said its forces downed 111 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, with debris causing damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said Russian artillery struck a residential block in the southeastern city of Kherson on Friday, killing two people and injuring 22 others, including a 16-year-old.\n\nRussian planes also dropped at least five powerful glide bombs on the northeastern city of Kharkiv - injuring six people and damaging homes, according to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov; and more on Ukraine’s southern Odesa region.","summary":"Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky is pressing Donald Trump to supply long-range missiles and extend sanctions to every Russian oil firm.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/world-politics/zelensky-urges-us-to-expand-russian-oil-sanctions-and-send-long-range-missiles-as-war-grinds-on-c-20463337","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20463337/43d844eae6cf9c60631f0ef7e6a8ca5075f9339f-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:22:15","author":"British Prime Minister,Staff Writers","authors":["British Prime Minister","Staff Writers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.317},{"id":372337842,"title":"Ontario premier says it will pause Ronald Reagan ad campaign criticising US tariffs next week","text":"Ottawa, Oct 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the advertisement campaign criticising US tariffs would pause on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\" between the two countries.\n\nThe advertisements were released last week by the government of Canada's Ontario province and were running in the US.\n\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump said he was ending trade talks with Canada in response.\n\n\"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,\" Ford said on Friday on X.\n\n\"We've achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels. I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"\n\nFord said he made the decision to end the ads after speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nThe ads featured featured audio from a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan where he lambasted tariffs as hurting \"every American worker and consumer\" and \"triggering fierce trade wars\".\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Foundation later claimed it \"misrepresents\" the speech, and that the Ontario government had not asked permission to use the clip.\n\nCarney told reporters earlier on Friday that Canada is prepared to resume trade talks with the US \"when the Americans are ready\".\n\nTrump criticised the ad late on Thursday night in a Truth Social post, calling it \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\".\n\nHe said trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".\n\nCanada is still the only G7 country that has not reached a trade deal with Trump since he began introducing sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US has imposed a 35 per cent levy on all Canadian goods -- though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement.\n\nIt has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50 per cent levy on metals and 25 per cent on automobiles.\n\nThose sector tariffs have especially hurt Ontario, where the bulk of Canada's auto manufacturing industry is based.\n\nIt is unclear if trade talks will indeed resume now that Ford has pulled the ad, and President Trump is yet to respond to the announcement it will stop running.\n\nThe White House on Friday signalled frustration with what it called \"Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers,\" and added that efforts to address these issues \"have not led to any constructive progress\".\n\nCarney has made some appeasements to keep talks going, including removing retaliatory tariffs and dropping Canada's digital services tax. But he has repeatedly said that he is searching for \"the best deal for Canada\".\n\nBoth Trump and Carney are heading to Asia on Friday for the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe Canadian Prime Minister told reporters that the focus of his trip would be \"developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia\".\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Ottawa, Oct 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the advertisement campaign criticising US tariffs would pause on Monday \"so that trade talks can resume\" between the two countries.

Smith for bizarre conspiracy theory on sports gambling arrests","text":"While the sports world continued to be rocked by arrests of athletes for alleged cheating, one popular sports commentator took some time out of the controversy to blame President Donald Trump.\n\nStephen A. Smith warned that the president was trying to get revenge on the players of the National Basketball Association and other sports figures over criticism they had leveled against him over many years.\n\n'This is just the tip of the iceberg. Everybody better brace themselves.'\n\n\"How many times, for one incident after another, have I said Trump is coming. He's coming. I'm gonna say it on national television again,\" Smith said.\n\nHe went on to claim that Trump was trying to disrupt the Super Bowl by ordering mass deportations during the performance of Bad Bunny at the halftime show.\n\n\"Big night for the NBA. [Victor] Wembanyama put on a show,\" Smith said of the recent NBA game. \"That has now been smeared because we're talking about this story. OK?\"\n\nHe went on to cite Trump's longtime relationship with sports leagues going back to his time as owner of a casino in Atlantic City.\n\n\"Don't be surprised if the WNBA is next on his list,\" he continued. \"Because when you've got all of these protests that have been going [on] out there and people that have been protesting against him and what have you, this man is coming. He's coming.\"\n\nSmith said he would have more to say about the issue on another platform.\n\n\"And I've been saying it for a long time, and to me this is the latest nugget of evidence,\" he added.\n\n\"Anybody that has seen his reactions from the sports leagues and the positions that people have taken, they are not surprised at what's going on today,\" Smith said. \n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg. Everybody better brace themselves,\" he continued.\n\nAmong the evidence Smith cited to support his claim was that other sports figures had been arrested before, but they did not see the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation holding media briefings on the matter.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel replied by berating Smith for the bizarre allegation and mocked the commentator during an interview on Fox News.\n\n\"I'm the FBI director.

The remarks came shortly after CZ received a presidential pardon, announced by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. The pardon, which addressed charges brought against Zhao by the Biden Administration amid its regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency sector, was framed as an exercise of President Trump’s constitutional authority. Binance had spent nearly a year pursuing the pardon, according to the Wall Street Journal. CZ, who served a four-month prison sentence in 2023 for pleading guilty to anti-money laundering (AML) violations, was released in September 2024. Following his release, he took to X (formerly Twitter) to comment on Trump’s own statement regarding the pardon. Trump had remarked, “Let me just tell you that he was somebody that, as I was told, I don’t know him, I don’t believe I’ve ever met him … he had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime.” In response, CZ acknowledged Trump’s claim of never having met him and mused, “It would be my honor someday. President Trump and Satoshi. Might be the same person.” The playful suggestion sparked a flurry of reactions across social media, blending speculation with humor in the crypto world. The pardon lifts restrictions that had prevented Zhao from running financial ventures, though it remains unclear how it affects his standing with US regulators or his ability to directly lead Binance. Zhao expressed his gratitude on social media, writing that he was “deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.” Binance called the decision “incredible news.” The pardon comes amid Trump’s ongoing efforts to cultivate a friendlier regulatory environment for digital assets. Since releasing his own coin shortly before his inauguration in January, Trump has loosened regulations, advocated for the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve, and pushed to make it easier for Americans to use retirement savings for digital asset investments. Before the pardon, Zhao’s companies had collaborated with Trump-linked firms on new digital currency projects, including Dominari Holdings, where Trump’s sons sit on the board of advisers. The Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, has also reportedly held talks with Binance representatives. Trump’s administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, who invested in WFLI, and has pardoned other figures in the crypto space, including the founders of BitMex and Ross Ulbricht of the Silk Road marketplace.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: The Canadian province of Ontario said on Friday it would pull an anti-tariff ad featuring former US president Ronald Reagan that prompted current leader Donald Trump to scrap trade talks.\nTrump announced on his Truth Social network on Thursday that he had \"terminated\" all negotiations with Canada over what he called the \"fake\" ad campaign that he said misrepresented fellow Republican Reagan.\nLess than 24 hours later, Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the ads after talking to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about the spiraling row with Washington.\n\"In speaking with Prime Minister Carney, Ontario will pause its US advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" Ford said in a post on X.\nFord added however that he had told his team to keep airing the ad during the first two games this weekend of baseball's World Series - in which a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, face the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Canadian ad used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.\nIt cited Reagan as saying that \"high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library's website.\nThe Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used \"selective audio and video\" and that it was reviewing its legal options.\nTrump did not immediately react to the Ontario premier's decision to pull the ad.\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told reporters that Trump had made his \"extreme displeasure\" known and was expected to respond later.\nA senior US official said that Trump would probably encounter Carney at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South Korea on Wednesday.\n\"They will likely see each other,\" the official told AFP.\n'Cheated and got caught'\nTrump had first vented his fury at the ad late on Thursday, saying it was designed to \"interfere with the decision of the US Supreme Court,\" which is due to rule on his sweeping global tariffs.\n\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!\" he said in a new post as he doubled down earlier Friday.\nCarney had earlier sought to calm the situation, saying that his country was ready to resume \"progress\" on trade talks \"when the Americans are ready\".\nCanada has \"to focus on what we can control, and realize what we cannot control,\" he added as he headed to Asia.\nThe latest twist in relations between the US and Canada came just over two weeks after Carney visited Trump at the White House to seek a relaxation of stiff US tariffs.\nAt that meeting, Trump described Carney as a \"world-class leader\" and said the Canadian would \"walk away very happy\" from their discussion.\nTrump's global sectoral tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.\nFor now, the US and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85% of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.\nBut in a speech on Wednesday, Carney said that the United States has raised \"its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression.\"\n\"Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,\" Carney added, saying the process \"will take some sacrifices and some time.\"\nWhite House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told reporters earlier that Canada had been \"very difficult to negotiate with\" and that \"frustration has built up over time\" for the president.","summary":"An anti-tariff ad featuring former US president Ronald Reagan prompted current leader Donald Trump to scrap trade talks with Canada.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/10/25/canadians-pull-tariff-ad-after-furious-trump-scraps-trade-talks","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/790b29ec-donald-trump-28062025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 22:15:02","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":372328870,"title":"US sends world’s largest warship towards Caribbean as it ramps up military presence","text":"The US is deploying the world’s largest warship towards the Caribbean, marking a major escalation in its military build-up in the region.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.\n\nThe US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean in recent weeks, sending other warships, a nuclear submarine as well as F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.\n\nIt has carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said “six male narco-terrorists” had been killed.\n\nThat operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation.\n\nThe strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. The Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign that seeks to destabilise the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nMaduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.\n\n“This is about regime change. They’re probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,” Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.\n\nHe argued the military build-up is intended to “strike fear” in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro’s inner circle so that they move against him.\n\nIn its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean.\n\nThe additional forces “will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs”, or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.\n\nThe carrier’s deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called “land action” in Venezuela.\n\n“We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” he said earlier this week.\n\nIt comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.\n\nThe aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nIts deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.\n\nThe carrier’s large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.\n\nIt is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.\n\nThe US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.\n\nThe strike announced on Friday was the tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMembers of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president’s authority to order them.\n\nOn 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier “without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel’s cargo posed a threat to the United States”.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.\n\nTrump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\n\n“We’re allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,” Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that “if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States”.\n\nThe six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.

Abigail Spanberger, her party’s nominee for Virginia governor, is fundraising with Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with just 11 days to go before Election Day.\n\nVirginia, one of two states electing a new governor on Nov. 4, serves as the Democrats’ first chance to flip a governor’s mansion during President Donald Trump’s second term. The joint fundraising effort is platformed by ActBlue, a key part of the Democratic Party’s digital fundraising efforts which has faced scrutiny from Republicans in Congress as well as Trump over fraud prevention and internal issues. (RELATED: ‘Notorious For Its Lax Standards’: Trump To Order Probe Into Dem Fundraising Juggernaut ActBlue)\n\n“This week, Trump endorsed Abigail Spanberger’s Republican opponent in the Virginia Governor’s race, and she’s being attacked with vicious ads online,” the website reads. “This is the only election where we might flip a Governor’s office from red to blue this year. We need to support Abigail in this critical moment.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s campaign is calling for donations that would be split evenly for both the candidates. The congresswoman is also actively promoting Spanberger in digital press releases where she highlights her past collaborations with Spanberger during their overlapping time in Congress. Both Spanberger and Ocasio-Cortez were first elected to the House in 2018.\n\n“Abigail is still demanding better — and now, she’s running for Governor of Virginia in the only election where we might flip a Governor’s office from red to blue this year,” Ocasio-Cortez’s email says.\n\nThe move to join forces with Ocasio-Cortez comes as Spanberger’s campaign funds triple that of her opponent, Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, whom Trump announced his support for her on Oct. 19. Campaign finance reports released in September show Spanberger has raised over $40 million while Earle-Sears has raked in nearly $17 million. Spanberger’s cash on hand also surpasses Earle-Sears’ by $4 million.\n\nRecent polling indicates the gubernatorial race is likely to be decided by a single-digit margin, as Spanberger was leading Earle-Sears 52%-43% in a Suffolk University poll released Thursday.\n\nSpanberger, previously possessed a larger lead over Earle-Sears, saw her margin shrink after her silence on Arlington Public Schools’ decision to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity. The Trump administration had found the district was in violation of civil rights law for alleged illegal discrimination against women.\n\nDemocrats took another hit in their effort to flip Virginia’s three statewide offices when three-year-old texts from Jay Jones, the party’s nominee for Attorney General, surfaced in which he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot. Jones also said if he had two bullets, he would use them both to shoot Gilbert in the head over Hitler and Pot.\n\nThe texts, as well as an alleged phone call from 2022 where Jones said he wished Gilbert’s wife “could watch her own child die in her arms so that [he] might reconsider his political views,” were first reported by the National Review.\n\nRepublican Virginia Gov.

Initially, the adoptions were stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but progress halted completely when China announced the closure of its international adoption program in 2024. \n\nDespite each family having been matched with a child in China waiting for a forever home and told their adoptions were cleared to move forward, the adoptions remain stalled following the shuttering of China’s program. \n\n“These are children who’ve already been matched with U.S. families—children who long for the safety and permanency of a loving family. Their rooms are ready, their siblings wait eagerly, and their parents pray daily for the moment they will finally be united. We believe that you can help make that moment a reality,” the letter to Trump reads. \n\nTrump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of next week in South Korea. The meeting is expected to focus on trade relations between the two nations, but the families are asking Trump to also “urge China to allow these adoptions to be finalized.” \n\n“This would be an act of compassion that transcends politics and strengthens the bonds between our two nations,” the families write. The letter has already been signed by more than 150 of the waiting families and is still garnering signatures. \n\n“You’ve led with moral clarity and American strength to bring home Israel’s hostages and raise the issue of Ukraine’s vulnerable children with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” the letter continued. “We are grateful for your strong leadership. Mr. President, we know you will be overjoyed when you see these children running into their parents’ arms—a joyful picture of love, family, and hope fulfilled.” \n\nThe president is aware of the issue of the pending adoptions of Chinese children, but senior U.S. officials say they are unsure whether the president plans to raise the issue with Xi during next week’s meeting. \n\nThe families have also written a similar letter to Xi, asking the Chinese leader to “help make possible a moment the world will never forget, children running into the arms of their parents at last. These reunions would be a testament to the shared values of love, family, and hope that transcend borders.” \n\nSigners of the letters to the two world leaders include families such as Lauren and Kevin Hawley, who were matched with a daughter, Eleanor, in January of 2020. \n\nEleanor, now 7, has a metabolic disorder, and there is a clinic near the Hawleys’ home outside Cincinnati, Ohio, that is well-equipped to provide her with medical care. \n\nUpon first seeing Eleanor’s picture, “we just both melted,” Lauren Hawley previously told The Daily Signal, adding, “it just felt like a deep knowing that she was ours.” \n\nThe Hawley family had 30-minute video calls with Eleanor every six months ahead of China closing its international adoption program and told her they were going to come get her in China and bring her home to America. \n\nThe Hawleys have not been given the opportunity to explain to Eleanor why they have not come to bring her home yet, and they have no way of knowing if the orphanage has told the child the situation or that the Hawley family is still working to bring her home. \n\nCallie and Brian Troyer are also waiting and have never met their now 10-year-old son, Sam, who is currently living in an orphanage in China. Sam was born with congenital cataracts and is blind. \n\nAfter waiting for five years, Callie Troyer says she has “reached the point where I’m not sure that anyone else other than President Trump is able to get our children home.” \n\nLifeline Children’s Services, a multifaceted child advocacy and adoption organization, represents about 60 of the waiting families and remains a vocal advocate of the effort to complete the 300 pending adoptions. \n\n“These children have forever families ready to welcome and love them—families who have completed the long and rigorous adoption journey and who have been waiting with hope and prayer for more than five years,” Herbie Newell, president and executive director of Lifeline Children’s Services, told The Daily Signal. \n\n“We are confident that President Trump and President Xi can put aside geopolitical differences and work together for the sake of these children,” Newell added. “Adoption is not a matter of politics, but of compassion, dignity, and the shared humanity that transcends borders.”","summary":"Hundreds of American families are asking President Donald Trump to help them bring their children home from China. &#160; “Your leadership could unite hundreds of...
